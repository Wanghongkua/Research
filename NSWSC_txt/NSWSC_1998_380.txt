Last Updated: 29 September 1998 `TWENTY-FIRST AUSTRALIA INC versus ANDREW SHADE (NO. 2)` `2428/98` `31 July 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT `HIS HONOUR: The question is who should pay the costs of these proceedings? Mr Russell for the defendant submits first that as his client emerged from the proceedings with what he eventually wanted that the plaintiff should pay his client's costs. It is only in very, very rare circumstances, if at all, that a plaintiff who has achieved success in proceedings is ordered to pay costs: Deen versus Different Drummer Pty Ltd [[1977] ACLD 526.] This is not such a special case.` ` Alternatively, Mr Russell submits that each party should pay their own costs. This proposition might have been something that could have been urged had the defendant before litigation taken the chance that was offered to him to give undertakings. He did not give those undertakings. His solicitor came with a fighting reply. The plaintiff called his bluff. The defendant gave evidence in the witness box which was not true and gave a very poor appearance for a person who is supposed to be a professional in the stockbroking business.` ` It is true that the defendant succeeded on some issues and it may be that he is relatively happy with the result of the case. It must also be noted that whilst he entered into a covenant with his eyes open and took the advantages of employment in this business, the law has read down his covenant for public policy reasons. So he has promised something, reneged on that and only escaped through the technicalities of the law.` ` In my view the plaintiff has succeeded in some respects. It is not a case where there are discrete issues and it is appropriate that the defendant pay fifty percent of the plaintiff's costs to date.` ` I make orders in accordance with the short minutes.` * * *
