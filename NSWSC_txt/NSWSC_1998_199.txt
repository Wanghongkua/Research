N300017/97 April 1998 
Master Malpass 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
MASTER: There are two Notices of Motion before the Court. The plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion on 13 March 1998. Primarily, it seeks an extension of time for the filing of a Jury Requisition. The first defendant filed a Notice of Motion on 26 March 1998. Primarily, it seeks an order that the proceedings be transferred to the District Court. It is common ground that, whatever happens, the proceedings should be heard in Newcastle. 
The first defendant has mentioned the matter on behalf of the second defendant. As I understand the position, the second defendant does not wish to be heard on either of the applications.

The plaintiff relies on a number of affidavits sworn by his solicitor (Mr
Hart). The first defendant relies on an affidavit sworn by Mr Preller (an employed solicitor having the conduct of the matter on behalf of the first defendant).

The proceedings have a long history. They were commenced in the District Court in 1991. In 1997, the plaintiff applied to have the proceedings removed into this Court. The relevant jurisdiction of the District Court was then $250,000.
The application was not opposed and an order was made on 14 April 1997.

The evidence is sparse. The Court has been told that the plaintiff is now 15 years of age. He suffered personal injury in 1989 when climbing a wall made of besser blocks. The wall collapsed. His injuries included a fracture of the right lower leg and grazing of the head and back. His action is for damages.

Particulars pursuant to the rules of the District Court were filed in July (see Exhibit 1). This may be the most recent particularisation of the claim. Largely, the affidavits annex copy medical reports. The material includes the results of an MRI and an EEG. There is some narrative of steps taken by the present solicitor of the plaintiff (inter alia, in relation to the reports).

Since the proceedings have been removed into this Court, there has been a substantial increase in the jurisdiction in the District Court. The relevant jurisdiction is now at the level of $750,000.

The medical material throws up an issue as to whether or not the plaintiff suffered some brain damage in the accident. Primarily, it is this matter which is relied on by the plaintiff in his endeavour to keep the proceedings in this
Court. It was submitted that, if he was successful on this issue, there was a real possibility of recovering an amount in excess of $750,000. There was some mention of special circumstances. However, this matter was but faintly argued.

In my view, this case does not have any particular features which provide other sufficient reason for the proceedings remaining in this Court. The prospects of this action being tried in this Court depend on whether or not the statutory provisions relating to the amount likely to be awarded have been satisfied. I shall return to that matter in due course.

At the outset, I made it known to the parties that I considered that it was appropriate for the question of the mode of trial to be determined by the
Court in which the proceedings were to be heard. Despite conceding the force of this view, I was urged by Counsel to determine the matter in this Court. It was mentioned that the parties have put themselves to the expense of a court hearing on that question and the costs of the exercise would be thrown away if it was not entertained. In the circumstances, I acceded to adopting that course.

The question of the trial by jury was but briefly argued. The Court was referred to certain of the provisions of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), 1970 [(sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s86.html), [87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s87.html), 88 and ) and the decision of Rath J in Percy versus General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd [(1975) 1 NSWLR 289] at 295. In Percy, the order sought was not made. The judge took the view that the case before him was "the very class of case which s. 89 of the Act contemplates should be tried without a jury" (p 295). It was a case that turned on its own particular circumstances.
 [Section 86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s86.html) is in the following terms:- (1) In proceedings on a common law claim, except proceedings to which either of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s87.html) or 88 applies, issues of fact shall, if any party files a requisition for trial with a jury and pays the fee prescribed by the regulations made under section 130, be tried with a jury.

The rules may prescribe the time which a requisition must be filed for the purposes of subsection one of this section.

Subsections (1) and (2) of section 89 are in the following terms:- (1) In any proceedings on a common law claim (except proceedings to which section 88 applies), the Court may order, despite [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s85.html), [86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s86.html) and [87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s87.html), that all or any issues of fact be tried without a jury.

In any proceedings to which section 88 applies, the Court may order, despite that section, that all or any issues of fact be tried without a jury where - any prolonged examination of documents or scientific or local investigation is required and cannot conveniently be made with a jury; or all parties consent to the order.

In this case, the Requisition for Trial With a Jury was not filed within the prescribed time. The prescribed time elapsed some years ago. Little is offered to explain away the delay in the making of this application. Some reliance was placed on the fact that there had been a change of solicitors. However, it appears that the present solicitor has been acting for the plaintiff for about three years (since about 20 March 1995). It is unclear as to when instructions were received to seek a trial with a jury. It seems that no steps were taken to implement those instructions until early 1997. The application did not come on for hearing until 6 April 1998.

This case falls into a category of cases that are regularly heard by a judicial officer without a jury. Indeed, under the statutory scheme, the normal rule in this Court is that proceedings shall be tried without a jury (see [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s85.html) and
Pambula District Hospital versus Herriman [(1988) 14 NSWLR 387] at 391).
Whilst [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s85.html) is expressed to be subject to [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s86.html), [87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s87.html) and 88, the plaintiff failed to exercise the entitlement provided by [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s86.html) He now needs the indulgence of the Court if he is to have a trial with a jury.

Little was put in support of this application. Largely, Counsel was left to submit that the application was made on instructions and that it was the practice of the plaintiff's present solicitor to request a jury in proceedings on a Common Law claim. It was not said that there would be injustice if the case was tried without a jury.

The plaintiff seeks an extension of time under the rules of Court (presumably [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p2) [rule 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s3.html) is relied on). The Court has a discretionary power to make the order sought. It is exercised in the light of the relevant circumstances of the case. Each case will turn on its own particular facts. The power is exercised so as to ensure that justice between the parties is best served. This is not a case where the
Court is being asked to dispense with a duly requisitioned jury (see
Pambula). The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the Court that the order sought should be made. In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that the onus has been discharged.

I now return to the question of whether or not these proceedings should be transferred to the District Court. There is evidence that suggests that the plaintiff may have, inter alia, an intellectual handicap, Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder and a personality change. There is conflicting evidence as to whether there is a connection between any such handicap and his accident injuries. There is also conflicting material as to whether the claims made on behalf of the plaintiff, that he has suffered from Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder and has had a personality change, can be substantiated. These are matters of conflict which should be left for resolution at a trial.

The first defendant places stress on a number of matters revealed by the evidence. There is evidence which suggests that there was no unconsciousness following the accident. It appears that the EEG did not show any epileptic or other abnormalities and that the MRI did not show any abnormalities of the brain itself. One of the plaintiff's own experts (Dr Wilkinson) had said that there seems to be a lack of objective evidence of any significant head injury.

The plaintiff relies on the material to be found in the reports provided by his experts. There are reports from, inter alia, a consulting psychiatrist, a neurologist and a clinical psychologist. They were obtained during 1995 and .

I shall now refer to some of the evidence provided by these experts. The plaintiff's consultant psychiatrist has described the intellectual handicap as being mild. The neurologist expressed the view that, on balance, he thought that there was some evidence that the plaintiff had suffered an organic head injury and that this may possibly reduce his job prospects. He further said that from the neurological point of view, the evidence of a significant head injury is only circumstantial and that he cannot say with absolute certainty that the plaintiff has suffered in a major way. He was only prepared to say that there is some evidence on balance that the plaintiff has suffered to some degree.

The claim that there are real prospects of recovering an amount in excess of $750,000 is significantly dependent on the plaintiff being successful in recovering a substantial component for economic loss. This assertion largely relies on the evidence from the experts. There is little else to give it support.

This application falls to be determined under the provisions introduced into the District Court Act, 1973 by the 1997 amendments. These amendments impose a departure from the approach previously taken in relation to applications of this nature. Subsection 5 of section 143 is in the following terms:- 
Without limiting any power of the Supreme Court under this section, the
Supreme Court may, at any time after the commencement and before the hearing of the action, consider any action for damages in respect of personal injury or death, in order to determine whether an order under this section transferring the proceedings ought to be made. Having considered the action, the Supreme Court is to make such an order unless: in the case of a motor accident claim, the Supreme Court is satisfied that the amount to be awarded to the plaintiff in the case, if successful, would be likely to exceed $1,000,000 and that the case involves complex legal issues or issues of general public importance, or in any other case, the Supreme Court is satisfied that the amount to be awarded to the plaintiff in the case, if successful, would be likely to exceed $750,000 or that there is other sufficient reason for trying the action in the
Supreme Court.

Under this provision, the Court, after considering the relevant action, is required to make an order unless either (a) or (b) thereof applies. The action has been brought before the Court for consideration. After having considered the action, it seems to me that the evidence falls short of meeting the requirements of (b). In forming that view, I have accepted, for present purposes, the evidence relied on by the plaintiff.

Whilst the evidence perhaps may be said to reveal a possibility that the plaintiff may be awarded an amount in excess of $750,000, I am not satisfied that, if he was successful, the amount to be awarded would be likely to exceed that sum. I am not satisfied that there is "other sufficient reason for trying the action in the Supreme Court". In the circumstances, it is mandatory for the Court to make an order.

I dismiss the plaintiff's application. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of that application. I order that the proceedings be transferred to the District
Court. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the first defendant's application.
The exhibit may be returned.
