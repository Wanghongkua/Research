JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: On 6 February 2013, after a contested hearing, I published my reserved reasons for judgment with the medium neutral citation Tanamerah Estates Pty Ltd versus Tibra Capital Pty Ltd <case> I shall, hereafter, identify the parties in the same way as in the reasons for judgment.
The reasons for judgment concerned a notice of motion filed by Tibra for an order for the removal of Mr Tydeman, identified as "the second Plaintiff" in the amended Statement of Claim, as a party to the proceedings, as well as orders sought by Mr Tydeman, in a notice of motion filed by 31 October 2012, for various forms of relief, including "[O]nly if [he] is denied from being a party to the proceedings ... then under [Section 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), the first Plaintiff [Tanamerah] asks the Court to make an order to dispense with the Rules and permit [him] to commence and carry on these proceedings as the agent and representative of the First Plaintiff and Alexander Superannuation Fund".
In relation to the notice of motion, Mr Tydeman made clear that he sought a dispensing order "in the circumstance of ... last resort".
The orders that I made were that: "(a) James Scott Tydeman be removed as a party/Plaintiff in the proceedings.

The Plaintiffs' notice of motion filed on 31 October 2012 is dismissed.

Unless by 20 February 2012, a notice of legal practitioner acting has been filed and served by a solicitor retained by Tanamerah Estates Pty Limited, the proceedings be stayed.

Tanamerah Estates Pty Limited and Mr Tydeman are to be jointly and severally liable to pay the Defendant's costs of the notices of motion."
On 18 February 2013, Tanamerah filed a notice of motion in which it sought: "1. In respect to the judgment handed down on 6 February 2013, pursuant to
UCPR r 36.15 and/or UCPR r 36.17: a. The Plaintiff seeks variations to the judgment due irregularities.
 b. The Plaintiff seeks to set aside order (a).
 c. The Plaintiff seeks to set aside order (c).
 d. The Plaintiff seeks to set aside order (d).
The Plaintiff seeks a stay on the proceedings with liberty to apply on 14 days notice. "
Bergin CJ in Eq heard the notice of motion on 8 March 2013. Her Honour gave written reasons for, in effect, dismissing the notice of motion, except as to one aspect, namely, the costs order that had been made by me. (It was submitted that "no opportunity had been given" to argue the issue of costs.)
Her Honour, by consent, granted leave to the Plaintiff to make application in writing to me to set aside, or vary, the costs order as recorded in paragraph [179(d)] of my reasons for judgment. Her Honour also noted that the parties agreed to proceed with the application on the papers and directions were made in regard to the filing of written submissions.
In accordance with the directions made by her Honour, I received detailed written submissions dated 22 March 2013 (18 pages in all) made by Tanamerah, signed by Mr Tydeman; an outline of submissions dated 5 April 2013, in response (9 pages), by Tibra, signed by counsel for the Defendant; and Tanamerah's written response dated 10 April 2013, in reply to the Defendant's submissions (14 pages).
Although the submissions were filed on behalf of Tanamerah, Tibra accepts, and I shall proceed upon the basis, that both Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman make the application to set aside, or vary, the costs order that I made. There is no dispute that the Court may set aside, or vary, the order, as if the order had not been entered.
I am only dealing, in these reasons, with what was referred to me by Bergin CJ in Eq and I propose to limit the consideration of the submissions made to the setting aside or variation of the costs order that I made. As her Honour stated in the ex tempore reasons for judgment, in relation to the other complaints made, those were matters for some form of appellate process. 
The Submissions of Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman
In Paragraphs 11 to 22 of the submissions of 22 March 2013, a number of facts, were set out which related to Tanamerah, the Alexander Superannuation Fund and Mr Tydeman, and at least some of which had been referred to in the reasons for judgment.
In Paragraphs 23 to 35 of the submissions of 22 March 2013, under the heading "The crux of the 'real' issue in the substantive dispute", allegations relating to the claims being made by Tanamerah against Tibra were set out. (I have ignored Paragraphs 33, 34 and 35 because they relate to an offer said to have been made by Tananamerah to settle the substantive dispute and are clearly irrelevant to the issue that I must consider.)
Included in this part of the submissions, the following appears: "On 19 June 2012, at the meeting of the directors, Tanamerah granted authorisation to Mr Tydeman to represent the company and to "commence" and "carry on" proceedings for Tanamerah in respect to, inter alia, Tibra's breach of the SA. It was Tanamerah's obligation, duty and responsibility to act in the best interest of Ms Tydeman (Member 1) as the company is the trustee of
ASF. Mr Tydeman, who stands only in the capacity as the "non-party" to represent Tanamerah, being no different than had a solicitor been retained and then appointed for Tanamerah, has no financial interest whatsoever in these proceedings.

At all material times Tibra was aware that at no time had Mr Tydeman ever been a "party" (as defined) in the dispute, he had always acted in the capacity of
Tanamerah's authorised "non-party" representative as contemplated by UCPR r7.2 and he never (at any time) had any cause of action in his own right to make any claim against Tibra or to seek relief for himself."
Then, in Paragraphs 36 to 46 of the submissions of 22 March 2013, there is set out what are said to be "the facts of the proceedings concerning this application to set aside the costs order (d)". In substance, what is submitted is that Mr Tydeman was no more than the representative of Tanamerah in executing and filing the original Statement of Claim and, thereafter, that he was not a party to the proceedings, but rather, standing "only as the plaintiff (as defined) by acting in that capacity to commence proceedings for Tanamerah".
The submissions referred to what had been noted at [23] of the reasons for judgment, namely: "There is no relief claimed by Mr Tydeman against Tibra in the amended
Statement of Claim. He admits that he does not have any individual cause of action available to him against Tibra. Nor does he claim to have "a joint personal entitlement" to the relief sought by Tanamerah. He accepts that he is not what is called a "proper Plaintiff" in the proceedings, but submits that he does not have to be in order to commence, or carry on, the proceedings on behalf of Tanamerah."
It was also submitted that: "By mere error, Mr Tydeman typed his name on the cover page of the document headed AMENDED STATEMENT OF CLAIM".

The reference to him being "the Second Plaintiff" was "a way of indicating he had commenced proceedings for Tanamerah and in conjunction with the relevant requirements of UCPR rule 7.2".

His name on the cover page "was in no way meant to convey the intention that he represented himself nor he had any causation claims or sought any relief from the defendant".

His name on the cover page "may be considered to be an irregularity (a trivial non-consequential, non-important error at best)" but not "to mean he was standing as being a party (as defined)".

The Defendant had "made the mistake of jumping to the conclusion that Mr
Tydeman had intended himself to be a party (as defined)" with the result that it "had embarked on the costly process of filing a notice of motion ... to have him removed as a party when in fact he had never purported himself (sic) to be a party in the first instance".

Tibra's intention was to have Mr Tydeman "removed as Tanamerah's representative and for Tanamerah to be forced to retain a solicitor".
Then, in Paragraphs 47 to 72 of the submissions are set out what is said to be the case law in support Tanamerah's position. Most of what is said in these paragraphs relate to orders being made against "a non-party". There is repeated reference in these, and in other paragraphs, to the definition of "Plaintiff" in [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s3.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/).
Reliance is placed on May versus Christodoulou <case>; [(2011) 80 NSWLR 462.]
In Paragraph 68 of the submissions, Mr Tydeman states that he recalls hearing, on 6 February 2013, when the reasons for judgment were delivered, that "both notices of motions were dismissed". It is unlikely that this was said by the Court, since the order that was made in Paragraph [179(b)] of the reasons, refers specifically only to "the Plaintiffs' notice of motion filed on 31 October 2012" being dismissed, and the order in Paragraph [179(a)] and that in Paragraph [179(c)] grants the relief sought by Tibra in its notice of motion.
In Paragraph 70 of the submissions, it is submitted that "the [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) application from the CPA ... was solely because the Court had directed him to do so and this direction was based on the defendant's encouragement to the Court and in various written communications, that such an application must be made" and that "its compliance with the direction made by the Court ought not result in it, or Mr Tydeman, suffering a costs order ...".
Finally, in Paragraphs 76 to 80 of the submissions, there is set out "further information in respect to Tanamerah" at least some of which is set out in the reasons for judgment.
It is not necessary to further detail the submissions that I have carefully read. 
Tibra's Submissions
Tibra succinctly submits: "(a) Tanamerah has not identified any basis for a departure from the ordinary rule that costs follow the event; 
Mr Tydeman also has not identified any basis for a departure from the ordinary rule that costs follow the event; 
The costs application should be dismissed with the costs of the costs application to be payable by both Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman jointly and severally and forthwith."
Tibra also submits that the costs submissions made by Mr Tydeman proceed under the misconception that he was a non-party at the time of the two notices of motion and that the costs order made was, at least in part, one made against a non-party.
On the costs of the costs application, Tibra accepts that Mr Tydeman is no longer a party to the proceedings. However, it relies upon [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/).

Tanamerah's Submissions in Reply
Once again, in these submissions, the following passage appears: "3 Tanamerah submits that before this application to set aside the costs order can proceed it is necessary to determine if the orders (a)-(c) made on 6
February 2013 accord with the orders sought by the defendant from 28 September
If orders (a)-(c) are found not accord, or should not be made, then order (d) must be set aside."
This submission, and some of the other submissions that I have also carefully read, repeat, in the guise of submissions in reply, many, if not all, of the previous submissions made and to which I have referred and seek to have me reconsider the other orders previously made. 
Determination
In Tobin versus Ezekiel (No 2) <case>, at [7], the Court wrote: "The circumstances in which the power to reopen a final judgment may be exercised have been addressed by the High Court in a number of cases including
Wentworth versus Woollahra Municipal Council  <case>; [149 CLR 672];
State Rail Authority of New South Wales versus Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd  <case>; [150 CLR 29](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=150%20CLR%2029 "View LawCiteRecord" ); Smith versus New South Wales Bar Association <case>; [176 CLR 256];
Autodesk Inc versus Dyason (No 2) <case>; [176
CLR 300]; Elliott v The Queen <case>; [234 CLR 38]; and
Aktas versus Westpac Banking Corporation (No 2) <case>; [241 CLR 570.]
That power is exercised with great caution because of the public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation. It may be exercised if it can be shown that by accident and without fault on the part of the applicant, he or she has not been heard: per Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ in Wentworth at 684.
However, the exercise of the power is not confined to circumstances where there has been a denial of a fair hearing. It may be used to rectify an apparent error arising from a miscarriage in the Court's judgment because it has proceeded on a misapprehension of the relevant facts or law: per Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc at 302; per French CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Aktas at [6]. However, the power is not to be exercised to enable the re-agitating of arguments already considered or because the party seeking the re-hearing has "failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put". The purpose of the jurisdiction "is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to reargue their cases": per
Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc at 303."
In determining whether I should set aside, or vary, the order for costs previously made, I remember that the central question is whether it is unjust to allow the order made to stand: Vacuum Oil Co Pty Ltd versus Stockdale <case>; [(1942) 42 SR NSW 239], at [16].
There are two preliminary matters with which I should deal.
First, Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman are wrong to submit that Tibra did not succeed on its notice of motion and that the notice of motion filed by Tibra had been dismissed. As will be obvious from a comparison of Paragraph 1 of the reasons for judgment and the orders made, the only aspect that did not warrant an order sought by Tibra being made, was in relation to the relief pursuant to [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) ("UCPR") [rule 13.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s13.4.html), that the proceedings by Mr Tydeman be dismissed. It was unnecessary to make such an order because there was no dispute about what I stated, and to what I referred, at Paragraph [23] of the reasons for judgment, which Paragraph I have set out earlier in these reasons.
On this topic, I also refer to what I said at Paragraph [88] of the reasons: "As stated, there is no dispute that Mr Tydeman has not identified any cause of action that he has against the Defendant and he does not suggest any cause of action. On this basis, the Defendant says that UCPR [rule .29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s6.29.html) enables the court to remove him as a plaintiff because he has been improperly, or unnecessarily, joined, and UCPR [rule .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s13.4.html) enables the court to dismiss the proceedings so far as they relate to him because no cause of action is disclosed."
I am satisfied that Tibra succeeded in obtaining the relief that it sought in its notice of motion and that Mr Tydeman and Tanamerah failed in the relief sought in his, and its, notice of motion.
Second, I do not accept that the notice of motion filed on behalf of Mr Tydeman was one brought "solely because the Court had directed him to do so and this direction was based on the Defendant's encouragement to the Court and in various written communications that such an application must be made".
As I said at Paragraphs [4] and [5] of the reasons for judgment: "Whilst trying to ascertain the real issues in dispute between the parties on
Tibra's notice of motion, it became clear that Mr Tydeman, who is, and at all relevant times has been, a director of Tanamerah, would seek, in the event that Tibra's application was successful, an order, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.html) [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), that
UCPR [rule .1(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s7.1.html) and (3), which rules, in summary, require a company within the meaning of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) to commence, and carry on, proceedings in any court by a solicitor, or by a director of the company, but only if the director is also a plaintiff in the proceedings, be dispensed with.

I directed Mr Tydeman to serve any notice of motion seeking such an order, and any affidavit in support thereof, by 31 October 2012, with which direction he complied."
The notice of motion did not have to be filed. Mr Tydeman was given the opportunity to file it, [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) clearly being a relevant matter upon which reliance might be placed. Had he not filed the notice of motion, the Court would have been entitled to conclude that no order under that section was being sought in the alternative.
In my view, Mr Tydeman well appreciated that he did not have to rely upon the section. This is amply demonstrated by the conditional relief he sought, namely "[O]nly if [he] is denied from being a party to the proceedings ... then under [Section 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/)".
I turn now to a reconsideration of the costs order and whether it should be set aside or varied. No third party rights would be affected by the setting aside, or varying, the costs order that was made.
The starting point in determining the question of costs is the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), [s 98(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html), which provides that subject to the rules of Court, and that, or any other, Act, costs are in the discretion of the Court. The discretion is broad but not unconfined. It is a judicial discretion to be exercised on a principled basis, that is to say, in accordance with the relevant legal principles. It enables an order to be made specifying by whom, to whom, and to what extent, costs are to be paid.
UCPR rule 42.1 provides that "... If the court makes any order as to costs, the court is to order that the costs follow the event unless it appears to the court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs". UCPR rule 42.2 provides that "unless the court orders otherwise or these rules otherwise provide, costs payable to a person under an order of the court or these rules are to be assessed on the ordinary basis".
Importantly, as was pointed out in May versus Christodoulou, an earlier rule, UCPR rule 43.3, was repealed on 7 May 2010. That rule, relevantly, provided: "(1) ... the Court may not, in the exercise of its powers and discretions under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), make any order for costs against a person who is not a party.

This rule does not limit the power of the Court: ...
 to make an order for costs against a person who commences or carries on proceedings ... as an authorised director of a corporation ...".
It is now quite clear that costs orders may be made against a non-party. The formulation of [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) in its terms means that what the High Court said in Knight versus FP Special Assets Ltd [(1992) 174 CLR 178], at [9] (by Greenwood and Rares JJ): "The exercise of the discretion takes account of all of the contextual circumstances of the litigation and the conduct of the parties. One aspect of the award of costs is a recognition that a party has been put to expense which, taking account of the merits as ultimately found on the trial of the action, might otherwise have been avoided. That consideration does not infuse the award of costs with any sense of penalty or punishment but simply recognises the compensatory nature of an award of costs, in context and according to principle. That is why an award of costs, although involving the exercise of a discretion, generally favours the successful party. As to the importance the community attaches to legal costs incurred of and incidental to the resolution of controversies before courts, see Clark versus Cmr of Taxation  <case> at <case>;
Uniline Australia Ltd versus S Briggs Pty Ltd (No 2) <case>; <case>; and,
Sagacious Legal Pty Ltd versus Wesfarmers General Insurance Ltd  <case> at <case> to [132]."
Ultimately, the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) and the UCPR require the Court to make such costs order as it thinks just in the particular circumstances of the case: Bullabidgee Pty Ltd versus McCleary (No 2) <case> at <case>. 
In Ohn versus Walton [(1995) 36 NSWLR 77], at 79, Gleeson CJ said: "The usual rationale of making a costs order is that it is just and reasonable that the successful party should be reimbursed for costs incurred, in the absence of grounds connected with the charge or conduct of the proceedings which make it unjust or unreasonable that there should be such reimbursement."
As has recently been repeated by Black J in In the matter of Employ (No. 96) Pty Limited (in liquidation) <case>, at [7]: "The principles underlying an award of costs include that costs are awarded to compensate the successful party for the expense of being put to the necessity of litigation; a wholly successful defendant should ordinarily receive its costs unless good reason is shown to the contrary; and the discretion to order costs must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some reason connected with the proceedings: Milne versus Attorney-General <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 460] at 477; Oschlack versus Richmond River Council  <case>; [(1998) 193 CLR 72] at 97-98 per McHugh J, at 129-123 per Kirby J; Ruddock v
Vardalis (No 2) [[2001] FCA 1865]; [(2001) 115
FCR 229] at 234. In Howard's Storage World Pty Ltd versus Haviv Holdings
Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2010) 182 FCR 84], Gray J observed at [17] that: "The overriding principle that costs are in the discretion of the court can also be expressed in terms of the negative proposition that no rule or principle should be applied mechanically in the determination of the question where costs should lie in any particular case. Attention must always be paid to the particular circumstances of the individual case. The aim is to do substantial justice in relation to costs, based on the outcomes of the various issues in the proceeding, as between the entities that are parties to that proceeding.""
I shall next deal with the submissions that Mr Tydeman was not a "party" to the proceedings.
The word "party" is not defined in [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s3.html), the definition section, of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/). Nor is the term defined in the UCPR. However, "Plaintiff" is relevantly defined as meaning "a person by whom proceedings are commenced".
Mr Tydeman referred to [s 56(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/). So far as the section is concerned, "party to a civil dispute" means "a person who is involved in the dispute". He also referred to "civil dispute" as defined in [s 18A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s18a.html) to mean, relevantly to [Part 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/index.html#p2a) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), "a dispute that may result in the commencement of civil proceedings". (Both the rule and the section relied upon have now been repealed.) 
In the Dictionary to the UCPR, an "active party" is relevantly defined, in relation to any proceedings, as meaning a party who has an address for service in the proceedings. In the Amended Statement of Claim, Mr Tydeman was described on the front sheet as "the Second Plaintiff". In the affidavit verifying the amended Statement of Claim, affirmed on 24 September 2012, he was also described as "the second Plaintiff". In "Contact Details for plaintiff acting in person or by authorised officer" Mr Tydeman was referred to as a director of Tanamerah and provided an address for service.
"Opposite party" is defined in the Dictionary to mean "defendant (in relation to a plaintiff) and plaintiff (in relation to a defendant)".
In Yakmor versus Hamdoush (No 2) <case>; [(2009) 76 NSWLR 148], a case dealing with the question whether a tutor was a "party" within UCPR rule 42.3, Giles JA, with whom Ipp and Tobias JJA agreed, wrote, at [39] - [41]; 155-156: "... in relation to costs some expansion of "party" from the plaintiff or defendant on the record has been recognised, albeit in other contexts. In Law
Society of New South Wales versus Jackson [(1981) 1 NSWLR 730] it was held that the Law Society was a party within <case> of the Legal
Practitioners Act 1898 because, although it was not the complainant, it had taken part in the proceedings before the Statutory Committee to which that subsection related by appearing and actively participating. In ACP Magazines
Pty Ltd versus Motion  <case> a subpoenaed company was held to be a party, principally by reason of a definition having the effect of including within a party a person against whom a claim for relief was made but also in reliance on Law Society of New South
Wales versus Jackson. In Victoria Legal Aid versus The County Court of Victoria  <case> a subpoenaed entity was regarded as a party to criminal proceedings within <case> of the Crimes (Criminal Trials) Act 1999 (Vic), principally because of a definition extending to any person served with notice of or attending at a hearing but also because (at [20]) the underlying purpose of providing for orders that practitioners pay costs due to the practitioners' wrongful acts indicated that the power should extend to the costs of a non- litigant.

These cases were taken up in In the matter of Bauhaus Pyrmont Pty Ltd (in liq)  <case> in holding that a subpoenaed person and company were parties within r 42.3 of the Rules. One reason was that there was a claim for relief within <case> of the
Act and the subpoenaed person and company became parties by force of that provision. The other (at [14]) was that the cases showed that the concept of "party" was not confined to a person on the record in the proceedings.

Cases decided on particular statutory provisions or rules provide only limited assistance in the present case. ..."
It is quite clear that, in taking all of the steps that he did, Mr Tydeman sought to be a party to the proceedings because he and Tanamerah considered that it was necessary that he be a party (a Plaintiff). Until such time as orders were made, he was identified as a party to the proceedings in the Amended Statement of Claim. Had Tibra not filed a notice of motion, Mr Tydeman would have remained the second Plaintiff in the proceedings and Tanamerah would have been entitled to commence and carry on the proceedings without a solicitor.
I do not accept the submission that Mr Tydeman was identified as a party by "mere error" in having named himself as the second Plaintiff. To the contrary, it was quite clear that he appreciated the effect of being named as a party to the proceedings and sought to rely upon the fact that he was so named in advancing the case that Tanamerah was not required to commence and carry on proceedings by a solicitor since he was a director, and also, a Plaintiff, in the proceedings.
For example, the notice of motion filed on 31 October 2012 sought various forms of relief, but "[o]nly if [he] is denied from being a party to the proceedings ... then under [Section 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), the first Plaintiff asks the Court to make an order to dispense with the Rules and permit [him] to commence and carry on these proceedings as the agent and representative of the First Plaintiff and Alexander Superannuation Fund". Mr Tydeman made clear that he sought a dispensing order "in the circumstance of ... last resort".
Furthermore, in the affidavit affirmed by him in the Amended Statement of Claim, he deposed that "I am aware I may be liable to pay some or all of the costs of the proceedings". 
Ms Tydeman, in her capacity as a director of Tanamerah, also affirmed an affidavit in support of the Amended Statement of Claim, in which she referred to "Mr Tydeman's authority to stand and act as the self-represented Plaintiff in the proceedings that has not been revoked".
All of the submissions made in opposition to the claim for relief sought by Tibra referred to "the Plaintiffs".
I note that one basis for opposing the relief sought by Tibra was that Mr Tydeman submitted that UCPR [rule 7.1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s7.1.html) did not require him to have a personal cause of action against the Defendant in order for him to be a plaintiff in circumstances in which the corporation had a cause of action: see Paragraphs [37] and [98] of the reasons for judgment.
I do not forget, also, the submissions that were made in the proceedings to determine the notices of motion, relating to UCPR rule 7.11(2) that "in proceedings relating to a trust, all trustees must be parties" and under rule 7.12(2) that "in proceedings relating to a trust all persons having a beneficial interest under the trust need not be parties but that the plaintiff may make parties of such persons as he or she thinks fit". In each case, Mr Tydeman sought to rely upon the rule to justify his involvement, as a party, in the proceedings.
In this regard, I refer to what I said at Paragraph [144]: "In considering UCPR rule 7.11 and 7.12, I am of the view that the person who is sought to be joined should, in each case, be a necessary and proper party to the proceedings. As I have said, in this case, each Member's interest is being represented by Tanamerah and there is simply no need for Mr Tydeman to be joined as a party other than, so it would seem, to enable Tanamerah to be represented by a director when, under UCPR [rule .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s7.1.html), it cannot be. Such a result is not one that would achieve the objects of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/)."
Finally, on this point, I refer to what was said by Samuels JA, with whom Reynolds and Mahoney JJA agreed, in Law Society of New South Wales versus Jackson [[1981] 1 NSWLR 730], at 735: "A party, essentially, is a person who takes part in legal proceedings and that is the definition to be found in Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law, at p
It cannot reasonably be doubted that the Council took part in these proceedings."
In my view, Mr Tydeman was a party to the proceedings. By opposing the notice of motion filed by Tibra, and by filing the notice of motion that he filed, he maintained, and continued to maintain, that he was a (second) "plaintiff" in the proceedings. He certainly "took part" in the proceedings because he participated in the proceedings for the purpose of seeking a favourable determination. It was not until the orders were made in the reasons for judgment, that he was no longer a Plaintiff in the proceedings. He was then removed as a party by the order that I made because I concluded he was neither a necessary, nor a proper, party to the litigation between Tanamerah and Tibra.
Nor did Mr Tydeman, in his capacity as director of Tanamerah, purport to conduct proceedings "in the name of" that company. He purported to be a separate human Plaintiff with the result that there was a company Plaintiff and a director Plaintiff, thereby avoiding the need for Tanamerah to commence and carry on proceedings by a solicitor.
Furthermore, in the absence of a dispensing order and without Mr Tydeman having been named as a Plaintiff, Tanamerah's obligation was to retain a solicitor to act for it.
Neither Tanamerah, nor Mr Tydeman, has advanced any reasons that satisfy me that some other order should be made as to the whole, or any part, of the costs of the two notices of motion. In those circumstances, I do not set aside, or vary, the order for costs previously made.
In case I am wrong, and Mr Tydeman was not a party to the proceedings until removed by my order, I turn then to what considerations should govern the exercise of a discretionary power in circumstances where a costs order is being considered as against a person who was not a party to the proceedings.
Even if Mr Tydeman is correct that he merely made submissions on behalf of Tanamerah (which I do not accept), that does not prevent an order for costs being made against him personally. Yet, I remember that in May versus Christodoulou, the majority in the Court of Appeal held that the fact that a director represents the company is not enough to justify the exercise of the power to award costs against the director personally. Sackville AJA, at [102]-[103], observed that: "Although a non-legally qualified director does not owe the same duties to the court as a legal practitioner, it is no doubt correct that the manner in which the director conducts legal proceedings on behalf of a company could justify a costs order against him or her personally. If, to take an example already given, the director repeatedly and flagrantly ignores court directions, thereby prolonging the proceedings and causing the other party to incur substantial and irrecoverable costs, a non-party costs order may well be appropriate.

In this case, however, the primary Judge did not find that the appellant engaged in conduct that was so reprehensible or inappropriate that a non-party costs order should be made against him. The criticisms made of the appellant's conduct of the proceedings, if made in relation to a legal representative, would have fallen well short of the sort of conduct that justifies a costs order against a legal practitioner personally ... If every legal practitioner who attempted to adduce inadmissible evidence or who asked irrelevant questions was made the subject of adverse costs orders, the courts would do little but adjudicate costs applications."
Even Handley AJA, in the minority, regarded as relevant to the exercise of the discretion to make an order for costs against the director, the fact that a director's involvement had prolonged the proceedings.
In Redman versus JGS Investment Holdings Pty Ltd; Redman versus Arraj <case>, Black J, dealing with a notice of motion for the joinder of a company as a party to the proceedings, noted, in respect of costs sought against directors who had appeared, at [5] - [7], wrote: "The majority directors' contention that the opposition to the motion was by
JGS, not by them, does not seem to me to reflect the reality of the conduct of the motion before me. There was no suggestion that JGS had taken any formal corporate step to authorise opposition to the motion. Any costs order would not be made against the majority directors as merely the "directors of JGS", but rather in their capacity as unsuccessful opponents to the relief sought in the motion.

However, even if the opposition by the majority directors were treated as analogous to the situation where a director appears in proceedings to represent a corporation's interests, the Court would have power to make an order for costs against them in an appropriate case. I should briefly refer to several relevant authorities, although the parties did not address them in submissions. The question whether the court should make a costs order against a director who carries on proceedings on behalf of a company is determined by reference to the factors identified by the High Court in Knight versus FP Special
Assets Ltd [[1992] HCA 28]; [(1992) 174 CLR 178], including whether the non-party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and has an interest in its subject matter; see also Yates v
Boland <case>
In FPM Constructions Pty Ltd versus Council of the City of Blue Mountains [[2005] NSWCA 340], at [210] Basten JA (with whom Beazley and Giles JJA agreed) noted that the exceptions to the general rule that an order for costs is only made against a party to the litigation should not be allowed to expand so as to undermine the rule itself, and noted relevant factors including that the unsuccessful party was the moving party and whether the conduct of the litigation was unreasonable. In May versus Christodoulou  <case>,
Sackville AJA observed at [102]-[103] that a relevant question was whether the non-party or director had engaged in conduct that was so inappropriate that a costs order should be made against him, and Handley AJA (in the minority) regarded the fact that a director's involvement had prolonged the proceedings to be relevant to the exercise of the discretion.

In my view, the majority directors should be ordered to pay the costs of the joinder motion in the Arraj proceedings. They actively sought to be heard and were heard in opposition to the orders sought in that motion and the motion would otherwise not have been opposed. The need for substantive argument as to that matter arose only because they opposed that order and they were ultimately unsuccessful in their opposition to that order. I consider that the circumstances of non-parties to the proceedings seeking to be heard in opposition to a joinder of a necessary or proper party to the proceedings, where the parties to the proceedings did not oppose that joinder, are sufficient to warrant an order for costs against the majority directors in that regard."
At all times, Mr Tydeman sought to be, and was, heard, in opposition to Tibra's notice of motion which related to his involvement in the proceedings. In addition, he advanced a case in support of the notice of motion that he had filed and made submissions why an order under [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) ought to be made. (I previously referred to the length and detail of submissions that were filed and the fact that the hearing of the two notices of motion took almost one day.) 
Both Tanamerah, and Mr Tydeman, was each comprehensively unsuccessful in maintaining its, and his, opposition to Tibra's notice of motion, and also in maintaining that the relevant rules should be dispensed with.
Before filing the Amended Statement of Claim, Tanamerah was aware of UCPR [rule 7.1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s7.1.html), which provided that a company within the meaning of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) of the Commonwealth may commence and carry on proceedings in any court by a solicitor or by a director of the company and in the case of proceedings in the Supreme Court, by a director only if the director is also a plaintiff in the proceedings. Unless Mr Tydeman, as a director, was also named as a Plaintiff in the proceedings, the requirement of the rule would not be satisfied. An Amended Statement of Claim was then filed naming him as a Plaintiff in the proceedings, in order to take advantage of the rule. He acknowledged in that amended Statement of Claim, the possibility that he may be liable for costs (although that acknowledgement was in the context of the proceedings).
It was only to avoid the need for Tanamerah to commence, and carry on, the proceedings in the Supreme Court by a solicitor, that Mr Tydeman was joined as a party to the proceedings, and he sought to maintain that position so that Tanamerah did not have to retain a solicitor. This was not because there was a financial constraint preventing Tanamerah from obtaining the assistance of a solicitor. Mr Tydeman informed me that there was not. He did not suggest that Tanamerah was unable to pay for legal representation, (although, subsequently, he stated that the directors would have to contribute to the costs). Nor did he say that the desire to have him represent Tanamerah arose, otherwise, from necessity rather than choice. He said, in relation to the proceedings, that he was "not trusting" of lawyers.
So it is not thought that I have overlooked it, I do not accept the following submissions made on the current application: "Ms Tydeman, Member 1, has no right of access to any funds of the superfund held by her trustee in Member 1's ledger to fund litigation because there are strict requirements set down by APRA pertaining to any self-managed superannuation fund. Litigation expenses to retain a solicitor would not satisfy the requisite test for the superfund. Accordingly, under this unique trust structure of ASF, which does not appear to have been previously considered by any Court, must not be confused with any other type of trust structure (e.g., discretionary or unit).

Also, there is no obligation or right for the directors to lend any funds to the trustee for any purpose whatsoever, including to fund litigation. The directors are prohibited from obtaining any benefit from the superannuation (in any respect). Accordingly, because Tanamerah's financial position is devoid of any funds or assets (in the company's own right), the company cannot enter into any scheme of arrangement on a commercial basis to borrow any money because it will never have the capacity to repay that liability."
None of these matters was put previously and they appear, for the first time, in the submissions of 22 March 2013. I refer to Mr Tydeman's, and Ms Tydeman's, acknowledgement regarding costs identified in Paragraphs [24] and [25] of the reasons for judgment. I also refer to Paragraph [49] of the reasons for judgment.
Moreover, it would rarely be just for a person, said to be representing another party for the purposes of an application to the Court, as well as the other party said to be represented, to be able to do so with no risk as to costs to himself, or the other party, should the application fail.
None of these matters advanced should prevent Tibra from obtaining an order for its costs of the notices of motion. To the contrary, at various parts of the reasons for judgment, I have noted the steps taken by the legal representatives for Tibra to inform Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman of relevant considerations (e.g. [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/)) that would apply in respect of its notice of motion.
It should also not be forgotten, in relation to the determination of costs, that I referred, at Paragraph [54], to some of the submissions made, which I was satisfied were not supported by the evidence presented on the notices of motion and I concluded, at Paragraph [55], that the criticisms made of Tibra's solicitors and counsel seemed to be unjustified.
In these circumstances, I remain satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order for costs against both Tanamerah and against Mr Tydeman. Accordingly, I do not propose to set aside, or vary, the costs order previously made.
In summary, then, if the question is where do the interests of justice lie, I would assess the position as follows - until the order was made removing Mr Tydeman, he was a party to the proceedings. In any event, all of the circumstances, as well as [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) and UCPR rule 42.1, justify an order in favour of Tibra being made for the costs of the notices of motion since it was successful. Tibra was put to expense in litigating the issue; it would appear that Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman were not.
Even if Mr Tydeman was not a party to the proceedings, his conduct, and that of Tanamerah, in opposing the grant of relief sought, and maintaining an entitlement to rely on [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s14.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), whether as a last resort or otherwise, is relevant. Tibra was forced to litigate the issue and to file its notice of motion and oppose the relief sought in the notice of motion filed by Mr Tydeman and Tanamerah. Moreover, the reason for not engaging a solicitor was personal to Mr Tydeman and Tanamerah. All these reasons justify the order for costs that I made.
In all the circumstances, the interests of justice do not require me to set aside, or vary, the costs order made by me in the reasons for judgment.
In relation to the question of costs of this application, Tanamerah, and Mr Tydeman, has each comprehensively failed. It is appropriate that it, and he, should pay the costs of the application to set aside, or vary the costs order previously made since Tibra has been put to expense, once again, in responding to the application. However, since Bergin CJ in Eq dealt with the issue of costs before her, the costs of this application to which I have referred should be limited to the costs and disbursements incurred in, and associated with, filing the submissions in reply and attending to take judgment (if Tibra does so by a legal representative).
I order that the application brought by Tanamerah and Mr Tydeman to set aside or vary the costs order be dismissed with costs (limited as set out above).
As Mr Tydeman is no longer a party to the proceedings, there is no reason why the costs orders made against him should not be able to be enforced forthwith.
In relation to Tanamerah, as the proceedings brought by it have been stayed, there is also no reason why the costs orders should not be able to be enforced forthwith. However, in the event that the matter proceeds with a solicitor retained by Tanamerah, before any costs order has been enforced, an application to stay the enforcement of the costs orders against it may be brought if the parties are unable to reach agreement on that issue.
