Friday, 13 December 2003  /02 The Ombudsman versus Robert Koopman & anor  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings, the plaintiff seeks declaratory and prerogative relief to prevent the first defendant proceeding against him in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, who is the second defendant, having regard to prohibitions on such proceedings which it is claimed are contained in the relevant legislation, the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/).  When the proceedings commenced by the first defendant came before the
Tribunal, a preliminary objection to such proceedings was taken by the plaintiff, but that objection was overruled and the President of the Tribunal who was hearing the matter ruled that he had power to proceed. It is in respect of that ruling that these proceedings are brought.  The President of the Tribunal who overruled the objection was His Honour
Judge O'Connor, a Judge of the District Court of New South Wales, and the question therefore arises whether these proceedings should have been commenced in this List of this Division or in the Court of Appeal.  In Daykin versus SAS Trustee Corporation <case>, [51 NSWLR 328], I reviewed the relevant legislation and concluded at para [5]:  "It follows therefore that although prima facie appeals under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/adta1997348/s119.html) of the [Administrative Decisions Tribunal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/adta1997348/) are properly commenced in the Administrative Law List in the Common Law Division, that is subject to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), and by virtue of that section there are assigned to the Court of Appeal proceedings on appeal and otherwise relating to "specified tribunals". A "specified tribunal" includes "(vii) a body of persons having amongst its number a judge or member, being a body functioning or purporting to function under any Act giving power to a body having amongst its number a judge or member, whether as judge or member or as designated person", and a judge or member is defined by subs (b) as a judge or member of the Land and Environment Court, Industrial
Relations Commission, the Dust Diseases Tribunal, the Government and Related
Employees Appeal Tribunal, the District Court or the Compensation Court."  Although these proceedings are not an appeal pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/adta1997348/s119.html) of the [Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/adta1997348/), they are proceedings for prohibiting or otherwise restraining the Tribunal from proceeding in a matter before it and for determining by declaration matters concerning the powers of a specified tribunal: [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), [s (2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) & (e).  As I held in Daykin, where the Tribunal is presided over by a Judge of the District Court, the Tribunal is a 'specified tribunal' and, accordingly, the proceedings are assigned by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) to the Court of Appeal.  Daykin has been approved by the Court of Appeal in Puglisi v
Administrative Decisions Tribunal Appeal Panel <case>, [52 NSWLR 350](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=52%20NSWLR%20350 "View LawCiteRecord" ), and without referring to Daykin, Sheller J expressed a similar view in Lloyd versus Veterinary Surgeons Investigating Committee <case>  I was also referred to the decision of Barrett J in NSW Breeding &
Racing versus Administrative Decisions Tribunal <case>, [53 NSWLR 559], at para [44] where his Honour appears to have left open the question of the appropriate forum where the proceedings are for judicial review from a single member of the Tribunal, not the Appeal Panel; but I am satisfied that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) covers both a single member of the Tribunal and the Appeal Panel, provided the person or one of the persons presiding has the status referred to in [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html)  There is power under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s51.html) of the
Act to permit the proceedings to remain in the Common Law Division, but having regard to the clear policy which is apparent from [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html), although it was appropriate to allow the urgent interlocutory proceedings to be dealt with in this Division, it is, in my view, more appropriate that the final determination in the matter be left to the Court of Appeal.  I therefore order that the proceedings be removed into the Court of Appeal, the matter is to be listed for directions on a date to be fixed by the
Registry and notified to parties. The costs in the proceedings in this
Division so far are reserved to the Court of Appeal.
