JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: I gave reasons for my decision in this matter on 8 March
The matter is in the list today to consider what orders should be made following those reasons.  I have been presented with three different versions of suggested orders.  The first version, submitted by Mr J T Johnson of counsel for the plaintiffs, includes an order that the Receiver have certain powers under the
Corporations Act and that the fourth defendant, Ausforest Limited, file and serve accounts.  This goes far beyond what I dealt with in my reasons for judgment. Indeed, I specifically rejected the idea that accounts should be taken before the land was sold the principal reason being that on the evidence before me there is no money to pay for accounts or enquiries until monies become available from the sale of the land. Mr Johnson says that the sale may take over a year and as every day goes by it will be more and more difficult to ensure that all the relevant information is still available. That may be so, and it also may be that if someone is prepared to fund the liquidator of Ausforest Limited, or alternatively, fund the trustees for sale, that enquiries can be made.  However, I am not prepared to order accounts at this stage, as to my mind, it would be throwing good money after bad. As Mr Johnson points out, he may take out a motion for accounts, though probably because of my reasons in the present case, he would start behind scratch. That, however, is a matter for the plaintiffs.  The principal reason why I have framed the orders as appointing trustees for sale as a way of carrying out the winding up of the scheme is illustrated by the result of the case of Burton versus Arcus <case>; [(2004) 51 ACSR 683], a decision of Johnson J of the Supreme Court of Western
Australia. There are great problems, as his Honour pointed out, in winding up a scheme where there are co-mortgagees of undivided shares of property which is involved in the scheme. The solution is to appoint trustees for sale so that the encumbrances affecting undivided shares can be superseded, the land sold, money produced, which can then be distributed to investors after all proper administration expenses have been paid.  I have made orders in accordance with paragraph 1 of Mr McHugh's draft, for the Receiver and paragraphs 2 to 6 of the draft submitted by Mr Lindsay Foster
SC on behalf of the first defendant. I have made a representative order.
However, there has already been, to my mind, some misleading publicity about this case and I want to make one hundred percent clear that I am not treating the present proceedings as a class action in making a representative order for the purpose of the <case> application which appears as order 1 in the short minutes. That merely allows the sale of the property without having to serve each investor. If this were a class action I would need to consider a procedure whereby  people could opt out (or opt in) of the action. That question has not arisen in these proceedings to date.  *
