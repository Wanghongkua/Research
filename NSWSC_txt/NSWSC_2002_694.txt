DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS versus SNB  
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff appeals under [s104(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s104.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) from an order of a Magistrate in the Dubbo Children's Court made on 4 February 2002 dismissing an information laid against the defendant alleging an offence under [s314](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s314.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) for making a false accusation against a person, intending that person to be the subject of an investigation of an offence, knowing the said person to be innocent of it.  The defendant was served with a Field Court Attendance Notice under [s100AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100ab.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) by a police officer, Inspector Boyter, in respect of this alleged offence and the information came before the Magistrate for hearing on 4 February 2002.  Inspector Boyter was the first witness in the prosecution case. During his evidence the Prosecutor sought to tender a statement taken from the defendant by Inspector Boyter on 13 March 2001 after complaint was made under the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) about a police officer. Objection was taken to the tender of the statement upon the ground that it was inadmissible by virtue of [s34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s34.html) of the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). Following a voir dire examination the objection was upheld. The effect of this ruling was that the prosecution was unable to establish an essential element of the case and, accordingly, the information was dismissed.  The short question is whether [s34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s34.html) of the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) applies to information obtained in the course of an investigation by a police officer acting otherwise than under the direction of or at the instigation of the
Ombudsman. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s34.html) of the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) relevantly provides:  "Disclosure by Ombudsman or officer  
The Ombudsman shall not, nor shall an officer of the Ombudsman, disclose any information obtained by the Ombudsman or officer in the course of the
Ombudsman's or officer's office, unless the disclosure is made:  where the information is obtained from a public authority, with the consent of the head of that authority or of the responsible Minister,  where the information is obtained from any other person:  with the consent of that person, or  for the purpose of proceedings (including an inquiry under section 197 of the Police Service Act 1990) with respect to the discipline of police officers before the Commissioner of Police or the Government and Related
Employees Appeal Tribunal,  for the purpose of any proceedings under Division 2 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/index.html#p5) of the [Freedom of Information Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/) arising as a consequence of a determination made by the Ombudsman under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/s24.html) or [43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/s43.html) of that Act,  for the purpose of any proceedings under section 37 or under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/index.html#p3) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/) or [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/scoia1983341/index.html#p4) of the [Special Commissions of Inquiry Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/scoia1983341/), or  for the purpose of discharging his or her functions under this or any other Act.  
Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units.  
Subsection (1) does not prevent the Ombudsman from furnishing any information relating to:  a matter arising under a law of another State, the Commonwealth or a
Territory of the Commonwealth, or  an undertaking that is or was being carried out jointly by New South Wales and another State, the Commonwealth or a Territory of the Commonwealth, to a person exercising under a law of that other State, the Commonwealth or that
Territory, as the case may be, functions similar to those exercised by the
Ombudsman under this Act.  
Subsection (1) does not operate to render admissible in evidence in any proceedings any document that would not have been so admissible if this section had not been enacted.  
Without limiting the operation of subsection (1) (a), in the application of subsection (1) to and in respect of information received in the course of an investigation under this Act of police conduct, the reference in that subsection:  to a public authority---shall be construed as a reference to a police officer,  to the head of that authority---shall be construed as a reference to the
Commissioner, and  to the responsible Minister---shall be construed as a reference to the
Minister administering the Police Service Act 1990.  
If:  the Ombudsman, or an officer of the Ombudsman, is to give evidence before, or to produce the whole or any part of a document to, the Joint Committee, and  the evidence proposed to be given, or the whole or any part of the document proposed to be produced, would disclose information obtained by the
Ombudsman or officer, in the course of his or her office, from a public authority or other person, and  the public authority or other person has informed the Ombudsman or officer that the information is confidential, the Ombudsman or officer must make a request under section 31H (1) for the evidence to be taken in private or for a direction to be given that the document, or part of the document, be treated as confidential.  
In the case of information obtained from a public authority or other person as referred to in subsection (4), a reference in section 31H to the consent in writing of a witness, in relation to the disclosure or publication of evidence, is to be construed as a reference to the consent in writing of the public authority or other person."  On its face this provision would not affect the evidence sought to be tendered. However, the matter is somewhat complicated by the provisions of s of the Police Service Act 1990 which provides-  
Application of section 34 of [Ombudsman Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/)  
In the application of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s34.html) (1) of the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) to information received by the Ombudsman, or an officer of the Ombudsman, in the administration or execution of this Part:  the reference in that subsection to a public authority is to be construed as a reference to a police officer, and  the reference in that subsection to the head of that authority is to be construed as a reference to the Commissioner, and  the reference in that subsection to the responsible Minister is to be construed as a reference to the Minister administering this Act.  
This section does not limit the operation of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s34.html) (1) of the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/).  In my view s164 of the Police Service Act 1990, when read with [s34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s34.html) of the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/), does not have the effect contended for by the defendant below. It does not convert an inquiry by the police officer into an inquiry by the Ombudsman, nor does it convert the police officer into an officer acting in the course of either the
Ombudsman's Office or that of an officer of the Ombudsman. It is not sought by the defendant to argue to the contrary.  It follows, therefore, that the evidence sought to be admitted was properly admissible and should have been received. Accordingly, the dismissal of the information is affected by a significant error of law. I quash the order dismissing the information and direct that the proceedings be remitted to the
Magistrate to be dealt with according to law.  The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs. In the circumstances I grant the defendant a certificate under [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) of the [Suitors Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
