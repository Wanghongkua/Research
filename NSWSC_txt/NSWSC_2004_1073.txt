YOUNG CJ in EQ  
Monday 8 November 2004  /04 - RE AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES LTD (IN LIQ)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application made by a liquidator who is a liquidator under a creditors' voluntary winding up in the liquidation of
Australian Resources Limited. The liquidator seeks an order under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) 2001 that the company be wound up in insolvency. There is precedent for making that order, the most recent of which is Carter versus New Tel Ltd <case>; [(2003) 44 ACSR 661.] However, the learned Austin J who decided that case made it quite clear at page 663 [5] that there must be good reasons for the Court to intervene by making a winding up order in a case where the company is already in liquidation.  The so-called good reasons put forward in the instant case are that the terms of an indemnity policy issued by the CGU Insurance Group may well have a different effect, an effect more beneficial to the liquidator, if the winding up is in insolvency rather than a creditors' voluntary winding up.  The liquidator has notified the members of the committee of inspection and others, all of whom may be thought not to have any commercial reason for opposing the application, and there has been no negative response.  In BP Australia Ltd versus Brown [(2003) 58 NSWLR 332], a case decided after Carter's case under [s
FF(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588ff.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), Chief
Justice Spigelman with whom Mason P and Handley JA agreed, said that courts are subject to a high level obligation to comply with procedural fairness.
Thus, in these sort of matters a person likely to be adversely affected by the order of the Court should be given an opportunity of making submissions to the
Court before any such order is made. The word "before" is put in italics to show its emphasis.  Mr Forster SC, who appears for the liquidator, says that in the present case there is no need to notify CGU because an application will in due course be made under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lrpa404/) 1946 and at that stage CGU can oppose and can ask that this present order be terminated or rescinded. My reading of what the learned Chief Justice said is that that is not to be the way in which this Court is to afford procedural justice.  The liquidator is reluctant to notify CGU. Accordingly, it follows that the present application should be dismissed and there should be no recourse to the company's assets for the liquidator's costs. If a fresh application is made to notify CGU, then of course the Court will entertain it. So at the moment I will just stand the matter over to the Registrar's list at 11 am on 15
November 2004.
