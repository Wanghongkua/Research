CLAUDE RAYMOND CICOLINI & ANOR versus A B ELDER & CO PTY LIMITED /98 March 1998 
Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal by way of stated case pursuant to [s.101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s101.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) from a verdict given in favour of the respondent on 13 June 1997. In essence, the case involved the awarding of commission to the respondent on the sale of property owned by the first and second appellants. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s106.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) provides:- "1. The court shall hear and determine the question or questions of law arising on such case." 
That provision does not enable this court to interfere with findings of fact, see Azzopardi v. Tasman UEB Industries Limited [(1985) 4 NSWLR 139], in particular at 155B-156F. Therefore it is not permissible for me to look at the facts, namely the transcript in this case unless there is an express assertion that there was no evidence to warrant the finding of a particular fact. It may be that there are other situations in which it is permissible to look at the evidence but they do not arise in this case.

The appellants' contentions are set out in paragraph 4 of the stated case in various headed subparagraphs. Contention 4.1 was not pursued. Contention 4.2 was pursued on behalf of the appellants and the argument centred round whether there was any evidence warranting the magistrate's finding contained in paragraph 2.14 and 3.3 of the stated case that the second appellant's wife was acting as courier on behalf of the first appellant and therefore that service of a copy of the agreement upon her complied within the provisions of the Act, namely [s.42AA(1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psabaa1941385/s42aa.html) of the [Property Stock and Business Agents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psabaa1941385/).
That section provides that a licensee shall not be entitled to any remuneration by way of commission or for expenses unless inter alia "a copy of the agreement was served by the licensee on that person within 48 hours of the agreement being signed by or on behalf of that person".

Service is not defined within the Act although there is some reference to service upon agents in [s.86B.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psabaa1941385/s86b.html)
I was referred to Repatriation Commission v. Gordon & Ors <case>; [(1990) 26 FCR 569] at 577 where Spender, J. said:- "The object of service, in whatever form, is to bring the contents of the document or documents served to the attention of the person to be served." 
The following passages in the transcript were relied upon by the respondent in support of its contention that there was evidence upon which it was open to the magistrate to make the finding in relation to the wife of the second defendant: p.8, ll.36-46; p.13, ll.42-48; p.16, ll.41-58; p.17, ll.1-45. Those are passages in the evidence of the respondent before the magistrate whose evidence the magistrate, as he was entitled to, accepted. The effect of this evidence was that the wife of the second appellant had delivered on behalf of the first appellant a signed form of the agreement to the respondent whereupon the respondent returned to her a copy of that form. In my judgment it was open to the magistrate to find that such amounted to service upon the first appellant within the meaning of the Act.

Contention 4.3 relates to the same subsection of the Act and asserts that the magistrate was wrong in law in finding that the agreement had been served on the first appellant within 48 hours of the signing of the agreement by the first appellant.

The relevant findings of fact are at paragraphs 2.7; 2.8; 2.11; 2.12; 2.13 and .14 of the stated case. The effect of those paragraphs is that at some time between 29 October and 31 October 1995 inclusive, the first appellant signed the document.

The relevant passages in the transcript relied upon by the respondent in support of the magistrate's finding are those already referred to in respect of contention 4.2 above and additionally p.7, ll.19-20.

In my judgment it was open to the magistrate to find that the service upon the second appellant's wife as courier for the first appellant (already dealt with above) was within 48 hour period required by the Act.

Contention 4.4 on behalf of the appellants was that there had not been a valid service of the statement of claim as required by [s.42A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psabaa1941385/s42a.html) of the Act, inasmuch as the document which it was conceded to have been served as the statement of claim was served prior to the sale and therefore was invalid as at that time no monies were due.

Such an argument had been expressly put forward in Jacobs v. The Public
Trustee [(1964) 80 WN 954] and rejected by the Court of Appeal.

Contention 4.5 is a criticism of the magistrate for not allowing the tender of the statement of claim issued by the respondent. This is dealt with in paragraph 3.4 of the stated case and amounts to the rejection of a late application to tender a document which was a matter entirely within the discretion of the magistrate. I do not see anything in the stated case which would justify me finding that his discretion miscarried in that respect. It follows that contention 4.6 cannot be sustained.

Contentions 4.7 to 4.10 all relate to allegations either of insufficient evidence or wrong conclusions being drawn from the evidence. As such, they seem to me to come within the ground covered by the case of Azzopardi and cannot be considered on appeal; it being conceded in respect of each contention that there was evidence and the criticism was of its sufficiency.

In the result, this appeal is dismissed with costs.
