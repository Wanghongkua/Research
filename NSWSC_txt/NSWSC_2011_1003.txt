Judgment  
By motion brought on the first day of the trial in this matter, the Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants, Barescape Pty Ltd as trustee of the Vs Family Trust and Anthony Ventura, sought orders under [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s61.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) that the cross-claim filed by the First Defendant/Cross-Claimant be struck out or, alternatively, a joint expert report dated 6 July 2011 and any supplementary joint expert reports or oral evidence from the experts be struck out, disallowed or rejected and consequential orders. 
After argument in respect of the motion, I delivered my judgment on 10 August 2011 and I ordered that the motion be dismissed. I reserved the question of costs for the parties to make further submissions after they had had the opportunity to read my reasons for judgment and those further submissions have now been made. 
Mr Kelly SC, who appears for the First Defendant/Cross-Claimant contends that costs should follow the event and points out that the motion was unsuccessful and took two days of court time in circumstances that the loss of those days may well have the result that the hearing cannot be completed within the allocated hearing dates. 
Mr Wood, who appears for the Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants, contends that matters which were the subject of evidence in the motion will also be relevant to the admissibility and weight of evidence and that the motion had been filed where there were issues as to discovery which continued up to the point of the hearing. I accept that there were issues as to the scope of discovery which continued up to the date of the hearing of the motion. However, prior to the argument of the motion before me, a comprehensive affidavit of Robert Faraday-Bensley sworn 8 August 2011 had been filed and served by the First Defendant/Cross-Claimant which provided a very substantial response to the complaints as to discovery made. 
In my view, the matters agitated by the motion were discrete and the two days spent on the motion is time which is lost and which will increase the costs of the hearing. This is sufficient, in my view, to support an order that the Plaintiffs/Cross Defendants should pay the Defendants'/Cross-Claimant's costs of and incidental to the motion. 
I should add, that the result of the motion might well have been predictable having regard to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd versus Cassar  <case> In my view, the subsisting issues as to discovery were such that they could have been addressed by less extreme remedies than striking out the cross-claim or excluding expert reports and it was therefore unlikely that the Court would exercise its powers in the manner sought in the motion. 
In these circumstances, I consider that the appropriate order is that the Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants pay the Defendants'/Cross Claimant's costs of and incidental to the motion and I so order. * * *
