Elsie Florence Bearns versus Noelene Christine Bearns-Hayes` `Estate of Eric Noel Bearns & Ors` ` 2008/95` `6 May 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /95 - ELSIE FLORENCE BEARNS V NOELENE CHRISTINE BEARNS-HAYES - ESTATE OF ERIC NOEL BEARNS & ORS 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application made by the plaintiff widow of the late Eric Noel Bearns to extend the time for bringing an application under the [Family Provision Act 1982](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) and, if that extension is given, for provision under that Act. 
The case has been most bitterly fought out, which is a shame for a large number of reasons not the least of which is that I am quite sure that had the parties been able to tolerate each other, a far more sensible arrangement with which they could live for the rest of their lives could have been worked out than the limited provision that the Court is able to make under the [Family
Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/).
However, as they are not able to do that, the Court must decide the matter according to law.

Eric Noel Bearns died on 26 June 1992. His last will, which was made on 11
March 1992, was duly admitted to probate. The plaintiff widow and the first defendant, the deceased's daughter, were the executors. The estate was said to be worth $3,820,000 in the probate document, but there is at least an additional $181,000 to be added to that, which was unearthed subsequently.
This additional sum is represented by the deceased's "rainy day" monies in the form of a treasure trove buried at Riverwood and dug up under the supervision of the solicitors for both parties in the case. Thus the deceased's estate is in the vicinity of $4 million. The plaintiff is 80 this year. She and the deceased were married for 46 years. Although, at some point in time, their relationship soured and they separated, the undisputed evidence is that in the early years of their association the plaintiff devoted herself to nursing the deceased back to health and that she was a considerable contributor to the amassing of the deceased's fortune.

The first defendant is approximately 50 years of age. She is the only child of the deceased and the plaintiff. She appears to be an astute businesswoman and there is nothing to suggest other than she is well able to provide for herself and her family. The second and third defendants are the deceased's and the plaintiff's grandchildren, the children of the first defendant. The second defendant is currently 20 and the third defendant is currently 18.

The Court has been given relatively sketchy details as to the deceased's assets. I think that the best way of dealing with the assets is to put them into four columns, the first column being the name of the property, the second the alleged value for probate purposes, the third the beneficiaries and the fourth any comments.

It can be seen that the bulk of the estate passes to the first defendant with the second and third defendants obtaining substantial benefits as well.

At one stage, there was in these proceedings a question of construction of the will. The plaintiff and the three defendants are the only persons beneficially entitled under the will. They have agreed that on the true construction of the will property passes as I have outlined. I am glad they have done that because if I had had to construe the will according to law, I may have come to some far more complicated interpretation. I will, however, proceed on the basis that the beneficial interests flow in the way in which I have outlined.

The first defendant alleges that the estate has been fully administered. She says that all the property has been transferred out of the estate to the beneficiaries before the present application was made. She concedes that this may not have been done strictly according to good conveyancing practice. For instance, the Riverwood property is in the name of the plaintiff and the first defendant as joint tenants though, in fact, the first defendant holds her interest as to two-thirds for the second and third defendants in equal shares.
As appears subsequently, this allegation is not supported by the core of the evidence.

The plaintiff made this application by summons filed on 21 April 1995. The summons was not served on the first defendant until 5 July 1995. The second and third defendants only came into the picture as parties late last year because it appeared that there was a will construction problem which might affect their interests and also their beneficial interests might be affected in a way that might not be able to be protected by the first defendant and her representatives.

Under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s16.html) of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) any application under the Act must have been filed no later than 26 December 1993.
The application was thus sixteen months out of time.

Mr Rundle, for the first defendant, objects to time being extended. He points to the fact that under [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s16.html) the Court may extend the time only if sufficient cause is shown as to why the application was not made in time. Mr Rundle says that no sufficient cause has been shown in the instant case.

The facts as to the making of the application out of time are, relatively speaking, undisputed. The plaintiff had some knowledge of the contents of the will prior to the death of her husband. She knew, or ought to have known, that she was not receiving the absolute interest in the matrimonial home at
Riverwood. She knew that her daughter and her grandchildren were receiving significant benefit. She did not do anything then or after the deceased died to obtain legal advice as to whether she could make any claim against the estate, sometimes colloquially called in evidence before me "contesting the will". She was present at many of the conferences that were held with the estate's solicitors, Messrs Klees and Chicken. I accept her evidence that she did leave most of the arrangements in the estate to the first defendant, but I also accept the evidence that she was present on most of the significant occasions when instructions were given to the solicitors.

The reason why the plaintiff may well have been content with what she was given under the will was that the other members of the family did not do anything to make it apparent to the plaintiff that they were going to disturb her occupation of the Riverwood property.

The will actually provided that the property at Riverwood was not to be sold for twelve years. Presumably one of the reasons for this was to ensure that the grandchildren did not take their estate in possession until they had reached what the deceased might have thought of as mature years, but another was probably to protect the plaintiff's occupation of the property.
Unfortunately, if these were the purposes of the deceased, they have not been fulfilled because the will clearly gives the grandchildren a vested interest in the property, and there is merely a trust for them so far as their half is concerned that is absolute and to which they can put an end at any time. In any event, they could arrange for the property to be sold either pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/calopa1898334/s64.html) of the [Conveyancing and Law of Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/calopa1898334/) or, alternatively, [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). However, the deceased, as I say, seems to have thought that his widow would be in the property for up to twelve years.

The plaintiff seemed to be content with that arrangement and indeed spent money of her own in repairs to the property.

The present situation is that both the first defendant and counsel for the second and third defendants have said that there is no present intention to disturb the plaintiff in her occupation. However, as a matter of law, there still can be an application under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) at any time, though, what has been said may well amount to an equitable defence to that claim.

By the end of 1994, relations between the plaintiff and the first defendant had significantly soured. The exact reason for this is not particularly clear, but relations became very bad indeed.

In late January 1995, the plaintiff consulted solicitors as to her rights under the Family Law Act and was told that as her husband was dead there were no rights under that Act that were relevant, but that the plaintiff had rights under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/), which were now still able to be asserted but the time for making the application had, as a matter of law, expired. The plaintiff consulted another solicitor early in February 1995, and he gave the same sort of answer and commenced preparing proceedings, which were filed in this Court on 21 April 1995.

There is in evidence Exhibit DX11, which is a letter from the first of those solicitors to the plaintiff, the penultimate paragraph of which reads as follows: "I confirm that for the moment you have decided to give your daughter until the end of February to make a realistic endeavour to sell the property at
Wrights Beach. I understand that you will then make a decision as to whether or not to challenge the provisions made for you by the Will of your late husband." 
As I say, two and a half months then passed before the application was filed.

Another two and a half months passed before the application was served. It was suggested to the plaintiff that this was because of a deliberate decision that she had made to hold things back as long as possible. The plaintiff denied that suggestion. The solicitor, who was in charge of the proceedings, at that stage, was called and he said that he could not remember why it was that such a time went by before he instructed process servers on 23 June 1995 to serve the summons.

The courts have considered over the last dozen years or so the principles to be applied when an extension of time is to be sought. The discussion on this matter usually commences with the decision of Herring CJ in Re Guskett <case>; [[1947] VLR 212.] The Victorian Act, at that stage, did not contain any guidelines to the Court as to when it should extend the time but his Honour, at p 214, said that the Act showed the legislative intention that applications should be made within the prescribed period and the provision to allow the
Court to extend the period: "does no more than enable the Court to grant an indulgence to an applicant in appropriate circumstances. It is for the applicant to make out a case that will justify the granting of the indulgence sought. He has to show reasons why his failure to apply within the time allowed should be excused. Every case will have to be dealt with on its own facts, but it would seem necessary for the applicant to satisfy the Court that the circumstances are such as to make it unjust for him to be penalised for being out of time. As, moreover, he is seeking an indulgence, he should apply promptly for an extension of time." 
Wednesday 7 May 1997 
HIS HONOUR continued: 
The English cases up to that point were considered and summarised by Megarry
VC in Re Salmon [[1981] Ch 167] at 175-176 where his Lordship sets out the six guidelines to English Courts dealing with this sort of problem. In essence the six principles are, (1) that the Court has an unfettered discretion; (2) that the onus is always on the plaintiff; (3) it is most relevant to look at how promptly the application was made after the claimant became aware of her rights and what were the background circumstances; (4) it is usually relevant as to whether there were any negotiations before the formal summons was filed; it is relevant to consider whether the estate has been distributed; and, would a refusal to extend the time leave the claimant without redress against anybody, such as her legal advisers? 
I considered these six principles in Massie versus Laundy 7 February 1986. I there commented that the "Salmon six", if I can call them that, were stricter than the local requirements and were probably a result of the history of the legislation in England. I said in that case: "What then does 'sufficient cause' mean within [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s16.html) of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/)? ... one looks at the same factors as were dealt with in cases under the old Act, which include the following: 
Is the reason for making a late claim sufficient? 
Would the beneficiaries under the will be unacceptably prejudiced if the time were extended? 
Has there been any unconscionable conduct on either side, which would enter into the equation?" 
In subsequent judgments those principles have been applied. However, if an application to extend time is made independently of the main application for relief under the Act, another factor is to what degree one has to assess the probabilities of success. These principles have been followed by me ever since and also by Hodgson J, and the latest manifestation of this is Warren v
McKnight <case>; [(1996) 40 NSWLR 390.] Powell JA has always doubted them see Degura
Mercieca 28 August 1988 unreported. His Honour's most recent judgment on the matter is a judgment of the Court of Appeal in De Winter versus Johnstone August 1995 unreported. In De Winter's case the other Judges were
Sheller and Cole JJA. Sheller JA appears to have accepted the principles, which Master McLaughlin had applied in that case, which were based originally on Massie versus Laundy. He, however, came to a different result on the merits than the other two Judges. Cole JA did not make any adverse comments on the way the Master had approached the matter. As I have said, Powell JA took a different view on the principles. His Honour, however, made it clear, I think, that what he was saying was his own personal view and not the view of the
Court. Accordingly, it seems to me one still applies those principles.

The matter of extension of time was dealt with by the Full Court of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia in Clayton versus Aust [(1983) 9 WAR ]
where the Court applied some of the Salmon six without really dealing with the principles that had been developed in New South Wales. They did, however, seem to apply those principles rather benignly to a person who had not moved with any great speed to press his claim.

In Re Nassim <case>; [[1984] VR 51](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20VR%2051 "View LawCiteRecord" ) Nicholson J, when a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria, applied the
Guskett rules. The court seemed almost to go as far as to say that where the claim was particularly strong the extension of time should be granted, notwithstanding most other facts, because otherwise there would be a substantial injustice. This seems to hark back to the view of Powell JA that there are really only two matters to consider, that is, first, whether there are acceptable reasons for the delay and, secondly, what is the justice of the case. However, at 56 his Honour stated that the mere lack of knowledge of a material fact, namely, the size and extent of the estate, had never been thought by the Court in the past to have been an acceptable reason but surely it was capable of being such a reason.

A few months later Re Lauer <case>; [[1984] VR 180] was decided. Because that decision had been reserved for thirteen months, there was no reference to Re Nassim, which had been argued and decided in the meantime. Young CJ said in Re Lauer at 185 that the mere fact that the applicant's financial position had deteriorated cannot, of itself, be a ground for granting an extension of time under the Act nor could the mere fact that the value of the estate had been inflated beyond what might have been expected at the date of the testator's death.

The High Court dealt with the matter in Neil versus Nott <case>; [(1984) 68 ALJR 509.] That was a case where there was a four month delay and an applicant in person applied for an extension of time, but the single Judge and the Full Court of Victoria refused to extend the time. The High Court allowed the appeal and granted the extension. At 511, the five Judges of the High
Court said that whilst they could not identify any particular error of principle in the Court below, prima facie illness and poverty of an applicant were sufficient to entitle a person to a number of indulgences to allow consideration of his moral claim. (Perhaps the words "moral claim" are interesting in view of the fact that the High Court in Singer versus Berghouse <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 201] said that was irrelevant). Again, this approach shows a rather benign view of extension of time applicants.

The present case is, to my mind, a borderline one. If one were looking at the merits, one has a situation of a widow, who has been a wife for 46 years, who does not own her own house. There is a $4,000,000 estate (though I must say the figures in the affidavits are very rubbery because I have never been told the basis of the probate valuations), but on the basis of there being a $4,000,000 estate, the plaintiff widow received $700,000, the defendant daughter $1,700,000 and each of the defendant grandchildren $780,000. A situation where a person gives his widow after 46 years less than he gives his grandchildren, where she has contributed to the estate, shows that the application has a very real chance of success. So, bearing in mind the factors that I have outlined and looking at the general question as to where does the justice lie in granting or not granting the extension, what should the Court do? 
I think essentially the uncontradicted evidence shows that up until late 1994, the plaintiff had no intention of making an application. It is almost certainly the case that she did not know that there was a right to make an application, but even if she had known, she had no motivation to do so. She had assurances from her family that her possession of the property at
Riverwood was secure. She had income flowing to her from the estate investments and she had about $230,000 of her own.

However, in the second half of 1994 severe arguments broke out between the plaintiff and the first defendant. It is impossible to work out who was at fault and the probabilities are that both ladies underestimated the emotional pressure that the other was under and said things that they might otherwise not have said.

The first defendant was going through the throes of a separation and an argument over property with her former husband, which was not resolved until
May 1995. The effect of these arguments was that the plaintiff felt abandoned by her family and that she should not rely on the loose arrangements that were previously in place. The matter came to a head when the plaintiff wanted some of the property sold and the first defendant felt that she was being unreasonable about this and really wanted cash money so that she could give some of those cash moneys to some English friends.

The first defendant had some emotional objection to selling part of the property because of the significance it had in her family. The parties were putting pressure on each other. They moved from a relationship of affection to a relationship of outward hostility and the whole scenario changed. Other things which might in the normal course of events have caused no problem, such as the irritation that the plaintiff now felt when the grandchildren would call at the Riverwood premises to go to the shed, became far more significant than they had been.

In January and February 1995, the plaintiff consulted a solicitor but even then, as the letter from her solicitor, which I have already set out, makes clear, she was holding back to put pressure on her daughter to deal with her request for more cash moneys.

Initially it appeared that there was a possible fault on behalf of the solicitors for the plaintiff in not bringing on this application earlier. The full evidence now shows that there was no fault on behalf of any solicitor who acted for the plaintiff in the delay involved in this case, and I think that this should be stated.

Although it could be said that the change of scenario had presented a different situation to what was applicable in the eighteen months after the deceased's death, when one looks at the way in which cases like Lauer have been decided, that sort of change in circumstances is not usually considered enough to overcome a prime facie rule that people must bring their applications in time.

Mr Rundle referred me to a decision of the High Court in Brisbane South
Regional Health Authority versus Taylor <case>; [(1996) 70 ALJR 866] on the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/), but, with respect, that is quite beside the point because in the instant case it is both the Act, which gives a statutory right, and the same Act, which deals with the time in which that statutory right must be exercised, and so it is a much stronger case for the first defendant than the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/) case to which Mr
Rundle referred.

I have tossed the matter around in my mind for quite some time, but it seems to me that the way the case was approached in Lauer shows that in all the circumstances of this case, the alteration of the picture, because of family arguments at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995, is insufficient to amount to sufficient facts within [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/s16.html) and accordingly the application to extend time should be refused.

The matter is actually more complicated than that. As is regrettably becoming more and more common in this sort of case, I have been given rubbery figures as to the value of the estate. I say this because the fourth column of the table I set out above shows such a decrease of "real" value of the property as when the application was heard from the probate valuation to make me very suspicious of the original figure. Very often probate figures these days are given on a valuer's estimates to the solicitors and sometimes one suspects that they are inflated so that capital gains tax will be lessened in the future. Whether that was the situation in the present case, I do not know, but, as I say, I have acted on what I feel are rubbery figures.

The first defendant says that the estate has been fully administered. This is very hard to believe. There is, however, evidence in Exhibit DX09 that some of the real estate has been distributed in specie. So far as the house at
Riverwood is concerned, the Certificate of Title shows that is in now in the name of the plaintiff and the first defendant as joint tenants. No one showed me the transmission application, even though the file of Mr Chicken, the solicitor who acted for the estate, was in Court. All I can assume is that it must have been an executor's transmission application and that the title is in the name of the executors. If so, this property has not been distributed and is still part of the actual estate.

Apart from the bald assertion in the first defendant's first affidavit that the estate has been fully administrated, there is no evidence to show that the shares have been distributed. The significance of this is that under [s (5)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s28.html) of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/), if the property has been distributed, not only have people seeking an extension of time to show sufficient cause, they have actually to show special circumstances. It follows that if the property had been distributed, then, as
I find the plaintiff has failed the lesser test, I would have no doubt at all that the plaintiff had not made out special circumstances under [s (5)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s28.html)
However, for some odd reason, the point was never argued.

The next matter is what would I have done had I extended the time. I think I need to deal with that because if there is an appeal and if the appeal is allowed, some other judicial officer will otherwise have to start again from scratch. Even though all these people appear to be fairly wealthy, there is no reason why they should have to go back to taws.

As I have said, the way in which the deceased has disposed of his $4,000,000 of itself shows that the widow has received far less than the community would expect a widow, who had been married for 46 years, should have received. She has no home that she can call her own. She has merely a quarter interest, and perhaps now she is protected by the estoppels that there have been undertakings given to her that she will not be disturbed, but that does not really help her to a great extent.

She is a very active lady, but she is a lady of 80 and especially if there are continued hassles at home it is far more likely than not that within the next five to ten years she will want to sell the property and move to somewhere else. If she does, she will only receive about $120,000 on the probate valuation, and even with her other property she may find difficulty in obtaining an interest in a retirement village or a substitute home unit and still giving herself some money to spare.

The first defendant is a millionairess, as a result of the estate, and appears to be wealthy in her own right. The grandchildren, who are 18 and 20, are well on their way to their first million dollars, if they do not already have their first million. They appear to have no affection for their grandmother at all, and she just cannot depend on them to give her the support that people normally expect from their family.

The community, I think, would have considered that the provision for the plaintiff of a quarter interest in the house and other property of the value of $580,000 in a $4,000,000 estate, was quite inadequate.

The plaintiff's needs are relatively modest. She needs a home. She said she would like an air-conditioned car, money to do up the house, a fund so she could pay for someone to help her in the house and help her in the garden and have a holiday - relatively modest needs.

I have endeavoured to suggest to the parties that they might like to settle this case out of their millions but that has been to no avail.

Had I found that I could make an order, because I extended the time, I would have made the order which Mr Ellison for the plaintiff sought, that is, that there be a fee simple in the house and a legacy of $400,000 in lieu of the present provision made for the plaintiff in the will. I would have done that even taking into account that the plaintiff has some $230,000 in the bank. As for this, the plaintiff says that she spent some of the money, but where a plaintiff comes to a Court without the documentation as to her current bank books, one assumes that she has still got what she told the Court she had last time.

However, because the application was made too late, the application should be dismissed with costs. I will stand the matter down to 2 pm so that counsel can consider these reasons.

At 2 pm 
This morning I gave reasons why I should not extend time for making an application by the plaintiff under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/). I indicated that had I extended time I would have made an order in her favour, and I indicated that I thought it was appropriate that the plaintiff, having lost the proceedings, should pay the costs. This afternoon the question of costs has been argued.

Mr Ellison submits that there should be no order for costs or each party should pay her or his own costs and, in particular, costs of the digging for the treasure trove should not be borne by the plaintiff. Mr Rundle submits that the order I contemplated this morning is correct. Mr Robinson for the grandchildren, has made some submissions as to how his costs should be paid.

There is a tension between <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), which gives the Court a judicial discretion as to costs and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html) of the [Family Provision Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/), which partly deals with costs in that it makes limitations on orders against the estate. A very real question is whether the two can be read together or whether [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html) is intended to cover the field. Although it is unclear, it seems to me that the appropriate way of approaching the problem is that <case> continues to apply, save as it is modified by [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html)
Indeed, <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) actually says that it operates "subject to any other Act".

Accordingly, the general principle that the successful party is entitled to her or his costs from the unsuccessful party continues to apply. Are there any reasons why that general principle should not apply in the instant case? 
I cannot really see any. The matter does involve an estate, but that of itself should not be a reason why the general rule does not apply. The cost of the dig for the treasure trove was something, however, which I do believe is part of the general administration of the estate and should not be borne by the unsuccessful plaintiff. Subject to those costs coming out of the estate, I think that as between the plaintiff and the first defendant the order that I contemplated making this morning was correct.

So far as the second and third defendants are concerned, they were not necessary parties to the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) proceedings because they never alleged that their mother was not fully and vigorously defending the proceedings in their interest. They were, however, necessary parties in the construction suit. The normal rule in the [Family
Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) application would be that they would pay their own costs of protecting any interest they may wish to protect but in the construction suit they would be entitled to their costs out of the fund in dispute. As things turned out, the construction suit was settled.

Mr Robinson did participate in the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) application. It is very difficult to work out an order for costs that will just not cause more complications and more costs along the line. Really Mr
Robinson's clients should be entitled to costs of the construction suit as against the assets still held by the estate, which are affected by the word "until" in the will, which is the Riverwood house and the tools. They should pay their own costs of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) aspect.
However, to avoid complications, it seems to me that the proper order is that the costs of the second and third defendants be paid out of the estate and that the executors, when paying that order, should resort to that property which is still held by them which was affected by the word "until" when used in the deceased's will, with liberty to apply.

So that the orders are:
That the proceedings are dismissed.
That the first defendant's costs, other than the costs associated with the retrieval of the treasure trove, be paid by the plaintiff.
That the costs of all parties retrieving the treasure trove be paid out of the treasure trove.
That the costs of the second and third defendants be paid out of the estate, the executors resorting first to the assets still held by them as executors which were affected by the word "until" used in the deceased's will.
Liberty to apply.
The exhibits will be retained for 28 days or until any appeal, whichever is the later.
