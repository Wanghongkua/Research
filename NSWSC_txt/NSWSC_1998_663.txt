Application of F O Fischl Matter No 4326/98 [1998] NSWSC 663 (3 December )

Last Updated: 12 January 1999 
APPLICATION OF F O FISCHL /98 December 1998 
Hodgson CJ in EQ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff Mr. Fischl is liquidator of Hogbin Wade Pty. Limited. Following the winding up of that company, there is an amount of about $11 million to be distributed to shareholders. Of that sum, just under $700,000.00 is to be distributed to James Llewellyn Palmer who is a minor of just over 17 years of age. The liquidator is concerned that if he pays this amount to the minor or to a parent of the minor, he may not get a discharge and there might be subsequently a claim brought against him when Mr. Palmer attains his majority. 
What is sought in the summons is an order directing that the moneys payable to
Mr. Palmer be paid to an authorised trustee company or alternatively paid to such other person and on such terms as the Court thinks fit, and an order that payment in accordance with that order be a sufficient and binding discharge.

The minor has appeared by a tutor, namely his mother, and substantially consents to orders of that nature being made.

Short Minutes have been submitted providing an order that a distribution to
Mr. Palmer be presumptively binding on him, and a further order that, provided the plaintiff pays the distribution to the Permanent Trustee Company Limited to be held on trust for the minor until such time as he attain 18 years of age, the plaintiff is discharged from any claim of action by the minor and that such payment is a binding receipt by the minor.

I am not certain that either of those orders are precisely appropriate. The question of civil acts being presumptively binding on minors is dealt with in s.19 of the Minors (Property & [Contracts)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca125/), which is in the following terms: . Where a minor participates in a civil act and his participation is for his benefit at the time of his participation, the civil act is presumptively binding on him.

That section only applies where a minor participates in a civil act, and the relevant civil act in this case would have to be something of the nature of an acknowledgment of receipt of property, or a discharge or acquittance, those being two of the cases of civil act referred to in the definition in [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca125/s6.html) of the
Act. Where what is contemplated is payment to a trustee company on behalf of the minor, it does not seem that that kind of civil act by the minor is apt or that it will actually take place.

Section 50 of the Minors (Property & [Contracts)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca125/) is in the following terms: (1) Where a minor is beneficially entitled at law or in equity to property, the Supreme Court may, on such terms as the Court thinks fit, make orders authorising a person, either generally or in any particular instance: to make any disposition of the property; to receive the proceeds of disposition of the property; to call for a disposition of the property to the person so authorised or as he directs; to receive the income of the property; to sue for and recover any chose in action comprised in the property; to invest the property; or to apply the capital or income of the property for the benefit of the minor.

The Court shall not make an order under this section unless it appears to the Court that the order is for the benefit of the minor.

Pursuant to that section, the Supreme Court may make an order authorising the liquidator in this case to pay the distribution in question to a trustee company, it being clear that such payment would be for the benefit of the minor. However, the section does not specifically provide that such payment would be a discharge and binding although it is very difficult to see that any claim could be brought against a person arising out of payment of money authorised by the Supreme Court pursuant to s.50.

In further support of the appropriateness of making that kind of order under s.50, Mr. Pape for the liquidator has referred me to [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/s47.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/), and also to [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/s48.html) of that Act. Those sections are in the following terms: (1) Where any money is held in trust for a minor, or for a person who is unable to give a good discharge or cannot be found, the trustee may pay the money to the public trustee or, except where the money is held in trust for a person who cannot be found, a trustee company, and on such payment shall furnish the public trustee or trustee company, as the case may be, with a copy of the trust instrument, or where there is not such instrument, then with a statutory declaration setting forth the trusts on which the money is held and shall also furnish such information as to the disability or identity of the person for whom such money is held in trust as the public trustee or trustee company, as the case may be, may require.

The public trustee or trustee company shall hold the money in trust for the minor or for such other person in accordance with the trusts affecting the same.

Where the money is held in trust for a minor or an insane or incapable person, the public trustee or trustee company may at his or its discretion exercise in respect of such money the powers conferred upon the public trustee or trustee company, as the case may be, by this or any other Act in respect of moneys held in trust for a minor.

This section applies to trusts created either before or after the commencement of this Act. (1) The receipt in writing of trustees or of a sole trustee for any money, securities, or other personal property or effects payable, transferable, or deliverable to them or him under any trust or power shall be a sufficient discharge for the same, and shall effectually exonerate the person paying, transferring, or delivering the same from seeing to the application or being answerable for any loss or misapplication thereof.

This section applies to trusts created either before or after the commencement of this Act.

In my opinion, the analogy of [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/s47.html) is one which suggests the appropriateness of an order under s.50 of the Minors (Property & [Contracts)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca125/), such as is sought in this case. However, it is not entirely clear that s.48 would then apply to give a complete discharge. Section 48 applies where the property in question is payable, transferable or deliverable to the trustee "under any trust or power" and it is not entirely clear that an authorisation of the
Supreme Court under s.50 of the Minors (Property & [Contracts)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca125/) would be a "power" within that section.

However, it is plain that the Permanent Trustee Company Limited would consent to becoming a trustee for the minor in respect of this property, and in my opinion, the Court may, in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, appoint the
Permanent Trustee Company Limited to be a trustee of that property, and then authorise the payment of it to the Permanent Trustee Company Limited under s.50. That payment will then not only be authorised by the Court, but also be a payment of money payable to the trustee company under a trust, namely that constituted by the Court order, so that the liquidator will have the additional protection of [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/s48.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/).

Beyond making those orders, I do not think it is appropriate for this Court to order that what is done will be a discharge of the liquidator's responsibility. The liquidator will have substantial protection from the sections of the Acts to which I have referred, and I do not think it would be appropriate for the Court to go beyond that.

I make the following orders.

Upon the provision by the Permanent Trustee Company Limited to the liquidator of a written consent to such appointment, I appoint Permanent Trustee Company
Limited trustee of such distributions to which James Llewellyn Palmer is entitled to receive in respect of the 42,000 shares held by him in Hogbin Wade
Pty. Limited (In Liquidation) to be held on trust for James Llewellyn Palmer until such time as he attains 18 years of age.

Pursuant to s.50 of the Minors (Property & Contracts) Act 1970 I authorise the plaintiff to pay to Permanent Trustee Company Limited, to be held on the trust referred to in the previous order, any such distribution.

I note that Mr. Eddy, solicitor for James Palmer, undertakes to the Court within 7 days to file a consent from Prudence Reynolds and a certificate of no conflict of interests, and also a copy of Permanent Trustee Company Limited's consent to be trustee.

I order that the plaintiff's costs of and incidental to these proceedings be paid out of the moneys payable to James Llewellyn Palmer.

The exhibits may be returned.
