Lawson versus Dunlevy  
Medium Neutral Citation: <case>  
Hearing Date(s): /12/2011  
Decision Date: February 2012  
Jurisdiction: 
Civil  
Before: 
Garling J  
Decision: 
The Court declares that insofar as the grant of conditional bail to the plaintiff required him to enter into an agreement in accordance with the [Bail
Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer, such obligation is unlawful. 
The Court orders that insofar as, and to the extent that, the grant of conditional bail obliges the plaintiff to enter into an agreement in accordance with the [Bail Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer, the grant of conditional bail is quashed. 
The Court orders that the second defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.  
Catchwords: 
CRIMINAL LAW - Bail - Whether bail condition imposing requirement to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer unlawful - Does not comply with legislative purpose - Does not promote effective law enforcement -
Deterring breach of bail does not fulfill purpose of protection and welfare of community of specially affected person - Consequences of non-compliance with bail condition do not contemplate deterrence conditions - "Breath test" term vague and meaningless - More onerous than required - Unlawful  
JUDGMENT 
On 17 August 2011, Magistrate Dunlevy, the first defendant, continued a grant of conditional bail to Jeremy Lawson, the plaintiff, during a hearing at the Local Court at Wilcannia. 
One of the bail conditions imposed was that Mr Lawson was "...not to consume alcohol for any reason, and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer."
On 14 November 2011, Mr Lawson commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court seeking, pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), to have orders made which have the effect of: declaring so much of the condition as required submission to a breath test as unlawful; and quashing that part of the condition.
No challenge was made to that part of the Condition that required Mr Lawson to refrain from consuming alcohol for any reason. 
For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the imposition of a bail condition which required Mr Lawson to submit to a breath test is unlawful and relief ought be granted. 
Accepted Facts 
The following facts were not challenged before me, and were accepted by both Mr Lawson and Constable Monique Gowans, the second defendant, who was the active contradictor in the proceedings. Magistrate Dunlevy took no active part in the proceedings and filed a submitting appearance. 
On 18 June 2011, police officers arrested Mr Lawson for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to [s 59(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s59.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The victim of the assault was alleged to be Stephanie Hunter, with whom Mr Lawson was living with in a domestic relationship. They have five children aged between 1 and 10 years. 
Mr Lawson was, after his arrest, taken by Constable Gowans to the Wilcannia Police Station. There he was granted bail by an appropriately authorised police officer, which was conditional upon Mr Lawson entering into an agreement "...to observe specified requirements as to my conduct whilst at liberty on bail ..."
There were three specified requirements: that Mr Lawson reside at a nominated address; that Mr Lawson was "... not to consume alcohol for any reason, and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer "; and that Mr Lawson was to abide by the conditions set out in the Apprehended
Violence Order which had been made that day.
Mr Lawson was bailed to appear in the Local Court at Wilcannia on 21 September 2011. 
On 17 August 2011, the Local Court was sitting in Wilcannia. Application was made to Magistrate Dunlevy to vary Mr Lawson's bail conditions so as to delete from them the words "... and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer ... " which I will, for convenience, refer to as the " impugned condition ". 
Magistrate Dunlevy, in an ex tempore judgment, which was, if I may say so with respect, most pellucid, declined to vary the bail conditions and continued Mr Lawson's conditional bail on the same terms and conditions which the police had imposed. 
In this Court, Ms Felicity Graham, a solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service, affirmed an affidavit on 11 November 2011 which included the following matters, which were neither objected to nor challenged by cross-examination: the Local Court Magistrate who presides in Broken Hill, Wentworth,
Wilcannia and Balranald, regularly imposes a bail condition requiring submission to breath testing by police; authorised police officers in the Barrier and Deniliquin Local Area
Commands also regularly impose such a condition when granting bail; and the condition is routinely re-imposed by the authorised justice or magistrate who presides at the first and subsequent court appearances.
In the Police Facts Sheet, created by one of the arresting police officers Senior Constable Michael Scharf, a request was made that Mr Lawson be placed on "alcohol bail", an expression used to describe the condition imposed, part of which is challenged. The use of this shorthand expression, confirms the evidence of Ms Graham that this condition is imposed regularly, as a matter of routine and in a standard form. [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) 
Bail is a statutory concept, the basis of which is to be found in the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/). Whether or not the impugned condition is permissible, can only be determined by a consideration of the legislation and the established principles by which the legislation is interpreted. 
Before identifying the relevant provision of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) , it is appropriate to restate the central principles of statutory interpretation which are engaged in this case: the starting point for statutory interpretation is to engage in a purposive construction, that is, to prefer a construction which promotes the purpose and/or object underlying an Act: Carr versus Western Australia  <case>; <case>- <case> per
Gleeson CJ; the primary object of legislative interpretation is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all of the provisions of the statute: Project Blue Sky Inc versus Australian
Broadcasting Authority  <case>; <case> and [71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; and it is well established that a statute should not be assumed to abrogate existing fundamental rights in the absence of clear language: Gifford v
Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd [[2003] HCA 33] at [[36]](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2003%5d%20HCA%2033#para36) per McHugh J;
Harrison versus Melhem <case>; <case>- <case> per
Basten JA, Spigelman CJ agreeing at [2].
It is appropriate now to identify the relevant provisions of the legislation. Bail is to be granted in accordance with the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) but only with respect to certain identified periods: [s 6.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s6.html) If bail is granted, then the person is entitled to be released from custody (if appropriate) and is entitled to remain at liberty until required to appear before a court: [s 7.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html)
When bail is conditional, then the right to remain at liberty is subject to compliance with the conditions which are imposed, because where a condition is apparently breached, then the person may be arrested: [s 50.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s50.html)
The authority for police to grant bail, and the procedures to be followed are set forth in [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p3) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . An authorised police officer may only grant bail in accordance with the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) : [s 17(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s17.html) The authority for a court to grant bail is found in [Part 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p4) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . [Part 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p5) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) contains provisions that apply to bail whether granted by police or by a court. Of importance to a grant of bail, are the terms of [s 32(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html) which provide for the criteria and matters to be considered in granting bail. Shortly put these criteria are: the probability that the person will appear in court when next required: [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html); the interests of the person: [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html); and protection of a particular person, or the community generally: [s (1)(b1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html); [s (1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html)
In considering the protection of the community, the likelihood of a person committing any serious offence whilst on bail, can only be considered if the court reaches the view that the person is likely to commit one or more serious offences, and that likelihood is sufficiently serious, when considered with the likely consequences, as to outweigh: "...the person's general right to be at liberty ": [s 32(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html) This is a statutory confirmation (if one were needed) of the general right of an individual to be at liberty. However, as a matter of the common law, there was no such general right once a person had been arrested. Hence the need for the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
It is to be observed that these matters as set out in [s 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s32.html) constitute the entirety of the matters that a court (or an authorised police officer) is entitled to take into account in determining whether to grant bail. 
Division 3 of [Part 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p5) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) deals with conditions which may be imposed. [Sections 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s36.html), [36A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s36a.html) and [36B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s36b.html) list the only conditions that can be imposed when conditional bail is granted. 
Importantly for the issues raised in this case, [s 37](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html) provides: " 37 Restrictions on imposing bail conditions 
Bail shall be granted unconditionally unless the authorised officer or court is of the opinion that one or more conditions should be imposed for the purpose of: promoting effective law enforcement, or the protection and welfare of any specially affected person, or the protection and welfare of the community, or reducing the likelihood of future offences being committed by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of an accused person.

Conditions shall not be imposed that are any more onerous for the accused person than appear to the authorised officer or court to be required: by the nature of the offence, or for the protection and welfare of any specially affected person, or by the circumstances of the accused person."
In the circumstances of this case, the final purpose listed in [s 37(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html) is not said by either party to be relevant. No question arises about the promotion of treatment or rehabilitation of the plaintiff by reference to the terms of the impugned condition. It can be put to one side. 
The central issue for determination is whether it can be said that the impugned condition is imposed for, and is capable of, fulfilling any one or more of the first three listed purposes. 
Before further considering that issue, it is appropriate to notice part of the Second Reading Speech of the Honourable Frank Walker MLA, the then Attorney-General, when on 14 December 1978, he said that the Bill which became the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), was being introduced as a result of a decision to " codify the law as to bail ". 
He said (at page 2016) that: "The basic object of setting bail is to ensure that an unconvicted accused person appears in court in respect of the offence for which bail is being considered. As such, it is the primary and most important factor to be considered in any bail application."
The Attorney-General noted that non-compliance with bail conditions was dealt with in [Part 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p7) of the Bill. He said: "Part VII is concerned with non-compliance with undertakings and conditions.
In order to ensure that accused persons released on non-financial bail conditions will appear and that legitimate community interests are otherwise protected, the Bill contains a number of important provisions in clauses 50 to ."
He concludes the Second Reading Speech with the following remarks: "These bail provisions are important measures which will substantially improve the administration of criminal justice in New South Wales. They attempt to strike the necessary delicate balance between the right of an unconvicted accused person to be at liberty while awaiting determination of the charge on the one hand, and the protection and welfare of the community on the other...
Although it is perfectly true that the community must be protected against dangerous offenders, one must not lose sight of the circumstances, first that when bail is being considered, one is confronted with an alleged crime and an unconvicted accused person, and second, the liberty of the subject is one of the most fundamental and treasured concepts in our society." 
Is the Impugned Condition authorised by the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/)? 
It is convenient to restate here two matters: 
It is accepted by both parties that it is a valid condition of bail to restrict a person from consuming any alcohol; 
The impugned condition is restricted to the following words: "...and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer."
In this and many like cases, as the consumption of alcohol has been directly connected with the commission of the offences with which the plaintiff was charged, the imposition of a ban on the consumption of alcohol can be said to fulfil the purpose of the protection and welfare of either the specially affected person or the community. 
Considering the three purposes, it is to be observed that they have been expressed separately. It is appropriate therefore, to give them separate consideration and meaning. A condition can fulfil more than one purpose, but each purpose should be understood as being addressed to different circumstances. 
In submission, the second defendant contended that the purpose of the impugned condition was two-fold, namely: to provide a ready means for the detection of the breach of the condition of bail requiring the plaintiff to refrain from consuming any alcohol; and to provide a deterrent to the plaintiff so as to ensure that he complied with the bail condition, by refraining from drinking alcohol.
A question arises as to whether either or both of these purposes fall within any of the three purposes contemplated by [s 37.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html) 
Law Enforcement 
I accept that the purpose of " promoting effective law enforcement " is a concept that is rather more elastic than concise, rather more ambulatory than fixed and generally protean like. In addition to the well known concept of preventing the commission of crime and the arrest of offenders, or else those suspected of committing crimes, it would also include ensuring that a person attends court when required and preventing the person from fleeing the jurisdiction, thereby attempting to avoid prosecution and sentence. It may also include conditions of bail, such as designated residence and compliance with supervision by a nominated person, because such conditions are designed to achieve these ends, and these ends promote law enforcement. 
I observe that the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) does not make a breach of a condition of bail an offence except in one clearly defined circumstance. A person may be arrested for breaching a condition of bail and be brought before a court, but they are then to be dealt with by being released on original bail or by the original bail being revoked: [s 50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s50.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . It is only an offence if a person fails to appear, and then only without reasonable excuse: [s 51](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s51.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
In the context of the impugned condition, which is one as to the conduct of an individual whilst on bail, the mechanism envisaged by the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) is that the person seeking bail "... enter[s] into an agreement to observe specified requirements as to his or her conduct while at liberty on bail ... ": [s 36(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s36.html) [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
The agreement does not create any obligation which is enforced by the criminal law. A breach of it is addressed by a revocation of bail, or else a continuation of bail. No question arises, at least directly, as to the enforcement of any specific law or the law generally. 
A condition which is designed to enable a more ready proof of a breach of the agreement, or else to deter a breach of this agreement does not either directly or indirectly address any issue of law enforcement. 
In those circumstances, it does not seem to me that either of the two purposes stated by the second defendant to justify the impugned condition fall within the purpose of " promoting effective law enforcement ": [s 37(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html) [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
Protection and Welfare 
A condition that restricts the consumption of alcohol can fulfil either of the legislated purposes dealing with the protection and welfare of either a specially affected person or of the community generally. 
The context in which it is necessary to consider these purposes is that although a person is charged with the commission of a criminal offence, it is likely that they will appear when required and so they should not remain in custody pending their next court appearance, but rather should be released on bail. 
A determination then needs to be made as to whether a particular specially affected person may need protection or else whether the community generally is in need of protection, and hence the person's bail ought be subject to a conduct requirement. 
It seems to me that the concept of protection as it is used in [s 37](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html), is protection from the conduct which involves the commission of further offences, or else which may involve a threat, a potential threat to the physical and mental well-being of an identified individual, but which may fall short of the commission of an offence. 
The impugned condition cannot fulfil these objectives. Nor could a condition such as an obligation to wear a specified type or colour of clothing that would enable ready detection of, or deterrence from breach of bail conditions fall within such a purpose. 
Likewise, the impugned condition, the purpose of which is to deter a breach of a condition of bail, or else to make the detection of a breach more readily established, does not fall within either of those purposes. 
For those reasons, I am not satisfied that that impugned condition is one which is permitted by [s 37](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html) as it does not comply with any of the purposes dictated by the legislation. 
Further Difficulties with the Impugned Condition 
There are three further reasons why I am satisfied that the condition is unlawful. [Part 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p7) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) deals with non-compliance with undertakings and conditions. As I have identified earlier, where a person is in breach of a condition of bail, the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) provides that they may be arrested, their original bail revoked or else they may be released on their original bail. If their original bail is revoked then new bail can be set. 
It is quite clear that the terms of [s 50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s50.html) are intended by the Legislature to deal with the course of action that would follow in the event of a breach of an undertaking or agreement that has been entered into. The method by which the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) achieves its intention is to require an individual to enter into an agreement, with or without conditions to comply with the bail undertaking. 
The penalty envisaged by a failure to comply with the bail agreement, or any condition of it, is that the person is brought before the Court and the question of bail is reconsidered, as would be the question of the imposition of any conditions. In other words, the Legislature places the responsibility of compliance with the bail undertaking on the individual, with the sanction that if they do not comply, the Court would reconsider the question of bail and any conditions. The ultimate sanction would be that the person has their liberty on bail terminated and they are remanded in custody. [Section 50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s50.html), which is contained within [Part 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p7) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) , does not contemplate the imposition of any deterrent upon a person subject to the bail undertaking or agreement other than that undertaking and the consequences of breach of that undertaking or any condition contemplated by [s 50.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s50.html)
It is not for the courts to fill a void left by the legislation and to impose a condition that deters a person from breaching their bail agreement. As I have said, the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) contemplates that the agreement will be adhered to or else the release of the person on bail will be put in jeopardy. 
The second reason which leads me to conclude that the impugned condition is unlawful, is that the terms of it are not capable of any enforcement because they are vague and, in a legal sense, meaningless. 
Central to the impugned condition, is the concept of a "breath test". But what is meant by the phrase a breath test? The phrase is not one known to the common law. It is only to be found in a defined way in a number of different statutes, none of which have any application in the context of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
It seems to me that those statutes fall within readily identifiable categories: those which affect the safety of the public, namely to test the alcohol consumption of: drivers of motor vehicles: [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic
Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/); rail safety staff; [Rail Safety (Drug and Alcohol Testing) Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/rsaatr2008426/) ; operators of marine craft: [Marine Safety Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/msa1998145/); drivers of passenger transport: [Passenger Transport (Drug and Alcohol
Testing) Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ptaatr2010547/); and those which affect the fitness for work of certain employees, namely: juvenile detention centre staff: [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/), [Children (Detention Centres) Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ccr2010351/); correctional centre staff: [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/), [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/cosr2008439/); and police officers: [Police Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pa199075/), [Police
Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/pr2008166/).
The term "breath test" is defined in each of these pieces of legislation. There is considerable similarity, although not precise identity, between these statutory definitions. Common to the statutory definitions is a definition of the device being used. The device is typically defined by reference to: "... a type approved by the Governor for the conduct of breath tests under the
Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act ".
In that particular legislation, the breath test is defined as one involving the use of a device which is of " ... a type approved by the Governor by order published in the Gazette" . In other legislation, the device is defined as including a device of a type "... that complies with the requirements of AS 3547 - 1997, Breath alcohol testing devices for personal use ... ". 
In these various pieces of legislation, the test is used for the detection, by way of a preliminary analysis at least, of the presence of alcohol in the blood of an individual. However, the breath test alone in each of these statutes is insufficient to determine that question with any finality or specificity. In order to determine the question of the actual amount of alcohol in a person's blood, generally the procedure required is that the person to whom a breath test has been administered is obliged to undertake a breath analysis test, administered by the use of a different device, often in a different location. Again, this is a statutorily defined test that includes provision for the certification of types of devices and operators, in order to comply with the statute. 
Of particular importance, where this is necessary for the purpose of the statute, the statutes also include provisions that give effect to the readings of the breath analysis machine and certificates that constitute admissible evidence and proof of the relevant reading. The detail of these statutory provisions is unnecessary to be recounted here, but such provisions as are typical can be found in Part 2, Division 7 of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act . 
It seems to me that without any form of definition, the words "breath test" as they are contained in the impugned condition, are meaningless. The test that can be undertaken by a police officer is not defined by the impugned condition itself, nor is it defined by reference to any piece of legislation. The concept is at large and could mean many different things to different people. 
There is a further final reason that the impugned condition is not valid. It is more onerous than required for the plaintiff, and thereby contrary to [s 37(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s37.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
The impugned condition does not call for any of the following: the police officer making the request to have a reasonable suspicion that the person has consumed alcohol; the specification of the location for, or the method of testing to which a person may be subject; the number of times in any one hour or on one day that a person can be requested to undergo a breath test; any connection between the result of a breath test and proof of the consumption of alcohol by the person subject to the bail condition.
The second defendant accepted that upon a proper interpretation of the impugned condition, an individual could be tested every 15 minutes for the entirety of a day. While this is an example that may be unlikely to be replicated in practice, it serves to demonstrate the onerous nature of the impugned condition, because there is no additional qualification or restriction contained within it which address any of the matters noted in the preceding paragraph. 
As well, arguably, the police requesting the person to undergo a breath test are not obliged to administer the test at the time when, and at the location where, the request is made, but rather are able to ask the person to whom they wish to administer the breath test to go to a different location, perhaps a police station, where the test would be administered. Yet there is no distance or location fixed by way of any words in the impugned condition, which would limit the police officer making the request. 
There is nothing in the impugned condition that would prevent a police officer requesting an individual to attend at a police station which is some kilometres from where that individual lives, in order to undergo the test. An individual without means of transport required to attend for the purpose specified, may be unable to do so, but may yet be in breach of the bail agreement, if they fail to comply with such a request. 
The example in the preceding three paragraphs may be highly unlikely to occur in everyday practice. And, it may be open to a person who does not comply with a request of the kind identified to contend that there has not been any breach of the impugned condition either, because the request was an unreasonable one, or else that they used their best endeavours to comply with the request. But this serves only to highlight that the impugned condition as stated: is far too broad, and is far more onerous than could possibly be required in the circumstances prevailing in the matter before Magistrate Dunlevy.
The impugned condition as framed, because of the reasons to which I have just referred is more onerous than the circumstances required and does not accord with the requirements of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) . 
Conclusion 
The impugned condition is unlawful and appropriate relief ought be granted. 
Orders 
The Court declares that insofar as the grant of conditional bail to the plaintiff required him to enter into an agreement in accordance with the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer, such obligation is unlawful.

The Court orders that insofar as, and to the extent that, the grant of conditional bail obliges the plaintiff to enter into an agreement in accordance with the [Bail Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer, the grant of conditional bail is quashed.

The Court orders that the second defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
