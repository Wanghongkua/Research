No. 030089/96 - Kennedy Miller Television Pty Ltd versus S J Lancken & Anor 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
These proceedings arise out of earlier proceedings in the Commercial Division of this Court and in the Court of Appeal, in which the plaintiff, Kennedy
Miller Television Pty Limited, recovered damages against ACN 003 075 394 Pty
Limited (formerly known as Nine Network Pty Limited). Nine was ordered to pay
Kennedy's costs of the proceedings at first instance and of the appeal. The costs were assessed by Mr S J Lancken, a costs assessor, who made a substantial reduction in Kennedy's claim both in relation to the hearing at first instance and the appeal.

In the present proceedings, Kennedy, as plaintiff, has joined Mr Lancken and
Nine as defendants, claiming an order in the nature of mandamus directing the assessor to provide reasons in writing for his determinations; and, further or in the alternative, a declaration that Mr Lancken is obliged to provide reasons in writing for his determinations.

Mr Lancken filed a submitting appearance.

Kennedy and Nine appeared by counsel on the hearing of the present summons.

Counsel appeared for the Attorney General and sought an order pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p8) r 8 that the Attorney be added as a party. Alternatively, counsel for the
Attorney sought to appear amicus curiae. As a further alternative, counsel for the Attorney appeared also for Mr Lancken and, on his behalf, applied for leave to withdraw the conditional appearance and to file an unqualified appearance. The only role sought by counsel for the Attorney and Mr Lancken in the hearing of the proceedings before me was one of advancing argument against
Kennedy's case that Mr Lancken was required to give reasons for his assessment. In those circumstances, I deferred ruling on the standing which would be afforded to the Attorney or Mr Lancken. That will be dealt with later in this judgment. Meantime, counsel for the Attorney has had a full opportunity to make submissions on the merits of Kennedy's claim and has done so.

A not insubstantial sum of money is involved. The damages recovered were in the order of $8m. The costs claimed in relation to the hearing at first instance - which included a reference and occupied some eleven and a half days - were $654,652 and, in relation to the appeal, $35,787. The bills of costs and the notices of objection contained extensive argument. The assessor sought further particulars of the claims. These were provided. The parties were invited by the assessor to make written submissions. They advised that they relied on the argument in the documentation to which I have referred. The assessor assessed the costs to be paid at $426,890 in respect of the hearing at first instance (being a reduction by about $227,000) and at $23,158 in respect of the appeal (being a reduction of about $12,000). The total reduction was about $240,000.

The assessor was asked to provide reasons for his determinations. He declined.

The statute 
The relevant statutory provisions are to be found in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p11),
Division 6, of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).
Pursuant to Sub-division 1, where a client is given a bill of costs or an order for costs is made, application may be made to the Supreme Court for an assessment. The court refers such an application to a costs assessor. The assessor may require the production of documents and require further particulars. The assessor must give the persons interested a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions and must give due consideration to any such submissions. The assessor is not bound by rules of evidence. Costs assessors are solicitors or barristers of at least five years standing appointed by the Chief Justice of the Court.

Sub-division 2 relates to assessments of bills of costs generally. By [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208a.html), the assessor must consider whether or not it was reasonable to carry out the work to which the costs relate, whether or not the work was carried out in a reasonable manner, and the fairness and reasonableness of the amount of the costs in relation to that work. The assessor is to determine the application by confirming the bill of costs or by substituting an amount that, in his or her opinion, is a fair and reasonable amount.
 [Section
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208b.html) specifies additional matters to be considered including the skill, labour and responsibility displayed, the complexity, novelty or difficulty of the matter, the quality of the work done, and the time within which the work was required to be done.

By [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208c.html) a costs assessor is to decline to assess a bill of costs if the disputed costs are subject to a costs agreement complying with the statute and the costs agreement specifies the amount of the costs or the dispute relates only to the rate specified in the agreement. The section does not apply if the assessor determines that the costs agreement is unjust. [Section
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208d.html) makes provision for such a determination and regulates the approach to such a determination.

Sub-division 3 relates specifically to the assessment of party/party costs.
[Section
F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208f.html) provides that the costs assessor must consider whether or not it was reasonable to carry out the work to which the costs relate, and what is a fair and reasonable amount of costs for the work concerned. [Section
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208g.html) prescribes additional matters which may be considered in relation to the assessment of party and party costs. These include the skill, labour and responsibility displayed, the complexity, novelty or difficulty of the matter, the quality of the work done, whether the level of expertise was appropriate to the nature of the work, the time within which the work was required to be done and the outcome of the matter.
 [Section
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208h.html) provides that an assessor is not to take into account any costs agreement in assessing costs payable as a result of a court order.

Sub-division 4 deals with the enforcement of assessments and appeals. [Section
J](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208j.html) provides that, on making a determination, the costs assessor is to issue to each party a certificate that sets out the determination. The amount certified may be recovered as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.

By [s
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208k.html) the determination is binding on the parties and no appeal lies in respect of the determination except as provided by the legislation.
 [Section
L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208l.html) provides that a party who is dissatisfied with a decision of a costs assessor as to a matter of law may appeal to the Supreme Court. The Court may affirm the decision or may make such determination in relation to the application as, in its opinion, should have been made by the assessor, or may remit its decision on the question to the costs assessor and order the assessor to re- determine the application. On a re-determination by the assessor, fresh evidence, or evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence received at the original proceedings, may be given. (In effect, the hearing on a re-determination is a hearing de novo.) [Section
M](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208m.html) provides for a general appeal, but only by leave. A party to an application may seek leave of the Supreme Court to appeal to the Court against an application. Such a general appeal is specified as an appeal by way of a new hearing; fresh evidence, or evidence in addition to or in substitution for the evidence received at the original proceedings, may be given. (Thus, the hearing of such an appeal is also, in effect, a hearing de novo.) 
By [s
N](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208n.html), the assessor or the appellate court may suspend the operation of the determination or decision until the appeal is determined.
 [Section
NA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208na.html) provides that the assessor may be made a party to an appeal only by the Court.

The regulation 
In Pt 12 of the Act, <case> provides that the Governor may, on the recommendation of the Attorney General, make regulations not inconsistent with the Act. The Attorney General is required, unless the circumstances are exceptional, to give specified professional bodies an opportunity to express their views on the proposed regulation.

The Legal Profession Regulation 1994 includes cl 26D, which provides that, in making a determination pursuant to <case>, the costs assessor may have regard to the extent to which the determination of the amount of fair and reasonable party/party costs differs from the amount of those costs claimed in the application for assessment, whether or not either or both of the parties to the application have made a genuine attempt to agree, and whether or not a party to the application has unnecessarily delayed the determination.

By cl 26F, the assessor for the purposes of <case>, is to give due consideration to the information in the application and the information otherwise provided in accordance with the procedures laid down.

Clause 26I provides that a certificate under <case>, setting out an assessor's determination, is to contain the information specified in the clause. The information specified includes the amount of costs determined as being fair and reasonable; if the costs assessor declines to assess a bill of costs under s 208C, the basis for doing so; and, where the costs assessor determines pursuant to <case> that a term of a costs agreement is unjust, the basis for doing so.

There is no express provision in cl 26I or elsewhere in the code for the provision of reasons in the certificate, with the certificate or on request.

Legislative history [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p11) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), in its present form, was substituted by the Legal Profession Reform Act 1993 and subsequent amendments. The 1993 Act introduced a new scheme for the assessment of costs by costs assessors, which I have reviewed.

The Legal Profession Regulation 1994 was notified in Gaz 78 on 10 June 1994.
It was expressed to commence on 1 July 1994. It also has undergone subsequent amendment.

The procedure for the taxation of costs in the Supreme Court prior to the introduction of the new scheme is to be found in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p52) of the [Supreme Court
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/). (Rule now provides that the part has no application after 30 June 1994 except as provided by the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) or regulations made under it. There are other exceptions, but they are not relevant.) The usual procedure, pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p52) r 50B, was for the taxing officer to give an appointment for a hearing before the officer. The parties could be represented by a solicitor or counsel. At the hearing, the taxing officer processed the bill, item by item, hearing and taking account of submissions made either generally or in relation to particular items. [Rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s59.html) provided for the taxing officer to issue a certificate.

By r 60, a party aggrieved could object to the decision and apply to the taxing officer to reconsider the decision; the statement of objections was required to specify the nature and grounds of each objection. On receipt of such a motion for re-consideration, the taxing officer was required, pursuant to r 61, to reconsider the decision and to issue a further certificate in accordance with his decision on re-consideration. By the same rule the taxing officer was required, upon the request of any party, to state in his certificate or in some other document, and by reference to the objections to his previous decision, his reasons for his decision on re-consideration.

Where a certificate was issued in accordance with a decision on re- consideration under r 61, an aggrieved party could apply to the Court, pursuant to r 62, for a review of the decision of the taxing officer on re- consideration. On the review, the Court is empowered to exercise all the powers and discretions of the taxing officer, make orders for alteration of the certificate, make orders for the remission of any item to the same or any other taxing officer, or make such other orders as the nature of the case required.

An obvious difference between the two regimes is that, under the earlier regime, the taxing officer was required, on request, to give reasons for his decision in relation to any item or other matter as to which objection was taken whereas, under the present regime, the statute includes no express requirement for reasons and the regulation contains a requirement for reasons only in relation to determinations made concerning unjust costs agreements.

Another difference is that, under the earlier regime, there was an unqualified right of appeal from a taxing officer's decision in relation to any objection lodged by an aggrieved party whereas, under the present regime, appeal is by leave only, except in relation to questions of law.

Extrinsic material 
In his second reading speech, introducing the Legal Profession Bill 1987 (which became the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/)), the
Attorney General said: "It is widely acknowledged that the present system for taxation of legal costs is both slow and costly. Following the major reforms to the legal profession provided for in the main bill, I propose to completely review this area.
Discussions have been held recently with the Law Society of New South Wales with the object of improving the present methods of reviewing bills of costs.
I am considering the feasibility of introducing an arbitration system, which would enable appropriate cases of disputes over bills of costs to be settled quickly and in a less costly manner for all parties involved." 
This is evidence of a parliamentary intention to legislate with a view to speeding up and reducing the cost of the taxing of costs. In the result, the arbitration system foreshadowed in that speech was not the amendment implemented by the Legal Profession Reform Act 1993 or subsequently, but the perceived mischief and the objectives of the later legislation are identified.

Neither the second reading speech relating to the introduction of the 1993 legislation, nor the explanatory note issued in relation to that legislation contribute anything material.

Decisions by Masters of this Court 
In Cachia versus St George Bank Ltd (Malpass M, Supreme Court , 26 October , unreported), an appeal had been instituted against the tax assessment, purportedly pursuant to <case> (which provides for appeal as to a matter of law). One of the grounds of appeal was, in effect, that the assessor had failed to give reasons for his determination notwithstanding a request that he do so. The Master noted that there had been a lack of full argument.
Relevantly, he ruled that reasons were not required. It appeared to him that the legislature intended to establish a code. There was no statutory provision for itemisation of the assessment or for the giving of reasons. An obligation to give reasons seemed to him to be inconsistent with the legislative scheme which included notification of the result by certificate. The content of the certificate was prescribed by statute and regulation. It did not seem to him that the assessor was engaged in the performance of a judicial function. There was no general rule that reasons must be given for non-judicial decisions.
Having regard to these considerations, the Master was not satisfied that an assessment under the Act gave rise to an implied duty to state reasons, nor that a failure to give reasons in this instance constituted an error of law.

I mention at this stage that, in the proceedings before me, counsel for
Kennedy explicitly conceded that the function of a cost assessor under the Act is an administrative as distinct from a judicial function. All submissions from counsel proceeded on that basis. I am content to decide the case on the basis on which it has been argued in that regard.

In Crooke versus David Crooke Pty Ltd (Malpass M, Supreme Court , 12 April , unreported), the aggrieved parties sought leave to appeal pursuant to s
M (which provides for a general appeal, subject to leave to appeal). An appeal was also brought pursuant to <case> (which provides for appeal as of right in relation to matters of law). The relief sought was refused. The
Master affirmed the views expressed in Cachia. There is reference to an argument that the assessor took an irrelevant matter into account, which suggests that there may have been some reasons provided by the assessor. No question appears to have arisen as to whether an assessor is obliged to give reasons.

In Busuttil versus Holder (Greenwood M, Supreme Court , 9 August 1996, unreported), there was an appeal against an assessment. The grounds included a failure to give reasons. The Master rejected a submission that the functions of an assessor are judicial in nature. The Master held there was no obligation to give reasons. Whilst this undoubtedly limited the scope for appeal, that, in the Master's opinion, fell short of having the effect of making an appeal impossible.

The appeal was argued pursuant to <case>. The Master held that the test for leave was whether there was an obvious error on the face of the record and substantial injustice to the appellant if the determination by the assessor were allowed to stand. Procedural fairness had not been denied. No error of law was established in relation to the processes followed. In the assessor's certificate, separate reduction figures were recorded in relation to groups of items specified by number. This made it possible to argue the rationale of some of the reductions. That was done. The following is a review of the arguments advanced and of the Master's rulings as they appear from the judgment: 
The appellant said that certain items related to the examination of subpoenaed documents. A legal costs consultant, Mr W Easton, gave evidence that the bill did not contain an item for the preparation of any such subpoena. This was apparently relied upon as evidence that there had been no such examination of subpoenaed documents as was claimed. However, it appeared that a subpoena had been issued at an earlier time. Accordingly, this ground was rejected.

There was an inconsistency between the claim and the result in relation to another group of items. That was resolved by a finding that there was a typographical error in the assessor's note in the certificate which resolved the apparent inconsistency.

Conflicting expert evidence was called as to the level of costs allowed for solicitor and senior counsel. It appears that the Master was not satisfied that the assessor had erred in this respect.

It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was an error in relation to the proportion of a filing fee paid on the application for assessment which was allowed by the assessor. The Master held that there was no error.

The Master held that a reduction from $240,000 to $170,000 did not, in itself, indicate that there had been a substantial injustice done to the appellant.

The Master took into account authorities which went against interfering with the discretion of a taxing officer unless a question of principle was involved. He also referred to authorities relating to the restraint which appellate courts exercise in appeals from a discretionary decision generally.
No error or other reason for interfering with the assessment was disclosed.
Accordingly, leave to appeal was refused.

There was an appeal from the Master, heard by Bell AJ (7 Nov 1996, unreported). The appeal was dismissed.

Bell AJ recorded that the argument advanced before him in support of the proposition that the costs assessor was bound to give reasons was that the assessor was acting judicially and not administratively. Having reviewed the authorities, Bell AJ held that the assessor's function was not judicial.
Accordingly, the appeal failed.

His Honour mentioned that, in his view, the right of appeal was not necessarily nugatory if there was no obligation to give reasons. He also mentioned that the scheme under the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) did not contain any such express requirement, in contrast with the scheme it replaced. However it was the determination that the assessor's function was administrative which was the reason for his Honour's determination, that having been the basis on which the case was argued.

As I have indicated earlier, I am proceeding on the assumption that the costs assessor's function is administrative, but (as will appear) the argument before me did not proceed on the basis that an obligation to give reasons depended on the function of the assessor being a judicial one.

In New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation versus Kirkwood (Greenwood
M, Supreme Court , 8 November 1996, unreported), there was a successful appeal pursuant to [s
M.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208m.html)
In relation to a case involving a two day hearing, a bill of costs was brought in at $119,106. It was reduced on assessment to $99,964 ie. by about $20,000.
The bill included almost $70,000 for disbursements. The Master found that the figure claimed for disbursements was well beyond what one would normally expect in such a case. The profit costs were also high. A number of items in the bill, including counsel's fees, were claimed at a rate beyond what one would normally expect. Having apparently evaluated these considerations against the fact that the bill had been reduced by a total amount of only $20,000 or thereabouts, the Master concluded that there appeared, on the face of the record, to be an error which may have led to a substantial injustice.
The assessment was set aside and referred for reassessment.

Lawrence versus Hannaford (Malpass M, Supreme Court , 26 March 1997, unreported) was an appeal pursuant to [s
L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208l.html) in relation to an assessment of the costs payable by a client to a solicitor.
The assessor allowed the costs as claimed. The first three grounds of appeal related to whether a costs agreement was with the client or with an associated person. The remaining grounds related to the assessor's allowance of a cancellation fee for counsel. It was common ground that the assessor was not obliged to give reasons. Under the first three grounds the question was whether an error of law had been made in determining that the appellant
Lawrence was a person liable for the solicitor's costs. It was held that there was no error, the determination in that regard being reasonably open to the assessor on the material before him. As to the remaining grounds, the Master was not satisfied that the alleged findings were truly involved in the assessment. Accordingly, there was no error of law in that regard. In any event, there was material which supported an entitlement on the part of counsel to charge such a cancellation fee, and a determination was reasonably open that it was fair and reasonable to allow such a fee. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

The law relating to obligation to give reasons 
In Public Service Board of New South Wales versus Osmond [(1985) 159 CLR ], the Board appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal requiring it to give reasons for dismissing an appeal made to it by an unsuccessful applicant for promotion. The statute under which the appeal was brought required the Board to consider the appeal and the grounds thereof and any further evidence in relation thereto which the Board deemed necessary for the proper determination of the appeal and stated that the decision of the Board should be final. There was no provision for appeal.

The appeal to the High Court was successful. It was held that there was no general rule of the common law or principle of natural justice requiring reasons to be given for administrative decisions, even those made in exercise of a statutory discretion and liable adversely to affect interests or defeat legitimate or reasonable expectations.

Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ agreed) rejected the submission that there was a general rule requiring reasons to be given for administrative decisions (at 662-670). He went on to say (at 670): "It remains to consider whether, notwithstanding that there is no general obligation to give reasons for an administrative decision, the circumstances makes this a special case in which natural justice required reasons to be given. The rules of natural justice are designed to ensure fairness in the making of a decision and it is difficult to see how the fairness of an administrative decision can be affected by what is done after the decision has been made. However, assuming that in special circumstances natural justice may require reasons to be given, the present is not such a case. The issues before the Board were simple and well defined: which of the two officers had the greater efficiency, and if neither of them had greater efficiency than the other, which was the senior? The respondent had the means of knowing what issues were canvassed on the appeal, and could readily infer whether the
Board's conclusion rested on par(a) or on par(b) of <case> of the Act.
Neither the provisions of the Act nor the circumstances of the case justified the conclusion that the rules of natural justice required the Board to communicate the reasons for its decision." 
His Honour's reference to "what is done after the decision has been made" was apparently a reference to the suggestion that the Board was required to give reasons for its decision after the decision had been made. At that stage, the process contemplated by the legislation had run its course, there being no provision for appeal.

The court in Osmond had no occasion to consider what implications may arise where there was provision for appeal to a court. The following quotation from the Earl of Halsbury in Quinn versus Leathem <case>; [(1901) AC ] at 506 is in point: "(T)here are two observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all." 
I would not read what fell from Gibbs CJ in Osmond as an opinion that there is no need for reasons where an appeal lies to a court.

Deane J agreed with the orders proposed by Gibbs CJ. He agreed that there was no general rule that reasons must be given for administrative decisions.
However, whereas Gibbs CJ merely assumed for the purposes of the argument that reasons might be required for an administrative decision in special circumstances, Deane J stated, in effect, that there could be special circumstances which gave rise to such a requirement. He said (at 676): "On the other hand, it is trite law that the common law rules of natural justice or procedural fair play are neither standardised nor immutable. The procedural consequences of their application depend upon the particular statutory framework within which they apply and upon the exigencies of the particular case. Their content may vary with changes in contemporary practice and standards. That being so, the statutory developments referred to in the judgments of Kirby P and Priestley JA in the Court of Appeal in the present case are conducive to an environment within which the courts should be less reluctant than they would have been in times past to discern in statutory provisions a legislative intent that the particular decision-maker should be under a duty to give reasons or to accept that special circumstances might arise in which contemporary standards of natural justice or procedural fair play demand that an administrative decision-maker provide reasons for a decision to a person whose property, rights or legitimate expectations are adversely affected by it. Where such circumstances exist, statutory provisions conferring the relevant decision-making power should, in the absence of a clear intent to the contrary, be construed so as to impose upon the decision- maker an implied statutory duty to provide such reasons. As has been said however, the circumstances in which natural justice or procedural fair play requires that an administrative decision-maker give reasons for his decision are special, that is to say, exceptional." 
In Chapmans Ltd versus Australian Stock Exchange Ltd <case>; [(1995) 17 ACSR 524], Beaumont J (at 529) took it to be the law that reasons might be required for an administrative determination in the particular circumstances of the case: "It is settled law in this country that there is no general, or abstract, duty to give reasons (see Public Service Board of New South Wales versus Osmond [(1986) 159 CLR 656] at 662; [63 ALR 559).] However, as Deane J indicated in Osmond (at CLR 676), the particular circumstances of the case may, as a matter of procedural fair play, demand that a decision maker provide reasons." 
In Cypressvale Pty Ltd versus Retail Shop Lease Tribunal [(1996) Qd R 462] the
Queensland Court of Appeal had before it a case in which an administrative tribunal had given reasons in the context of a statutory regime for judicial review. The question was whether the reasons were adequate and it was held that they were. However, Fitzgerald P made some pertinent observations in relation to the decision in Osmond. He said (at 476): "...Public Service Board versus Osmond does not hold that fairness does not ordinarily require that reasons be given for decisions which affect rights and liabilities; its conclusion was rather that at that time, those who made administrative decisions were not required to provide reasons because that was established by a long line of authority. It is not really surprising that, in a complex society in which there is a proliferation of tribunals with power to affect citizens' rights and liabilities, the courts have come to insist that it is an incident of a duty to act fairly that decisions be adequately explained.

The nature and extent of the obligation to give reasons varies according to the circumstances; the obligation is, after all, an aspect of the duty to act fairly in the particular circumstances. The broad principle deducible from the cases is that the decision-maker is required to give reasons which disclose what was taken into account and in what manner, and thus whether an error has been made ..." 
This passage would not justify a decision on my part that, as a general rule, there is an obligation binding on an administrative decision-maker to give reasons in every case. To so hold would be contrary to Osmond. However, the observation signifies a liberalising stream of thought in this area of the law. It encourages one to consider whether the absence of reasons constitutes procedural unfairness having regard to some special feature of the case, an approach which is, in my view, not inconsistent with the majority position in
Osmond.

English cases were cited in the proceedings before me, in which it has been held that an administrative tribunal was bound to provide reasons for its decision: R versus Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Doody <case>; [[1994] 1 AC 531]; R versus Civil Service Appeals Board; Ex parte Cunningham [[1991] 4 All ER 310]; R versus Higher Education Funding Council; Ex parte
Institute of Dental Surgery <case>; [[1994] 1 WLR 242]; R versus City of London Corporation; Ex parte Matson [1997] 1
WLR 765. Distinctions can be drawn having regard to the legislative framework in which some of those decisions arose. These cases do show, however, that the trend of authority in England is very much towards a recognition that there may be procedural unfairness in a failure to give reasons, at least in particular classes of case. A similar attitude is to be found in the writings of academic: Wade, Administrative Law (1994, 7th ed); Craig, The Common
Law, Reasons and Administrative Justice [(1994) CLJ 282]; Campbell, The
Duty to Give Reasons in Administrative Law [(1994) Public Law 184.] 
I turn to the law that reasons must be given for a judicial, as distinct from an administrative determination. In requiring judicial officers to provide reasons for their decisions, the courts have emphasised (among other considerations) the need for reasons as a means of effectuating the right of appeal. In Pettitt versus Dunkley [(1971) 1 NSWLR 376], Asprey JA said (at 381) in relation to an appeal from a judge of the District Court: "The rights of appeal referred to by Sir Frederick Jordan are statutory rights granted by the legislature to the parties (Worrall versus Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd <case>; [(1917) 24 CLR 28], at p31) and the failure of a trial judge in the appropriate case to state his findings and reasons amounts, in my view, to an encroachment upon those rights. The omission of the trial judge makes it impossible for an appellate court to give effect to those rights, either for one party to the appeal or another, and so carry out its own appellate functions. It is unnecessary to stress the prime importance to a party to an appeal, whether he be appellant or respondent, of the findings and reasons at first instance ..." 
In the same case, Moffitt JA said (at 387): "I think there is a duty upon a judge or magistrate, at least at first instance, in an appropriate case and in appropriate circumstances to give reasons for a decision such as will facilitate a litigant, who may be aggrieved, exercising rights he has to appeal. In Carlson versus King [(1947) 64
WN 65] at p 66 Jordan CJ in delivering the decision of the Full
Court said: `It has long been established that it is the duty of a court of first instance, from which an appeal lies to a higher court, to make, or cause to be made, a note of everything necessary to enable the case to be laid properly and sufficiently before the appellate court if there should be an appeal. This includes not only the evidence, and the decision arrived at, but also the reasons for arriving at the decision." 
In Soulemezis versus Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd [(1987) 10 NSWLR 247] Kirby P said (at 259): "(T)he judicial obligation to give reasons, and not to frustrate the legislative facility of appeal on questions of law, at lease obliges a judge to state generally and briefly the grounds which have led him or her to the conclusions reached concerning disputed factual questions and to list the findings on the principal contested issues." 
Mahoney JA, following Pettitt, reaffirmed his opinion that the statement of reasons by a judicial officer may be necessary to enable a party to exercise his right of appeal. His Honour said that this is one of the conventional functions of the requirement. That was a restatement by Mahoney JA of what he had said in Housing Commission of New South Wales versus Tatmar [(1983) 3 NSWLR ],
McHugh JA said (at 280-281): "...I agree with the statement by Mahoney JA in Housing Commission of New
South Wales versus Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd (at 386) that the extent of the duty to give reasons is related `to the function to be served by the giving of reasons'. Thus more elaborate reasons are required where legislation gives a right of appeal against a decision than where no appeal lies. In the first class of case, unless the basis of the decision is properly articulated, the losing party may be effectively deprived of his right of appeal. In a case where a right of appeal is given only in respect of a question of law, different considerations apply from the case where there is a full appeal. An ultimate finding of fact, which is not subject to appeal and which is in no way dependent upon the application of a legal standard, can be treated less elaborately than an issue involving a question of law or mixed fact and law.
If no right of appeal is given against findings of fact, a failure to state the basis of even a crucial finding of fact, if it involves no legal standard, will only constitute an error of law if the failure can be characterised as a breach of the principle that justice must be seen to be done." 
Discussion 
I was interested to hear from counsel how appeal rights under ss 208L and 208M could effectively be exercised, in the absence of reasons, including identification of the items reduced and the reason or reasons for each reduction.

I was told that the point would be carried substantially by counsel for the
Attorney General. Counsel for Nine advanced only one way in which it was said that a right of appeal would be effectively preserved. It was said that if the result was wholly disproportionate, error would be apparent on the face of the certificate. For that purpose, it was acknowledged, that some extrinsic evidence might be necessary. (Evidence would certainly be necessary as to the nature of the proceedings, their duration and so on; otherwise, there would be nothing with which the result could be seen to be disproportionate.) It was also suggested that expert evidence could be given to show that the assessment was not one which could reasonably have been made. (It may be noted that disproportionality on the face of the certificate was the basis for a successful appeal in Kirkwood (supra). It may also be noted that experts were called in Busuttil (supra), but there was only scope for such evidence in that case because the assessor had fortuitously broken down the assessment in the certificate relative to groups of items; otherwise, there would have been no basis for the points ventilated in the expert evidence in that case.) 
As was foreshadowed, counsel for the Attorney General advanced an argument that rights of appeal would be materially preserved notwithstanding the absence of reasons from the assessor. He referred to appeals relating to a finding of an unjust costs agreement pursuant to ss 208C and 208D. However, an appeal was unimpeded in relation to that topic because reasons were required. Next, it was said that an error in following the procedure under the
Act would be identifiable and could provide the basis for an appeal. That, however, left untouched appeals which went to the merits in the ordinary way.
Counsel for the Attorney General said that these were not exhaustive illustrations of the ambit of effective appeal available in the absence of reasons. However, when further illustrations were sought, none were forthcoming.

In the case of a costs assessment, in the absence of reasons disclosing which items have been reduced, by what amount and for what reason or reasons in each case, an error of principle or a simple mistake (such as in arithmetic or looking at the wrong scale) or some other error of legal principle or of fact could go undetected and usually would. In the absence of reasons, the appeal rights provided by the statute would be ineffectual in the case of error of the most ordinary kind.

It cannot have been intended by the parliament that an error of law or an error of fact affecting the result should pass without remedy under a scheme which provides for an appeal in relation to a matter of law and leave to appeal generally. I would hold, for this reason, that there is an implied statutory obligation on the part of a costs assessor to provide reasons such as I have mentioned.

Further, it seems to me that there is an element in the reasoning which underlies the requirement for reasons to be given by a judicial officer which is applicable to appeals to a court from an administrative decision-maker. One of the main rationales for the rule applicable to judicial determinations is that without reasons error may not be disclosed. Injustices would pass without cure. The appeal process would fail to achieve its objective.

This reasoning applies equally to a scheme which provides for appeal to a court from an administrative determination, except where there was an unqualified right to a re-hearing de novo on appeal. In that case, the reasons for the original determination do not matter because the appeal is a fresh hearing, unrelated to the reasons for the original determination. But where there is an appeal on questions of law or a general appeal only by leave, error is likely to pass undetected in the case of an administrative determination as readily as in the case of a judicial determination absent reasons for the determination.

In relation to an appeal pursuant to <case>, it seems to me that, except in the case of a wholly disproportionate result, error of law on the part of the assessor would never be disclosed in the absence of reasons. That amounts to a very extensive and serious frustration of the appeal process provided by the section.

In relation to an appeal pursuant to <case>, too much emphasis should not be given to the limitation which exists, in any event, by reason of the need for leave. As I have recorded, Master Greenwood held in Busuttil (supra) that the test for leave, in this instance, was whether there was an obvious error on the face of the record and substantial injustice to the appellant if the determination by the assessor were allowed to stand. The test was taken from cases relating to appeals by leave to an appellate court from an interlocutory judgment: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited versus Philip Morris
Incorporated <case>; [(1981) 148 CLR 170]; Niemann versus Electronic Industries Ltd <case>; [[1978] VR 431.] However, the test for leave tends to vary according to the nature of the case. By contrast, for example, it has been said by the High
Court, in relation to an application for leave to appeal to the Court of
Criminal Appeal against sentence, that the appellate court might rightly refuse leave to appeal where the court is satisfied that an application for leave is without merits: Bailey versus Director of Public Prosecutions <case>; [(1988) 62 ALJR 319] (at 319). The court went on to say (at 319): "But where there is a sufficiently arguable case, the more appropriate course is to grant leave to appeal, deal with the merits of the argument and then reach a decision allowing or dismissing the appeal." 
This is a much more liberal test for leave than the test relating to appeal from an appellate court from an interlocutory judgment.

I am by no means satisfied that the test for leave under <case> is as strict as was stated in Busuttil. It may be that an arguable case is sufficient.
However, whether the test be an obvious error on the face of the record and substantial injustice, or merely an arguable case, or something in between, demonstrable error or arguable error - whichever it be - in relation to the merits of the determination would pass without remedy in the absence of reasons, unless the error is so gross that error is apparent from the result.

I am unimpressed with the argument that the new legislative scheme does not provide expressly for reasons to be given. It is true that the earlier regime did so, albeit on request. It is suggested that this contrast shows an intention on the part of the legislature that reasons should not be required.
That, it is said, is conformable with the apparent intention of the legislature to speed up the assessment of costs and to contain the costs of such assessments.

I do not see it that way. The requirement for reasons under the previous regime was contained in the rules of court at a time when the function was performed by officers of the court. Under the new regime, costs assessors are appointed pursuant to legislation. They are not officers of the court. Their functions are governed by the legislation and by regulation. It seems to me that the need for reasons in order to effectuate the provisions for appeal in the legislation is so obvious that the legislature is to be treated as having anticipated that that would be implied. The regulation made pursuant to the legislation deals with what is to be included in a certificate. Reasons are not mentioned. But the regulation is not inconsistent with an assessor including reasons in the certificate. A prescription of matters to be included does not proscribe the inclusion of any other matter.

I agree that given an implicit intention on the part of the legislature that reasons would be provided, one would have expected that requirement to appear in the regulation. It does not. All one can say is that the regulation-making authority has failed to carry through the intention of the legislature as well as it might have done.

It was submitted that one could look to the regulation for assistance in the construction of the statute. However, the weight of authority appears to be against that approach unless the regulation is made concurrently with the passage of the legislation: Gifford, Statutory Interpretation (1990) (pp -147); Pearce, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (1996, 4th ed) (pp -77). In any event, as I have stated, the regulation is not inconsistent with reasons being provided.

Reasons required 
I would hold that a right of appeal to a court - unless by way of an unqualified re-hearing de novo - constitutes a "special circumstance" of the kind contemplated in Osmond and an exception to the general rule that there is no requirement for reasons to be given by an administrative decision-maker.

Because of the appeal provisions in the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), I hold that a costs assessor is bound to give reasons for his determination, specifying the items which have been reduced, by what amount and for what reason in each instance.

It was argued on behalf of Kennedy that there were special features of the present case which marked it out from the ordinary run of assessment determinations. I am not satisfied that there are any such special features.
This judgment would apply to assessments generally.

Having regard to the purpose to be served by such reasons and the sources of the requirement - implied statutory obligation and procedural fairness - the obligation should be no higher than is necessary for the purpose. It would, in my view, be sufficient if reasons were provided on request by an aggrieved party. The request could be limited in some way if the aggrieved party were so minded, for example, to particular items. The costs assessor would be entitled to make a supplementary charge for the time required to provide reasons as part of the cost of the assessment.

It does not seem to me that what I have proposed would be particularly onerous or that it would materially increase the cost of the process. It may be preferable for assessors to anticipate the possibility of a request for reasons when processing the bill. In the ordinary course, the assessor would need to note against any item reduced the amount of the reduction or the reduced amount in order to be able to tally up the result. It would be easy enough to record the reason for the reduction in each instance at the same time. In each case, the reason must be readily to mind. Otherwise, the item would not have been reduced. In most instances, a word or two would suffice. A code could be devised for recurring reasons. I doubt that this would add much to the cost of the assessment. It would, in my view, be a reasonable incident of the assessment and chargeable as part of the assessment. If a request for reasons were made at a later time, little extra work would be required to produce the reasons in suitable form.

The provision of reasons, which was required on request under the earlier scheme, is not inconsistent with the stated objectives of the amending legislation, namely, to speed up and to reduce the cost of taxation of costs, having regard to other features of the scheme in particular, the elimination of hearings and oral argument before a taxing officer.

My decision is the converse of that of Bell AJ in Busuttil. I would be inclined to follow such a decision as a matter of comity in ordinary circumstances. But, in view of the narrow basis on which Busuttil was argued before Bell AJ, I do not believe I should decline to implement a strong view of my own based, as it is, on an approach which was not argued before his
Honour.

Intervention sought by the Attorney General 
As I have recorded, an order pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p8) r 8 was sought by the Attorney General that the Attorney be added as a party to the proceedings. So far as is material, the rule provides that, where a person who is not a party ought to have been joined as a party or is a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon, the court may order that he or she be added as a party.

Allowing the intervention of a party pursuant to the rule is to be contrasted with hearing counsel for a party amicus curiae. The flexible and extensive nature of the court's discretion in the latter respect was emphasised in
United States Tobacco Co versus Minister for Consumer Affairs <case>; [(1988) 20 FCR 520.] There, it was stated (at 536) that no strict rules have been developed and that it is for the court to accept the assistance of the amicus if it seems proper to the court to do so. The court said: "The general principle is that the parties are entitled to carry on their litigation free from the intervention of persons who are strangers to the litigation. But there is an overriding right of the court to see that justice is done. An amicus may be heard if good cause is shown for doing so and if the court thinks it proper." 
The principle that parties are entitled to carry on their litigation free from the interference of persons who are strangers to the litigation seems to me to have even more point in the exercise of the court's discretion under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p8) r 8 because of the implications of an order under that rule.

In Adams versus Adams [(1970) 3 All ER 572], it was said (at 577) that the Attorney General had the right of intervention at the invitation or with the permission of the court where the suit raised any question of public policy on which the executive may have a view which it may desire to bring to the notice of the court.

A stricter approach has been adopted in this country. In Corporate Affairs
Commission versus Bradley; Commonwealth of Australia (Intervener) (1974) 1 NSWLR , it was held on appeal that the trial judge had erred in joining the
Commonwealth as a party to the proceedings pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p8) r 8. It was held (at 398 and 402) by Hutley JA (with whom Reynolds and Glass
JJA agreed) that there was no inherent power in the court to permit intervention apart from the rule, and that there was no general right of intervention by the Attorney General whenever a question of public policy arose. His Honour went on to say (at 403) that a doctrine that the courts should accept the guidance of the executive in issues of public policy was subversive of the independence of the judiciary.

Counsel for the Attorney also invoked [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s23.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) which provides that the court shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales. However, it does not seem to me that the section raises any relevant consideration which would not arise in any event under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p8) r 8.

In the course of argument, I inquired whether the Attorney General would be willing to forgo any claim for costs in the proceedings before me and, in relation to an appeal, whether the Attorney would do likewise and be prepared to pay the costs of other parties if the Attorney instituted the appeal. I was informed that the Attorney would not claim costs in relation to the proceedings before me but that no undertaking was offered in relation to costs on appeal.

On the principles enunciated in Bradley, I do not think it would be a proper exercise of the court's power to order that the Attorney General be made a party to the proceedings pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p8) r 8. But, however that may be and assuming for the purpose of the argument that to do so would be consistent with the correct application of legal principle, I would not make the order in the exercise my discretion in the circumstances of the present case.

The considerations which I take into account in that regard are as follows. In this case, the Attorney General sought no role other than the presentation of legal argument. In that circumstance, by hearing counsel for the Attorney amicus curiae the court has received all the assistance which the Attorney could proffer in the proceedings and the executive government has had the opportunity of putting everything it wished to put on the merits of the case through counsel.

As a practical matter, the only purpose to be served by granting the application for joinder as distinct from hearing counsel amicus curiae would be to provide the executive with a right to appeal against my decision in the event that no appeal is otherwise to be instituted. That would be to foist upon the existing parties to the litigation the prospect of an appeal which neither would have sought. In the absence of protection in relation to costs, that seems to me to be unfair.

Withdrawal of conditional appearance 
In The Queen versus The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman <case>; [(1980) 144 CLR 13], observations were made as to the legitimacy of the court hearing from the tribunal whose decision was impugned in the proceedings. The court cautioned against doing so. It said (at 35) that if the tribunal became a protagonist in the court there was the risk that, by so doing, it would endanger the impartiality which it was expected to maintain in subsequent proceedings before the Tribunal if and when relief was granted. It was said that the presentation of a case on behalf of a tribunal should be regarded as exceptional and, where it occurred, it should in general be limited to submissions going to the powers and procedures of the tribunal.

A similar view was expressed in BTR plc versus Westinghouse Brake and Signal Co
Ltd [(1992) 106 ALR 35.] It was said that, in the circumstances of that case, the Australian Securities Commission had properly advanced arguments relating to the court's jurisdiction and powers, the construction of the legislation involved and the powers and the procedures of the Commission under the legislation.

Similar views have been expressed in Kaycliff Pty Ltd versus Australian
Broadcasting Tribunal [(1989-1990) 19 ALD 315];
Riverina Broadcasters (Holdings) Pty Ltd versus Australian Broadcasting
Tribunal <case>; [(1992) 28 ALD 813]; Cairns Port Authority versus Albietz [(1995) 2 Qd R 470.] 
In the circumstances of this case, I believe the court has a discretion to allow the costs assessor to withdraw his conditional appearance and to file an unconditional appearance for the purpose of receiving submissions on his behalf in relation to the point in question in these proceedings. In the present case, those are the submissions which have been made by counsel appearing for the Attorney and for the assessor. I would exercise my discretion against granting the application for the reasons that follow.

Were I to do what is sought there would be no practical consequence in relation to the proceedings before me because the submissions made by counsel for the Attorney amicus curiae would simply be treated as having been made on behalf of the assessor as well. A further consideration is that in this case the tribunal in the person of the assessor is, pursuant to this judgment, to continue to have a function to discharge under the legislation. That makes the case one of the kind referred to by the High Court in Hardiman, and there is no exceptional reason for the assessor needing to be heard on matters of the kind referred to in that decision. The assessor, insofar as he has an interest in the outcome, has had the benefit of everything that could be and was said by counsel for the Attorney General on the point in question.

Again, a practical view should be taken of the reasons for and effect of what is proposed. The only purpose which could be served by granting the application - assuming that the proposal would be effective in this respect - is to provide the assessor with a right of appeal on the merits of the case in the event that an appeal is not otherwise instituted from this decision.
Again, it seems to me to be unfair that other parties to the proceedings should be exposed to such a prospect without protection as to costs.

The application was put on the alternative basis that [s
NA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208na.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) provided a basis for the assessor being made a full party to the proceedings.
The section provides that a costs assessor can be made a party to an appeal against a determination or decision of the costs assessor only by the Supreme
Court. The appeal referred to in the section is an appeal pursuant to [s
L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208l.html) or [s
M.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208m.html)
The present proceedings are not such an appeal. The section therefore has no relevance to the present proceedings.

Orders 
I propose to list the matter for mention. The parties should bring in short minutes of order to implement this judgment and in relation to costs. The parties will have an opportunity to be heard in relation to costs on that occasion.
