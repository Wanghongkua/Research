REGINA versus SCOTT PODETTI 
CCA 60010/98 September 1998 
Grove J, Kirby J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
GROVE J: The applicant in these proceedings appears in person and the notice of application for leave to appeal purports to be an application in relation to the cancellation of an order for periodic detention. 
As has been pointed out to the applicant, and he has acknowledged that he appreciates, this Court does not have jurisdiction to deal directly with an appeal against an order for cancellation.

In written submissions sent to the Court in response to the Registrar's direction, there is recognition of this circumstance in that the applicant states that the only ground for appeal is that there were special circumstances within the meaning of <case> sub [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s2.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/).

The history of the matter so far as it is relevant to relate it, is that the applicant appeared in 1993 before his Honour Judge O'Reilly QC at the Penrith
District Court when in respect of an offence of supply cannabis contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act he was sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on 12
February 1993. Failure to undertake the conditions of periodic detention led to the matter being brought back before the Penrith District Court and on 1
February 1994 his Honour Judge Luland QC made a cancellation order. The applicant did not appear on that occasion.

There is ample authority that in the absence of the periodic detainee there is jurisdiction in the District Court to make an order. There was, of course, no submission made on behalf of the applicant to Luland DCJ concerning the balance of the term which would be required to be served consequent upon the cancellation of the periodic detention order.

Nevertheless his Honour invoked jurisdiction vested in him to divide the balance of what had been a fixed term into a minimum and additional term. This he specified to be twenty-one months minimum term with an additional term of eight months and twenty-eight days. The applicant's actual custody appears to have commenced on 13 December 1997. In that regard I refer to the particulars of trial pursuant to [Criminal Appeal
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/).

In his submissions in relation to special circumstances now made, the applicant makes reference to diagnosis of his mother with a serious medical condition and the later temporary remission of her condition. He also points out that there have been serious problems in relation to his family situation and that he has small children and that his fiancee is presently awaiting the birth of another child.

The circumstances set out in the document provoke sympathy for the applicant.
Leaving aside the circumstance that he was in effect the author of his own misfortune in his failure to attend the earlier proceedings, I would be prepared to look at the matters which he now raises for the purpose of their assessment as special circumstances within the meaning of [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/s5.html) I regret, however, to come to the conclusion that though they are evocative of sympathy they ought not be assessed as amounting to special circumstances for the purposes of further altering the division into minimum and additional term as specified by his Honour Judge Luland.

Although in his necessarily brief remarks in February 1994 his Honour made no reference to finding favourably to the applicant special circumstances and extension of the additional term component which he specified, it can be observed that the additional term component does in fact exceed one third of the minimum term. I am unable to perceive any error in the assessment made by his Honour and as I have said, even setting aside any procedural difficulties
I would not for myself intervene to substitute any different division from that made by his Honour.

Having regard to the terms of the document filed, the appropriate order in this case is to refuse leave. I propose therefore that leave to appeal be refused.

KIRBY J: I agree with both the reasons given by Grove J and the order that he proposes, namely, that leave be refused. 
GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore is leave to appeal is refused and it is accordingly dismissed. * * *
