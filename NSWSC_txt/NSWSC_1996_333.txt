SIMOS
J The Plaintiff, Richard Lawrence Maddrell, is, and has been since 27
March 1988, in custody at the Goulburn Correctional Centre, following a finding on that day by a jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, that he was not guilty of a charge of murder by reason of mental illness.
This was a special verdict by the jury returned pursuant to section 428ZA of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) which is in the following terms:- "428ZA. Special Verdict. Where, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill as aforesaid at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury shall return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness."
Following the return of this special verdict by the jury the Plaintiff was dealt with in accordance with section 428ZB of the Act which is in the following terms:- "428ZB. Effect of finding and declaration as to mental illness.
Where, upon the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court shall order that the person be detained in strict custody in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law."
The Plaintiff wishes to make application to the Supreme Court under the [Family Provision Act 1982](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) for additional provision out of the estate of his father, the late Henry Leslie Maddrell, additional to the provision already made for the Plaintiff in the will of the deceased dated 1 July 1994.
The present application by notice of motion is made pursuant to the provisions of the [Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/) which provides that certain persons in custody may not institute any civil proceedings in any court except by leave of that court granted on his application.
The relevant provisions of that Act are [sections 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s3.html), [4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) and [5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s5.html) which are in the following terms:- "Felon may sue.
Subject to this Act, a person shall not, by reason of his having been convicted of, or found to have committed, a felony, be incapable of instituting and maintaining any civil proceedings in any court.

Leave required in certain cases.
A person who is in custody as a result of his having been convicted of, or found to have committed, a felony may not institute any civil proceedings in any court except by the leave of that court granted on his application.

Grant of leave
A court shall not, under [section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html), grant leave to a person to institute proceedings unless the court is satisfied that the proceedings are not an abuse of process and that there is prima facie ground for the proceedings."
The Plaintiff is, plainly, not a person who is in custody as a result of his having been convicted of a felony within the meaning of [section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the
Act, but brings the present application upon the basis that he is a person "who is in custody as a result of his having been ... found to have committed, a felony" within the meaning of that section.
Accordingly, the first question to be determined is whether or not the
Plaintiff, in the relevant circumstances as described above, is a person who, within the meaning of [section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html), is "in custody as a result of his having been ... found to have committed, a felony."
In my opinion, although the matter is not free from doubt, the better view is that the Plaintiff is not a person who is in custody "as a result of his having been ...
found to have committed a felony" within the meaning of [section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the Act. This is because, in my opinion, the special verdict of the jury, returned pursuant to section 428ZA of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) necessarily involves, a finding that the Plaintiff, by reason of his mental illness, was "not... responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done" and where a person has been found to be not responsible according to law for his or her action, he or she cannot, in my opinion, be said to be a person who has been found to have committed a felony. In other words, in my opinion, a person cannot be found to have committed a felony, unless that person has been found to be responsible according to law for his or her act.
It follows, in my opinion, that in the relevant circumstances, the
Plaintiff is not a person who is in custody "as a result of his having been ... found to have committed, a felony" and accordingly, does not need the leave of the court to institute proceedings under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) in respect of his late father's estate.
As this finding is not, in my opinion, free from doubt, it is appropriate that I should also express my opinion as to the merits of the present application upon the assumption that the Plaintiff does require the leave of the court upon the basis that he is, contrary to the view expressed above, a person who is in custody "as a result of his having been ... found to have committed, a felony" within the meaning of [section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the [Felons (Civil
Proceedings) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/).
Upon that basis it is, in my opinion, plain that the Plaintiff is entitled to a grant of leave to institute those proceedings under the [Family
Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) in respect of his later father's estate since, on the evidence before me, I am clearly satisfied that the proposed proceedings would not be an abuse of process and further, that there is prima facie ground for the proceedings. Indeed, it is my understanding that counsel for the Defendant conceded that the proposed proceedings did not constitute an abuse of process and did not argue that there was not "prima facie ground for the proceedings" as also required by [section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s5.html) of the Act. Quite apart, however, from that very proper approach taken by counsel for the Defendant in the particular circumstances of this case, I am of the view, as stated above, that both the requirements of [section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s5.html) of the Act have been satisfied. The principal evidence in this connection is contained in the affidavit of the Plaintiff dated 14
September 1995 and the affidavit of Anthony George Nevill dated 18
May 1995 filed on behalf of the Defendant. This expression of opinion should not, however, be taken to involve any expression of view as to the likely outcome of those proceedings when they are eventually dealt with on their merits.
I record that the Notice of Motion in the present application was filed on 21 March and that the matter was adjourned from time to time initially, inter alia, for the purpose of the Defendant, and the Court, being satisfied that the Plaintiff had the requisite mental capacity to give instructions to commence the present and the proposed proceedings. In the event, certain further information was obtained and put before the Court and that aspect is no longer an issue in the present proceedings.
I mention that matter, however, in connection with the fact that the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) requires that applications under that Act be made within months of the death of the deceased. In the present case the deceased in respect of whom the Plaintiff in the present application wishes to bring proceedings died on 1 July 1994, so that, as at the date of delivery of this judgment, the period of 18 months has expired. Although it is unnecessary for me to do so having regard to the decision I have reached, I indicate that if, contrary to my opinion, it were to be held on appeal that leave was required by the
Plaintiff to institute the proposed proceedings in respect of the estate of his late father, and if it were held that that could not be done until leave was granted, so that an application would first need to be made for an extension of time within which to commence the proceedings, I would be disposed prima facie to grant such leave extending the time within which such proceedings might be commenced, having regard to the circumstances in which the present application was adjourned from time to time. I have not, of course, heard argument on this issue, and whether or not such an extension of time should be granted in all the circumstances would necessitate hearing argument as to any prejudice that might thereby be suffered by other interested parties and, accordingly, the prima facie view, which I have expressed above, is subject to that qualification.
I also note that in addition to the Notice of Motion instituting the present proceedings which was filed on 21 March 1995, the Plaintiff also filed on the same day, a summons under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/). The effect of my judgment is that the Plaintiff was entitled to file that summons without leave and accordingly, does not require any extension of time in order to commence those proceedings. If, on the other hand, it were to be held, on appeal, that leave was required in respect of that summons, I indicate that I would have been prepared to grant such leave under [section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s5.html) of the [Felons (Civil
Proceedings) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/) nunc pro tunc.
I record that I have been informed by letter dated 15 February 1996 from the solicitors for the Defendant, and with the consent of the solicitors for the Plaintiff, that the Plaintiff's grandmother, Joyce Grenville Peterson, died on 1 January
The gift made to the Plaintiff by the deceased in his will dated 1 July 1994, paragraphs 4.50 and 4.51, is expressed to be subject to a life interest in favour of the late Mrs. Peterson, provided that the
Plaintiff survived the deceased by one calendar month (which, of course, he did). This fact will, of course, be relevant in the substantive [Family
Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) proceedings but does not affect the present judgment.
Counsel for the Defendant submitted, as I understood him, that even if the Plaintiff were successful in the present application, the costs of the
Defendant of this application should be paid out of the Plaintiff's share in the estate of the deceased. As the Plaintiff has failed in the present application upon the basis that it was unnecessary, I see no reason why the
Plaintiff should not pay the Defendant's costs of this application, nor do I see any reason why I should not order that those costs be paid out of the
Plaintiff's share in the estate of the deceased. Counsel for the Plaintiff, as
I understood it, agreed that such an order would be appropriate in the event that the Plaintiff failed in the present application.
I indicate, however, that in my opinion that would have been the appropriate order even if counsel for the Plaintiff had not agreed.
Accordingly, I dismiss the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion and order that the costs of the Defendant be paid out of the Plaintiff
Is share in the estate of the late Henry Leslie Maddrell.
