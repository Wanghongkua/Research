MAGAR versus SCHWEIZER 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
Introduction 
On 14 January 1997 Mr J.E. Heagney LCM determined a case in which a solicitor,
Mr Norbert Joseph Schweizer, for whom Mr D.L. Davies of Senior Counsel and Mr
T.K. Luckman of Counsel appeared, was the plaintiff, and Mr Sobhi Ayad Magar, for whom Mr G.P. McNally of Counsel appeared, was the defendant. Relevantly for present purposes there were two issues. The first was whether Mr Schweizer and Mr Magar had entered into an enforceable agreement whereby Mr Magar had agreed with Mr Schweizer that he, Mr Magar, would pay to Mr Schweizer the legal costs incurred by a company, Acacia Packaging Pty Limited, which was controlled by Mr Magar. This agreement was alleged to have been entered into because that company was in financial difficulties, and Mr Schweizer was only prepared to continue to act for it if Mr Magar agreed to pay his fees of doing so.

The second was whether Mr Schweizer had satisfied the condition precedent to suing Mr Magar provided for by s.198(1) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) , which is in the following terms:- "Proceedings for the recovery of costs incurred by a solicitor in transacting any business shall not be commenced or maintained against any person unless at least one month has passed since the person has been given a bill of costs so incurred." 
The Magistrate, having found that the agreement for which Mr Schweizer contended had been entered into, that the requirements of [s.198(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s198.html) had been satisfied, and that, accordingly, Mr Schweizer was entitled to a "verdict and judgment" for $24,204.27, was asked to state a case pursuant to [s.101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s101.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) , which, of course, only allows for consideration of error "in point of law". He stated his case on 9 May 1997 and, on 15 May 1997, a Summons was filed whereby
Mr Magar claimed a decision or determination of the questions and matters stated for decision or determination therein.

The Stated Case was divided into five main paragraphs, the first of which set forth the Magistrate's determination; the second of which set forth the facts he found; the third of which stated his grounds of determination; the fourth of which stated Mr Magar's contention; and the fifth of which asserted:- "The matter to be determined by the Court is whether my determination was erroneous in point of law." 
Paragraph 4, which identified Mr Magar as "the appellant", stated:- "The appellant contends that my determination was erroneous in point of law upon the grounds: 
After finding that: exhibit 10 did not even insinuate that the defendant had agreed to be personally liable for the fees, and that the terms of the conversation in the plaintiff's office of itself did not point with any compelling force to a conclusion that the defendant had agreed to be personally liable for the fees of Acacia Packaging Pty Limited.

I, erred in law in failing to find no agreement between the appellant and the respondent on the grounds of: 
No meeting of the minds, 
Uncertainty.

That I was in error in finding that the plaintiff's bill of costs complied with [Part 11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p11) of the [Legal Profession Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).

Alternatively that I erred in law in failing to find that the agreement related only to the one file." 
On the hearing of the Summons, Mr McNally tendered the Magistrate's judgment, which was neither appended to nor incorporated in the Stated Case. I had doubts as to whether, in these circumstances, the judgment was admissible. But as no objection was raised to its tender, I accepted it and it became Exhibit
A. Mr McNally also sought to tender the bills, which were in evidence as
Exhibit 11 before the Magistrate, to which objection was taken. They were not incorporated in or appended to the Stated Case and, objection having been taken, I ruled that they were inadmissible. I have given my reasons for that ruling. I would repeat, at this point, that there is an obligation on a party seeking to have a case stated to ensure that the Magistrate incorporates into it all matters, which are necessary to enable any argument sought to be advanced on any point of law to be made. [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p32) [rule (b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s4.html) makes clear that the Stated Case is to state "concisely the facts and documents necessary to enable the Court to decide the questions arising or otherwise to hear and determine the proceedings on the Stated Case".

As Yeldham J said in Glover versus MacDougall [[1976] 2 NSWLR 359] at p.361:- "It is also clear from the authorities that the magistrate, in the stated case, which I appreciate in practice is drafted by the parties, should categorically and clearly set out all the facts found by him upon the evidence before him which are relevant to the questions posed for determination by this Court." 
When this ruling was made Mr McNally submitted that I should refer the matter back to the Magistrate pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p32) [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s7.html) to state further facts. I declined to do so, in the exercise of my discretion, for the reasons I then gave.

Possible Legislative Reform 
In my respectful opinion it would be appropriate for the legislature to give consideration to whether this Court should be the forum in which appeals on points of law, by way of stated cases, from a Magistrate are determined in civil cases. In most such cases the amount in issue is, relatively speaking, very small being an amount within the financial jurisdiction limit of the
Local Court. The jurisdiction of the District Court has been increased to $750,000 and, at this time, it seems somewhat anachronistic that this Court is called upon to determine points of law arising in matters involving, as the present does, an amount of less than $25,000. However, whether there is a change is a matter ultimately for the determination of the legislature. I would assume, however, that if the legislature comes to consider the matter it will also have regard to the costs to the parties of requiring that the proceedings be brought in this Court.

The Contract Point 
Mr McNally's first submission was that the Magistrate's findings did not enable him to conclude, as he did, that there was an agreement between the parties of the type for which Mr Schweizer contended. The submission was that notwithstanding the conversations, which the Magistrate found to be proved, his statements that the letter, Exhibit 10, of itself did not "even insinuate that" Mr Magar had agreed to be personally liable for the legal fees incurred by the company and, secondly, that the terms of the conversation "of themselves do not point with any compelling force to such a conclusion" vitiated his finding that there was such an agreement.

In my opinion these submissions must be rejected because they do not give rise to any error in point of law. The conversations, which the Magistrate accepted took place and which are recorded in his reasons, coupled with his rejection of the evidence of Mr Magar could only lead, in my opinion, to the conclusion that there was such a contract. It is unclear to me, and for present purposes it does not matter, why the Magistrate qualified his findings in this respect by the use of the words relied upon in the submissions. It is irrelevant because he has found, as a fact, that there was such an agreement and no submission was made, nor on his findings could it have been made, that there was no evidence on which he could come to that conclusion. Indeed, on the evidence he accepted, there was a strong case made by Mr Schweizer. He was only required to come to the conclusion on that matter of fact, namely whether a contract existed, on the balance of probabilities and the use of the word "compelling" tended to intrude, at least inferentially, a higher standard of proof than Mr Schweizer was obliged to meet.

However all that may be, the position is that the Magistrate found as a fact that there was an agreement in the terms alleged by Mr Schweizer. That was a finding of fact which was clearly open on the evidence and, accordingly, there was no error of law.

I only pause to mention that even if it could have been said, and in my view it could not, that such a finding was perverse, that would not have been sufficient to invalidate it as an error of law. In Azzopardi versus Tasman UEB
Industries Limited [(1985) 4 NSWLR 139], Glass JA, with whom Samuels JA agreed, considered what will constitute errors of law at pp.156-157. His Honour said, in a passage which is well known:- "Errors may be committed by a Workers' Compensation Judge at one of three points viz determining the facts by way of primary findings and inferences, directing himself as to the law and applying the law to the facts found. At the first stage the determination of facts by a reasoning process marred though it be by patent error, illogicality or perversity will, as has been said, never be vulnerable to attack as an error of law by an applicant for compensation. At the second stage any error made will by definition be an error of law. At the third stage when the law correctly stated is applied to the facts found in order to produce a conclusion error may intrude again. An erroneous conclusion that facts properly determined fail to satisfy a statutory test, for example, injury arising out of the course of employment, substantial interruption to journey, or failure to provide suitable employment will ordinarily be an erroneous conclusion of fact. It is only in marginal cases that the statutory test is satisfied or not satisfied as a matter of law, because no other application is reasonably open: Hope versus Bathurst City Council; Australian Gaslight Co versus Valuer General. Accordingly this Court will not entertain unexplained perversity of result as a ground for intervention although it will correct perverse or unreasonable applications of law to the facts found." 
I repeat, for the purpose of emphasis, that in my opinion there is no suggestion that the Magistrate's finding in relation to the agreement was tainted by any form of perversity.

The Bill Of Costs Point 
In his reasons the Magistrate said:- "The defendant's argument that the plaintiff's bills are not in proper form is conceded to be a `technical' one, but it remains one that is open to him to make. The relevant bills (Exhibit 11) appear to me, however, to be in proper form. They set out the work which the plaintiff says he has done and the amount which he is charging for that work: should he wish to do so, the defendant could have the bills taxed in their present form and, as I understand the law, no more is required." 
In paragraph 2(q) he found:- "The plaintiff's bills (Exhibit 11) are in proper form, setting out the work which the plaintiff says he has done and the amount which he is charging for that work. The defendant could have the bills taxed in their present form." 
In paragraph 3(c) the Magistrate set out a number of submissions, which had been made by Mr Magar in relation to the bill of costs. Having done so he said:- "I did not accept the submissions and found that the bills appeared to be in a proper form. They set out the work which the plaintiff said he had done and the amount which he is charging for that work. I found that should he wish to do so, the defendant could have the bills taxed in their present form and, as I understood the law, no more is required." 
Mr McNally submitted that a solicitor's right to recover remuneration is governed by the relevant provisions of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) .
Reference was made to [s.198](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s198.html) and to the requirement that a bill of costs "should comprise a detailed account of specific items of work done, showing the specific charges allotted to each item": Ex parte Farmers Fertilisers Corp Limited <case>; [(1916) 16 SR 645];
Florence Investments Pty Limited versus H.G. Slater & Co [[1975] 2 NSWLR ], and the unreported decision of Master Greenwood in Ross Jones & Ors v
Flynn.

It was accepted by Mr Magar, but not by Mr Schweizer as I understood it, that the bills should have met, at the relevant time, the requirements of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p52) [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s49.html) and, therefore, set forth in short terms a chronological description of the work done by the solicitor and, beside each item, the costs claimed for the work described in the item. Mr Davies submitted that the proper approach was that stated in Action Australia Pty Limited versus Michael Frankel (Barr AJ - December 1994 - unreported), in which his Honour considered "bill of costs" under the Act and adopted the approach of Bowen CJ in Florence Investments
Pty Limited, where his Honour had found that items must be specified and charged separately and not included in one lump sum; that the account must be such that it gave the client such reasonable information as would enable him or her to take advice as to its taxation; and that the account need not be so explicit on its face as to enable a solicitor at once to say and without further enquiries whether the charges were proper. The issue therefore is whether the bill sets forth the work done and what has been charged for it.
The findings of the Magistrate make it clear, in my opinion, that these are the precise matters to which he looked and there is no reason for reading into his findings any limitation. The findings of fact as to the contents of the bill are impervious to attack.

In the light of these findings, assuming for the moment that the conclusion was erroneous, the words of Glass JA in relation to "an erroneous conclusion", which I have quoted, are obviously relevant as showing that if there was one it was an error of fact. However, I am not satisfied that there was an erroneous conclusion.

In Mahony versus Industrial Registrar of New South Wales & Anor [(1987) 8
NSWLR 1](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%208%20NSWLR%201 "View LawCiteRecord" ) it was held that the decision whether a relationship is one of employer and employee or principal and independent contractor is a finding of ultimate fact determined by applying criteria of law to findings of primary fact. It was also held that provided the correct legal criteria had been applied, the decision was invulnerable to review by way of certiorari, even if the findings of fact were perverse or unreasonable. Accordingly, contrary to Mr
McNally's submission, the conclusion to which the Magistrate came, namely that the bills were in a form which would enable them to be taxed, based as it was upon his findings of fact as to the form of the bills, is not a finding of law but a finding of ultimate fact. It cannot be disturbed and, if I may say so, there is no basis, having regard to the primary facts found by the Magistrate, why it should be.

Conclusions 
In my opinion the question posed in paragraph 5 of the Stated Case must be answered "No" and, accordingly, I order that the Summons be dismissed with costs.

Addendum 
A short written submission was made in relation to the third question raised in the Stated Case, but it was not elaborated on in oral submissions. In my opinion, the question and the submission made clear that the point involved was not one of law, but of fact. It must suffer the same fate as the other questions.
