Application of Globite Australia [1996] NSWSC 184 (11 June 1996) 
APPLICATION OF GLOBITE AUSTRALIA LTD /96 
TUESDAY 11 JUNE 1996 
THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application to issue shares at a discount under <case> of the Corporations Law. The court has the task under that section to make sure that all the pre-conditions are fulfilled. However, the court appears only to have power to approve an issue of shares at a discount if the relevant shares are first offered to every holder of that class of shares in proportion to the number of shares in the class already held.

The instant case involves the creation and issue of preference shares at a discount in a case where there are currently only in existence ordinary shares. Section subs 2 envisages that the Court may only approve of the issue of shares at a discount if the shares to be issued are of a class already issued. Why this should be so is quite unclear.

The problem has been got around in this case by the directors meeting and allocating one preference share at full value to a solicitor. The solicitor was then offered 800,000 preference shares at a discount, which he declined, so that the statutory pre-conditions have now been fulfilled.

The matters which the court looks to in this sort of application, as set out in Re Jarass Pty Ltd [(1988) 6 ACLC 767]; Re "Air
North West" Pty Ltd [(1988) 6 ACLC 1143]; Re
Mallina Holdings Ltd [(1989) 15 ACLR 493] and Re
Esmeralda Exploration Ltd [(1991) 33 FCR 192] at 198-9, having been complied with, I make orders in accordance with the short minutes which I have initialled, dated and will place with the papers.
