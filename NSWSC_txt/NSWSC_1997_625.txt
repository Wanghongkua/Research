JUDGMENT 
GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the Campbelltown District Court by his Honour Judge Ford QC on 18 June 1997. On that occasion the applicant was convicted upon three counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. 
On each count he was sentenced to serve concurrent terms consisting of a minimum term of twelve months with an additional term of four months.

On this application written submissions, as confirmed by Mr Byrne of senior counsel, indicate that no attack is made upon the quantum of the sentences as such. The sole matter sought to be agitated is the omission to have regard to the [Home Detention Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/).

It should be emphasised that the applicant was represented by senior counsel at the sentencing proceedings. He did not appear in this application.

Nothing was said to the sentencing judge about any desire to have reference to the [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) and, as that statute itself makes clear, it is designed to provide a facility for the service of full-time imprisonment other than in, what I might describe as, the routine ways.

I regard the current application as facing some difficulties. Whilst it may be that a refusal to refer a matter for assessment could fall within the expanded definition of sentence for the purpose of the Criminal Appeal Act, in the current case, as I pointed out, what is sought to be brought before this Court is simply what amounts to an afterthought.

It is possible that there is no inhibition upon the applicant's having returned in the interim to the District Court Judge and made application for referral and it seems to me that the course which this Court should adopt is to achieve what would have been achieved by making application at an appropriate time to that judge.

For my part, I would not wish to express any view as to whether this case is or is not appropriate for the exercise of discretion by the District Court judge to refer for assessment under the [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) and I would regard it as a matter entirely for him to assess the matter in accordance with his appreciation of all the circumstances.

This Court has power under section 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to remit any matter or issue to a court of trial for determination and this is a matter which can still be appropriately dealt with in that court.

The applicant has been granted bail in the Supreme Court pending this appeal.
The Crown does not oppose the continuance of that bail upon appropriate conditions. It is more practical for bail to be continued by a single judge of the Supreme Court rather than by this Court sitting in Banco.

I would propose the following order, that the matter be remitted to the
District Court at Campbelltown for such consideration as that Court deems appropriate in relation to the sentence imposed on 18 June 1997 and the [Home
Detention Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/).

JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the presiding judge and with the order proposed by his Honour. 
SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
GROVE J: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed. Simpson J will deal with the bail application. * * *
