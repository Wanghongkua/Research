JUDGMENT
The applicant Paul Gerard Weston, as Special Purpose Liquidator of One.Tel Limited (SPL), seeks orders fixing his remuneration for the periods 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011 and 1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011, and for payment of the approved amounts (net of interim payments) out of the assets of One.Tel and (as to that part that is payable by an external litigation funder) out of the Special Purpose Liquidation bank account.
As Black J has explained <case>, [6]-[8]], in the context of this liquidation, the procedure for referral to a registrar and an interim payment in the meantime has become well-established, such orders having been made in respect of the periods 1 July 2009 to 28 February 2010 ("the first remuneration period") <case>; 1 March 2010 to 31 December 2010 ("the second remuneration period") [Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq) (Ward J, 14 March 2011, unreported)]; 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011 ("the third remuneration period") [Onefone Australia Pty Limited versus One.Tel Ltd (Hammerschlag J, 14 June 2011)]; 1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011 ("the fourth remuneration period") [Onefone Australia Pty Limited versus One.Tel Ltd (Barrett J, 19 December 2011)]; and 1 October 2011 to 9 March 2012 ("the fifth remuneration period") <case> J, 23 April 2012)]. 
The next step is the consideration of the registrar's report. On 26 September 2011, following report by the registrar, Barrett J made orders fixing the remuneration of the SPL for the first and second remuneration periods, and orders for payment to the SPL of the approved amounts (net of the interim payments) out of the assets of One.Tel and (as to the funded component) out of the Special Purpose Liquidation bank account. The present application seeks similar orders in respect of the third and fourth remuneration periods.
As to the third period, the SPL seeks that his remuneration not previously approved by the Committee of Inspection ("COI") be determined in the amount of $84,405 plus GST - the COI having previously approved payment of part of the remuneration for that period that was payable by the litigation funder. On 14 June 2011, Hammerschlag J made orders for an interim payment of two thirds of the claim for the first period, reference to a registrar for assessment and quantification of the whole of the claim, and costs of the application. The Registrar has reported on the claim and recommended payment of the amount sought of $84,405 plus GST, comprising the $56,250 plus GST interim payment, and a further $28,135 plus GST, which the SPL now seeks together with the additional costs and expenses incurred in making the application.
As to the fourth period, the SPL seeks that his remuneration be determined in the amount of $232,876 plus GST - the COI not having previously approved payment of any part of the remuneration for that period. On 19 December 2011, Barrett J made orders for an interim payment of two thirds of the claim for the second period, and reference to a registrar for assessment and quantification of the whole of the claim. The Registrar has reported on the claim and recommended payment of the amount sought of $232,876 plus GST, comprising the $155,250.66 plus GST interim payment, and a further $77,625.34 plus GST. That amount, in turn, comprises $28,499.67 plus GST for "funded work" payable by the SPL's litigation funder, and $49,125.67 plus GST to be paid out of the assets of One.Tel. The SPL now seeks payment of the further amounts of $28,499.67 plus GST for funded work and $49,125.67 plus GST for unfunded work, together with the costs and expenses incurred in making the application.
The quantum of the SPL's remuneration has in the past been the subject of controversy, and some elements of his claimed remuneration have not been allowed <case>; [(2010) 80 ACSR 11].], [11]-[13] (Black J)].
While, prima facie, I would be inclined to adopt the Registrar's report, before making orders it seems to me that the members of the COI, and/or the general purpose liquidators, should be afforded an opportunity to be heard, and it should be ascertained whether the SPL is prepared to give an undertaking to repay any remuneration referable to the removal proceedings if it be found, in those proceedings, that he was not entitled to such remuneration. 
I will make directions accordingly.
