Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund P/L & Anor versus Batemans Bay Local
Aboriginal Land Council & Anor /96 
Monday, 3 June 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The first defendant is a body corporate constituted under s.6 of the [Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/). The second defendant is the body corporate constituted under s.22 of that Act.

By deed dated 22 May 1996 there was established a trust fund, of which the first defendant is the trustee, called the New South Wales Aboriginal Land
Councils Funeral Contribution Fund (to which I will refer as the Fund), which made provision for the payment of funeral benefits to Aboriginal persons in
New South Wales (and their spouses and children) who subscribed to the Fund.
In the event of any insufficiency of trust assets, liability to pay benefits to subscribers and to discharge liabilities of the Fund was assumed under the deed by the second defendant. By further deed of the same date between the two defendants, management of the affairs of the first defendant in respect of its duties, responsibilities and obligations as trustee of the Fund, apart from two minor discretionary powers, was vested in the second defendant.

It is evident that the scheme for the payment of funeral benefits to subscribing Aboriginal and associated persons in New South Wales which found expression in these deeds, was initiated, and is in practical terms to be conducted, by the second defendant, and that the only reason for the involvement of the first defendant was an apparent perception that the operation of such a scheme was not within the functions conferred on the second defendant in its own right by s.23 of the [Aboriginal Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/), but was within the functions conferred on a Local Aboriginal Land Council by that Act (s.12(d)) and that by s.23(f) there was conferred on the second defendant the function "with the agreement of a Local Aboriginal Land Council, to manage any of the affairs of that Council." 
The operation of contributory funeral funds is controlled and regulated by the [Funeral Funds Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/). [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of that Act, so far as immediately relevant, provides as follows: "11(1) A person shall not carry on or advertise that he carries on or is willing to carry on any contributory funeral benefit business unless that person is: ...
 exempt from the application of this section pursuant to subs.(3).
 ...

A person is exempt from the application of this section if: that person is: ...
 a person for the time being declared by the Minister by order published in the Gazette to be a person exempt from the application of this section or a person belonging to a class of persons so declared; ..." 
On 17 May 1996 there was published in the Gazette an order by the Minister for
Fair Trading, dated 3 April 1996, purporting to declare pursuant to [s.11(3)(a)(v)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) that upon publication of the order "New South Wales Aboriginal Land Councils
Funeral Contribution Fund is exempt from the application of [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the Act." 
The defendants intend that the Fund will commence accepting members and subscriptions on 3 June 1996, that is today, and they have advertised that intention throughout the Aboriginal community in New South Wales.

The first plaintiff is presently operating a contributory funeral benefit business for members of the Aboriginal community in New South Wales and their spouses and children. The first plaintiff was declared to be exempt from the application of [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/) by an order of the Minister published in the Gazette in April 1994. The first plaintiff's fund has approximately 3,000 subscribing members. The second plaintiff, which is under the same management as the first plaintiff, operates a contributory life insurance fund business, also for members of the
Aboriginal community in New South Wales and their spouses and children, and that fund has approximately 4,000 members. There is evidence that currently approximately 400 new members per week have been subscribing to the funds operated by the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs have two working directors, three office staff and thirteen commission agents. Subscription rates to the first plaintiff's fund range from $4.00 to $26.00 per fortnight, depending on age, for the provision of funeral benefits of varying amounts up to a maximum of $6,000.00. Subscription rates to the second plaintiff's fund range from $6.00 to $26.00 per fortnight, again depending on age, for the provision of payments on death in the sum of $6,000.00. The conditions of eligibility for membership of, and benefits from, the two funds of the plaintiffs differ, but they are said to be effectively complementary funds. The subscription rates proposed for the defendants' Fund are $15.00 per annum for persons under twenty and $40.00 per annum for persons over nineteen, for the provision of basic funeral costs within certain limits.
It appears that the subscription rates proposed for the defendants' Fund are likely to be substantially less than would render the assets of the Fund sufficient for the payment of the benefits proposed and that it is contemplated that the fund would be supplemented by donations and the proceeds of fund raising activities, but more importantly, will be subsidised to any necessary extent by the second defendant from its resources, including, it would appear, monies made available to it under the [Aboriginal Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/).

The plaintiffs assert that by reason that the proposed subscription levels of the defendants' Fund are substantially below levels which would fund the provision of the proposed benefits, the plaintiffs' funds will be unable to compete and will rapidly lose members to the defendants' Fund and within a short period will be compelled to cease operations.

There is presently before the Court an application by the plaintiffs for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from carrying on a contributory funeral benefit business in New South Wales. The basis for that application is that the operation of the Fund by the defendants will be unlawful on each of two grounds, namely: that it will involve a breach of [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/), in that the purported exemption published on 17 May 1996 is ineffective; and that it will involve each of the defendants acting beyond the functions conferred on it by the [Aboriginal Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/).

In the course of submissions this morning, a third composite ground has been propounded, namely that by reason of the provisions of the [Aboriginal Land
Rights Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) specifying the respective functions of the defendants, any exemption purportedly granted to the defendants or either of them under [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/) in respect of the proposed Fund, would necessarily be unlawful.

The defendants contend, inter alia, that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring proceedings to restrain any alleged breach by the defendants of the kind relied on, on any branch of the argument. The standing relied on by the plaintiffs is that of persons operating a business with which the defendants' prospective business will compete in the same limited market, on a basis which is likely to lead to the destruction of the plaintiffs' business, with corresponding economic damage to the plaintiffs. If the decision of Jacobs J in Helicopter Utilities versus Australian National Airlines Commission [(1961) 80
WN 48], which was followed by White J in Consolidated Press Holdings versus Totalisator
Agency Board [(1984) 37 SASR 67], were to still represent the law in this area, then it would in my view be apparent that the plaintiffs have no standing to maintain the proceedings, but I think that the decisions of the High Court in Australian Conservation Foundation v
The Commonwealth 146 CLR 493 and Onus versus Alcoa of Australia <case>; [149 CLR 27] and the discussion in those cases, and other recent authorities, evidence a redefinition and liberalisation of the rules as to standing, to which effect should be given, as was pointed out by Angel J in Oatmont & Anor v
Australian Agricultural Co & Ors <case>; [(1991) 9 ACLC 1123], in a judgment the relevant part of which was approved on appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Northern Territory (see 10 ACLC 1220 at ). His Honour expressed his disagreement with the decisions in Helicopter
Utilities and Consolidated Press Holdings and held, in substance, that interference with commercial or business interests is now sufficient to confer standing in cases of this kind.

In view of the fluidity and uncertainty of the law in this area, the severe time constraints associated with the preparation for and hearing of the present interlocutory application, and the state of the evidence, it is inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings to determine the question of the plaintiffs' standing on a final basis. It is, I think, sufficient for present purposes to say that the plaintiffs have an arguable case for sufficient standing to bring these proceedings and should not be denied interlocutory relief to which they might otherwise be entitled on the ground of absence of standing.

It is strongly arguable that the Minister's order published on 17 May 1996 was ineffective to give rise to any exemption from the application of [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/), pursuant to subs.(3)(a)(v). What was declared to be exempt by that order was not a "person", as the section requires, but the proposed name of a trust fund which had not then even been constituted. There is therefore a strong case to be made that the carrying on by the defendants or either of them of the scheme established by the deeds of 22 May 1996, will be in breach of [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/) and therefore unlawful.

On the evidence presently before the Court, the carrying on of that scheme is likely seriously to damage the commercial interests of the plaintiffs, to an extent which may well terminate their present business within a short period of time. So far as the defendants are concerned, an interlocutory injunction would delay, for the period of its duration, the effective commencement of their scheme and give rise to some confusion among those members of the
Aboriginal community in New South Wales who have been made aware of the imminent commencement of that scheme.

There are also various discretionary matters relied on by the defendants in support of their resistance to interlocutory relief, including submissions to the following effect: that equity will not readily restrain, by injunction, breaches of the criminal law; that the evidence discloses that the order published on 17 May 1996 was intended to validate the operation of the scheme subsequently established by the deeds of 22 May 1996, that prosecution for any breach of [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) in consequence of the ineffectiveness of the purported exemption, which may be attributed to error on the part of the Minister or her advisers, is unlikely, and that the Minister could now make a further order for exemption remedying any technical defects in the order published on 17 May 1996; that the evident purpose of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/) is to protect the interests of subscribers to contributory funeral funds, rather than to protect the operations of one such fund as against competition by another; and that the operation of the defendants' scheme will be for the public benefit and in particular for the benefit of the Aboriginal community in New
South Wales, even if it does damage the commercial interests of the plaintiffs.

Having considered all the matters put to me, I have reached the conclusion that if this matter can be brought on for a final hearing within a reasonably short period, an interlocutory injunction should be granted on the ground pressed in relation to [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/), in order to preserve the status quo. Although I recognise the weight of the discretionary considerations relied on by the defendants, they do not persuade me that the plaintiffs have no real prospect of success on a final hearing, and at any such final hearing they can be fully evaluated. I recognise also that the question of the apparent protective purpose of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/) may also be relevant to the question of the plaintiffs' standing, which of course will be open for consideration on a final hearing.

In such a case as this, once the Court has found that a plaintiff has a serious case for relief at a final hearing, generally speaking the balance of convenience will determine the question of interlocutory relief pending that hearing and the Court does not undertake a preliminary trial and give or withhold interlocutory relief upon a forecast as to the ultimate result of the case. The present is not a case where the decision to grant or refuse an interlocutory injunction will in a practical sense determine the substance of the matter in issue cf Kolback Securities versus Epoch Mining [8 NSWLR ] at 535-6.

I have omitted so far any consideration of the grounds of challenge to the defendants' activities based on the provisions of the [Aboriginal Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/), because of a submission on the part of the defendants that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a claim for relief of the kind here sought on those grounds, by virtue of the provisions of [ss.71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s71.html) and [20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) of the [Land and Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/).
Because I have decided that subject to a speedy final hearing there should be an interlocutory injunction on a ground unrelated to the [Aboriginal Land
Rights Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/), I do not propose to devote any attention today to the questions which have been debated as to the jurisdiction of this Court either in relation to the limitation of functions of the respective defendants under the [Aboriginal
Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/), per se, or, what might be a more complicated question, in relation to the composite ground to which I have already referred under which it is said that no lawful exemption could be given pursuant to [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/s11.html) of the [Funeral Funds
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ffa1979150/) to either of the defendants by reason of the limitation of their functions under the [Aboriginal Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/).

When I referred earlier to an early final hearing, I had in mind a hearing within a matter of days or weeks. It so happens that I could myself hear this case on a final basis in the period from 19 to 21 June, which is about two and a half weeks away, and because I do regard this as an urgent matter for final hearing, I will offer those dates and ask counsel to make any submissions they may wish to as to whether the matter should not be set down for final hearing at that time and as to any directions which may be needed in the meantime.
