Judgment  
The plaintiff, by originating process, filed on 27 April 2011 applies under [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (2001) for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on it by the defendant, Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. 
The debt to which the statutory demand relates is in the sum of $145,922.55, and is described as follows: "

Description of the Debt 
Amount of the Debt 
Running Balance Account deficit debt as at 1 April 2011 in respect of amounts due under the BAS provisions as defined in subsection 995-1(1) of the [Income
Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/) ('the
ITAA 1997') [BAS provisions include, generally: the goods and services tax provisions, the PAYG withholding provisions, the PAYG instalment provisions, the fringe benefits tax instalment provisions and the deferred company instalment provisions], administrative overpayments due under [section
AAZN](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazn.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) ('the
TAA 1953') and the general interest charge payable under [section
AAZF](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazf.html) of the TAA 1953, being a debt due and payable by the company pursuant to [section
AAZH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazh.html) of the TAA 1953 ,922.55 "
The debt is thus a debt due under the specified provisions of the taxation laws of the Commonwealth. 
The transcript will show the explanation of the facts of this case given to the court by Mr Acheampong, who has appeared for the Deputy Commissioner. That statement of facts is not questioned by the plaintiff and is consistent with the evidence given by Mr Casonato in his affidavit of 30 June 2011. 
The facts as to the basis for the plaintiff's indebtedness under the taxation legislation are indistinguishable from those that came before the court in Mossimo Systems International Pty Ltd versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  <case>, Matrix Holdings Pty Ltd versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [[2011] NSWSC 324], are wholly applicable to this case. There is no basis on which it is open to the court in the present proceedings to come to any conclusion different from the conclusion reached in each of the earlier cases (being, I might say, cases involving companies associated with the present plaintiff and for which Ms Caporale, an authorised person, appeared as she has appeared today for the plaintiff). 
The outcome is inevitable. There is no basis whatsoever for relief based on either <case>(a) or <case>. The reasons are succinctly stated in the written outline of submissions provided to the court by Mr Acheampong which will be kept in the court file. 
The orders of the court are as follows: 
Order that the proceedings be dismissed.
Order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.
