CRISTINA CALIN versus DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIVE SERVICES 
CA 40264/97 March 1998 
Meagher JA, Sheller JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: In this matter Senior Commissioner Hopkins made an award for the claimant, the Department of Corrective Services in the Compensation Court of New South Wales on 11 April 1997. On 9 May 1997 the opponent who was the respondent that time filed an appeal in this Court against Senior Commissioner Hopkins' decision. That appeal was incompetent, it should have been made to a judge of the Compensation Court pursuant to <case> of the [Compensation Court Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) . 
Then without discontinuing these proceedings she filed a notice of motion in the Compensation Court of New South Wales applying for a variety of orders including a review of the decision of Senior Commissioner Hopkins.

Eventually that notice of motion was heard by Campbell CCJ on 4 September 1997 and 3 October 1997 with judgement given on 12 December 1997. That judgment was adverse to the opponent Ms Calin.

Thereupon on 5 January 1998 Ms Calin filed an amended notice of appeal purporting to amend the original notice of appeal. The claimant the original respondent, the Department of Corrective Services, now brings these proceedings in order to strike out the appeal as incompetent.

We shall have to accede to this. The incompetence arises really out of three different factors. In the first place the original notice of appeal was incompetent because this Court was not the correct Appellate Court. The so called amended notice of appeal does not overcome that problem. An incompetent appeal cannot be cured by an amendment the purpose of which is to create an appeal from a judgment which in any event has not been delivered at the day of filing the original appeal.

Moreover, this is the second ground why the current appeal is incompetent, an appeal has to be instituted within twenty one days of the material date. The appeal as amended does not comply with this provision.

The third ground is that there is a double violation of [s.32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s32.html) of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) in that the appeal does not raise any issue of law and does not relate to the admission or rejection of evidence.

Therefore Order 1 as sought in the notice of motion that the appeal be struck out as incompetent must be made. As to costs we have already intimated that we do not think the claimant is entitled to her costs in view of a number of factors, the chief of which is the long delay she has been responsible for in bringing this application.

Those will be the orders of the Court.
