WORKERS' COMPENSATION - action at common law - deduction for compensation under [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  
The respondent sued the appellant for damages for industrial deafness sustained prior to 4 pm on 30 June 1987. The [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  precluded common law recovery for further deafness suffered after that time.
The trial Judge made no deduction for the respondent's rights under the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) . The employer appealed by leave.

HELD: Allowing the appeal: (1) The inchoate rights under the Workers' Compensation Act 1926  which the respondent had ceased to exist as he had not given notice under <case>(4B)(b)(i) prior to its repeal. However he was clearly entitled to compensation under <case> of the 1987 Act on giving the necessary notice, and those rights were not directly affected by the recovery of damages. (2) Neither the 1926 Act nor the 1987 Act precluded the respondent from recovering damages from the appellant. (3) The damages payable by the appellant should be reduced to reflect the respondent's right to compensation under the 1987 Act. Kempsey District Hospital versus Thackham [(1995) 36 NSWLR 492] applied. (4) Entitlement to lump sum compensation for pain and suffering under <case> of the [Workers Compensation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) must be proved by the party alleging the entitlement which in this case was the appellant. It had not called evidence to establish the amount the respondent would probably receive under <case> and the respondent's damages should not be reduced because of any right to such an award. 
ORDERS 
Appeal allowed.

Set aside the judgment of the District Court except as to costs and in lieu thereof substitute judgment for the plaintiff for $37,775 with effect from 5 November 1997.

The appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.

TRANSFIELD PTY LTD versus MARIO MASTROIANNI 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: The respondent, who was 51 at the date of trial, started working for the appellant in the construction industry on 10 February 1964. Because of the cyclical nature of that industry he was laid off from time to time but later re-employed. He worked for W G Pty Ltd for the 5 years ending on 18 September 1983 but was re-employed by the appellant the next day. He was laid off for the last time on 28 April 1993 and then worked for Gastonbury Steel for about 6 months but had not worked since. 
The respondent sued the appellant for damages for his industrial deafness caused by exposure to noise at work before 4 pm on 30 June 1987 when the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) came into force. No claim was made for further hearing losses after that date, no doubt because of the restrictions in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p5) of that Act but these did not affect his rights to damages for industrial deafness caused before 4 pm on 30 June 1987. See Hobbs versus Costain Australia
Ltd (C/A, 16/2/95, unreported).

The trial Judge, Newton ADCJ, first assessed damages for the respondent's total hearing loss and then deducted one seventh for his employment with W G
Pty Ltd, and another seventh for his employment since 30 June 1987. The appellant does not challenge this approach but the Court will correct a mathematical error which resulted in judgment being entered for $2,000 less than the amount required by the Judge's findings.

The appeal to this Court, by leave, challenges the decision of the Judge, without giving reasons, to make no deduction for the respondent's compensation rights under the 1987 Act. The respondent had not crystalised those rights by decision or settlement prior to the trial, there was no agreement as to their value and the Judge made no relevant findings.

There is no doubt that the respondent had rights under the Workers
Compensation Acts 1926 and 1987 in respect of his industrial deafness.
Section 7 (4B)(b) of the 1926 Act provided that where a worker suffered a loss of hearing caused by a gradual process that injury should be deemed to have happened when he gave notice to his employer provided he was in a relevant employment (para (i)) and if not it should be deemed to have happened on his last day in such an employment (para (ii)). The respondent did not give a notice under <case> (4B)(b)(i) prior to the repeal of the 1926 Act so his rights to compensation for industrial deafness under that Act then ceased to exist.

Section 17 (1)(a) of the 1987 Act contains equivalent provisions. The respondent's exposure to industrial noise continued after 30 June 1987, while he was employed by the appellant and Gastonbury Steel, and the Judge found that he suffered a further hearing loss during this period. He did not give notice to the appellant while in its employment and there is no evidence that he ever gave a notice to Gastonbury Steel.

The respondent's rights to compensation under the 1987 Act therefore remain inchoate. However, subject only to the effect of this award of damages, there is nothing to stop the respondent from giving notice of this injury at any time (s 88 (1) as modified by <case> (1)(b)). If and when such a notice is given s 17 (1)(a)(ii) will deem his injury to have happened on the date in October when he last worked for Gastonbury Steel. In the language of Barwick CJ in The Commissioner for Railways versus Bain <case>; [(1965) 112 CLR 246] at 256-7 the injury will be taken to have happened at that time "as it were at one blow".

The statutory fictions in <case> (1) and its predecessor do not affect the common law rights of the parties. The respondent's industrial deafness arose as a result of the combined effect of a myriad of minute injuries to his hearing sustained each day he was exposed to excessive noise in his employment. Compare Milne versus International Combustion (Australia) Ltd (1953) WCR 80. His common law claim was therefore based on causes of action which accrued daily during his employment with the appellant up to 30 June 1987.

Prima facie the respondent still has rights to compensation for an injury which has not yet occurred but will be deemed, when it does, to have occurred on the last day he worked for Gastonbury Steel. The injuries involved in these proceedings occurred on other days but the industrial deafness for which compensation can still, prima facie, be awarded includes deafness for which damages have been awarded in this case.

Section 63 of the 1926 Act permitted a worker to pursue rights against his employer under the Act and at common law but made provision to prevent double recovery. Sub section (1) provided that the Act should not affect any civil liability of the employer where "the injury" was caused by the employer's negligence. Sub section (2) provided that "in such case" where a worker proceeding independently of the Act obtained judgment against his employer "he shall not be entitled to any compensation under this Act other than compensation paid to him before such ... judgment". Sub section (5) provided that payments of compensation under the Act should, to the extent of their amount, be a defence to proceedings against the employer independently of the
Act "in respect of the injury".

If the respondent had recovered compensation under the 1926 Act and then sued for damages, <case> (5) would have made any payment of compensation, so far as it went, a defence to those proceedings provided the payment was "in respect of the injury" the subject of the action for damages. If he had recovered damages "in such case" prior to the repeal of the 1926 Act, <case> (2) would have terminated his entitlement to compensation.

In Vanramer Pty Ltd versus Higgins [(1991) 24 NSWLR 661] at 670 this Court held that: "... section 63 (2) only applies where the injured worker could, if he wished, commence separate proceedings at common law and under the Act in respect of the same injury". (emphasis supplied) 
In the present case the injuries would not have been the same because the compensable injury would be deemed to occur on the date defined in <case> (b), but the injuries for which damages would be payable occurred daily at work over many years. Because the injuries were not the same, <case> could not have applied directly to prevent the recovery and retention of both compensation and damages. The recovery of damages could not have terminated the respondent's rights to compensation for his hearing loss.

The position under the 1987 Act is more complicated because if and when the respondent gives a notice under <case> (1)(a)(ii), the injury will be deemed to have happened on the last day he was employed by Gastonbury Steel and under par (c) (ii) the compensation will be payable by that employer. This case therefore does not fall within ss 151, 151A and 151B of the 1987 Act (the equivalent of <case> of the 1926 Act), which deal with the case where a worker has rights to compensation and damages against his employer.

The case appears at first sight to be within <case> (1) (the equivalent of s of the 1926 Act) which applies where "... the injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a liability in some person other than the worker's employer to pay damages in respect of the injury ...".

However there is still the problem of the different injuries, a deemed one in
October 1993 for the purposes of the 1987 Act and, at common law, daily injuries at work up to 30 June 1987. The deemed injury in 1993 for which compensation would be payable would not give rise to a liability in some person other than Gastonbury Steel to pay damages. Section 151Z (1) therefore does not, in terms, apply and its machinery provisions would not prevent the respondent recovering and retaining both compensation and damages.

It is also necessary to consider the relevant Savings and Transitional provisions in Parts 6 and 14 of Schedule 6 of the 1987 Act to which we were referred by Mr Jackson QC for the respondent. Clause 1 of Pt 6 makes Div 4 of
Pt 3 (providing for lump sum compensation) applicable to injuries received before the 1987 Act. Clause 2 provides for the application of <case> (lump sums for pain and suffering) to cases where the injury occurred, in whole or in part, before the 1987 Act. Clause 5 deals with the case where a loss resulted from an injury received before the 1987 Act if it was not one for which compensation was payable under <case> of the 1926 Act.

Hearing loss cases are dealt with in cl 5 A which deems (contrary to the fact) partial loss of hearing in both ears to be a loss for which compensation was payable under <case> of the 1926 Act. Clause 6 deals with the case where a loss results from injuries received before and after the 1987 Act. These provisions apply to the deemed injuries created by <case> (4B) of the 1926 Act and <case> (1) of the 1987 Act. See Rico Pty Ltd versus Road Traffic Authority [(1992) 28 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281992%29%2028%20NSWLR%20679 "View LawCiteRecord" ) They have no direct application to the actual injuries sustained by the respondent or to his common law rights arising from such injuries.

Part 15 of sch 6, as its heading indicates, contains "Provisions relating to common law remedies". Clause 1 provides that Pt 5 of the 1987 Act (which contains ss 151, 151A, 151B and 151Z) with an irrelevant exception does not apply to a cause of action in respect of an injury received before the Act, and ss 63 and 64 of the 1926 Act continue to apply to such injuries. Clause 1 provides that references to compensation and proceedings in ss 63 and 64 apply to compensation or proceedings under the 1987 Act.

The words in cl 1 (1)(a) "a cause of action in respect of an injury received" before the 1987 Act refer to an actual injury. Accordingly Pt 5 of the 1987
Act does not apply in this case and the only relevant provisions for present purposes are ss 63 and 64. Section 63 has already been dealt with. Section 64 applied: "Where the injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof - ".

This language is practically identical with that in <case> (1) and is indistinguishable in effect. For the reasons previously given <case>, like <case>
Z(1), cannot apply directly in this case and the recovery of these damages will not affect the respondent's right to recover compensation from Gastonbury
Steel. The only question then is whether his compensation rights affect the damages recoverable from the appellant.

Questions of this nature have arisen with some frequency since Hood
Constructions Pty Ltd versus Nicholas & Anor [(1987) 9 NSWLR 60.] The worker there suffered a compensable injury which was made worse by the negligence of a medical practitioner. This was a separate injury, but it increased the compensation payable by the employer for the first. Hope JA held, at 71, that s 64: "does not deal with the present situation, where the injury for which compensation is payable ... was not the injury creating a legal liability in another person to pay damages, but the compensation is, in whole or in part, paid or payable in respect of the same incapacity ... or disability for which damages are to be assessed".

His Honour continued at 72: "The provisions of the [Workers Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) show clearly enough a policy against duplication. It does not appear why the present case is not covered ... I do not think that ... the fact that the ...
Act deals with the question of duplication in other classes of case precludes the application of a dominant rule in any case with which it does not purport to deal ... In my opinion ... (the doctor) is entitled to have deducted from any damages awarded to the plaintiff the amount of compensation paid ... in respect of matters for which damages are to be assessed".

The Court applied these principles in Kempsey District Hospital versus Thackham [(1995) 36 NSWLR 492] where the authorities are collected. In that case, like this, the worker's rights to lump sum compensation had not been crystalised by decision or settlement before the damages were assessed. Handley JA said at :
 "... this Court has discerned a clear intention by Parliament that injured workers should not retain both compensation and full damages for the same injury. The decisions ... reflect a constructive and purposive interpretation of the legislation which has not allowed this intention to be defeated by incomplete drafting".

In my judgment the Court should apply the principle stated by Hope JA in the present case, and reduce the damages payable by the appellant to reflect the respondent's rights to compensation for his industrial deafness.

The Judge did not make any precise finding as to the extent of the respondent's hearing loss, but he noted that the results obtained by the experts did not greatly differ. Dr Gow found 19.8 percent binaural loss, Mr
Keck 19.6 percent, and Dr Carroll 12.4 percent. The Judge said: "I prefer the opinions of Dr Gow and Dr Carroll. Based on their evidence the plaintiff would appear to have a moderate degree of deafness ... I think that he has very much the sort of difficulties that you would expect from the extent of deafness referred to by the experts, that is to say a mild to moderate sensory neural hearing loss".

It is not clear whether the Judge took one or other of the figures found by Dr
Gow and Dr Carroll, or whether he adopted an average. On balance I think he must have taken an average because only in that way could he have preferred both the "opinions" and based himself on "their evidence". The average of their results is a binaural loss of 16.1 percent which at the date of trial would be reflected in a lump sum award under <case> of $10,465. The appellant is only entitled to a deduction of five sevenths of this figure that being its share of responsibility in damages for the respondent's total hearing loss.
The resulting figure is $7,475.

The combined effect of <case> (2) and <case> (1) of the 1987 Act in force at the relevant time would entitle the respondent to a lump sum award for pain and suffering if his award under <case> exceeded $10,000. The respondent would therefore be entitled to a further lump sum for pain and suffering under <case>.

There was no agreement as to what that lump sum might be, and the appellant did not call expert evidence to establish a probable figure. The appellant's senior counsel invited this Court to treat the respondent's pain and suffering as being one tenth of a most extreme case, carrying an entitlement to an award under <case> of $5,000. I am not prepared to act on this invitation to speculate. The appellant had the evidentiary onus, and probably the legal onus on this issue, and it was not discharged. This Court has no knowledge of the level of awards for pain and suffering made by the Compensation Court in cases of mild to moderate hearing loss. The question is not what this Court thinks was a proper amount to award in such a case but the amount which the respondent would more probably than not recover if he took proceedings in the
Compensation Court. I would therefore reject the appellant's claim to a further deduction for the respondent's probable award under <case>.

These principles create difficulties as Kirby P pointed out in Kempsey
District Hospital versus Thackham. However as was said in that case at 509, workers and their legal advisers can deal with these difficulties by crystalising compensation rights prior to the trial of actions for damages. If workers and their legal advisers will not do this, they can hardly complain of the uncertainties involved. The remedy is in their hands alone because an employer or third party tortfeasor cannot take the initiative to have the worker's compensation rights determined in the Compensation Court.

In my opinion therefore the appeal should be allowed. In accordance with the condition imposed on the grant of leave, the appellant should pay the respondent's costs of the appeal. The following orders should be made: 
Appeal allowed.

Set aside the judgment of the District Court except as to costs and in lieu thereof substitute judgment for the plaintiff for $37,775 with effect from 5 November 1997.

The appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.
