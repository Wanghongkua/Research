JUDGE1
KIRBY ACJ This is purely a transitional case. It falls (by the date of the commencement of the plaintiff's action) after the decision of the High Court of Australia in McKain versus R W Miller and Company (South Australia)
Pty Limited <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 1], after the initial amendment of [s 38A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/s38a.html) of the [Limitation of Actions Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/) (SA) but before the further amendment of that section by the insertion (in June 1994) of [s 38A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/s38a.html) and (3) and, most importantly, before the amendment of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) to enact legislation similar to <case> in this State.
Accordingly, at the time he commenced his action, the plaintiff was entitled to require a court in this State to regard, by the law of this State, the status of the South Australian [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) (whatever it said) as procedural and not substantive in character. But procedure was to be determined by the law of this State, not that of South Australia. A different result would follow now, by reason of the supervening amendment of the New
South Wales legislation, binding on this Court. But, at the applicable time, the old law as stated in McKain had not been amended or repealed. The plaintiff was entitled to have that old law applied.
No argument was mounted that this Court was bound by the Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) to give full faith and credit to the [Limitation of Actions
Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/) (SA), [s 38A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/s38a.html) and, doing so, to treat, in New South Wales, the applicable limitation law as substantive (in accordance with that section) rather than procedural (as it would have been regarded in this State by a line of common law decisions).
Respectfully, I have much sympathy for the views of the minority in the
High Court in Breavington versus Godleman and Ors <case>; [(1988) 169 CLR 41], 129ff and
McKain on this constitutional point. But I am bound to the holding of the majority.
On the face of things, the plaintiff's proceedings appear to be a pure case of "forum shopping". He could not maintain his action, when he commenced it, still less now, in South Australia, where the wrongs allegedly occurred.
That is the jurisdiction with which the parties at the relevant time and the cause of action had the most natural connection. Instead, the plaintiff brought his proceedings to New South Wales (his current residence) with which, otherwise, the alleged wrong and the parties had no connection. Whereas once this fact would have caused much heartburning, and even judicial condemnation, more recent academic writing, reflections on the character of the Australian nation and of the jurisdictional divisions within it and the experience of other federations, such as the United States, have tended to produce different judicial responses. See eg Goliath Portland Cement Co Ltd versus Bengtell and Anor [(1994) 33 NSWLR 414 (CA)], 435; F K Juenger, "What's Wrong with Forum
Shopping?" (1994) 16 Sydney Law Review; cf B R Opeskin, "The Price of Forum
Shopping:
A Reply to Professor Juenger" [[1994] SydLawRw 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/SydLawRw/1994/2.html "View Case" ); [(1994) 16 Sydney Law Review, 14.] In any case, the duty of the Court, whatever its predilections about "forum shopping" is (subject to any over-riding constitutional rule) to give effect to the principles of private international law as modified by any supervening applicable legislation.

Finlay J upheld the motion by the defendant to dismiss the plaintiff's action as insupportable, having regard to the amendment to the South
Australian limitation law. For the reasons which I have given, it is my view that his Honour erred in doing so.
It follows that the orders proposed by Sheller JA should be made.
JUDGE2
SHELLER JA The defendant, Pasminco Metals-BHAS Pty Limited ,
employed the plaintiff, Max Chisholm, as a gardener at the Port Pirie Lead
Smelter, Port Pirie, South Australia from to 1980. In April 1980 the plaintiff returned to New South Wales. Between 1987 and 1992 he was treated by
Dr Robertson. In February he consulted a specialist physician, Dr
Cleland, about lead poisoning. On 28 February 1992 the appellant commenced treatment for lead poisoning. On 5 May 1992 he instructed a solicitor to act for him.
On 20 August 1993 the plaintiff began proceedings against Pasminco by a statement of claim filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to recover damages for negligence which was alleged to have resulted in the lead poisoning to the plaintiff. On the defendant's application, Finlay J struck out the statement of claim on the ground that his action was, by force of a limitation of action imposed and made part of the substantive law of South
Australia by the [Limitation of Actions Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/) (SA) (the South Australian
Act), not maintainable in New South Wales. By leave of the Court the plaintiff appeals from this decision.
 
LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
Section 36 (1) of the South Australian Act provides that: "All actions in which the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to any person, shall be commenced within three years next after the cause of action accrued but not after."
Civil liability for the tort is governed by South Australian law, the lex loci delicti; Breavington versus Godleman <case>; [(1988) 169 CLR 41] at 39; Stevens versus Head <case>; [(1993) 176 CLR 433] at 453; Nygh, Conflict of Laws in
Australia, 6th ed at 341.
In McKain versus RW Miller and Company, in proceedings in the Supreme
Court of
New South Wales to recover damages in negligence for an injury which took place in South Australia, the majority of the
High Court at 40 referred to the distinction which has been drawn between substantive law (the subject of the conflict of law rules) and procedural law which is governed by the lex fori alone. At 41 their Honours said: "For the purposes of applying conflict of law rules, English courts have long adopted the distinction that a true statute of limitation, which does no more than cut off resort to the courts for enforcement of a claim, is a procedural law, while a statute which extinguishes a civil liability and destroys a cause of action is a substantive law."
At 44 the majority held that s36 (1) of the South Australian
Act was procedural in nature and had no effect on the action brought in New South
Wales to enforce the cause of action existing under the common law applicable in that State.
In July 1992, to overcome difficulties the decision in McKain versus RW Miller and Company created, the Special Committee of Solicitors General recommended adoption of the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendation that each
State legislate that the law of a jurisdiction dealing with limitation periods be part of a substantive law of that jurisdiction.
On 17 June 1993 the South
Australian Act was amended by inserting s38A as follows: "A limitation of action imposed by this Act is to be regarded as part of the substantive law of the State."
New South Wales did not introduce similar legislation until December after the plaintiff had filed his statement of claim. On 9 June 1994 the
South Australian Act was again amended by
Act No 41 of 1994 which substituted a new s38A as follows: "(1) A limitation law of the State is a substantive law of the 
State.

A limitation law of another State or a Territory of the
Commonwealth, or of New Zealand, is to be regarded as a substantive law of that place and applied accordingly.

If a court in this State applies a limitation law of another State or a Territory of the Commonwealth, or of New
Zealand, a discretion conferred by that law is to be exercised, as far as practicable, in the same way as courts in that other place exercise the discretion in comparable cases." 
Section 6 of Act No 41 of 1994 provided that the amendments substituting s38A "extend to a cause of action that arose before the commencement of that section unless court proceedings based on the cause of action had been started before the commencement of that section." 
JUDGMENT AT FIRST INSTANCE
By notice of motion dated 20 August 1993 the plaintiff applied pursuant to [s60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) to extend the time for commencement of the proceedings. By notice of motion dated 1 February 1994 Pasminco moved that the plaintiff's statement of claim be struck out. On 2 February 1995
Finlay J delivered judgment striking out the statement of claim and ordering the plaintiff to pay Pasminco's costs.
It was common ground that the cause of action accrued not later than I
December 1979.
Section 36 (1) of the South Australian Act required such action to be commenced by December 1982. Section 48 of the South Australian
Act provides general power to extend periods of limitations but the powers conferred thereby are limited, in particular by s48 (3) which provides: "This section does not - ...
empower a court to extend a limitation of time prescribed by this
Act unless it is satisfied - that facts material to the plaintiff's case were not ascertained by him until some point of time occurring within twelve months before the expiration of the period of limitation or occurring after the expiration of that period and that the action was instituted within twelve months after the ascertainment of those facts by the plaintiff: (emphasis added) ...
and that in all the circumstances of the case it is just to grant the extension of time."
Finlay J held, in my opinion correctly, that if the facts material to the plaintiff's case were ascertained by him before 20
August 1992, that is to say twelve months before the date upon which the action was begun, the action would be statute barred in
South Australia. His Honour found that the plaintiff had ascertained the relevant facts material to his case no later than February .
His Honour held that s38A of the South Australian Act, in its earlier form, made the limitation of action imposed by ss36 (1) and 48 of the South
Australian Act part of the substantive law of South Australia. In his Honour's opinion it followed that, if the action was not maintainable in South
Australia under the substantive law of that State, New South Wales conflict of law rules made it not maintainable in New South Wales.
 
APPEAL
Section 38A, in the form passed in 1993, required a South Australian court applying South Australian law to treat a limitation of action imposed by the South Australian Act as part of the substantive law of the State. But a
New South Wales court in deciding whether a law is substantial or procedural applies New South Wales law. When the plaintiff filed his statement of claim in August 1993, according to New South Wales conflict of laws rules, procedural law was governed by the law of the forum alone and s36 (1) of the
South Australian Act was a procedural law; McKain versus RW Miller and Company.
The
South Australian legislature cannot abrogate or override New South Wales conflict of laws rules. The substitution of a new s38A in the South Australian
Act acknowledged this in the case where South Australian courts are considering a limitation law of another
State or Territory or of New Zealand.
Section 38A (2) requires a limitation law of another State or Territory or of
New Zealand to be regarded by the South Australian court as a substantive law of that place and applied accordingly. If a similar provision had been in force in New South Wales at the relevant time the New South Wales court would have been bound to regard the South Australian [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) as a substantive law of that State. But at the relevant time there was no such provision in New
South Wales and accordingly, applying the law of the forum, the New South
Wales court was bound to treat the South Australian limitation as procedural and so not operating as a limitation of action in proceedings commenced in New
South Wales. Accordingly, with the greatest respect, his Honour erred in striking out the statement of claim on this ground.
In the alternative the respondent submitted that the phrase "that section" in [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s6.html) of Act No 41 of 1994 referred to s38A of the South Australian
Act as inserted in 1993. Accordingly since the plaintiff's action was commenced after 17 June 1993, s38A, in its substituted form, applied. Even if this were so it would not assist the defendant since, as I have sought to explain, it is New South Wales conflict of law rules which are to be applied.
However it is to my mind clear that the phrase "that section" refers to s5 of
Act No 41 of 1994. The amendments extend to a cause of action that arose before the commencement of s5 substituting s38A in its new form but not if, as in this case, court proceedings based on the cause of action had been started before the commencement of s5.
 
ORDERS
I propose the following orders:  . Appeal allowed; 
The orders of 2 February 1995 be set aside; 
In lieu thereof the defendant's notice of motion of 1 February 1994 be dismissed with costs;
The plaintiff's notice of motion of 20 August 1993 be remitted to the
Common Law Division for determination; 
The defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the appeal.
JUDGE3
POWELL JA I agree with Sheller JA.
