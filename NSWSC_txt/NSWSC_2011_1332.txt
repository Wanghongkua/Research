JUDGMENT 
Objection to document entitled "Meade Movement Checklist" (T234) 
Objection has been taken to a document which is contained in the records of the Marsfield Baby Health Centre ( Marsfield ). It is a two-page document entitled "Meade Movement Checklist" (the Checklist ). 
The Checklist contains a list of movements or activities and beside each there are two options: "PRESENT" or "EMERGING". For example: "Present toy 20-25 cm from baby's face and move toy horizontally 180 degrees.  i. Baby follows the toy degrees with eyes"
One can discern from the Plaintiff's clinical notes from Marsfield the names of the persons who may have performed the test, but there is no evidence as to their qualifications. Furthermore, the test is labelled "results only valid if used with training" but there is no evidence as to whether the persons who may have performed the test have received any training to do so. 
The Defendants contend that the Checklist is not, as the Plaintiff submits, a document that records observations as to the Plaintiff's capacity to move on the day of the test, but rather that there is contained in the document opinion evidence. The Defendants rely on Lithgow City Council versus Jackson  <case> and say that, even if I am satisfied that the Meade Movement Checklist is admissible as a business record pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s69.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) , I ought reject it on the basis that it does not comply with [s 78](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s78.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) . 
I consider that the Checklist (of which the example set out above is typical) contains observations rather than opinions. 
Had I considered that the Checklist contained opinions rather than observations, I would have rejected it on the basis that it does not comply with [s 78](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s78.html) (lay opinions), since evidence of the opinion is not necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person's perception of the matter or event within the meaning of [s 78(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s78.html) Nor does it fall within the exception to the opinion rule <case> (opinions based on specialised knowledge) because of the lack of evidence of the qualifications of the person or persons who performed the test. 
Nonetheless, the Checklist as filled in is, in my opinion, a business record of Marsfield which records observations made of the Plaintiff on 9 April 1996, but does not contain opinions. 
The weight to be given to any of the matters recorded in this document is quite another question and I will take some persuasion to place any substantial weight on it. Nonetheless, I do not consider that the weight of this document is so slight as not to warrant its admissibility pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s69.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) . * * *
