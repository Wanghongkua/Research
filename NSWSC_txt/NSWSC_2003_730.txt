THURSDAY 7 AUGUST 2003  /03 ROWLANDS versus CONSUMER, TRADER & TENANCY TRIBUNAL & ANOR  
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT  I have before me Ms Rowlands, an applicant in person. On Friday 1 August , an application was due to be made to the Consumer, Trader & Tenancy
Tribunal at 2pm concerning her occupancy of premises at 31 Elizabeth Bay Road,
Elizabeth Bay, Sydney. Because of transportation difficulties, Ms Rowlands notified the Tribunal that she would be late. She says she arrived at 2.35pm.
She was handed a document being a notice of an order made for termination and possession of the premises together with an order that she should pay the landlord a daily occupation fee at a specified rate to the date of giving up possession.  On Monday 4 August 2003, Ms Rowlands applied under the [Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s68.html) for a rehearing. Today, Thursday 7 August 2003, she received a notice that on
Tuesday 5 August 2003 her application for a rehearing was refused. It was said that she was aware of the time and place of the hearing and an additional 45 minutes was allowed for her to be present. Ms Rowlands disputes this.  The [Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s65.html) is in the following terms:  "Except as provided by this section, a court has no jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:  a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari or other relief, or  a declaratory judgment or order, or  an injunction,  in respect of any matter that has been heard and determined (or is to be heard or determined) by the Tribunal in accordance with this Act or in respect of any ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such a matter."  [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s65.html), however, provides:  "A court is not prevented from granting relief or a remedy of a kind referred to in subsection (1) in relation to a matter in respect of which the Tribunal has made an order if the ground on which the relief or remedy is sought is that:  the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or  in relation to the hearing or determination of the matter, a party had been denied procedural fairness."  I think it is open to argument that Ms Rowlands was denied procedural fairness in the refusal by the Tribunal to rehear the matter.  I make an order that the Tribunal show cause before me at 10am on Friday 8
August 2003 why a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari or other relief should not be issued forthwith. I direct that notice of this order be given in the first instance by telephone by my
Associate to the Tribunal.
