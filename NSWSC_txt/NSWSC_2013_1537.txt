DECISION
The applicant, Walter James Kuehne, applies for an inquiry into his sentence pursuant to [s 78(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s78.html) of the [Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) (the Act). The applicant submits that his sentence should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
This application is one of several made by persons who have been convicted and sentenced for offences carrying a standard non-parole period, have unsuccessfully appealed against the conviction and/or sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and now seek a further hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that there is a doubt or question as to "a mitigating circumstance" in the case, namely the infection of the original sentencing exercise by Muldrock error : Muldrock versus The Queen <case> ; [244 CLR 120.]
In the light of that determination, the Attorney General concedes that there is sufficient evidence of Muldrock error in the instant case to justify action being taken under <case> of the Act. The Attorney General does not maintain that the application ought not be dealt with for any of the discretionary reasons referred to in <case> of the Act.
The applicant was convicted after trial in the District Court on 7 August 2009 of an offence committed on 15 November 2007, namely that the applicant in company with others broke into and entered commercial premises in Blackett, wherein the applicant stole a sum of money the property of those premises. That offence under [s 112(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s112.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years' imprisonment.
In brief terms, the applicant broke into the yard of a bakery in the early hours of the morning of 17 November 2007 in the company of two other men. They were armed with a pole and a knife. The baker surprised the offenders as they were attempting to enter the premises. The baker took refuge in the store room and observed the offenders remove the cash register from the shop. The fingerprints of the applicant were found on the top of the boundary fence. 
The judge's remarks on sentence included a review of the applicant's subjective circumstances, including the fact that he was 28 years of age at the date of sentence, that he was described by a psychologist as "of low cognitive functioning and socially unsophisticated" and that he was raised in a dysfunctional environment where he was exposed to domestic violence. The offender was educated to year 12. He commenced consuming alcohol and smoking cannabis at 12 years of age. At 17 years of age he commenced intravenous use of amphetamines. He has also used ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. The applicant had a criminal history which included failed attempts at completing the Drug Court programme and residential rehabilitation. The applicant was on parole at the time of the commission of the instant offence.
The sentencing judge found the offence to be "at the mid range of objective seriousness" and that there was "no good reason to depart from that guideline, benchmark or guidepost." It is clear that the judge therefore engaged in a two-stage sentencing process. 
The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 3 December 2008, with a balance of term of one year and 8 months. The applicant is therefore eligible for release on 3 December 2013.
The applicant's appeal against conviction and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal on 10 March 2011 was dismissed on 4 May 2011. The decision in Muldrock versus The Queen was handed down on 5 October 2011.
The sentencing judge erred in failing to synthesise the objective and subjective factors before arriving at an appropriate sentence, having regard to the standard non-parole period. There is, in my view, a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case warranting a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. I accept the applicant's submission that the merits of the case, in so far as a reduction in sentence may be warranted, are not within the purview of this application. Rather, that question is one for the Court of Criminal Appeal.
In these circumstances, the application is granted. The matter is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
