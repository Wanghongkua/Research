Kenneth Frederick HANSEN versus COMPTROLLER-GENERAL OF CUSTOMS /95 March 1996 
COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
SMART J, SPERLING J, HIDDEN J 
CATCHWORDS: ASSESSMENT OF CUSTOMS VALUE - MATERIALITY OF FALSE STATEMENTS 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Question Answered 
HEADNOTE 
Two used luxury cars were imported. On entering these goods for home consumption false statements were made as to the prices paid on the domestic markets of the foreign countries and Customs was invited to and did treat, the prices paid, with adjustments, as the customs value. Customs was also invited to and did assess customs duty and sales tax on the customs value as so stated. These were paid. Subsequently, further false statements were made.
There was a major understatement of the amounts paid for the vehicles.

None of the methods for assessing the customs value of the goods in s.159 of the Customs Act was applicable and so the fall back method applied. Section
G(c) provided that the Collector in assessing the fall back value of the goods was not to have regard to the price on the domestic market of the country from which the imported goods were exported.

Dr Hansen contended that as Customs could pay no regard to the price paid by him on the domestic markets of the foreign countries his false statements and attempts to deceive Customs officers about the purchase price of each vehicle overseas were immaterial.

HELD: (1) In determining the fall back value of the two cars regard may not be had to the prices paid on the domestic market in the countries of export.

Nevertheless the false statements were material in the circumstance.

ORDERS 
Case stated remitted with the answer stated in the reasons for judgment.
 
JUDGMENT 
SMART J: 
Introduction 
This stated case arises out of the importation of two used luxury sedans and alleged multiple offences under the Customs Act. As to the Rolls Royce there was one charge of smuggling goods, one of evading duty and eight charges of making a false statement. As to the Mercedes Benz there was one charge of smuggling goods, one of evading duty and five charges of making a false statement.

Dr Hansen contended that he was not guilty because none of what he wrote or said as to the price he paid for the vehicles was material to the task of ascertaining the customs value of the two sedans. Customs duty and sales tax are calculated upon that value.

The question for determination is: 
Whether as a matter of law, on the proper construction of the Customs Act, section 161G, the purchase price paid for the vehicles, or either of them, was immaterial to the assessment of value for Customs and thus Customs duty.

The parties were at issue as to the construction of s.161G of the Customs Act.
Dr Hansen contended that all the charges related to an alleged mis-statement of the price at which the vehicles were purchased in the United States or
United Kingdom respectively. Dr Hansen submitted that S.161G(c) prohibited
Customs having regard to the price of the sedans on the domestic market of the country from which each was exported. This meant that Customs could pay no regard to the actual price paid by Dr Hansen for the vehicles on the domestic markets in the United States of America and the United Kingdom respectively.

Accordingly, it was claimed by Dr Hansen that his false statements bearing upon the price paid overseas and attempts to deceive Customs officers about the purchase price of the vehicles overseas were immaterial.

It was not suggested that the purchases were made on the export market of either the United States or the United Kingdom. The vendors in these countries were making local domestic sales and were not involved in export transactions as such. It appeared to be Dr Hansen's plan to import these sedans into
Australia, after first using them overseas.

Customs contended that the purchase price of each vehicle overseas was directly relevant to the assessment of customs duty and that even if the purchase prices were not directly relevant to the assessment of customs duty they were still material matters. Customs contended that Dr Hansen was guilty of the offences whether or not the purchase prices of the vehicles were able to be used to determine customs duty.

The Facts 
In late 1989 Dr Hansen and his wife left Australia and went to the United
States of America. Subsequently they travelled to the United Kingdom. Later they returned to the United States. They came back to Australia in early July .

About 5 January 1990 they bought a Rolls Royce by private treaty in the United
States. The purchase price was US $30,000 of which US $25,000 was received in cash by the vendor. A further US $6779 was paid by Dr Hansen in the United
States for overhauling and detailing the vehicle which was used by them while they were in the United States. The vehicle was registered in Dr Hansen's name in the State of Delaware in which he was then resident, insured and enrolled on the local Rolls Royce owners club register.

The vehicle was exported to Australia from the United States when they returned to live in Australia. It arrived about 1 August 1990. Dr Hansen declared to Customs at that time that he had purchased the vehicle for US $8000.

In March 1990 Dr and Mrs Hansen bought a Mercedes Benz by private treaty for [sterling]14,738 pounds sterling while they were in England. The vehicle was shipped to the continent and thereafter to the United States and was used by the appellant and his wife in those places. The vehicle was registered in the
State of Delaware in Mrs Hansen's name on 14 May 1990. The vehicle was exported to Australia by Mrs Hansen and arrived on 31 July 1990. Dr Hansen declared to Customs at that time that he had purchased the vehicle for US $11,000.

In respect of both the Rolls Royce and the Mercedes-Benz importations the judge found: that the appellant made deliberate false statements as to, or in relation to, the purchase price of the vehicles in oral and documentary statements made by him at the time of importation of the vehicles and subsequently; that the appellant engaged in elaborate charades in that regard to mislead the Customs officers in relation to the purchase price of the vehicles; that on importation of the vehicles, a Customs 'shopfront' assessment of duty payable on the vehicles was undertaken by reference to the vehicles' purchase prices, repairs and allowable depreciation; that, by the time the matter came before [him], an assessment of duty based on the discovered true purchase prices of the vehicles had been made employing the 'fall back' method of assessment of 'value for Customs', which method is defined and described in section 161G of the Customs Act; that the duty paid on importation was calculated on a basis that included the false purchase price.
 that the duty payable assessed subsequently by employing the 'fall back' method was also calculated on a basis that included the purchase price, this time as established by the evidence of the prosecution.

It appeared from the informations annexed to the stated case that the false statements were allegedly made over an extended period. They were allegedly first made when the Statement for Vehicle Imported By a Passenger (B357) was made and the entry for home consumption was lodged. The information as to the
Rolls Royce alleged that as a result of the false statements revenue of $46,343.88 was short levied by Customs, being $12,136.81 in customs duty and $34,207.07 in sales tax. The information as to the Mercedes-Benz alleged that as a result of the false statements revenue of $21,313.01 was short levied by
Customs being $4890.25 in customs duty and $16,422.76 in sales tax.

The Legislation [S.21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/s21.html) of the [Customs Tariff Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/) provides that duties of customs are imposed, in accordance with that Act, on goods imported into Australia. Schedule 3 comprises a list of goods and the percentage of customs duty payable on each.
[S.13(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/s13.html) provides that where in Schedule 3 (which applies in the present case) reference is made to a percentage in relation to goods the reference is to that percentage of the value of the goods.
[S13(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/s13.html) provides that the value of any goods for the purposes of that Act is, unless the contrary intention appears, the customs value of the goods ascertained or determined in accordance with Division 2 of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/index.html#p8) of the [Customs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/).
 [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/index.html#p8),
Division 2 contains detailed provisions for the valuation of imported goods.
[S159](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html) provides that unless a contrary intention appears the value of imported goods for the purposes of an Act imposing duty is their customs value. The Collector has to determine that in accordance with that section. He is required to proceed sequentially, until he finds a category which applies, namely: their transactions value; their identical goods value; their similar goods value; their deductive (contemporary sales) value; their deductive (later sales) value; their deductive (derived goods sales) value; their computed value.

If the collector finds an applicable category he does not consider any later category. If none of these categories is applicable the customs value of the goods is their fall-back value.

In the present case the Collector determined that none of the categories applied and that the customs value of the vehicles was their fall-back value.
This is specified in [s161G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html) which provides: "The fall-back value of imported goods is such value as a Collector determines, having regard to the other methods of valuation under this
Division in the order in which those methods would ordinarily be considered under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html) and of such other matters as the Collector considers relevant, but not having regard to any of the following matters: the selling price in Australia of goods produced in Australia; any system that provides for the acceptance for Customs purposes of the higher of 2 alternative values; the price of goods on the domestic market of the country from which the imported goods were exported; the cost of production of goods, other than the computed value of identical goods or similar goods; the price of goods sold for export to a country other than Australia and not imported into Australia; any system that provides for minimum values for Customs purposes; arbitrary or fictitious values." 
As counsel for Dr Hansen pointed out "fall-back" is the nearest analogue to one of the primary tests, searching for that analogue in the same sequence but not having regard to any of the prohibited matters. Of particular importance was the prohibition in (c). Regard must not be had to the price of goods on the domestic market of the country from which the imported goods were exported.

In assessing the "fall back" value the Collector had regard to the first category, the transaction value as the nearest analogue, modified to fit the circumstances. The Collector took into account the prices paid for the subject vehicles in the overseas domestic markets of the USA and UK respectively. Dr
Hansen, at the time the vehicles were imported into Australia, declared, in writing, the sums for which he had purchased the vehicles. The entry for home consumption in respect of each vehicle invited the Collector to assess customs value on the basis of the invoice price, which was specified, and contained calculations of customs duty and sales tax based on such customs value which was the falsely stated invoice price. In each case Customs so assessed duty.
Dr Hansen's challenge involves the unpalatable proposition that Customs was wrong to accept the truth of what he stated and to agree to assess duty on the basis which he suggested, namely his stated purchase price of goods with permissible allowances and modifications.

Dr Hansen submitted that Customs made no investigations to determine whether any method other than "fall back" could be used once it was apparent that, "transaction value" could not. Even so, counsel for Dr Hansen when asked to indicate what Customs should have done took the view that Customs may well have worked through each of the categories and ultimately had to rely on "fall back". Counsel concentrated on what should have been done once "fall back" had been reached. Customs should have discarded any analogue based on transaction value because of [S161G(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html) and used an analogue based on [S161C.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161c.html)
Customs should have taken the Australian domestic value of identical equivalent landed vehicles. Put in homely terms, Dr Hansen contended that
Customs should have taken a similar model and year Silver Shadow Rolls Royce of about the same mileage and the same condition and ascertained what such a
Rolls Royce would be worth if sold on the market in Australia about the time of the importation. The same exercise should be undertaken for the Mercedes
Benz. It was likely to be an easier exercise for the Mercedes Benz because of the number of them in Australia.

The reasons why none of the categories (or primary tests) apply, put briefly are: 
For the transaction value method to apply there has to be "an import sales transaction" as defined in [s154.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s154.html)
That involves a "contract (or contracts) of sale for the importation of the goods into Australia". Thus the sale of the goods has to include their export and importation into Australia. This method is inapplicable.

For the identical goods value to apply there have to be comparable identical goods [(s161A).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161a.html)
To so qualify the comparable goods must have been exported to Australia about the same time as the imported goods - within 45 days [(s154(2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s154.html)
The Collector must also be satisfied that the comparable goods either were sold in substantially the same quantities as the imported goods in an import sales transaction at the same trade level as the import sales transaction of the imported goods or are of a kind that reasonable inquiry by the Collector had not shown to be so sold. Dr Hansen never suggested that this inapplicable method should be applied.

For the similar goods value to apply there have to be comparable similar goods [(s161B).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161b.html)
The same conditions apply as with comparable identical goods. It would be hard for this section to apply as the imported goods were particular makes and models of second hand motor vehicles. Dr Hansen never suggested that this inapplicable method should be applied.

The deductive (contemporary sales) value [(s161C)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161c.html) and the deductive (later sales) value [(s161D)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161d.html) do not apply as they depend upon a sale of comparable goods.
[S161C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161c.html) also depends upon the sale being contemporary.
[S161D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161d.html) depends upon the sale taking place within 90 days of the importation of the goods and the sale being known to a Collector.

The deductive (derived goods sales) value [(S161E)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161e.html) does not apply. It depends upon derived goods which means the imported goods after they have been assembled, packaged or further processed in Australia.
Further, it depends upon a sale known to a Collector during the 90 days beginning on the day of importation of the imported goods.

The computed value method may take precedence over the deductive methods if the owner so requests. The computed value method involves taking the costs of production (both Australian arranged costs and other actual production costs) and the profit and expenses usually added to the sale for export to
Australia of goods of the same class as the imported goods from the country of export of the imported goods. There are other matters. This method of valuation could not reasonably be applied to the importation of second hand motor vehicles.

Customs were correct to apply the fall back value.

Before returning to the terms of [s161G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html) some general principles are noted: "...it is one of the underlying principles of the Act that the Government should rely upon the importer to honestly state the truth, according to his knowledge, in reference to a matter of which he knows everything and the customs authorities know nothing. If in the case of duties payable ad valorem the customs authorities took steps in each case to satisfy themselves of the value of the goods for duty before allowing them to land, trade would be seriously hampered. Almost of necessity they must take the importer's statement of value prima facie as true. The policy of the Act, therefore, is that the custom's authorities trust to the statement of the person importing the goods"(per O'Connor J in R versus Lyon <case>; [(1906) 3 CLR 770] at 786.) This is the reason for the severe penalties in the
Act for making incorrect statements.

The system used in Australia for the valuation of goods for customs purposes is based on the GATT Valuation Code which gives effect to the valuation principles in Article VII of GATT. Regard maybe had to the Agreement and the Code for the purpose of interpreting the legislation and resolving any ambiguity.

Customs had a twofold approach. It submitted that s161G, on its ordinary meaning, did not prohibit the Customs having regard to the actual price paid in the United States for the Rolls Royce and that paid in the United Kingdom for the Mercedes Benz. It was further contended that the court should have regard to the history, the preparatory legislative materials and the GATT texts. The court should give effect to the purpose and scheme of the legislation.

Dr Hansen and Customs had different starting points. Customs pointed out that in 99% of cases the customs value is the invoice price. Entries for home consumption are prepared (and were prepared in the present case) on the basis of the invoice price. Customs relied on some indications to that effect in Re
Sussan (Wholesalers) Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs [(1978) 1 ALD 603] at 608 (which was on an earlier [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and
Conventions) and Re IDD Societe Anonyme and Collector of Customs [(1985) 8 ALD ] at , 256 and 257. Dr Hansen contended that what should be considered was the price actually paid under the contract for sale by reason of which goods were imported into Australia but subject to statutory adjustments. The contract of sale taken must be found to be the "relevant transaction". The Administrative
Appeals Tribunal expressed the view that Div 2 of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/index.html#p8) of the Act was designed to give effect to the Agreement on Implementation of
Article VII of GATT. There were important statutory amendments in 1987. A new [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/index.html#p8),
Division 2 was substituted in the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/).

In the last mentioned case the Tribunal held at 259 that the only relevant contract for the sale of the goods imported was one pursuant to which goods were exported to Australia and by reason of which the goods became subject to
Customs control. The Tribunal could see no reason why Parliament would have intended that the price paid by a foreign corporation for the manufacture in
Hong Kong of goods to be exported to Australia under a contract of sale between the foreign corporation and an Australian purchaser would be relevant to, let alone determinative of, the customs value of those goods on their ultimate importation into Australia. This case points up that what is of consequence is the price paid on the export market of the country in which the goods are purchased and permissible adjustments and not other prices paid in the country from which the goods are ultimately exported.

Dr Hansen's starting point was that both in arriving at the transaction value and the fall back value the price paid on the domestic market of the country of export was irrelevant.

Customs pointed out that [s161G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html) spoke of the fall back value of "imported goods" being such value as a
Collector determines having regard to other methods of valuation in the specified sequence under [s159.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html)
When it came to matters to which regard was not to be had it referred to "goods" in sub-paras (a), (c), (d) and (e) and not to "imported goods." Under sub-para (a) the Collector cannot have regard to the selling price in
Australia of goods produced in Australia. Obviously this does not refer to "imported goods". Similar observations could be made as to (e) which deals with the price of goods sold for export to a country other then Australia and not imported into Australia.

Under sub-para (d) the Collector cannot have regard to the cost of production of goods wherever produced (other than the computed value of identical goods or similar goods). I have not overlooked sub-paras (b), (f) and (g) which are aimed at excluding from consideration values which are unlikely to give a true guide to the values used to determine customs value.

The phrase "of goods" in [s161G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html) is general in nature and wide in its ambit. In some sub-paras the context demonstrates that "imported goods" are not within the phrase "of goods." In broad terms the section is trying to exclude from consideration general indications of price and production costs prevailing in situations which could be regarded as unreliable indicators of value. Such an approach also applies to (c). The price on the domestic market often includes local taxes and differs from the price on the same country's export market.

Customs submitted that there was a contrast in sub-para (c). It excluded from consideration the price of goods on the domestic market of the country from which the imported goods were exported. The sub-para did not say the price of imported goods. Dr Hansen contended that if the price of goods on the domestic market of the foreign country was not an acceptable consideration or indicator it was hard to see why the price paid for the imported goods on the domestic market of the foreign country should not also be excluded. It was submitted that there was nothing in the context to cut down the ordinary meaning of the words "the price of goods on the domestic market".
 [S161G(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html) poses some problems of construction. There are strong indications of a general approach prohibiting regard to prices of relevant goods on inappropriate markets and distinguishing that from the price of the imported goods. Customs contended that it would be absurd to exclude the actual price paid for the imported goods. Dr Hansen contended that as the prices paid for goods on the domestic market of the exporting country were a forbidden indicator it would be wrong to create an exception which the words of the sub-para did not warrant in respect of the prices paid on the domestic market of the exporting country for the actual goods imported.

The use of extrinsic materials is not limited to the resolution of ambiguities, the elucidation of obscurities or the rejection of absurd or unreasonable results. It suffices if it is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision: [s15AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s15ab.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) and Re
Gardner Smith [66 ALR 377] at 383.

The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1987 came into operation on 1 July 1989. The replacement Explanatory Memorandum stated that the Bill and the Supplementary Memorandum introduced a complete re-draft of
Division 2 of Part VIII of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) to further strengthen the implementation of a valuation system for customs duty purposes that the value of imported goods should, so far as possible, be the price paid or payable under the actual import sales transaction where it has been dictated by arms length commercial considerations. Goods were to be valued at the Free On Board point. Division 2 was stated to be designed to give effect to Australia's obligations under the Agreement on Implementation of Article
VII of GATT. It is noted that "import sales transaction" is defined for the purpose of ascertaining which contracts are to be taken into account in determining the "price paid under the transaction value method." 
On p34 of the Memorandum it is stated that the Collector "shall not have regard to any of the [listed] matters consistent with Australia's obligations under the GATT: ...
 the price of the goods on the domestic market of the country from which the goods were exported.
 ...

This wording which differs from that in the Statute suggests that what is to be disregarded is the price of the goods in question on the domestic market of the country from which the goods were exported.

Articles 1 to 6 of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of GATT contains Rules on Customs Valuation and deal in sequence with the methods of valuation earlier listed prior to reaching "fall back". Article 7 provides that if the customs value cannot be determined using these methods, it shall be determined using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of that Agreement and of Article VII of the General
Agreement and on the basis of data available in the country of importation.
Article 7 cl 2 provides that no customs value shall be determined under the provisions of that Article on the basis of 7 listed matters which correspond with those listed in [s161G.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161g.html)
The differences in wording are immaterial.

Cl 2 of the Interpretative Note to Article 7 states that a reasonable flexibility in applying the methods of valuation earlier listed would be in conformity with the aims and provisions of Article 7.

Cl 2(a) of Article VII of GATT provides that the value for customs purposes of imported merchandise should be based on the actual value of the imported merchandise on which duty is assessed and should not be based on the value of merchandise of national origin or on arbitrary or fictitious values. Cl 2(b) provides that "actual value" should be the price at which, at a time and place determined by the legislation of the country of importation, such or like merchandise is sold or offered for sale in the ordinary course of trade under fully competitive conditions. Paragraph 2 cl 1 of the Note to Article VII provides that it would be in conformity with Article VII to presume that "actual value" may be represented by the invoice price plus certain additions.
Cl 4 provides that the wording of paragraph 2(a) and (b) permits a contracting party to determine the value for customs purposes either on the basis of a particular exporter's prices of the imported merchandise or on the basis of the general price level of like merchandise (on the export market).

The GATT Technical Committee caused a study to be made of the Treatment of
Used Motor Vehicles. That study stated that the valuation treatment of used motor vehicles gave rise to practical problems. In cl 16 it was noted that in many cases the customs value of used motor vehicles will have to be determined under Article 7 of the Agreement on Implementation. Cl 17 reads: 
When valuing goods using this "fall-back" method, it is important to bear in mind certain broad principles laid down by the Agreement and in particular that: - for the purposes of Article 7 the value shall be determined using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of the
Agreement and of Article VII of the GATT, on the basis of data available in the country of importation; - certain methods of valuation are expressly excluded by paragraph 2 of
Article 7; - the methods of valuation employed should be those laid down in Articles 1 to 6, inclusive, applied with reasonable flexibility, and should, to the greatest extent possible, be based on previously determined Customs values; - the Agreement recommends consultation between the Customs administration and the importer to establish the basis for valuation.

Cl 18 acknowledges that in the final analysis it must be left to each country to choose a method of valuation comparable with the principles and general provisions of the Agreement and with Article VII of GATT.

Customs placed much reliance on cl 19 which states: 
Customs value could, for example, be based on the price actually paid or payable for the vehicle. In this case, the goods would have to be valued with reference to their condition at the time of valuation. The price would therefore be adjusted to take account of the depreciation (with reference to age or use) incurred since purchase.

The tables for depreciation set out times since date of purchase being less than 6 months, 6 to 12 months and 12 months to 24 months and use since date of purchase being less than 5000 kms, 5001 to 15,000 kms and 15,001 to 30,000 kms. The percentage allowed for depreciation varies depending on the criteria selected, the time since purchase and the use of the vehicle.

Any improvement made or accessories added after purchase would enhance the value of the vehicle. Cl 19 is meant to give an example. It is therefore not meant to be contrary to or inconsistent with clauses 17 or 18. Clause 18 specifically provides that a value determined under Article 7 of the Code must be defensible at law. The reference in cl 19 of the study to the price actually paid or payable for the vehicle is probably a reference back to the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation. That would result in a consistent scheme. The price on the export market is taken and the adjustments mentioned are made. The situation to be envisaged is goods being sold on the export market of the exporting country but subject to being used prior to their export in the exporting country.

Throughout the International Agreements and Notes there are some constant themes. Wherever possible the customs value of imported goods is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation adjusted in accordance with Article 8. Where the fall back method is used regard cannot be had to the price of goods on the domestic market of the country of exportation. Consultation should be had between the importer and Customs where the 'transaction value' cannot be used including an exchange of information. Agreement on the method or the value may be reached.

In the publication Customs Valuation, Commentary on the GATT Customs Valuation
Code, the authors (Sherman and Glashoff) deal with the permitted and prohibited methods of valuation. At p 239 in dealing with the prohibited methods of valuation this passage appears: c) The Price of Goods on the Domestic Market of the Country of Exportation 
This was a basic Canadian approach to valuation for many years. Its unacceptability under the Code was a major reason for Canada's delay in adoption of the Code until 1985. This method of valuation is contrary to the spirit of the declaration in the preamble that 'valuation procedures should not be used to combat dumping'. (C7) Dumping is basically defined as selling for export at less than is charged in the home market (plus injury to industry in the country of importation) and valuation based on the home market price is usually directed at increasing duties in situations where the price for export is lower.

The Canadian practice involved rejecting the price paid on the export market because it was a "dumping price" and using the price on the domestic market of the exporting country. Using the latter price is not permitted under the Code.

Customs submitted that the purpose underlying the insertion of sub-para (c) in s161G, namely, prohibiting the use of customs valuations to combat dumping did not apply in the present case. There was no question of dumping. Customs sought, in effect, to read s161G(c) as only applying when there was dumping or an attempt to use customs valuations to combat dumping. It is not permissible to read the wide words used so narrowly. Prices on domestic markets frequently include local taxes such as a value added tax, which are not applied to goods sold on export markets.

GAAT, the Code and other agreements, Notes and Studies point to it not being permissible under them to use as a basis for valuation of the imported goods the price or prices of goods on the domestic market of the exporting country and that includes the imported goods. These materials and the Explanatory
Memorandum do not support Customs using as a base the price of the vehicles on the domestic markets of the United States or the United Kingdom.

Sub-para (c) unlike other sub-paragraphs in s161G does not contain any limitations, conditions or qualifications which would entitle a court to read down the phrase "of goods" in sub-para (c) so as to exclude "the imported goods". I have difficulty in understanding why Customs could not have regard to prices paid for relevant Rolls Royce and Mercedes Benz vehicles on the domestic markets of the United States and United Kingdom but could use the prices earlier paid on the domestic markets of those countries for the vehicles which were subsequently imported by the purchasers.

Counsel for Customs stressed that basically the price or the invoice price of the goods was the basis of arriving at the customs value. I do not agree. The usual basis is the price, usually the invoice price, of the goods on the export market of the country from which the goods are imported. In clause 1 of the General Introductory Commentary to the Implementation Agreement it is stated: "The primary basis for customs value under the Agreement is 'transaction value' as defined in Article 1...." 
Article 1 states: "The customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value, that is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Article ...." 
In Re IDD Societe Anonyme (No 2) supra at 255, the Tribunal adopted some remarks made in an earlier decision that what was excluded from the definition of "relevant transaction" was a contract of sale that does not bring the goods to Australia. That principle underlies the current regime.

While the fall back value is such value as the Collector determines he is required to have regard to other methods of valuation in sequence and not to have regard to any of the prohibited matters.

I conclude that in determining the fall back value of the two vehicles regard may not be had to the prices paid on the domestic markets in the United States and the United Kingdom for the respective vehicles.

Customs submitted that whatever method of valuation was employed to determine questions of value, the purchase price of the imported goods was always relevant, even if it was not determinative, or I would add, the base from which customs value was ultimately determined. It is important, Customs contended, to know what price was paid for imported goods so the Collector could determine whether the transaction value method should be used or rejected or used in a modified way or as an analogue or simply as a comparison if another method of customs valuation should be employed. It was, perhaps, a rough cross check or cross reference through which to view the results produced by other methods. Lies told by an importer in relation to the purchase price of imported goods were always material for the purposes of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/).

Under [s233(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) a person shall not smuggle any goods. By [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s4.html) "smuggling" means, inter alia, any importation or attempted importation of goods with intent to defraud the revenue.
[S234(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) provides that a person shall not evade payment of any duty which is payable.
[S234(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) provides that a person shall not knowingly or recklessly: "(i) make a statement to an officer that is false or misleading in a material particular; or ..." 
Under [s237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s237.html) any attempt to commit an offence against the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) shall be an offence against the Act punishable as if the offence had been committed.

The offence of smuggling (any importation or attempted importation of goods with intent to defraud the revenue) does not depend on whether the price paid for the imported goods on the domestic market of the exporting country may be taken into consideration in determing the customs value, being in this case the fall back value. There is an importation with intent to defraud the revenue where goods are brought into Australia from overseas, the entry for home consumption contains the particular that the invoice price (FOB) and the customs value for duty is a stated figure which is false and the duty shown as payable is demonstrably calculated on that figure. The essential facts are covered in paras 2 to 10 of the Information as to the Rolls Royce, in paras 2 to 15 of the Information as to the Mercedes Benz and by the judge's findings.
The representation of an invoice price to Customs with a significant understatement as to price, knowingly made, and an invitation to assess duty on that basis speak of an intention to defraud the revenue. There was an importation.

The offence of evading payment of Customs duty also does not depend on whether the price paid for the imported goods on the domestic market of the exporting country may be taken into consideration in determing the customs value, and in this case, the fall back value.

The knowingly false, major understatement of the invoice price, Dr Hansen's invitation to treat such understated price as the customs value and to calculate the duty payable on the basis of such price, causing an assessment on that basis to be made and the paying of it amounts to an evasion of payment of customs duty.

The information as to each vehicle specified the precise amounts of duty short levied, which were significant and based upon the difference between the falsely stated amounts and the true total price for each vehicle.

The false statements bear upon any consultation between the importer and
Customs, any negotiations and any agreement as to the method of valuation, the customs value and the duties payable.

When the importer purports to take the invoice price as the customs value and that purported price is false and the true invoice price (being the true price paid for the goods) is more than double there is little difficulty in concluding that there has been an evasion of duty.

These observations indicate an approach to the charges of smuggling and evasion which may not correspond completely with that to the charges of knowingly making a statement that was false in a material particular. However, counsel did not approach them separately. The falsity of the statements made was not contested. The issue was whether the falsity was in a material particular.

Upon materiality Customs correctly submitted that Dr Hansen wished Customs to accept, as the customs value of the vehicles, his proffered basis of the invoice price (with adjustments) as the price paid for the vehicles. On this basis, the customs duty would be 40% (and sales tax 20%) of the false invoice price.

Dr Hansen submitted that both he and Customs had approached the assessment of the duties upon an incorrect basis. That may be so. He certainly did in supplying knowingly false information. Ostensibly, he was propounding the invoice price (albeit falsely stated) with adjustments.

Customs was prepared to and initially assessed duty on the invoice price which
Dr Hansen propounded. Subsequently it assessed duty on the invoice price, correctly stated. It treated the true purchase price with adjustments as the customs value. Dr Hansen and Customs started ostensibly from the same base of the invoice price. Dr Hansen stated it falsely whereas Customs insisted on it being stated truthfully. As earlier mentioned, the parties may agree on customs value and its method of calculation. This pre-supposes the supply of correct (or at least not deliberately false) information.

Where a party propounds a basis for the assessment of customs duty and knowingly states falsely the material figures relating to that basis and seeks to have Customs act upon that basis and upon those false figures it is unsustainable to suggest that those statements are not material to the assessment of customs duty and sales tax. It is not to the point that the basis suggested for the calculation of duty was incorrect or rejected. The knowingly false information is supplied in an effort to obtain a favourable assessment. It could not be accepted that an importer could supply, knowingly, false information of some consequence as the basis of the assessment he proposed but be untroubled if that basis or method of assessment is rejected.

I would answer the question asked in the stated case thus: 
In the circumstances of the present case with Dr Hansen seeking the assessment of customs duty on the basis of the invoice price of the vehicles (being the ostensible purchase price of the vehicles on the domestic markets of the exporting country with adjustments) and knowingly falsely stating that price, such false statements were material to the assessment of the customs value of the vehicles and the customs duty and sales tax payable.

The case stated should be returned to the judge with this expression of opinion. Dr Hansen is to pay the Comptroller's costs of the stated case.

SPERLING J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment in draft form of Smart J. I agree with his proposed answer to the question asked in the stated case, with the orders he proposes and with his reasons for decision.
 
HIDDEN J: I agree with Smart J.
