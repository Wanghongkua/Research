THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
CLARKE, BEAZLEY JJA, SANTOW AJA 
CATCHWORDS: BUILDING CONTROL AND TOWN PLANNING - Extension of Use - Licensed premises - whether extended trading hours constitute an "enlargement, expansion or intensification of use" within <case>(c) [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/).

EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: RESERVED 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: ALLOWED 
The licensee of the Rose, Shamrock & Thistle Hotel on Oxford Street, Paddington was granted approval for extended trading hours by the Licensing Court of NSW on 28 March 1995. The approval permitted the hotel to trade in liquor from 5 am until 5 am the next day, Mondays to Saturdays, and from 10 am until 10 pm on Sundays. The appellant council had earlier rejected a development application by the respondent for extended trading hours.

The appellant commenced proceedings in the Land & Environment Court against the respondent seeking a declaration that the 24 hour trading was in breach of the relevant Local Environmental Plan and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/index.html#p4) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/), or alternatively, that Part 5 of the EPA Act had to be complied with. Section (2)(c) of the EPA Act requires development consent for "any enlargement or expansion or intensification" of use. The appellant's case at first instance, before Pearlman CJ, centred on the question of whether the increase in trading hours constituted an "intensification" of an existing use within s (2)(c) of the EPA Act. Her Honour, finding that there had been no "intensification" of use, dismissed the appellant's application.

HELD: 
Appeal allowed.

Whether an increase in trading hours for the sale of on-site liquor is an "enlargement or expansion or intensification" of the use of the premises within the meaning of <case>(c) EPA Act is a question of whether what has been established falls within the notion of increase embodied within <case>(c). However, if required to categorise an increase in trading hours as either an "enlargement", "expansion" or "intensification" of use, Clarke JA preferred the view that it constituted an "intensification", while Beazley JA and Santow AJA considered it to constitute an "enlargement".
 
ORDERS 
The Court orders that the:
Appeal be allowed with costs.
Parties submit Short Minutes of Order specifying any declarations and injunctions sought in accordance with these reasons for judgment within 24 hours.
 
JUDGMENT 
BEAZLEY JA: The question raised on the appeal is a short one, namely, whether, by operating a hotel known as the Rose, Shamrock & Thistle Hotel on Oxford Street, Paddington during extended hours, there has been an "enlargement", "expansion" or "intensification" of use within the meaning of [s 109(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) (the EPA Act). If there has, it is common ground that the second respondent, who is the owner of the hotel, requires development consent for the enlarged, expanded or intensified use.

Facts 
The Rose, Shamrock & Thistle Hotel is on the corner of Oxford Street and
Rosebud Lane in Paddington. The ground floor is used as a `hotel', that is, for the on-site sale of liquor. Certain entertainment-type facilities, such as a TAB agency, jukebox and pool tables are also located on this floor. The first floor is unoccupied. The second floor is used for hotel accommodation for paying guests, with the provision of about 14 rooms.

On 4 October 1991, the LEP applicable to the land came into operation. Under the LEP, use of the premises, which are zoned 3(a)(General business), as a hotel, is permissible with the consent of council. At that date, the premises were being used as a hotel (including the provision of accommodation) and thus had the benefit of the existing use provisions in Part 4 Division 2 of the EPA
Act. As at 4 October 1991, the trading hours of that portion of the hotel used for on-site liquor sales were Monday-Saturday 7 am-12 midnight, and Sunday 10 am-8 pm.

The first respondent became the licensee of the hotel in late 1994. The trial judge (Pearlman CJ) found that at that time, liquor was being sold on the premises during the trading hours to which I have just referred.

On 28 March 1995, the Licensing Court of NSW granted approval for extended trading hours for the sale of liquor from 5 am until 5 am the next day, Monday to Saturday, and from 10 am until 10 pm on Sunday. Since that date, liquor has been sold on the premises during those hours. The respondents do not have development consent for trading in liquor sales during such extended hours.

Issue on the Appeal 
The sole issue on appeal is whether, by trading during these extended hours, there has been an "enlargement, expansion or intensification of . . use" within <case>(c) of the EPA Act. If there has, development consent for that use of the premises is required under <case> of the EPA Act. Both parties were in agreement that, in this case, the relevant date for comparison of the extent of the use for the purposes of <case>(c) was 4 October 1991, the commencement date of the appellant's LEP.

Findings by the Trial Judge 
The relief argued sought and refused at first instance included a declaration that this use of the hotel for 24 hour trading was a breach of the relevant
LEP and Part 4 of the EPA Act or alternatively, that Part 5 of the EPA Act had to be complied with. The appellant's case at first instance was that the use of the hotel was an "intensification of . . use" within <case>(c).
Presumably, because of the way the application was framed, the focus of argument and her Honour's judgment was upon the question whether there had been an intensification of use.

Her Honour noted that the hours during which the use was carried on was merely one aspect of use and that <case> necessitated a consideration of all aspects of use of the hotel. Her Honour correctly differentiated between impact of use and intensification of use. Then, adapting the approach taken by Cripps J in
King versus Lewis [(1991) 74 LGRA 362], in relation to the assessment of intensification of use in an extractive industry (ie, by measuring output), her Honour accepted that the question whether there had been an intensification of use in this case could be appropriately assessed by a comparison of objective criteria such as: levels of patronage, liquor sale records and revenue from liquor sales; revenue from amusement machines; and a comparison of use of other aspects of the hotel- eg., the use of the premises for accommodation. Her Honour held that the appellant had not discharged the onus it bore that there had been an intensification in the extent of the use.

Her Honour was correct in respect of which party bore the onus for the purposes of <case>. However, for reasons to which I shall now turn, her
Honour was in error in dismissing the application.

Relevant Statutory Scheme 
Section 109 is part of the statutory regulation of existing use under the
EPA. Under <case>, except as provided by the EPA Act, nothing in the Act or in an environmental planning instrument prevents the continuance of an existing use. However, subsection 107(1) does not authorise "any enlargement or expansion or intensification of an existing use".
 
Section 109, which is relevant to this case, then provides: "(1) Nothing in an environmental planning instrument operates so as to require consent to be obtained under this Act for the continuance of a use of a building, work or land for a lawful purpose for which it was being used immediately before the coming into force of the instrument or so as to prevent the continuance of that use except with consent under this Act being obtained.
 
Nothing in subsection (1) authorises - any alteration or extension to or rebuilding of a building or work; any increase in the area of the use of the land from the area actually physically and lawfully used immediately before the coming into operation of the instrument therein mentioned; without affecting paragraph (a) or (b), any enlargement or expansion or intensification of the use therein mentioned.
. . " 
Section 109(2) (as was <case>) was inserted into the Act in 1986. The effect of the insertion of the subsection was explained by Priestley JA in
Vaughan-Taylor versus David Mitchell-Melcann Pty Ltd & Anor [(1991) 73 LGRA ]
at 373 as follows: "The effect of <case>, as it was interpreted in light of the High Court decisions, was radically changed by the addition to it, operative from 3
February 1986, of subs (2). That subsection requires that "use" be understood in a much narrower sense than before; its effect was, in my opinion, to limit the continued use previously permitted by . . . <case> without consent, to the actual use of the land on the day when the planning laws otherwise would have affected it, that actual use being confined to the land actually (as opposed to potentially) physically being used, and the extent of the use of that land likewise being limited to its extent on that day".
 
Section 109(2) to the extent it qualifies the scope of existing use rights (or perhaps more accurately "privileges": see Vanmeld Pty Ltd versus Fairfield City
Council [(1992) 75 LGRA 375)] restores to local councils, planning control over the continued use of a building, work or land affected by a planning instrument. To that extent, the earlier authorities on the meaning of "existing use of land": viz Parramatta City
Council versus Brickworks Limited <case>; [(1972) 128 CLR 1]; Eaton & Sons Pty Ltd versus Warringah Shire Council <case>; <case>; [(1975) 132 CLR 83]; are of limited, if any, assistance: see Clarke JA in The
Council of the Municipality of Ku-ring-gai versus Mobil Oil Australia (unreported
NSW CA, 3 June 1992).

As I have said, her Honour dealt with the matter on the basis of "intensification". However, <case>(c) is wider than that. There was considerable discussion in argument between bench and bar as to the wider ambit of the section and in particular as to whether the expression "enlargement" was more apposite to the case of extended trading hours, than the word "intensification". Counsel for the respondent advised the court that he was not prejudiced by any such shift in emphasis.

The three words used in <case>(c) are each words of ordinary English meaning. They are each separated in paragraph (c) by the word "or", which, upon a proper construction of the paragraph, is a true disjunctive. Thus, the paragraph is not to be read "ejusdem generis" and each word is to be given its full and ordinary meaning. It is appropriate, when considering the ordinary meaning of words, to use in aid, their dictionary meaning. The dictionary meaning of each word is as follows: "Enlargement: 
The act of enlarging, increase, expansion, amplification.
 [Enlarging]: 
To make larger, increase in extent, bulk or quantity, add to": The Macquarie
Dictionary "an increase in size, extent or scope": The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary.

Expansion: "The act of expanding, the state of being expanded, the amount or degree of expanding.
 [Expand]: "To increase in extent, size, volume, scope": The Macquarie Dictionary.
 "spread or stretch (a thing) out, esp. to its fullest extent, extend, open out;. . . widen the boundaries of, increase the area, scope etc., of, enlarge, dilate": The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.
 
Intensification: "[Intensify] to make intense or more intense": The Macquarie Dictionary.
 "The action of intensifying.
 [Intensify]: 
Make intense; augment, strengthen, heighten, deepen": The Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary.

It is apparent from the above definitions that the words have overlapping meanings. It is not necessary, for the purposes of this appeal to explore their similar or differing nuances. In my opinion, the operation of the hotel for the extended hours for the sale of on-site liquor is an "enlargement" of the use of the premises. It does not matter, therefore, whether the extended hours of operation have resulted in increased patronage, increased liquor sales, or increased revenue from one or more areas of the operational centres of the hotel. Whether those matters are relevant factors to be considered in determining whether there has been an "intensification" in use does not arise on the approach which I consider should have been taken on the facts here.

There are two matters to which I should refer briefly, in deference to the way the matter was put by senior counsel for the respondents. First, he submitted that <case>(c) required scrutiny of the extent of the actual use and not merely the extent of the permitted use. Put in that way, I agree with the submission. However, it is not to the point here, as her Honour found that liquor was being sold during the extended licensed hours.

Secondly, senior counsel submitted, and her Honour found, that the total use of the premises had to be considered. Senior counsel pointed out that the accommodation portion of the hotel had always operated for 24 hours a day, as it must, and therefore there had been no change in this aspect of its operation. Again I agree with the central thrust of this proposition, but do not find it to be of any particular relevance in this case. Although there was no evidence as to the relative revenue of the accommodation and liquor sale aspects of the hotel's operations, the accommodation was on a small scale and it can be inferred that the liquor sale revenue was not insignificant, and that that aspect of its operation was an important aspect of the overall use of the premises. In my opinion, <case>(c) operates in such circumstances where there has been an enlargement of such aspect of the use.

It follows from what I have said that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the parties submit Short Minutes of Order specifying any declarations and injunctions sought in accordance with these reasons for judgment within 24 hours.
 
CLARKE JA: On 23 August 1991 the licensee of the Rose Shamrock & Thistle Hotel, which is situated at 57 Oxford Street, Paddington, lodged a development application with the South Sydney City Council (the Council) in which it sought an extension of trading hours, which were at the time between the hours of 7am and 12 midnight from Monday to Saturday and 10am to 8pm on Sunday. The application was refused. 
On 28 March 1995 the Licensing Court of New South Wales made an order permitting the ground floor of the hotel premises to be used to sell liquor between the hours of 5am to 5am the next succeeding day from Monday to
Saturday and from 10am to 10pm on Sunday. Since that date liquor has been sold at the premises during those hours. No application had been made for development consent following the refusal of the application in 1991 to which
I have referred.

The Council thereupon filed an application in the Land & Environment Court seeking a declaration that the licensee of the hotel was trading in breach of the relevant local environmental plan. It contended that development approval was required in order that the hotel could trade within those hours. The application was heard by Pearlman J who dismissed it. The Council thereupon appealed and the sole point in the appeal is whether the Council had established that the increase in trading hours constituted an `enlargement or expansion or intensification' of the use of the hotel premises within [s109(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) (the
Act).
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html), so far as is relevant, reads: "109 Existing consent 
Nothing in an environmental planning instrument operates so as to require consent to be obtained under this Act for the continuance of a use of a building, work or land for a lawful purpose for which it was being used immediately before the coming into force of the instrument or so as to prevent the continuance of that use except with consent under this Act being obtained.

Nothing in subsection (1) authorises: any alteration or extension to or rebuilding of a building or work, any increase in the area of the use made of a building, work or land from the area actually physically and lawfully used immediately before the coming into operation of the instrument therein mentioned, without affecting paragraph (a) or (b), any enlargement or expansion or intensification of the use therein mentioned, ..." 
The relevant environmental planning instrument came into force on 4 October
The evidence before the court, which included the development application made in August 1991 and a Council Minute Paper bearing date 10
October 1991, established that the permitted hours of trading at the time the instrument became law were those I mentioned in the opening paragraph.
Following the order of the Licensing Court the hours of trading were, as her
Honour found, increased so that the hotel was open for trading for 24 hours per day during the whole of a week with the exception of the period between pm Sunday and 5am on the following Monday. At first blush I would have thought that it was unarguable that the extended trading hours constituted an `enlargement or expansion or intensification' of the use of the hotel premises. In reaching a contrary conclusion her Honour examined a number of factors including liquor sales, the revenue from approved amusement devices, continuance of the provision of accommodation, whether there had been an increase in the number of patrons using the bars in the premises or the number of people using the accommodation and any increase in objectionable behaviour in the neighbourhood of the hotel. In my opinion the question should be approached more simply and that is by asking simply whether the increased hours of trading falls involved an enlargement, expansion or intensification of the use.

In addition, subs(2) to [s109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) of the Act effected a fairly radical change to the Act and the pre-existing approach to the concept of an existing use. In Vaughan-Taylor versus David
Mitchell-Melcann Pty Limited & Anor [(1991) 73 LGR 366] Priestley
JA said (at 373): "The effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html), as it was interpreted in light of the High Court decisions, was radically changed by the addition to it, operative from 3 February 1986, of subs (2).
That subsection requires `use' be understood in a much narrower sense than before; its effect was, in my opinion, to limit the continued use previously permitted by <case> and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) without consent, to the actual use of the land on the day when the planning laws otherwise would have effected it, that actual use being confined to the land actually (as opposed to potentially) physically being used, and the extent of the use of that land likewise being limited to its extent on that day." 
This statement was approved unanimously by this Court in the Council of the
Municipality of Ku-ring-gai versus Mobil Oil Australia Limited (New South Wales
Court of Appeal, 3 June 1992, unreported). As was said in that case the effect of the alterations to the Act of which [s109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) formed part was that existing use rights were to be more narrowly interpreted while enlargements of, and other alterations to, existing uses were facilitated with the consent of the relevant local government authority. These authorities establish, in my opinion, that when a question arises whether there has been an enlargement, expansion or intensification of a use within [s109(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) of the Act the Court is required to examine the extent of the use of the relevant land at the date that the relevant environmental planning instrument came into force (4 October 1991) and the later use which is claimed to be an enlarged, expanded or intensified use.

The question is one of fact and does not, in my opinion, require a complicated analysis of trading figures, numbers of patrons, etc. In the present case one asks simply whether the great extension of the hours of operation effected an expansion, enlargement or intensification of the earlier use. For my part the question allows only of one answer and that is `Yes".

There was some debate during the hearing as to whether this was a case in which it was appropriate to speak of enlargement or intensification. I do not think it helpful to dwell on that issue. The real question is whether what has been established falls within the notion of increase embodied within [s109(2)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html)
I have no doubt that it does. Nothing is to be gained, in my opinion, by inquiring whether the increase in trading hours effected an enlargement (which seems appropriate to areas of use), expansion (which must involve more than an enlargement) or intensification. If I was forced to decide between the three words I tend to favour `intensification' (see by way of example, Rockdale
Municipal Council versus Clark [(1982) 47 LGRA 159], per
Hutley JA at 160). As the appellant's counsel pointed out there can be no doubt that the impact of the use of the premises as a licensed hotel spread over 24 hours will have different consequences in town planning terms to the amenity of the neighbourhood than those activities within the earlier permitted hours. Indeed a great deal of the evidence concerned complaints by occupiers of neighbouring residences since the opening hours have increased.
In these circumstances a narrower construction to [s109(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) would be inimical to the environmental and planning considerations underlying the Act.

For these reasons I agree with the orders proposed.
 
SANTOW AJA: I have had the advantage of reading the Judgments of Clarke JA and Beazley JA in draft. The facts are sufficiently set out in those Judgments. Clarke JA and Beazley JA reach the same conclusion, with which I agree, as I do with the orders proposed.

However, since Clarke JA and Beazley JA reach the same conclusion by slightly different routes, I would wish to add some observations of my own.

With Beazley JA, I conclude that the extension of trading hours, in the circumstances of this case, are more appositely dealt with by reference to the expression "enlargement" in [s109(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) ("the [EPA
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/)"), than by reference to the expression "intensification".

An examination of [s109(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) of the [EPA
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/), in the context of the earlier paragraphs (a) and (b) shows that paragraphs (a) and are directed essentially at the physical aspects of a continuing use.
Thus paragraph (a) relates to the "alteration or extension to or re-building of a building or work". Paragraph (b) relates to "an increase in the area of the use made of a building, work or land". This is by comparison to the area actually physically and lawfully used before the relevant date there referred to.

Paragraph (c) of [s109(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html) is directed rather at the use itself than a building extension or increase in the physical area of the relevant use. There is clearly the possibility of overlap between paragraphs (a) and (b) on the one hand and paragraph (c) on the other. That is reflected in the fact that paragraph (c) is prefaced by the words "without affecting paragraph (a) or (b)". Indeed paragraph (c) refers in its concluding words to "the use therein mentioned". This links paragraph to the earlier paragraph (b), where reference is made to various kinds of use (though by reference to physical area).

The remaining paragraphs (d) and (e) are directed at the continuance of the use, either in breach of any consent in force under the [EPA
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) (para ) or after the use is abandoned (para (e)).

In that statutory context, and taking into account the various dictionary meanings set out in the Judgment of Beazley JA concerning the disjunctive expression "enlargement or expansion or intensification", it is natural enough to attribute a time dimension to enlargement. That time dimension may operate independently of whether there be also an intensification, in the sense of heightening or deepening the use being made. There may, in particular circumstances be both, as illustrated by the example of extending a tennis use from day to night, depending on the facts.

Thus the decision in Rockdale Municipal Council versus Clark [(1982) 47 LGRA ]
per Hutley JA at 160 dealt with precisely that situation. It pre-dates the amendments to the [EPA
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) inserted into the Act in 1986 whereby the existing use rights were constricted by the new [sections (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s107.html) and [109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s109.html)(2).
Those sections were assisted by a new power to make regulations in [s108](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s108.html) "with respect to existing use". That case, following the Judgment of the
High Court in Norman versus Gosford Shire Council <case>; [(1975) 132 CLR 83], affirmed that the intensification of a permitted use does not mean that there is a new use. The new sections reverse that. However, what is relevant about that case is that it concluded that the extension of an existing use for day tennis to a further use for night tennis was the intensification of a permitted use.

However, no evidence appears to have been given in that case as to whether this meant that there would be a less intense use overall by reason of the spreading of the tennis between day and night. Thus the case is not on all fours with the present one before us. Here there was quite comprehensive evidence of matters relevant to the intensification or heightening of a use related to an hotel. This was by comparison of objective criteria such as levels of patronage, liquor sales records and revenue from liquor sales as well as revenue from amusement machines. To extrapolate from Rockdale
Municipal Council versus Clark (supra), that the mere extension of time in relation to a particular use is of necessity intensification, would be going too far, as indeed the reasoning of Pearlman J recognises.

That is why I prefer the view that the present case is more appropriately considered as an enlargement of an existing use, in circumstances where some use clearly occurs in the additional hours. This is so, whether or not there be any increase in terms of the various items of use relevant to an hotel such as liquor sales, whether aggregated in a given day or over a longer period.

It follows from what I have said that the Appeal should be allowed with costs.
