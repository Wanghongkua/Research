Regina versus Geoffrey Duncan KAIN 
CCA 60123/97 September 1997 
Smart J, Sully J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 
CCA 60123/97 REGINA versus Geoffrey Duncan KAIN 
JUDGMENT 
SMART J: Geoffrey Duncan Kain has applied for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by Judge Pain in the District Court on 7
March 1997. That sentence was one of concurrent fixed terms of three months on counts of break, enter and steal and 3 breaches of recognisance. The offences occurred in June and October 1979 and the breaches, which related to non-payment of compensation, in 1980.

There were some difficulties arising out of the proceedings on 7 March 1997.
There was ambiguous evidence as to how much had been paid. There was material indicating that at the time of the breaches by non-payment, the applicant was on unemployment benefits and probably unable to pay. The solicitor for Mr Kain did not seem to appreciate what facts and circumstances should be proved in evidence.

In all the circumstances, bearing in mind the ages of the offences, the reasons for the breaches of the recognizances, that the applicant has spent effectively two months and eighteen days in custody for the 1979 offences and has spent fifteen of the last seventeen years in custody in South Australia, this Court should grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentences and in lieu thereof, on each count, impose a sentence of a fixed term of two months, eighteen days to date from 1 January 1997 and to expire on March 1997. That was the day on which he was last released on bail.
 
SULLY J: I agree.
 
SMART J: The orders are as proposed.
