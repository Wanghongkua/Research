Wednesday 9 January 2002  
Re GRACE AND RITA  On 26 September 2001, the children of the second and third Defendants were removed from the care of their parents pursuant to [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s43.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/).  On 27 September 2001 officers of the Department of Community Services attempted to file at the Campbelltown Children's Court an application pursuant to the provisions of [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s45.html) and [61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s61.html) of the Act. The Registrar declined to accept the application on the basis of a general policy that unless an application was to be heard on the list day, such application would not be accepted.  On 28 September 2001 the Department lodged the application in relation to the children and it came before Mr T Lucas sitting as the Children's Court of
New South Wales.  His Worship determined that the application could be seen as an attempt by the Department to circumvent the requirements of an application under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/index.html#p1) of Chapter 5 of the Act. He made orders that the matter be adjourned until 3
October and that parental responsibility of the children be granted to the
Minister.  On 2 October 2001 a further application was filed and dealt with on 3
October.   The substance of the application filed on 28 September was in these terms:-  "FINAL ORDERS 
I hereby made application to the Children's Court at 
For the following final orders:  *Unknown at this point  
The grounds on which it is alleged that the child/young person is in need of care and protection are  the child or young person has been, or is likely to be, physically or sexually abused or ill-treated;  the child or young person is suffering or is likely to suffer serious developmental impairment or serious psychological arm as a consequence of the domestic environment in which he or she is living;  
The application is accompanied by an affidavit in support of the application in accordance with Children's Court [Rule .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s20.html)  
Interim Orders 
In addition to the final orders sought, I make application for the following interim orders: 
S.69 Interim Care Order 
The Department respectfully requests that Tori and Taylisha be placed in the
Director General's care during the interim period  
S.54 Assessment of person's capacity for parental responsibility 
The Department further requests that an adjournment of 8 weeks be granted in order for parental capacity assessments to be completed.  
The grounds on which the interim orders are applied for are that it is not in the best interests of the safety, welfare and well-being of the child or young person that he/she should remain with his/her parents or other person having parental responsibility.  The application dealt with on 3 October was in identical terms save that it contained an additional ground, viz.-  "the child or young person's basic physical, psychological or educational needs are not being met, or are likely not to be met, by his or her parents  The magistrate held that the application was not a valid one but an abuse of process. However he held that the matter was one where it was appropriate for an emergency care and protection order for a period of 14 days. He so ordered.  I was informed that another care application involving the children the subject of these proceedings is being processed but the proceedings in this
Court have been brought by the Director General of the Department of Community
Services to challenge the view of the Act taken by the registrar and the magistrate. Before me there was representation on behalf of the Director
General, the children involved and their mother. In the summons, the orders sought were:- 
An order that these proceedings be styled "Re Grace and Rita." 
A declaration that in proceedings relating to TP (date of birth 25 April ) and TP2 (date of birth 2 May 2000) at the Campbelltown Children's Court on 3 October 2001 ("the said proceedings") the First Defendant as constituted by Mr T Lucas, Children's Court Magistrate, erred in the construction of s.45 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) act 1998)"the Act") 
A declaration that I the said proceedings, the First Defendant erred in the construction of s.61 of "the Act". 
A declaration that in the said proceedings, the First Defendant erred in failing to hear the Plaintiff's application for leave to amend the s.61 Care
Application. 
An order that the First Defendant hear and determine the Plaintiff's application for leave to amend the s.61 Care Application, according to law. 
An order that the First Defendant hear and determine the Plaintiff's application pursuant to s.45 of "the Act" according to law 
An order that no information be published - except for the purpose of the proper conduct of these proceedings and the execution of the orders made therein - that would allow Tori Potts or Taylisha Potts to be identified as the subject of these proceedings.  Order 1 was consented to and made during the hearing.  So far as is relevant to the issues I have to decide, the [Children and
Young Persons (Care and Protection)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/) provides:-  [Part 1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/index.html#p1) Emergency protection and assessment 
Division 1 Emergency removal  Removal of children and young persons without warrant 
If the Director-General or a police officer is satisfied, on reasonable grounds:-  that a child or young person is at immediate risk of serious harm, and  that the making of an apprehended violence order would not be sufficient to protect the child or young person from that risk  the Director-General or police officer may (without the need for any authority other than that conferred by this subsection) remove the child or young person from the place of risk in accordance with this section.  and (3) (These subsections contain other removal powers.)  Prompt application to Children's Court for care order 
If a child or young person is removed from premises or a place under a power of removal conferred by or under this act or the care responsibility of a child or young person is assumed by an order under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s44.html), the Director-General must apply to the Children's Court at the first available opportunity, but no later than the next sitting day of the Children's Court after the removal or assumption of care and protection, for one or more of the following care orders in respect of the child or young person:-  an emergency care and protection order,  an examination and assessment order,  any other care order. 
On the hearing of the application, the Director-General must explain to the Children's Court why the removal of the child or young person without a warrant was considered to be necessary. 
Despite subsection (1) the Director-General is not required to apply for any order of the Children's Court if the Director-General considers that no order is necessary, but the Director-General must explain to the Children's
Court at the first available opportunity why no care applications was made.  [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s61.html), [64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s64.html), [67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s67.html), [68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s68.html) and [70](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s70.html) apply to an application for an emergency care and protection order. The other provisions of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/index.html#p2) do not apply to such an order.  
Division 2 Emergency care and protection orders   Emergency care and protection orders 
The Children's Court may make an order for the emergency care and protection of a child or young person if it is satisfied that the child or young person is at risk of serious harm. 
The order, while in force, places the child or young person in the care and protection of the Director-General or the person specified in the order. 
The order has effect for a maximum period of 14 days, unless the order is extended in accordance with subsection (4). 
An order under this section may, while the order remains in force, be extended once only for a further maximum period of 14 days.  
Division 4 Who has care responsibility?  Care of child or young person pending care proceedings 
If a child or young person is removed from the care of his or her parent or parents under this Part or a warrant issued under [section :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s233.html)  the child or young person is to be kept at a place approved by the
Minister for the purposes of this section, and 
The Director-General has the care responsibility for the child or young person. 
The Children's court may, by order, vest the care responsibility in a designated agency.  
Division 6 Examination and assessment orders  Making of assessment orders 
The Children's Court may make an order for:  the physical, psychological, psychiatric or other medical examination of a child or young person, or  the assessment of a child or young person, or both.  [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/index.html#p2) Care applications   Definitions 
In this Act: 
Care application means an application for a care order. 
Care order means an order under this Chapter for or with respect to the care and protection of a child or young person, and includes a contact order under [section 86.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s86.html) 
Care proceedings means proceedings under this Chapter.  Applications for care orders 
A care order may be made only on the application of the Director-General, except as provided by this Chapter. 
A care application must specify the particular care order sought and the grounds on which it is sought. 
The order sought may be varied, but only with the leave of the Children's
Court.  Interim and final orders 
A care order may be made as an interim order or a final order, except as provided by this Part.  Evidence of prior alternative action 
When making a care application, the Director-General must furnish details to the Children's Court of:-  the support and assistance provided for the safety, welfare and well-being of the child or young person, and  the alternatives to a care order that were considered before the application was made and the reasons why those alternatives were rejected.  Children's Court order not limited by terms of care application 
The making of a care application for a particular care order of the Children's
Court does not prevent the Children's Court from making a care order different from, in addition to, or in substitution for, the order for which the application was made, provided all prerequisites to the making of the order are satisfied.  Interim care orders 
The Children's Court may make interim care orders in relation to a child or young person after a care application is made and before the application is finally determined. 
The Director-General, in seeking an interim care order, has the onus of satisfying the Children's Court that it is not in the best interests of the safety, welfare and well-being of the child or young person that he or she should remain with his or her parents or other persons having parental responsibility.  The precise basis for the magistrate's conclusion that the applications before him were invalid and an abuse of process does not appear clearly.
However the transcript of proceedings on 3 October reveals that His Worship was concerned that:- 
The application on that day did not specify any final orders sought, 
The application did not seek an emergency care and protection order and thus appeared to be one under [s61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s61.html) rather than under [s45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s45.html), 
Applications for an emergency care and protection order involves different standards than do those under [s61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s61.html), and 
The application sought an assessment order and assessments by the
Children's Court clinic took 8 weeks.  When his Worship indicated his concern that the application did not specify any particular final order sought, the legal representative appearing for the
Director General indicated he sought leave to amend to add a final order.
According to the transcript, he did not develop this application and immediately afterwards his Worship delivered some reasons for judgment in which he remarked that the procedure followed by the Director-General was an abuse of process and the application not valid. His Worship did not advert to the amendment application. Then the parties further addressed. The representative of the mother submitted that as there was no valid application, there was no valid basis for the children being held and they should be returned to the mother. The lawyer representing the children expressed concern at that possibility and submitted that [s15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s15.html) of the Children's Court Act enabled the court to make any order it saw as necessary and that an emergency care and protection order was appropriate.
Counsel appearing for the Department of Community Services joined in that application, not renewing his application to amend or reminding the Magistrate of it.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s15.html) of the Children's Court Act, 1987 provides:-  "The court may in relation to all matters in respect of which it has jurisdiction, make such orders, including interlocutory orders, as it thinks appropriate."  A convenient first question is whether, when s45(1)(c) refers to applying for "any other care order", the section intends to refer to care applications dealt with in Part 2 of Chapter 5 or some application for a care order not attended with the same limitations and restrictions. In that an emergency care and protection order, even if extended, is limited to a period of 28 days, the
Act clearly contemplates that such orders will be followed by further proceedings. The nature of examination and assessment orders leads the same direction. Those further proceedings may, of course be pursuant to additional prayers in the application seeking an emergency care and protection order or an examination and assessment order but they may also be entirely new or pursuant to a grant of leave to amend the initial application. For s45 expressly contemplates that only one of the types of orders to which it refers may be sought in an application under the section.  And if an emergency care and protection order or an examination and assessment order may be sought in an application under s45 without any prayer for final relief (insofar as any relief under the Act may be final), there is no reason apparent in s45(1) why the third type of relief contemplated by the section, "any other care order" should not equally be of a preliminary or interim nature rather than one where, in circumstances likely to be attended by haste and an incomplete state of knowledge, the Director-General has to specify the particular order finally to be sought.  On the other hand, sub-section 4 does provide an indication of what is intended. It provides that some of the sections in Part 2 shall apply to an application for an emergency care and protection order. There is no comparable provision relating to an application for "any other care order". One of the sections mentioned in sub-section 4 is section 64, a section directed to ensuring that parents are notified of applications. A second is s67, providing that the Children's Court is not to be limited by the terms of a care application to the orders the court may make. It is inconceivable that
Parliament intended that these provisions should apply to care applications generally and to applications for emergency care and protection orders yet not to care applications brought under s45(1). The fact that sub-section 4 is limited to applications for emergency care and protection orders thus indicates that Parliament thought or intended that applications under s45(1) for "any other care order" were governed in any event by the terms of Part 2 of the Division. Thus in my view, an application for a care order, even if brought in the circumstances contemplated by s45, is still an application under s61.  Further support for this view is afforded by the circumstance that, if the view of the Director General is correct and the act permits the bringing of interim care orders without more, the concept of emergency care and protection orders is otiose as is the stipulation in Section 46(1) that satisfaction that a child or young person is at risk of serious harm is the touch stone by which applications for emergency care and protection orders are to be judged.  My attention was drawn to passages from the Minister's Second Reading speech when the current legislation was introduced into Parliament and to extracts from a report of the "Review of the [Children (Care and Protection)
Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/capa1987250/):
Recommendations for Law Reform". The latter document contained the passage:-  "Recommendation3.3 
The Act should require that the care application must state the orders or orders sought and the grounds for the order. The child and those with current parental responsibility for child should be told clearly what the concerns about them are and what effect the orders sought will have on residence, contact, parental responsibility and supervision.  
Comment: Unnecessary litigation may well be avoided if the parents are clear from the beginning what orders the Department is seeking and the grounds of that application... .  
The Act should allow for the orders sought to be varied ... but only with leave of the Court."  In her second reading speech the Minister said:-  "This bill proposes that where a child or young person has been removed the matter must be immediately brought before the court, that is, no later than the next sitting day. The court will then be able to make a range of interim orders which will allow for a full assessment of the circumstances. It will allow the Plaintiff to gather reports and evidence, and for the Plaintiff to decide if a care application is needed and what Final Orders will be sought."  In the reference to "a range of interim orders which will allow for a full assessment of the circumstances", these last remarks perhaps give some support for the view that no final orders need be specified at the time application is made after a child's removal. In paragraphs 45(1) (a) and (b), the act clearly does not fulfil the aim of the authors of the report that the parents of a child should know from the outset what orders will be sought. However, because in my view the wording of the act itself is clear, I find these references of no assistance.  The fact that the applications in this case sought care orders (other than those the subject of s45(1)(a) and (b)) yet failed to specify any final orders thus amounted to a breach of the terms of s61(2). Although there may be argument that the terms of s61 should be regarded as directory, the inclusion of the word "must" in s61 leads to the view that compliance with the section is mandatory.  The third of the matters referred to above which seemed to be of, or to lead to, concern on the part of the magistrate is obviously correct. However, the matter needs no further attention than given to it above.  The fourth of the matters which concerned his Worship has nothing to do with the validity of any application. If, as seemed common ground, the 8 week estimate of the time it takes for there to be an assessment by the Children's
Court clinic (as s58 contemplates will generally occur) is correct, the
Director General may have to rely more than he would have wished on being given liberty to amend any application and on interim orders being granted at the end of the 28 day period provided for by s46. Presumably the problem is that the resources necessary to achieve early definition of the final order sought, are not available but, be that as it may, the Children's Court has to deal with the situation as it is presented.  In the light of these remarks, I return to the summons in this Court. Order , as I have said, has been made. The parties considered that order 7 was unnecessary. Counsel appearing for the Director General pressed for each of orders 2 to 6. Counsel appearing for the mother and children opposed that and submitted that I should affirm the decisions of the magistrate.  It follows from what I have said that I am not persuaded that the magistrate's reservations concerning the application brought before him were incorrect. Indeed, if I understand correctly his Worship's view, I agree with him. Accordingly no orders in terms of prayers 2, 3 and 6 of the summons will be made.  Nor am I disposed to make orders in accordance with prayers 4 and 5. So far as prayer 4 is concerned, I am not satisfied that his Worship failed to hear the application to amend although he clearly did not deal with it. It is not apparent whether this was merely an oversight but in any event the approach then taken by Counsel for the Director General would seem to indicate he was content to proceed to other matters. In these circumstances I am not satisfied there was any error of law on the part of the Magistrate. But in any event, the fact that there is another application on foot would indicate that any application to amend the Applications with which I am concerned is academic.
There is thus no occasion for making order 5.  It follows that, apart from the first prayer, the other orders sought in the Summons should be refused. They were the substantial matters. Accordingly my formal order is that, except in relation to prayer 1, the Summons is dismissed, with costs.
