JUDGMENT 
Introduction
By amended summons filed on 23 September 2014 Craig Varty appealed against a conviction entered by Magistrate Gilmour at the Downing Centre Local Court on 14 May 2014 for possessing a prohibited drug contrary to <case> of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMTA). The appeal was brought pursuant to [Part 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/index.html#p5) of the [Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) . The appeal is of right on a question of law alone: subs 52(1).
Although the amended summons does not specify the grounds of appeal, it was accepted by Mr Kell, who appeared on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), that the grounds relied upon were those identified in the plaintiff's written submissions as follows: * (1) The Magistrate erred in treating the plaintiff's dropping of the drugs as an 'intervening' fact' which weighed in favour of admitting the evidence when it was irrelevant to the discretion.
* (2) The Magistrate erroneously applied the criminal standard when determining whether the contravention was deliberate or reckless and erred in limiting the weight given to the gravity and nature of the contravention.
* (3) The Magistrate failed to give proper weight to the low level of seriousness of the [s 10(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s10.html) offence.
Although the second and third grounds raised questions of fact that were not open for this Court to review, the first ground involved a question of law, since the plaintiff contended that her Honour had had regard to an irrelevant consideration. The second ground also involved a question of law since the application of the correct standard of proof is a question of law.

The Background 
The underlying facts
On Thursday 4 September 2012, at about 2.20pm the plaintiff was a passenger in a red Holden Commodore sedan which was being driven by Jonathan McCarrie. The car was travelling northbound on the Pacific Highway near Chatswood. Police in an unmarked car noticed that the Commodore was being driven erratically. Senior Constable David Wilson used his mobile phone to advise police, who were travelling ahead in another unmarked police car, that the Commodore was being driven dangerously. He saw the Commodore swerve into a 7/11 service station for a short period before continuing along Pacific Highway.
Senior Constable Wilson recognised Mr McCarrie and informed Senior Constable Sleigh, the driver of the second police vehicle. Senior Constable Hassett, the passenger in that vehicle, also recognised him in connection with other police matters in the Forster area. Senior Constable Hassett asked Senior Constable Sleigh to pull the Commodore over. He activated the car's flashing lights and brought the Commodore to a stop on the side of the road.
Senior Constable Hassett went to the passenger door of the Commodore. He recognised the plaintiff and noticed that his hands were shaking and he was sweating. By this time the first police vehicle had stopped. Senior Constable Wilson approached the driver's side of the Commodore and saw the plaintiff put his hands down in front of him in the direction of the foot well of the vehicle.
Senior Constable Hassett told Mr McCarrie and the plaintiff that he believed that they may be in possession of illegal drugs and proposed to search them and the Commodore. Senior Constable Hassett opened the passenger door and the plaintiff started to get out. Senior Constable Wilson saw that the plaintiff was carrying a pair of black jeans. He saw him move both of his hands behind his back and vigorously shake a container. Numerous particles of substance fell to the ground. Senior Constable Wilson called to other police and said, "It's in his hands." The plaintiff did not relinquish his grip on the container. After a physical altercation, the plaintiff was arrested and collected the particles collected from the ground. When the Commodore was searched, glass smoking implements and wallet, containing the plaintiff's identification, and two plastic bags of a white crystalline substance, accepted to be methylamphetamine, known as ice, were found.

The criminal proceedings
The plaintiff was charged with deemed supply of methylamphetamine under [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s25.html) of the DMTA, with an alternative charge of possession under [s 10(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s10.html) of the DMTA. He was also charged with resisting an officer in the execution of his or her duty: [s 58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s58.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) .
The matter was heard summarily before Magistrate Gilmour over four days: 2 September 2013, 26 November 2013, 10 March 2014 and 14 May 2014.
The plaintiff objected to the evidence of what occurred after the Commodore was stopped on the ground that it had been unlawfully obtained because the officer did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that the occupants of the vehicle were in possession of prohibited drugs.
After Senior Constables Wilson and Hassett had given evidence on the voir dire the Magistrate gave an ex tempore judgment, on 10 March 2014, in which she held that the search was illegal as Senior Constable Hassett did not have reasonable grounds to suspect, within the meaning of [s 21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/leara2002451/s21.html) of the [Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/leara2002451/) (LEPRA), that the plaintiff had a prohibited drug within his possession or control. At the conclusion of this part of the decision, her Honour said: "As has been pointed out it must be probative evidence upon which a reasonable suspicion can be attached and on that basis I cannot see on the evidence before me that there was available at that time a reasonable suspicion that could attach to Mr Varty at the time he was told he was to be searched, and to get out of the car. On that basis I find that the direction to get out of the car to be searched was illegal.

However, that's not where it ends, we now have to continue on to [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/leara2002451/s138.html)"
Her Honour then heard submissions on whether the evidence that had been obtained after Senior Constable Hassett had decided to search the Commodore should be admitted notwithstanding that it had been unlawfully obtained: [s 138](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) . Her Honour's reasons for admitting the evidence included the following: "In this case, as has been shown by the evidence, the vehicle in which Mr
Varty, the accused, was a passenger, was stopped. Mr Varty was told he was to exit the vehicle and be searched, and in the process of exiting the vehicle and prior to the search he was observed to drop something behind his back.

Officer Wilson, in the belief that Mr Varty may have been disposing of evidence then yelled out to Officer Hassett and both Mr Varty and the material said to have been dropped were in the control of the various police officers.
Those are the circumstances. As I have said there is no doubt, as I have ruled, that the indication to Mr Varty that he was to remove himself from the vehicle, or be removed from the vehicle and to be searched, was illegal.

That search, no doubt as anticipated by Officer Hassett, had an intervening situation where before that search took place he was observed to drop the offending drug where upon a further detention became evident. They are the facts that have got to be relied upon in this case.

If one looks at [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s138.html), it says, "Without limiting the matters that the Court may take into account under subs (1) it is to take into account the probative value of the evidence". Clearly in this case without the admission of the evidence then in effect there is no case. The importance of the evidence likewise without the drug, there is no case.

The nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence, and the nature of the subject matter of the proceedings; this is a deemed supply case, it is at the lower end of the scale. There is not evidence at this point in time of any indicia of actual supply. There is no evidence that a supply was taking place, was about to take place, it is based purely on the deeming provisions and as has been pointed out, falls into the just deeming provisions in terms of the quantity being 3.38 grams.

Nonetheless this Court, on a regular basis, daily in fact, deals with numerous drug related offences. One cannot say that it is a minor offence or a trivial offence, they take up much of the Court's time, and of course, within the supply charges there are those that are minor and more serious, but the offence itself is an offence which I think is a relevant offence.

The gravity of the impropriety; in this case it falls down to the belief of a police officer as to whether he had proper grounds for a reasonable suspicion to allow him to exercise the powers set out in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s21.html) of the [Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/leara2002451/). There is the case where an officer can honestly believe he was entitled to search under those provisions.

There are other cases where the issue of proactive policing goes too far on the mistaken belief as to what that reasonable suspicion can be, and then there is the deliberate or reckless version where it was known or not cared as to whether or not those provisions had been made out before such a search was indicated. Whilst I have some disquiet about the evidence of Leading Senior
Constable Hassett, I cannot say which of those he fits into.

If I had to say, it is more likely that it was proactive policing gone too far, but I cannot definitively say that he was reckless or deliberately disregarded [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/leara2002451/s21.html) on the evidence before me and therefore I have to give him the benefit of the doubt in that his belief as to what the law was, was clearly erroneous. In terms of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, I don't need to consider that in terms of these issues.

Whether any other proceeding whether or not in court has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention; I cannot speak for what the police service may or may not do to any finding that I make but certainly it would seem that at this point in time that is unlikely. The difficulty if any of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of Australian law; Obviously there is no difficulty in investigating drug related offences and carrying out proper stops, search and detail situations, so I do not believe that that really falls to consideration in this Court either.

Again, I do find, as I have indicated to the parties, that the intervention between telling Mr Varty he was going to be searched and before that search taking place, he being seen to dispose of what we now know was the drugs, before the search, does play a part in my decision. It is not the only defining issue but it goes to the nature of the case.

Given the circumstances and the facts in this particular case as they seem to be made out by the evidence, I do believe that the evidence should be admitted as desirability outweighing the undesirability of admitting the evidence and I intend to so."
Following this ruling, the prosecution withdrew the deemed supply charge (subs 25(1) of the DMTA) on the express indication to the Court by the defence that the plaintiff would not be called to give evidence and that the defence would concede that, on the evidence, the Court would find the accused guilty of possession of the drugs (subs 10(1) of DMTA). Thus, while the plaintiff did not plead guilty, he accepted that the offence had been made out.
The plaintiff was, accordingly, convicted of the possession charge and placed on a good behaviour bond for 15 months pursuant to [s 9(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/s9.html) of the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/) . The resist officer charge was dismissed, in accordance with her Honour's finding that the search was not lawful.

The DMTA (s 3 and Sch 1) provides that the traffickable quantity of methylamphetamine is 3g.
Section 21 of LEPRA provides in part: Power to search persons and seize and detain things without warrant 
A police officer may, without a warrant, stop, search and detain a person, and anything in the possession of or under the control of the person, if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that any of the following circumstances exists: . .

Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
Evidence that was obtained: improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.
. .

Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: the probative value of the evidence, and the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.
[Section 142](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s142.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides: 
Admissibility of evidence: standard of proof 
Except as otherwise provided by this Act, in any proceeding the court is to find that the facts necessary for deciding: a question whether evidence should be admitted or not admitted, whether in the exercise of a discretion or not, or any other question arising under this Act, have been proved if it is satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities.

In determining whether it is so satisfied, the matters that the court must take into account include: the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question.

The parties' submissions 
Ground 1: the Magistrate erred in treating the dropping of the drugs as an intervening fact which weighed in favour of admitting the evidence
Ms Manuell SC, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, contended that her Honour erroneously conflated two issues and used the evidence of the "intervening fact", namely the plaintiff's dropping of the drugs, to determine both whether there were reasonable grounds for suspicion (whether the evidence had been lawfully obtained) and whether the evidence ought be admitted under <case> (1). She submitted that the Magistrate was prohibited from taking the "intervening fact" into account in deciding whether it ought to be admitted.
Ms Manuell submitted that the evidence of the "intervening fact" was obtained as a result of the unlawful search because, had it not been for the plaintiff having been directed to get out of the car, the drugs would not have been dropped.
Ms Manuell conceded in oral submissions that the probative value of the evidence and its importance was high. She accepted that the plaintiff's conduct amounted to a "consciousness of guilt" but submitted that this was irrelevant to the question whether the evidence, which had been found to be unlawfully obtained, ought be admitted.
Mr Kell submitted that it was open to her Honour to have regard to the evidence that the plaintiff was observed attempting to dispose of the drugs before the search was effected. Mr Kell contended that the so-called "intervening act" might fall within subs 138(3)(a), (b) or (c) but that it was otherwise relevant to the exercise of the discretion in [s 138(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) which did not restrict the matters that could be taken into account to the matters listed in [s 138(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html)
Mr Kell contended that the plaintiff's conduct amounted to a consciousness of guilt which would make it easier to prove the charge of deemed supply, or alternatively, possession because it would assist the police to prove that the drugs had been in his possession and that he was aware that the drugs were on his person (which is why he needed to get rid of them).

Ground 2: The Magistrate erred in limiting the weight given to the gravity and nature of the contravention and applied the incorrect standard of proof
Ms Manuell contended that, although the Magistrate had referred to the gravity and weight of the contravention, her Honour gave too much weight to the "intervening act". She asserted that her Honour's decision "turned largely" on the attempted disposal of the drugs, that her Honour gave "primacy" to this factor and that it "tipped the balance" in favour of admission of the evidence.
She also contended that the Magistrate erred in applying the criminal standard (beyond reasonable doubt) to the determination whether the contravention had been deliberate or reckless, when the applicable standard, as provided for by [s 142](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s142.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) was the civil standard, or proof on the balance of probabilities.
In support of this submission Ms Manuell relied on an extract from the debate between Bar and Bench in the course of argument, which I propose to disregard since, as I understood Ms Manuell to concede in oral argument, such exchanges are an orthodox means of testing propositions, rather than reflecting a considered view arrived at on the basis of evidence and submissions. They are no substitute for reasons (Director of Public Prosecutions versus Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited <case>; <case>) and ought not to be taken to amount to reasons.
Ms Manuell also relied on the following extract from her Honour's oral reasons, and emphasised the passages which I have italicised below: "If I had to say, it is more likely that it was proactive policing gone too far, but I cannot definitively say that he [Constable Hassett] was reckless or deliberately disregarded [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s21.html) on the evidence before me and therefore I have to give him the benefit of the doubt that his belief as to what the law was, was clearly erroneous."
Ms Manuell submitted that the words chosen by her Honour revealed that the criminal standard had been applied contrary to [s 142](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s142.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) which makes the civil standard applicable. She contended that this was a material error because of the importance of the factor in [s 138(3)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html), namely whether the contravention was deliberate or reckless, and referred to R versus Dalley <case> at <case> per Simpson J.
Mr Kell submitted that a fair reading of her Honour's reasons indicated that her Honour did not misapprehend the appropriate standard of proof to be applied.

Ground 3: The Magistrate failed to give proper weight to the low level of seriousness of the offence under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s10.html) of the DMTA
Ms Manuell submitted that her Honour did not sufficiently address the seriousness of the deemed supply offence (s 25(1)) and did not address the seriousness of the lesser offence [(s 10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s10.html) at all. She submitted that the public interest in admitting unlawfully obtained evidence varies with the seriousness of the offence: R versus Dalley at [1]-[7] per Spigelman CJ, Blanch J concurring. She contended that the amount of methylamphetamine was barely above the traffickable quantity and, accordingly, its seriousness ought to be regarded as relatively low. She submitted that this ought to have inclined the Magistrate to refuse to admit the evidence.
Mr Kell contended that it was not necessary for her Honour separately to address the seriousness of the [s 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s10.html) offence since the primary charge was brought under <case>. He submitted that it was open to her Honour to assess the seriousness of the offence in the way in which her Honour did.

Reasons 
Whether [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides an exhaustive list of matters that may be taken into account in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html)
Where an objection is taken to evidence on the grounds that it has been unlawfully obtained, the Court must consider: first, whether the evidence has been unlawfully obtained; and, if so, whether the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in that way. It is not necessary to address the first step since in the present case there was no challenge to her Honour's finding that the evidence of what had occurred after the car was stopped had been unlawfully obtained.
The second step involves the Court weighing up the desirability of admitting the evidence against the undesirability of admitting it. The wording of subs 138(3) indicates that the list is non-exhaustive ("Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account") and that each of the items on the list is a mandatory relevant consideration ("it [the Court] is to take into account. . . "). [Section 138](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) does not specify any matters which are not to be taken into account. Accordingly, a matter will only be an irrelevant consideration if the statutory wording, as a matter of necessary implication from its subject matter, scope and purpose, prohibits a decision-maker from taking it into account: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs versus Peko-Wallsend Limited <case>; [162 CLR 24 (Peko-Wallsend)] at 505 per Dixon J.
I do not accept Ms Manuell's argument that her Honour did not consider that the drugs were obtained as a consequence of the unlawful search. The whole premise of the decision which her Honour had to make was that the evidence (of the plaintiff attempting to conceal the drugs and then dropping them) had been unlawfully obtained. Although some of what her Honour said could be read as distinguishing between conduct that occurred before the search had got underway and the search proper, the way the Magistrate approached the question made it clear that all of the evidence, from the time the occupants got out of the car, had been unlawfully obtained.
It is difficult to see how the so-called "intervening fact" could be irrelevant to the discretion conferred by [s 138(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) It would seem to fall within the description of the "nature of the subject matter of the proceeding" in subs 138(3)(c) as well as coming within subs (3)(a) and (b). However, even if it is not regarded as falling within the list in subs 138(3), I do not accept that it is not otherwise relevant or that the Magistrate was not entitled to take it into account. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the discretion conferred by [s 138](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) are such as to render significant the context in which the illegality occurred. But for what her Honour found to be an illegal search, the evidence of Mr Varty trying to conceal and then dropping the prohibited substance when he got out of the motor vehicle would not have been obtained.
The evidence was also relevant because of the way the provisions relating to deemed supply operate. [Section 3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s3.html) of the DMTA provides for a wider definition of supply, which includes "keeping or having in possession for supply". Section 25(1) of the DMTA provides for the offence of supply of a prohibited drug. [Section 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s29.html) of the DMTA relevantly deems possession of an amount not less than the traffickable quantity of a prohibited drug (3g in the case of methylamphetamine) to be supply.
Accordingly, Mr Varty could be convicted of deemed supply (count 1) if the Magistrate was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prohibited drugs were in his possession. Proof of this fact was assisted by Mr Varty's consciousness of guilt (which Ms Manuell accepted he exhibited by trying to conceal and then dropping the drug) since it tended to show that the drugs were in his possession rather than in Mr McCarrie's possession: see R versus Nguyen <case> (disposal of a gun).
In my view, the Magistrate was entitled to take into account the evidence of the attempted concealment and the dropping of the drugs in the exercise of the discretion under [s 138(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). Accordingly, the first ground is not made out.

The application of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s142.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to the determination whether the contravention was deliberate or reckless
Where reasons are given ex tempore, it is necessary to apply a certain latitude to them and to resist adopting too pedantic an approach: Acuthan versus Coates <case> per Hodgson, Tobias and McColl JJA (which dealt with [s 140](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s140.html), which is, on this point, relevantly indistinguishable). The so-called Briginshaw doctrine has the effect that, although the standard of proof is not altered where the matter to be proved involves fraud, criminal conduct, or, as in the instant case, unlawful conduct, the strength of the evidence necessary to satisfy the tribunal of fact on the balance of probabilities may be greater because of the seriousness of the allegation.
There was no finding that Constable Hassett did not believe there to be grounds to search the vehicle and its occupants. Her Honour recited his evidence as to his grounds for stopping and searching the car in the following passage from her reasons for determining that the search was unlawful: "There was in the evidence of Leading Senior Constable Hassett, the contention that his belief as to the basis upon which he searched, or told Mr Varty he was to be searched, was based on a combination of things, the intel that was known in relation to McCarrie, the vehicle, and what was referred to as a methodology of McCarrie using passengers to help transport drugs, intel specifically on Mr Varty, both written and otherwise, and his association with
Mr Varty."
What made the search unlawful was that her Honour found that there were, objectively, no reasonable grounds to suspect that there were prohibited drugs in the car, principally because of the lack of written data to back-up the factors identified by Senior Constable Hassett. However, her Honour did not find that Senior Constable Hassett did not believe the grounds which he identified as his grounds for suspicion.
Her Honour's reference to "benefit of the doubt" ought, in my view, be taken to indicate her Honour's appreciation of the gravity of the allegation that a police officer acted either deliberately or recklessly in contravention of the law and the effect of the Briginshaw doctrine on its proof on the balance of probabilities. Although her Honour did not expressly refer to this, it is implicit in the reasons that the determination of whether grounds are reasonable grounds is one about which minds may differ. The use of the word "doubt" in this context does not, in my view, incorporate the criminal standard, but rather indicates that her Honour was not persuaded that Senior Constable Hassett did not consider the grounds he identified to be reasonable (which would have made the illegality deliberate) or that he did not care whether the grounds he identified were reasonable (which would have made the illegality reckless).

The weight to be given to relevant considerations in the exercise of the discretion conferred by [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)
The weight to be given to relevant considerations is pre-eminently a matter for the decision-maker. The weight given to such considerations does not give rise to a question of law, unless the decision is manifestly unreasonable: Peko-Wallsend, at 41-42 per Mason J. It was not contended that the Magistrate's decision was manifestly unreasonable (in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd versus Wednesbury Corporation <case>; <case> per Branson J.
Her Honour's reasons indicate that she considered whether the contravention was deliberate or reckless and was not satisfied that it was either. For the reasons given above, this finding did not involve any error of law since I consider that her Honour applied the requisite standard under [s 142](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s142.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). The weight to which her Honour gave the finding was a matter for her Honour and does not give rise to a question of law. The second ground is not made out.
It is apparent from the extract of her Honour's reasons set out above that her Honour considered the objective seriousness of an offence under <case> of the DMTA. Although her Honour did not specifically address the seriousness of the alternative count under [s 10(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s10.html), there was no need for her to do so. If the evidence was admitted, the threshold quantity for an offence under <case> had been exceeded. There was no reason for her Honour to contemplate, much less predict, the arrangement that was eventually arrived at by agreement (that Mr Varty would not contest the [s 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s10.html) charge) following her Honour's ruling. The weight to which her Honour gave her assessment of the objective seriousness of the <case> offence was a matter for her Honour and does not give rise to a question of law. The third ground is not made out.

Summary
The decision which the Magistrate was required to make was discretionary. The principles in House versus The King  <case>; [55 CLR 499] apply. The plaintiff has failed to make out any basis for a finding that her Honour had regard to any irrelevant matter or failed to consider a relevant matter or otherwise made an error of law (or indeed fact). The conclusion which her Honour reached was open to her in the exercise of the discretion conferred by [s 138(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Costs
The DPP did not seek costs of the proceedings. Mr Kell, who appeared on behalf of the DPP, confirmed that there should be no order as to costs with the intent that each party should bear his own costs of the proceedings.

Orders
For the foregoing reasons I make the following orders: * (1) Dismiss the amended summons.
* (2) No order as to costs.
