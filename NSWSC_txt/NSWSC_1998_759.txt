THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR TRADING versus CHRISTOPHER THOMAS SHARP /98 May 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In this matter, when the matter came before this court this morning, there was no appearance on behalf of Mr. Christopher Thomas Sharp. An affidavit of 18 May 1998 of Phillip Meadows has been filed in court. That affidavit sets out that at the time of the service of the summons herein the identity of the respondent was ascertained by Mr. Meadows and there was evidence that the nature of the process being served upon him was sufficiently drawn to his attention within the Rules. 
The orders sought in the summons included orders restraining the defendant from carrying on the business of a motor dealer without holding a licence under the provisions of the [Motor Dealers Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/) and orders restraining him from advertising or offering for sale motor vehicles, buying, selling or exchanging motor vehicles unless he held at the relevant time a dealer's licence.

Mr. Greenaway of counsel appearing on behalf of the Director General drew my attention to the ambit of the orders sought in the light particularly of [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/s9.html) of the [Motor Dealers Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/) and drew my attention to the definition of "dealer". Essentially a dealer under that
Act is a person who carries on business as a dealer. The definition does not contain such a degree of particularity as would enable more closely the activities of the defendant to be supervised by the Director so that business activities might be separated cleanly and clearly from personal activities in terms of the purchase or sale of motor vehicles.

I was provided with some short minutes of order as to orders sought in lieu of those in the summons particularly because those orders sought in paragraphs 2, and 4 of the summons were so widely drafted that they might prevent the defendant from owning and dealing in personal motor vehicles. Order 2, sought by the short minutes of order handed up to me by the plaintiff's counsel today, seeks an injunction restraining the defendant for a period of two years from dealing in motor vehicles in any way either personally or through another without the prior written approval of the Director General of the Department of Fair Trading.

During argument, Mr. Greenaway of counsel advised me that such orders have previously been made by judges of this court but that no reasoning has been given for the making of such orders and nor is he able to point to any precedent nor direct authority in the Act for such an order.

The affidavit material upon which Mr. Greenaway relies includes firstly the affidavit of Mr. Barry Simpson sworn 14 May 1998. Mr. Simpson, following a complaint of some sort from a motor dealer in Campbelltown, attended at premises at Appin which plainly were the premises of a car yard. There were cars there; there were employees but the signage, such as it was, indicated that these premises were used for car rental. Indeed when the deponent spoke to a person he identified as the defendant and who accepted that identification the defendant asserted to him that the premises were being used for renting the cars and that the cars were the stock of a car rental business.

I note in passing that one of the signs displayed at the premises as shown in the exhibits to that affidavit bore the words "rent/buy plan". Mr. Simpson deposes in paragraph 9 of his affidavit:- "From information provided to me in the course of my duties and from investigations carried out I believe that the defendant is still operating as a motor dealer in the Western Suburbs area of Sydney." 
That paragraph on its own or in the light of Mr. Simpson's affidavit, had that been the only evidence, would have been such that I would not be able to place reliance upon it for the purposes of granting the injunctions that are sought.
However, it is not on its own, it is to be considered in the light of the evidence of Judith Anderson, Assistant Investigator, who swore an affidavit dated 14 May 1998. In that affidavit Ms. Anderson gave evidence that the defendant was dealt with by the Local Court at Campbelltown on 3 April 1998 on a charge under [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/s9.html) of the [Motor Dealers Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/) that the defendant did carry on business as a dealer not being the holder of a dealer's licence, particulars of which were that the defendant purchased 92 vehicles and sold 90 vehicles with proceeds of $1,550.

The defendant failed to appear and was dealt with pursuant to [s.75B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) and fined. Ms. Anderson swears that she believes the defendant has since lodged an application pursuant to [s.100A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100a.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) for a re-hearing. Additionally, Ms. Anderson refers to some evidence given in proceedings in the Equity Division of this court in which there is discussion concerning the lease of some premises and some other matters. In that regard
Mr. Sharp was called and gave evidence which appears in the transcript of 14
April 1997 and at p.4 there are allegations, to put it no higher, that Mr.
Sharp executed some documents without regard for the veracity or accuracy of that which he was thereby purporting to say. Mr. Sharp makes allegations in that evidence concerning the activities of various legal practitioners and it is patent that Mr. Sharp's evidence left a great deal to be desired. He then goes on in re-examination when being questioned as to the use of the name
Christian James Sharp to say:- "My main thing was to open up a car yard. That happened and I have several conflicts with a few inspectors from Consumer Affairs and I was trying to keep a low profile, not that any charges were laid but I had a couple of altercations with a couple of inspectors and that was the main reason and then
I went and showed them my identification and said, 'That's who I really am.
That's what's going on' and ..." 
Ms. Anderson further gives evidence that the registered proprietor of the business name of Appin Rentals, the premises referred to by Mr. Simpson, is shown to be Christian James Sharp and that there is no record of a motor dealer's licence being issued to Christopher Thomas Sharp, Chris Sharp, Chris
Sharpe, Christian James Sharp nor any record of the trading names Appin
Rentals or Appin Rental as referred to on any issued motor dealer's licence.
Ms. Anderson goes on to show that the business Appin Rental or Appin Rentals at that location has ceased to operate and that correspondence sent to the defendant has been returned; telephone calls to his telephone number are met by a woman's voice identifying herself as his mother and offering to pass on messages; that on 15 May 1997 the defendant failed to attend for an interview that had been arranged with inspectors; on 17 May the defendant came to the
Department of Fair Trading and had a conversation with her during which he admitted that Appin Rentals is being used to operate a motor car rental business and that of the 60 vehicles which have been registered through RTA records to Appin Rentals he had only three vehicles left since he had sold the rest and was operating the business from his briefcase.

The evidence continues that the defendant is still unlicensed and is carrying on business as Choice Rental and Leppington Rental at the address 105 Camden
Valley Way, Leppington, and that he has sold, either of his own accord or through Appin Rentals, 90 vehicles, having purchased 92 vehicles between 11
April 1996 and 22 April 1997.

The [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), [s.66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s66.html) provides:- "(1) If, on the application of the Commissioner with the consent of the
Minister, the Supreme Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct that constitutes, or would constitute:- a contravention of:- ...
 a provision of any other legislation administered by the Minister ...
 ...
 the court may grant an injunction in such terms as the court determines to be appropriate.

An injunction under subsection (1) may be granted as an interim injunction without an undertaking being required as to damages or costs or may be granted as a permanent injunction." 
By the Fair Trading Legislation Amendment Act 1997 the provisions of the [Fair
Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) have been altered to omit the word "Commissioner" wherever occurring and inserting in lieu "Director General". The consent of the Minister for the time being for
Fair Trading as at 10 March 1998 has been admitted and marked Exhibit A.

What is sought here is a permanent injunction to restrain the contravention of [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/s9.html) of the [Motor Dealers Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/).

There cannot be the slightest doubt that the defendant has engaged in the proscribed conduct. There is not the slightest doubt that the defendant intended, when spoken to by Ms. Anderson, to continue to engage in one guise or another in the proscribed conduct.
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/s9.html) of the [Motor Dealers Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/) provides that:- "A person (other than an exempted person) shall not:- carry on, or advertise that the person carries on or is willing to carry on, the business of a dealer unless the person is the holder of a dealer's licence." 
Such conduct amounts to a criminal offence under the section and subsequent offences may be punished not only by fines but imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.

Mr. Greenaway has quite properly emphasised that the application is made in aid of the Minister's function to protect members of the public from unlicensed trading such in particular that they would not have the advantages of the statutory warranties the [Motor Dealers Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mda1974154/) provides for, that they would not have the advantages of the adequate system of supervision that the Department has sought to exercise over dealers and emphasises the public importance of the grant of appropriate injunctions.
Except in relation to one matter, I accept these submissions. The order that is sought as order 2 is one of which specific notice has not been given to the defendant and, as I have already said, Mr. Greenaway was unable to take me to any particular authority for making an order in that form. As at present advised I am not willing to make such an order but I would not be willing to close the gate to such an order being made.

In those circumstances I will make an order in accordance with order 1 as sought in the minutes of order handed up in court.

I direct the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the action to date.

I stand over generally the summons with liberty to restore on 48 hours notice of the restoration and of what orders would be sought in such restoration to the defendant.
