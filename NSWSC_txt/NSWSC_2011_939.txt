EX TEMPORE Judgment  
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff is the Owners Corporation of a strata plan comprising a residential strata development at Hornsby, New South Wales ("the building"). The defendant is the builder which constructed the building. 
The building was constructed between March 2001 and the end of December 2001. [Section 18B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s18b.html) of the [Home Building Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/)") implies warranties, as to the quality of the work, in favour of the plaintiff into the contract under which the defendant constructed the building. [Section 18E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s18e.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) provides, relevantly, that proceedings for breach of a statutory warranty must be commenced within seven years after completion of the work to which it relates. [Part 3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/index.html#p3a) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) confers upon the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal ("the Tribunal") jurisdiction to deal with claims for breach of statutory warranty up to $500,000. [Section 23(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s23.html) of [Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/) ("the [CTTT Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/)") provides as follows: 
If the parties in any Tribunal proceedings so agree, or if the Tribunal of its own motion or on the application of a party so directs, the proceedings are:  to be transferred to a court (in accordance with the rules of that court) that has jurisdiction in the matter, and  to continue before that court as if they had been instituted there.  [Section 24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s24.html) of the [CTTT Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/) provides that a person may, in accordance with the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) under which the application is made, apply to the Tribunal to have a matter dealt with by the Tribunal. [Section 24(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s24.html) of the [CTTT Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/) provides that 
Despite the provisions of any other [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/), an application to have a matter dealt with by the Tribunal must be made:  in writing (or in such other form as may be prescribed by the regulations), and  in accordance with the regulations.  [Section 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s32.html) of the [CTTT Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/) provides that: 
The Tribunal may, in any proceedings, make any amendments to any document (for example, an application) filed in connection with the proceedings that the Tribunal considers to be necessary in the interests of justice.  
Any such amendment may be made:  at any stage of the proceedings, and  on such terms as the Tribunal thinks fit,  but may only be made after notifying the party to whom the amendment relates.  
If a provision of this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) or the regulations is not complied with in relation to the commencement or conduct of proceedings, the failure to comply is to be treated as an irregularity and does not nullify the proceedings or any decision in the proceedings unless the
Tribunal otherwise determines.  
The Tribunal may, however, in dealing with any such irregularity, wholly or partly set aside the proceedings or a decision in the proceedings.  [Regulation 11(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ctattr2009452/s11.html) of the [Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Regulation 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ctattr2009452/) ("the [Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ctattr2009452/)") provides as follows: 
For the purposes of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s24.html) (2) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/), an application made to the Tribunal must contain the following particulars:  the name and address of the applicant,  the name and last known address of each other party,  a description of the order or orders sought by the applicant,  a concise statement containing particulars sufficient to enable each other party to know the nature of the claim or dispute,  if an amount of money is claimed or in dispute, the amount claimed or disputed,  if the application relates to a claim or dispute arising from the occupation of any premises - the address of those premises,  if the applicant is a corporation - the applicant's ACN.  [Section 14(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) ("the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/)") provides the following: 
An action on any of the following causes of action is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of six years running from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff or to a person through whom the plaintiff claims:  ...  a cause of action founded on tort, including a cause of action for damages for breach of statutory duty, ... 
On 27 November 2008, the plaintiff lodged with the Tribunal a Home Building Division Application by which it applied to have a matter dealt with by the Tribunal. 
The application is a printed standard form ("the form") with provision for the insertion of information. 
Paragraph 14 of the form is as follows: 
What is your dispute about?  
This form will be sent to the other party. Therefore you must provide details so that the other party can understand the problem. For example, you could list the defect, its location and an estimate of the cost to repair eg leaks/roof/$5,000. Additional information may be attached to this application eg copy of rectification order. 
The plaintiff inserted the following response: 
This is a claim for defective works in the construction of the premises for breaches of the statutory warranties under the [Home Building
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) and
Negligence. 
Paragraph 15 of the form requires the applicant to specify what orders it wants and states that " You must include a dollar amount for the order(s) you want " . It identifies a number of different types of orders with boxes to be ticked as well as a box where "Other" may be ticked, with space for that other to be specified. One of the options is "An order to pay me the amount of $". The plaintiff ticked this box and inserted the words "To be advised". 
There is provision in the form for the insertion of a figure representing "Total value of claim". The plaintiff inserted the words "In excess of $50,000 but less than $500,000". 
Beneath para 15 the following words appear: "The limit of jurisdiction of the Tribunal in this Division is $500,000 (If your claim is for more you may wish to seek legal advice)". 
On 21 January 2009, the matter was first listed in the Tribunal for directions. There were a number of subsequent directions hearings and a site meeting. It became clear that the amount claimed by the plaintiff would exceed the jurisdictional limit of the Tribunal and on 26 October 2009, the proceedings were, under [s 23(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s23.html) of the [CTTT Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/), transferred to this Court. 
A Summons and Technology and Construction List Statement were filed on 29 January 2010. The Technology and Construction List Statement pleads breach of the warranties implied by [s 18B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s18b.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) and also pleads that the defendant owed to the plaintiff a duty of care, which it breached, not to carry out the work negligently. 
In March 2010, the plaintiff provided a "Scott Schedule of alleged Defective Construction". [Section 1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s1.html) of the Scott Schedule is entitled "Exterior Elevations". It comprises some 29 separate claims, one of which (para 1.0.1) is for "cracked render/waterproofing finishes" in respect of "whole of building generally". The description goes on to state, "Cracked skim-coating to Hebel panel (AAC) external wall skin allows water penetration into the external skin" and describes the cause of the defect as "Failure to construct in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations/instructions". 
Under a sub-heading "Particulars Sought" the following appears: . When was defect first identified by Plaintiff  cracks identified in Gleeson Report of early 2003.

A multitude of individual cracks are identified in the Belmont Report of
January 2007.
 . When was defect first notified to Defendant 
Gleeson Report notified to LOR/BM on 27/02/2003.

I am not aware of the Belmont Report being published to LOR/BM  ("LOR/BM" is a reference to the defendant) 
Under a heading "Estimated rectification cost" the Scott Schedule provides as follows: 
Allow rate of $65 per m 2 for membrane; $75 per m 2 new joint construction; $35 per m 2 for scaffold: 
Less 33% on membrane & scaffold; mitigation for maintenance: less $35 per m 2  m 2 @ $140 = $665,000 e/o 22.5% o/heads, profit $149,625 
Subtotal $814,625 
GST; 10% $ 81,462 
Total $896,087  
By Notice of Motion filed on 29 July 2011, the defendant moves for summary dismissal of the entirety of the plaintiff's claim for breach of statutory warranty and for dismissal of that part of the claim described above in the Scott Schedule on the basis that they are statute barred, in the case of the statutory warranty claims, by virtue of [s 18E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s18e.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/), and in the case of the negligence claim, by virtue of <case> of the Limitations [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/). 
As to the statutory warranty claims, the defendant puts that athe work to which the plaintiff's claim relates was completed by 31 December ;
 bunder [s
E(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/s18e.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hba1989128/) the plaintiff had to commence its proceedings by 31 December 2008; cthe application with the CTTT on 27 November 2008 was a nullity because it did not comply with paras 11(1)(d) and (e) of the Regulations respectively because the description of the claim provided fell short of being a concise statement containing particulars sufficient to enable the defendant to know the nature of the claim or dispute and the information did not sufficiently state the amount claimed or disputed; and dthese proceedings were thus not commenced before the cut-off date and are barred.
As to the claim in negligence, the defendant puts that: athe plaintiff's cause of action became statute barred under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) six years after the defects complained of became manifest; bthe defects in the Scott Schedule described above became manifest no later than "27/02/2003" when they were identified in the "Gleeson Report"; cthe six year period accordingly expired no later than 27 February 2009; das with the statutory warranty claims, the lodging with the Tribunal of the application on 27 November 2008 was ineffective to commence proceedings; and ethese proceedings were thus not commenced before the cut-off date and are barred.
The defendant drew the Court's attention to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Cyril Smith & Associates Pty Ltd versus Owners-Strata Plan No 64970  <case> and in particular to para 15 in which Basten JA (delivering the judgment of the Court) said: 
If the superficial cracking should put the owner on notice of inquiry as to its cause and if reasonable inquiry would have revealed the cause, the underlying defect has become manifest, even though it did not in fact become known to the owner at that time.
At the outset, it is appropriate to observe that generally speaking, limitation issues should not be determined in an application such as the present one in advance of the trial, particularly where insufficient is known of the damage sustained by the plaintiff and of the circumstances in which it was sustained to justify a confident answer: Wardley Australia Ltd versus The State of Western Australia <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 514] at 533. 
It is also apt to refer to para 62 of Practice Note SC Eq 3 which provides that as a general rule, applications to strike out or for summary judgment will not be entertained in this list, and that while sometimes applications are appropriate, strictness should be expected in declining to entertain them. 
The defendant's attack on both categories of claims fails at the first hurdle because the form contains sufficient particulars to enable the defendant to know the nature of each. As to quantum, the claim is one for unliquidated damages and precision is neither required nor feasible. Sufficient information as to quantum is provided including that the amount claimed is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. 
But even if this were not the case, [s 32(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s32.html) of the [CTTT Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/) makes it clear that the proceedings are not nullified by a failure to comply with the regulations, unless the Tribunal has otherwise determined, which it has not. 
There are added difficulties for the defendant in respect to the claim in negligence. 
I am by no means satisfied that the material in evidence justifies, particularly at this stage, a conclusion, let alone a confident answer, that the underlying defects the subject of the claim had become manifest more than six years before 27 November 2008 or, indeed, before the Belmont Report of January 2007. Neither that Report nor the Gleeson Report were admitted into evidence in the application. 
It is far from clear on the material now before the Court that reasonable enquiry by the plaintiff, in the knowledge of the two cracks manifest by 27 February 2003, would have revealed the cause of the underlying defect which resulted in the multitude of individual cracks identified in the Belmont Report. 
Additionally, the present application proceeded on the footing that the amount claimed in the Scott Schedule related only to the defects described in para 1.0.1. A reading of the Scott Schedule makes it clear that this is not the case. The figure of $896,087 spans various defects in respect of which no challenge is made. 
It follows that the application must be dismissed with costs. * * *
