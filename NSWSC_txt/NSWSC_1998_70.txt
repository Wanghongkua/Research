SHEARER & ANOR versus THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE` ` 108454/95` `23 March 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Probate Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings to revoke probate the plaintiffs have indicated they no longer wish to proceed. The suit, accordingly, must be dismissed. 
The principal reason adduced by the plaintiffs as to why they do not wish to proceed is that the matters have been subsumed in the proceedings they brought under the Family Provisions Act in the Equity Division, which is 2547/95.

Miss Needham for the plaintiffs says that no order for costs should be made because the material that has been filed in these proceedings has to a great extent been used in the other proceedings.

If that is so then, when dealing with the other proceedings, the appropriate adjustment can be made, but it seems to me in these present proceedings the normal order should flow, that is the proceedings should be dismissed with costs.
