JUDGMENT
On 10 July 2014 I made restraining orders in relation to the property of the defendant arising out of the suspicion of an authorised officer of the plaintiff that the defendant had engaged in a serious crime related activity, being the supply of drugs. One of the items of property was a unit, Unit 3, 11 15 Renwick Street, Leichhardt.
Information has now come to light in relation to the sale of that unit and the purchase price paid for it, particularly in the light of the amount of the vendor's mortgage and the fact that the contract was privately negotiated without the intervention of an agent. There is evidence to suggest that both the vendor and the vendor's brother, who was said to have organised the sale, have information concerning the defendant's property.
The application is made for the examination of the vendor's brother pursuant to [Section 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) (1)(b)(ii) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . I am satisfied on the evidence that it is appropriate to order that the respondent be so examined.
Accordingly I make Order 1 in the draft order provided to me. I grant leave in paragraph 2 and liberty in paragraph 3.
