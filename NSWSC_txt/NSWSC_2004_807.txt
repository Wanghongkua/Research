CAMPBELL J  
TUESDAY 31 AUGUST  /04 RE NSW TENNIS ASSOCIATION LIMITED (No. 2)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: I gave judgment in this matter on 15 March 2004: Re NSW
Tennis Association Limited  <case>; [(2004) 49 ACSR 83.] In that judgment, I decided that a charge given on 1 August by the New South Wales Lawn Tennis Association Limited ("the Company") secured no debt which was enforceable against the Company as at 15 March 2004.
The evidence before me included the results of an ASIC search of the Company, including the portion of the Register of Company Charges applicable to it. In that extract, it appeared as though the word "type" was a heading, which had a blank alongside it, in the same row as the word "type" appeared. To give effect to the decision, I ordered that the entry in the Register of Charges be amended by:  "alongside the heading "Type" in the Register the following words be inserted:  "charge securing no debt enforceable against the company as at 15 March .""  It has now emerged that an order in that form is incapable of being registered. That is because the word "type" is not intended to be an independent heading, but rather is part of a composite heading, namely "form type". As well, that composite heading was intended to relate a column, not a row. Further, it appears that, since the time of the search which was before me in evidence on 15 March 2004, the column heading has been altered, so that it now reads "SEL type".  It appears that the intent of my original order can be adequately achieved by the following orders, which I make: 
Order made 15 March 2004 is revoked. 
Concerning charge number 217361 entered in the Australian Register of
Company Charges given by New South Wales Tennis Association Ltd to Estate of
Late Sir Daniel Cooper, chargee,  order that the following words be entered as a partial release of the charge:  "the charge does not secure any debt enforceable against the Company as at 15
March 2004."
