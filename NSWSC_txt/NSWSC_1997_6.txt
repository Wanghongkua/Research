Regina versus D R Tillott [1997] NSWSC 6 (21 January 1997) 
REGINA v. Daniel Robert TILLOTT /96 
Monday, 18 November 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
SHELLER JA, SMART J, DUNFORD J 
JUDGMENT 
SHELLER JA: The court is in a position to deal with this matter now and
I will ask Smart J to give the first judgment.

SMART J: Daniel Robert Tillott seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence comprising a minimum term of 18 months and an additional term of six months on a charge of attempting to escape from lawful custody. His complaints include that the judge failed to consider the question of special circumstances necessitating a longer than usual additional term; that such circumstances existed; and that the sentence should have reflected them.

Mr Tillott's particular complaint is of undue disparity between the sentence which he received and the sentence received by his two co-offenders, Jamal and
Taylor.

On the view which I take it is unnecessary to deal with the disparity argument or the argument as to special circumstances, except in a limited way.

The circumstances out of which the charges arose are narrated in the judgment of 
Abadee J which is reported in Regina v. Tillott & Ors [(1995-1996) 38
NSWLR 1] at 4 and following. They are also set out in the judgment of
Job DCJ and the earlier judgement of Mathews J of 17 December, 1993.

The applicant has been in custody continually since 19 September, 1990. The various earlier offences which are unrelated to the charge the subject of this appeal resulted in incarceration expiring on or about 21 or 22 July, 1995. The original sentence imposed by Job DCJ dated from 22 July, 1995 and is due to expire on 21 January, 1997.  
The applicant will have spent a continuous period in custody from 19
September, 1990 and received an additional term of but six months. It is important to consider on a global basis the length of time spent in custody, and the length of the additional term.

In the circumstances, the appropriate allowance to have been made in this case, particularly at this stage, is a minimum term which expires on 21
November, 1996, and an additional term of eight months.

Accordingly, I would propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted; that the appeal be allowed; and that in lieu of the sentence imposed by Job
DCJ there be a minimum term of 16 months to date from 22 July, 1995 expiring on 21 November, 1996, and an additional term of eight months commencing on 22
November, 1996.

SHELLER JA: I agree.

DUNFORD J: I also agree.

SHELLER JA: The orders proposed by Smart J will be the orders of the court.
