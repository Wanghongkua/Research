ORDER 
HIS HONOUR: I am satisfied that this matter falls within the [De Facto Relationships Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/dfra220/) of 1984. 
With regard to the terms of the settlement both as to the action and the cross-claim: by consent there will be a declaration in accordance with term 1.

I make an order in accordance with term 2.

There will be a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff as against the first defendant in the sum of $16,500. The said sum of $16,500 is to be paid within days to the plaintiff.

There will be no order as to costs as between the plaintiff and the first defendant.

I make a declaration in accordance with term 6.

I make the orders as against the first defendant and the plaintiff in accordance with term 7. Pending the transfer, referred to in term 7 I direct that the first defendant shall have exclusive occupancy of the Bronte unit being 10/20 Pacific Street, Bronte. Further, that the first defendant shall pay all rates, taxes, outgoings thereon as they fall due and the first defendant shall keep the unit in good repair (fair wear and tear, excepted.) 
I make the declaration in term 9.

I make the declaration in term 10.

I make the declaration in term 11.

I make the declaration in term 12.

I make the declaration in term 13.

I make the declaration in term 14.

As to the notations: 
I note notation 1.

I note notation 2.

I note the respective undertakings by the plaintiff and the first defendant in notation 3.

I note notation 4.

The terms of settlement consisting of five pages will be initialled by me and placed with the papers.

The parties will provide typed terms of these orders to give effect to the terms of settlement.

As to the action and cross-claim the terms of settlement will be initialled by me and dated.

After copies have been provided to the parties they will be placed in the file.

I congratulate the parties and their respective legal representatives for reaching agreement in this matter, which I note has not been simple.

The law looks with great favour upon settlements because they carry with them finality and finality in legal proceedings is a most precious thing. Time and time again one sees in one's life in the law persons financially ruined by litigation. Therefore, with the commonsense of the parties and the good advice of their respective lawyers what is prima facie a very satisfactory settlement, fair to both parties, has been achieved and I, on behalf of the
Court, congratulate the parties and their respective legal advisers.

The action as against the second defendant will be adjourned until Monday 13
July 1998.
