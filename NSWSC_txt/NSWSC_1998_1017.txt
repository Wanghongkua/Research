Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: These reasons deal with questions of costs arising from the dismissal of three applications made under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/). I gave reasons for judgment in both of these matters at the end of a three day hearing on 23 March 1998. The two sets of proceedings comprehended three applications under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/), the older set of proceedings comprehending applications made by Mrs Shearer and Mrs Barnes, the later proceedings being an application by Mr Hawke. All three proceedings were dismissed. 
As I noted at the end of my previous set of reasons, complex questions of costs arose and these were considered both in written submissions and also in a short oral hearing on Friday 27 March 1998.

The court is given a wide discretion as to the award of costs, though this discretion flows from <case> of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). That discretion, however, must be exercised judicially and there is a bank of case law which lays down guidelines as to how it should be approached. Two of the strictest guidelines are (a) what is termed "the ordinary rule", that is, that the successful party gets his or her costs, and an unsuccessful party pays them; and (b) that a successful party is never, or perhaps it is better put, hardly ever, ordered to pay the costs of an unsuccessful party. Superadded to these guidelines are principles that flow from the system in the Rules implementing the policy that people must consider reasonable offers of compromise and that if they do not, then costs consequences will follow. Apart from the learning concerning offers of compromise strictly so called, there is a subsidiary branch dealing with what are known as Calderbank letters because of the exposition of the effect of such documents in Calderbank versus Calderbank [[1976] Fam 93.] 
The first question to consider is whether there are some particular guidelines that should be applied to applications under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/).

In proceedings under the Testator's Family Maintenance & [Guardianship of
Infants Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/goia1916231/), it was not uncommon for costs of unsuccessful applications to be awarded out of the estate; see eg Re Duncan <case>; [[1939] VLR 355.] There are very few reported cases on the matter. The leading textbook on the Act, Davern Wright Testator's Family Maintenance in
Australia and New Zealand 3rd ed (Law Book Company 1974) at p 176, lays down the general principle that as a general rule an applicant receives his or her costs out of the estate usually on a party and party basis, and an unsuccessful applicant is ordered to pay costs between party and party, "but in what might be termed borderline cases the court has relieved unsuccessful applicants from having to pay costs." 
In Queensland, there were two cases before Hoare, J in 1972, namely Re
Bodman [[1972] Qd R 281] and Re Klease [[1972] QWN 44], in which his
Honour, without really giving reasons, directed that the costs of an unsuccessful applicant be paid out of the estate. However, these cases appear to be the basis for Professor Dickey saying in his book Family Provision
After Death (LBC 1992), a book on the current legislation, at p 184, that an applicant might obtain costs even if she had been unsuccessful on the merits and reasonableness of her case. It appears that this passage and a passage of an English book led Gaudron, J in Singer versus Berghouse <case>; [(1993) 114 ALR 521] at 522 to say, in relation to the present Act, "Family
Provision cases stand apart from cases in which costs follow the event.
Leaving aside cases under the Act which, in <case>, makes special provision in that regard, costs in Family Provision cases generally depend on the overall justice of the case. It is not uncommon, in the case of unsuccessful applications, for no order to be made as to costs, particularly if it would have a detrimental effect on the applicant's financial position. And there may even be circumstances in which it is appropriate for an unsuccessful party to have his or her costs paid out of the estate." 
I must now turn to <case> of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) and consider both what it says and what, by inference, it must be taken to have dealt with by silence.

Section 33 provides as follows:- "33. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), the 
Court may order that the costs, charges and expenses of or incidental to proceedings under this Act in relation to the estate or notional estate of a deceased person be paid out of the estate or notional estate, or both, in such manner as the Court thinks fit.

The Court shall not order that the whole or any part of the costs, charges or expenses of or incidental to proceedings in respect of an application in relation to a deceased person made by an eligible person who is such a person by reason only of paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of `eligible person' in [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/s6.html) be paid out of the estate or notional estate of the deceased person unless: the Court has made an order for provision in favour of the eligible person on the application; or there are special circumstances which make it just and equitable for the Court to do so.

The Court shall not order that the whole or any part of the costs, charges and expenses of or incidental to proceedings in respect of an application in relation to a deceased person made by an eligible person be paid out of the estate or notional estate of the deceased person by reason only of the fact that the eligible person is a person described in paragraph (a) or (b) of the definition of `eligible person' in [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/s6.html) or the fact that the Court has made an order for provision in favour of the eligible person on the application." 
Section 33 has been only considered on three occasions as far as I am aware.
The most authoritative of these is the judgment of Sheller, JA in King v
Foster - 7 December 1995, unreported. His Honour there said, "It seems to me that subsection (2) recognizes that in the case of other eligible persons (ie persons other than those within paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of eligible person) whose applications are unsuccessful, the Court retains a discretion to make an order that the applicant's costs be paid out of the estate without the need for there to be special circumstances." 
In Stewart versus McDougall - 19 November 1987, unreported, I said that s 33 was a rather peculiar provision. I probably should have directed more attention to the contrast between <case> and <case> than I did, but I considered that subsection (3) gave the impression that there must be something more rather than merely being an eligible person or merely winning in the case before there should be an order for costs and it was hard to see how the previously existing practice of an unsuccessful applicant getting costs could continue. I also dealt with the matter in Bearns versus Bearns-Hayes - 7 May 1997, unreported.

I believe this is the first case in which I have been referred to all the authorities, and in particular the approach in King versus Foster which focuses on <case> of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) and contrasts it with subsection (3) so that the section permits the court to make a costs order in an unsuccessful application even though there are not special circumstances which make it just and equitable for the court so to do. This then brings back the situation under the former law that borderline cases, especially those made by applicants with little funds, can be dismissed yet the applicants' costs be paid out of the estate.

I then need to consider the Calderbank letters. Because I am told this matter may go to the Court of Appeal I will not embarrass the Court of Appeal by referring to figures.

I have no material before me to show that any attempt was made to compromise
Mrs Shearer's case. However, on 16 June 1997 the defendant wrote a letter without prejudice, except as to costs, offering to settle the proceedings brought by Mrs Barnes for $x plus her costs of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) proceedings on the basis that the probate proceedings were dismissed with no orders as to the plaintiff's costs. It is certainly true that this offer was not accepted, but the evidence also shows that in due course a deed was drawn up between the plaintiff Mrs Barnes and the Public Trustee whereby Mrs Barnes was to be paid $2x from the estate and she was to release the Trustee from all of her rights to make an application or further application under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/). In other words, the plaintiff was to receive $2x and withdraw her application.

The proceedings as I have said in my earlier judgment, came on before
Einstein, J on 1 September 1997. His Honour declined to proceed with the applications because Mr Hawke had not been notified.

At the end of the hearing before me, Mr Blackburn-Hart for the estate, said that he waived the condition that there be a release. He said that as this release was solely for the benefit of the Public Trustee, he was able to do this; see Toga Development No 10 Pty Ltd versus Gibson (1973) 2 BPR 9260. There is, however, no suggestion at all that there was any waiver by the Public
Trustee of the condition until after I had delivered my reasons for judgment.

It is rather hard to know just why the parties stipulated for a settlement in this form. The settlement being for a sum of money if the proceedings were dismissed meant that it may have been open for the plaintiff to have commenced new proceedings though she would have been out of time and there would probably have been a fairly substantial defence to any application to extend time. Had the application been for a consent order, then there would have been no need for a release, except perhaps a release in the remote event that Mrs
Barnes might make an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/s8.html) of the Act and nowadays, where all the persons interested in the estate are sui juris and consent, judges usually make orders almost as of course.

However, the fact is that an offer was made by a Calderbank letter, there were then negotiations, the parties arrived at a figure, but the settlement fell through.

As Hill, J said in Johns S Hayes & Associates Pty Ltd versus Kimberly-Clark
Australia Pty Ltd [(1994) 52 FCR 201], 206, "There is no authority supporting the proposition that the mere writing of a
Calderbank letter would justify an order for costs in favour of a successful party being taxed on ... an indemnity basis." See also Mgica (1992) Pty Ltd v Kenny & Good Pty Ltd (No 2) [(1996) 70 FCR 236.] 
A slightly heavier weighting is given to Calderbank letters in the Commercial
Division of this Court, but even in that Division it is clear that the ultimate decision would depend on a consideration of the particular facts and circumstances in each case (per Rolfe, J in Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v
Federal Airports Corporation (1996) 138 ALR 425, 441). It seems to me that whichever way one approaches the matter in the circumstances that I have detailed the fact of the Calderbank letter last June is of minimal concern when considering what is the appropriate order for costs.

In the case of Mr Hawke, a Calderbank letter was written by the defendant on March 1998, the proceedings being listed to commence before me on 19 March.
The offer was for $z, being split into $a by way of a legacy, and $b for costs. Again, a release was required.

There was no waiver of the requirement for a release until after I had given judgment. Although the release was for the benefit of the Public Trustee and could be waived, it in fact was not waived before the hearing. It would appear that by 17 March the brief on hearing had been delivered and the majority of the costs had already been incurred. In my view, the late giving of the
Calderbank letter, subject to a condition which was not fulfilled and because the major part of the costs had already been incurred, it does not seem to me that the Calderbank letter should alter the decision as to costs.

I then go back to the initial question as to what is the proper order for costs? 
It was at least impliedly suggested to me during the argument on costs, that as the plaintiff Mrs Barnes and the defendant had agreed on an arm's length basis for settlement at a substantial figure, that I was the odd man out and that my decision was probably wrong. Of course, this was put in very respectful terms. It should be pointed out that there is a very great difference between persons advising clients as to what is a proper settlement before a case is heard, to the situation that applies after a case is heard.
For settlement negotiations, counsel and solicitors assess the possibility or probability of the plaintiff succeeding on the question of liability and use that assessment to discount what the plaintiff would get if she were successful. However, in a decision made by a court, there is a black and white question as to liability and there is no discounting of the amount that would be given to a plaintiff who establishes liability merely because she just gets over the liability barrier on the balance of probabilities.

Again, counsel who are assessing the case for settlement purposes do not know how their client is going to perform in the witness box, whether there are some skeletons in her closet that cross examining counsel will expose, and generally whether she will be accepted. When a judge is making a decision, he or she has to make an assessment of these factors and decide one way or the other, whereas counsel advising on settlement puts a discount figure on the money sum involved.

In the instant case, had it been accepted that Mrs Barnes and Mrs Shearer had been excused all contact with their mother because of the mother's request, and they were dutiful daughters up until that time, then a different result may have followed. However, I did not accept that evidence. Thus, in lieu of the case appearing to be one of devoted daughters who were in needy circumstances of which the deceased ought to have been aware and have made provision, instead the case appeared to be one where there had been no contact between the daughters and the deceased for some time. Furthermore, there was validity in the suggestion the daughters had soured the relations between the testatrix and her husband, the daughters had been living independent lives from the testatrix for some time, and were not dependent on her. Rather they had already been living beyond their means and gone through capital which had passed to them from other sources, they had not contributed to their mother's estate at all, and their mother had made a deliberate decision in 1992 to exclude them from benefit. Looking at the case this way, they must fail.

It seems to me that the two daughters do get to what I described in argument "as 45% of the way" to making out a case for relief under the Act, so there is justification in ordering that their costs be paid out of the estate. It could be said, as I think Mr Blackburn-Hart did say at some stage, that their needs were brought about by their extravagant living. However, as was said in another context, "'Hardship' has no connotation of undeserved suffering, the misery we suffer because of our own mistakes is not less misery." Jeffery v
Burmeister <case>; [[1946] VLR 363], 369.

In all the circumstances I consider that the female plaintiffs should have their costs out of the estate.

It should be made clear, however, that many of the affidavits which were prepared and read in these proceedings were prepared for the associated
Probate proceedings. In the Probate proceedings I have already made an order that the plaintiffs pay the Public Trustee's costs. Where an affidavit prepared for the Probate proceedings was read in these proceedings, the parts which were not read or which were attempted to be read and which were excluded, should not form part of the plaintiffs' costs. In other words, if, for instance, the whole of pp 57 and 58 of an affidavit were rejected, then in assessing the costs of the affidavit, no amount should be allowed for preparing or copying those two pages. The plaintiffs' costs are to be on what used to be called "the party and party basis".

The costs of Mr Hawke are in a different category. He did not even get to my notional 45% barrier. However, his application was to a great degree spurred on by the unfortunate problem of his not being notified of the deals that had already been done between the Public Trustee and at least one of his sisters.
There is obviously no love lost between the members of the family and he was virtually forced into the situation of entering the arena. He should have his costs of the application before Mr Justice Windeyer to extend the time, but otherwise there should be no order for Mr Hawke's costs.

Accordingly, I order that the costs and expenses of the Public Trustee of and incidental to both proceedings be paid out of the estate of the late Margaret
Ellen Smith. I order that the costs of the plaintiffs in proceedings 2547 of be paid out of the same estate. It is to be noted that such order for costs is on the party and party basis and is not to include costs of material which was rejected in proceedings 2547 of 1995. In proceedings 4168 of 1997 the defendant's costs of and incidental to the proceedings are to come out of the estate of Margaret Ellen Smith. The plaintiff's costs of the motion for extension of time on the party and party basis is to come out of the same estate, but otherwise there is to be no order for the plaintiff's costs.
