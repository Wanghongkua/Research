JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: The applicant seeks leave to proceed with the proceedings bought in the Local Court against the respondent which is a company in liquidation.  The members of the company resolved on 20 May 2009 that the company be wound up voluntarily.
 The proceedings brought by the applicant against the company in the Local
Court are stayed pursuant to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s500.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth).
 The applicant seeks leave pursuant to that provision to proceed against the company in that court.
 The general principle is that upon a company going into liquidation claims against it should be dealt with by the liquidator through the process of submission and adjudication on proofs of debt. Such administrative proceedings are at least generally more expeditious and cheaper than proceeding with litigation.
 I am told that the applicant has lodged a proof of debt with the liquidator but that proof has not yet been ruled on. I do not understand that steps have been taken by the applicant to require the liquidator to deal with the proof of debt. The liquidator says at the moment he is without funds.
 Nothing has been put which warrants departure from the usual position that claims against the company in liquidation should be dealt with by the liquidator, and any dispute in relation to the liquidator's adjudication on the claim being dealt with by way of an appeal against his refusal, indeed allowance, of the proof of debt.
 For these reasons I order that the interlocutory process filed on 30 July be dismissed.
 The liquidator has not appeared at the hearing. He said he had no objection to the application being heard, but said he would not be represented. It does not appear to me that the liquidator would have incurred any costs in respect of the application. He did not appear to ask for such costs.
 I make no order for costs on the application.
