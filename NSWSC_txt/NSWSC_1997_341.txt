REGINA versus BRENDAN KELLY SMITH 
The respondent to this Crown appeal was sentenced after pleading guilty to a single count of dangerous driving causing death. The District Court judge imposed a total term of eight months imprisonment which he divided into minimum term of six months and additional term of two months. The proceedings were then adjourned for assessment of the respondent's suitability under the [Home Detention Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/).
Pursuant to that Act the sentence was stayed and the respondent granted bail.
After favourable assessment the respondent was returned before the Court and an order made that the sentence be served by way of home detention. The Act authorizes service of the minimum term element of a sentence so structured to be served in that way.

HELD (By the Court) In all the circumstances the total term of eight months was erroneous and it should be increased to sixteen months divided into minimum and additional terms of 12 and 4 months. That the minimum term be served by way of home detention. 
By Grove J (Studdert J agreeing) - The express object of the [Home Detention Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) that it provide a means of serving a sentence of full time imprisonment and the structure of that Act requiring final assessment of the term to be imposed before any decision that service be by way of home detention has the consequence that assessment of the adequacy or inadequacy of the term should not take into account the subsequent collateral order. 
By Smart J (dissenting) - That service of a sentence in home detention should be regarded as less onerous than service of a sentence in gaol. That amelioration should be taken into account in assessing the severity or adequacy of a sentence. 
REGINA versus BRENDAN KELLY SMITH 
JUDGMENT 
SMART J: Grove J will give the first judgment. 
GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal alleging the manifest inadequacy of sentence passed by Job DCJ in Newcastle District Court. The respondent was charged with a single count of dangerous driving causing death contrary to <case> of the Crimes Act. The offence occurred on 24 March 1996. On 7 February 1997 he appeared before a magistrate and pleaded guilty to that charge. On 10 April 1997 he adhered to that plea and consequently was convicted by Job DCJ. He was remanded in custody overnight and on the following day his Honour sentenced the respondent to a total term of eight months imprisonment divided into a minimum term of six months and an additional term of two months. Thereupon the respondent was referred for assessment pursuant to the [Home Detention Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/); pursuant to [s 9(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s9.html) of that Act the execution of sentence was stayed and his Honour exercised power under [s 9(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s9.html) to grant bail to the respondent, a term of which was that he reappear for "the final sentence" on 2 May 1997. On that date his Honour received a report assessing the respondent as suitable for home detention. He stated: "Consequently, the sentence of six months minimum term, with additional term of two months which I imposed on 11 April will commence from today, and that sentence may be served by way of home detention." 
Pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s11.html) of the [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) power was vested to direct that the minimum term component of such a sentence (as distinct from the total of a fixed term) be served in home detention. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s24.html) of the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) required the making of a parole order in respect of the additional term. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s8.html) of the same statute required specification of the eligibility date for release on parole. These are procedural matters essentially but they should be not overlooked.

The facts can be extracted from the remarks on sentence by Job DCJ on 11 April
The respondent was a pastry cook who was just short of his nineteenth birthday on the date of offence. He ceased work at about 1 am and drove his mother's vehicle to a beach where he met a friend named Sean Hope. The latter asked for a lift and the respondent said that he suggested having "a bong".
They went to a friend's house and consumed some marijuana. His Honour said it was not clear just exactly how much was consumed but at most it was the smoking of two cones. The respondent gave sworn evidence that he consumed only one. No express finding about drug intake was made however at about 2.05 am both young men were again in the vehicle when it went out of control and after what his Honour described as an extraordinarily severe impact, collided with a tree. Sean Hope died as a result of injuries received. The respondent estimated his relevant vehicle speed as 90 kms per hour. Blood sampling from the respondent detected traces consistent with the use of cannabis and a medical expert gave evidence that the readings offered the conclusion that the respondent's driving ability would have been impaired. Job DCJ noted that the evidence was not that that ability was substantially impaired.

The respondent had no prior convictions.

As a preface to more detailed submissions counsel for the Crown put to this
Court that a sentence comprising a minimum term of six months with an additional term of two months would have been manifestly inadequate had it been served full time. To this was added the contention that the result of his
Honour's direction that it be served in home detention was to structure a sentence which was not commensurate at all with the criminality involved.

It is convenient to deal with the Crown submissions in two stages. The first is to consider whether the sentence, absent the order for service under the [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/), was manifestly inadequate. In this regard the Crown relied upon five propositions: 
That the sentence did not give sufficient weight to the seriousness of the criminality involved; 
That the sentence failed to give sufficient weight to punishment and deterrence; 
That the sentence failed to have proper regard to the ten year maximum penalty recently fixed by Parliament; 
That excessive weight was given to subjective matters; and 
That the unduly lenient sentence was indicative of error or departure from principle.

There can be no doubt that dangerous driving involving excessive speed and against the background of the consumption of a driving ability inhibiting drug which results in the loss of life must be regarded as extremely serious. The applicable speed limit on the road where the offence was committed was 60 kms per hour.

It has been recognized in this Court that the usual rule that considerations of general deterrence are not as important when sentencing young offenders as when sentencing older offenders does not apply to dangerous driving. There is a prevalence of this offence amongst young drivers who may not have developed the skills to control motor vehicles when driven dangerously and it is the duty of the courts to seek to deter the behaviour proscribed by the statute:
Regina versus MacIntyre [1988 38 A Crim R 135]; Regina v Slattery CCA unreported 19 December 1996.

It is a matter of legislative history that the restructure of <case> involved an increase in the available maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death from five years imprisonment to ten years imprisonment. It is incumbent upon courts to give effect to concerns manifested by Parliament: R v
Hartikainen CCA unreported 8 June 1993. It is clear that Parliament intended that the offence of dangerous driving causing death be perceived as a crime of greater magnitude than might have been assessed by advertence to and reflection upon the superseded maximum penalty.

The respondent was able to draw upon a considerable number of favourable subjective factors in addition to his unblemished prior record. It has been observed that it is always a difficult thing to send a young person with good character to prison but, where appropriate, it is something which must be done as a deterrent to others: Slattery @ p 11 per Hunt CJ at CL. Of course, it cannot be overlooked that Job DCJ did in fact impose a sentence of imprisonment.

The submission by the Crown in support of the fifth proposition in essence related to the home detention order and I will turn to it as the second stage.

In my view the substantive submission on behalf of the Crown that the sentence was manifestly inadequate has been made out. In particular I am of the view that a total sentence of eight months imprisonment for an offence which involved the voluntary ingestion of drugs, consequent impairment of driving ability, driving at a speed exceeding the applicable limit by a margin of 50 percent thereby causing death is an imposition so low that it demonstrates miscarriage of sentencing discretion.

Allowing for the double jeopardy involved in Crown appeals and the oft-stated principles which should guide this Court when increasing sentence I would substitute as an appropriate imposition a total of sixteen months imprisonment. I have given consideration to the issue of special circumstances within the meaning of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) but my conclusion is that that total sentence would in all the circumstances be appropriately divided into a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of four months. I am conscious that this result is identical to application of the formula mentioned in the statute.

I turn secondly to submissions advanced in connection with the [Home Detention
Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/). We were informed that this is the first occasion upon which a sentence directed to be served pursuant to that Act has come before the Court. The essence of the Crown submission was that the order for home detention introduced a significant degree of leniency into any sentence imposed and that accordingly that leniency should be taken into account in assessing the adequacy of such sentence. By way of analogy observations by this Court that periodic detention has such an element built into it was the subject of reference: R v
Hallocoglu [1992 29 NSWLR 67] and the cases referred to therein.

The Crown contended that, although the [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) was recent legislation and there was no authority directly in point, it was a matter of commonsense and logic that in parallel with the reasoning exemplified in Hallocoglu, home detention should be assessed as more lenient than full time incarceration.

In my opinion the Crown submission cannot be sustained in the light of expressions within the statute and its structure.

The Act itself proclaims its objects (in <case>) and negates what might be presumed to be other objects (s 4(2)) in these terms: (1) The objects of this Act are to provide for home detention as a means of serving a sentence of full-time imprisonment, and to that end: to define the class of sentences of imprisonment that may be served by way of home detention, and the class of offenders who are eligible to serve a sentence in that way, and to provide for due assessment of eligible offenders so as to determine their suitability, and the suitability of their circumstances, to serve a term of imprisonment by way of home detention, and to provide for the making and revocation of home detention orders and for the imposition of conditions applicable to home detention; specifying periods of confinement and the circumstances in which the offender may be absent from home, and regulating the conduct of the offender while subject to home detention and providing for the monitoring of that conduct, and generally defining the constraints and privileges pertaining to home detention.

It is not the object of this Act to divert to home detention offenders who might be appropriately dealt with by way of periodic detention or by a non- custodial form of sentence." 
The emphasis is added.

There is an immediate contrast able to be perceived between periodic detention which is an option exercised by the sentencer at the time of imposition of sentence and home detention which is explicitly a potential means of serving an already selected option of full time imprisonment.

It is noted that the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) contains no declaration of objects in terms similar to the [Home Detention Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) being limited to its preamble that it is to make provision for and with respect to periodic detention of certain persons sentenced to imprisonment. Home detention hence is a method by which an already imposed sentence of imprisonment may be served. The statute itself provides limits as to the offences for which it may be available and the offenders who may be subject to it and the jurisdiction may only be exercised after there has been imposed a fixed term of imprisonment not exceeding eighteen months or minimum and additional terms not exceeding eighteen months in aggregate. As my earlier reference demonstrates, the procedure required by this statute is to impose the sentence which is then stayed whilst an assessment of suitability is made.
If bail has not been granted during the period leading up to assessment, time spent in custody may be taken into account in fixing the commencement date: [s (5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s11.html)
The structure of the Act makes it a matter for decision after the sentence is imposed whether it will be permitted to be served by way of home detention. An order is prohibited where the assessment is unfavourable [(s (4))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s8.html) and jurisdiction is vested in the Court even where the report recommends service by way of home detention to decline to make an order [(s (5)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s8.html) 
It can be observed that pursuant to Home Detention Regulation 9 there are prescribed standard conditions applying to home detention which are restricting upon freedom of movement of the prisoner under sentence upon terms which are comparatively as rigorous as those as would be applied to a prisoner in a minimum security institution who was permitted work or study release privileges. There are of course provisions for revocation in the event of breach and the commitment of the offender to serve the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon him other than pursuant to home detention.

My conclusion therefore is that an order for home detention is a collateral order to a sentence of imprisonment and accordingly is not a matter to be taken into account by this Court in assessing the adequacy of a term of imprisonment imposed in the Court from which appeal is brought. That conclusion is, I consider, compatible with the ordinary separation of responsibility (subject to Administrative Law jurisdiction) that it is for the executive to determine how, where and under what conditions a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court is to be served. The [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) transfers one of the decisions on the aspect of where sentence is to be served to the judicial arm.

It is acknowledged by the Crown that there is no need for this Court to acquire a fresh assessment of suitability of the respondent in the event that we were minded to allow the appeal and increase the period of imprisonment but in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court to order that the minimum term element of any sentence be served by way of home detention.

An affidavit of Dennis Norman Graham sworn 22 August 1997 has been read. He is a Probation and Parole officer who speaks of the detention of the respondent to date. I quote from that affidavit: "Mr Smith entered the Programme on 2 May 1997. He has cooperated fully with this Service and has been meticulous in carrying out requirements.

To date, there have been 67 personal contacts with the detainee, 39 of these face-to-face.

There has also been 33 contacts with others (parents, employer, educator).

Seven random alcohol breath tests and five urinalysis have been carried out all with satisfactory results with no illicit substances recorded.

Random computer generated telephone calls have been set at 3-8 calls per day when Mr Smith is not at work. A lower than usual level has been set recognizing that the detainee is a shift worker and also because of his very favourable response.

Mr Smith copes with the pressures of Home Detention by reminding himself that his situation is a consequence of his offending behaviour. He also appreciates the opportunity of maintaining family and other relationships and support, being able to continue his apprenticeship and secure a future. The death of his friend still haunts him and he regards this burden as `a life sentence'.

SUMMARY 
Mr Smith was assessed as particularly suitable for Home Detention being a person who was committed and well motivated with a supportive family and posing no threat to the community. He is now fulfilling this assessment in an exemplary way, keeping strictly to requirements but at the same making good progress at work, at study and at life in general. In the area of personal development, little intervention is required as Mr Smith's self management is very good. This Service however, will continue to involve itself, as appropriate with the issues surrounding the death of his friend." 
In my opinion it is appropriate that any substituted sentence consequent upon the success of the Crown appeal should be served in home detention.

I propose the following orders:
The appeal be allowed and the sentences and orders of the District Court be quashed.
In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced to a total term of sixteen months imprisonment consisting of a minimum term of twelve months commencing on 2 May 1997 and expiring on 1 May 1998 together with an additional term of four months commencing on 2 May 1998.
That the minimum term component of that sentence be served by way of home detention.
That the respondent be released to parole on 2 May 1998 and whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.

SMART J: I agree with the reasons of Grove J for increasing the sentence and with the orders which he proposes. The orders produce the correct result in this case. I have one area of disagreement. 
I regard service of home detention as substantially less onerous than service of a sentence of the same length in gaol but that does not mean that in the present case home detention is inappropriate. This is just the sort of case where it is open to the judge to consider and use this method of sentencing.
The legislation envisages that home detention is permissible and may be appropriate for the subject offence.

The fact that a sentence may be served in different ways or by different means does not result in the sentence being necessarily of the same severity. The means of service are important. I would take them into account in assessing the severity or adequacy of a sentence.
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s5.html) of the [Home Detention
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) provides that a home detention order may be made in respect of a sentence of imprisonment comprising (a) a fixed term of imprisonment not exceeding eighteen months, or (b) a minimum term and an additional term that do not in the aggregate exceed eighteen months. The section is facultative and not mandatory in its terms.

Section (1) of the Act provides that the Court by whom a person is sentenced, as referred to in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s5.html), or any Court reviewing such a sentence, may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for home detention as a means of serving the minimum term of the sentence (or in the case of a fixed term sentence, the whole of the fixed term).

After determining the sentence, and providing that it is one not exceeding eighteen months in the aggregate, the judge decides whether it is an appropriate case for a reference under [section (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s9.html)
The reference is for an assessment as to the suitability of the offender. The judge has a discretion whether to make a reference.

If the judge thinks that home detention could or would be appropriate he may refer the offender for an assessment. If he thinks that home detention is inappropriate, he would not refer the offender for an assessment. It does not mitigate against my view that the length of the sentence is determined first and then a decision is made as to whether there should be a reference for an assessment as to home detention.

Where home detention is considered appropriate, there are conditions which must be met before it may be imposed [(s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s8.html) of the Act). [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s8.html) empowers the Court to decline to make a home detention order even if the assessment is generally favourable. Further materials may have emerged or some matter or matters appearing in the assessment may cause the judge to think that a home detention order should not be made.

STUDDERT J: I agree that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate and warrants the intervention of this Court. I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J and I agree with his Honour's analysis of the provisions of the [Home Detention Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) and their effect. 
SMART J: The orders will be as proposed by Grove J. * * *
