Chief Commissioner for Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) versus Webb [1996]
NSWSC 581 (29 November 1996) 
Chief Commissioner For Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) versus Webb /90 November 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
MASTER MALPASS 
JUDGMENT 
MASTER: During the period between 28 June 1988 and 27 November 1988, the defendant carried on the business of selling tobacco in New South Wales for resale. It is common ground that, during such period, he did not hold a Tobacco Wholesaler's Licence.

It is alleged by the plaintiff that the defendant became liable, pursuant to section 47 of the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act, 1987 (the
Act), to pay an amount equal to the fee which would have been payable for a licence had the defendant held a licence for the said period, together with a penalty. It is further alleged that assessments were made by the plaintiff and that notices of assessment were served on the defendant. It is further alleged that the defendant neither lodged an objection with the plaintiff nor brought an appeal against the assessments. It is further alleged that some moneys have been paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. A claim is made for the balance of the moneys (in the sum of $254,355.27) and interest thereon.

These proceedings were commenced in 1990 by the filing of a Statement of
Claim. The claim as presently propounded by the plaintiff is to be found in the Amended Statement of Claim filed on 22 June 1995. A Defence which bears the date 28 June 1996 was filed in Court on 26 November 1996.

A Notice of Motion seeking summary judgment was filed on 12 April 1995. The
Notice of Motion was first fixed for a hearing to take place on 28 June 1996.
The special fixture was aborted on that day because of the raising of a constitutional issue by the defendant. The Notice of Motion was stood over generally to enable the service of notices pursuant to section 78B of the
Judiciary Act, 1903. On 29 October 1996, a further special fixture was allocated. The Notice of Motion was fixed for hearing on 26 November 1996.

On 26 November 1996, there was no appearance for any Attorney General. The defendant made an application for adjournment of the hearing. The opposed application was refused and the hearing was completed.

The evidence was of a formal nature. No affidavits were sworn on behalf of the defendant. There were no issues of fact raised by him.

Only one issue was raised by the defendant. It is the issue which is expressed in paragraph 2 of the Defence. It raises a question of law. In substance, it is said that the Act is invalid as it violates section 90 of the
Commonwealth of Australia [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), (in that the licence fee is an excise duty). If the defendant fails on that question, it is common ground that the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on his claim.

The defendant has informed the Court that there are two matters which have been fixed for hearing before the High Court in March next year. One of these matters is the case of Ha versus New South Wales. It is said that the decisions in these matters may lead to the result that the Act is found to be invalid.
The defendant had sought that the plaintiff's Notice of Motion be stood over to abide the result of these matters.

The defendant has referred the Court to a considerable volume of material. I shall make express reference to some of it. It includes the decisions of the
High Court in Philip Morris Limited & Ors versus Commissioner of Business
Franchises (Victoria) & Anor [(1989) 176 CLR 399]; Coastace
Pty Limited & Anor versus The State of New South Wales & Ors <case>; [(1989) 167 CLR 503]; Capital Duplicators Pty Limited & Anor versus Australian
Capital Territory & Anor <case>; <case>; [70
ALJR 611.] 
It is common ground that the effect of the decisions in, inter alia, Philip
Morris and Coastace is to uphold the validity of the Act. The relevant licence fee was found not to be an excise duty. This Court is bound to follow those decisions.

The defendant seeks to take comfort in various observations made in Capital
Duplicators. Express reference has been made to passages which may be found, inter alia, on pp 580, 582-588, 590-591 and 596-597. For the purposes of deciding this application, it is unnecessary to embark on any detailed analysis of the various observations.

As I understand the arguments put on behalf of the defendant, it is not said that Capital Duplicators has overruled Philip Morris and Coastace. It is said that Philip Morris and Coastace were wrongly decided and that a reconsideration of those decisions may lead the High Court to hold that the
Act is invalid.

I should add that in Capital Duplicators, the High Court was asked to reconsider the earlier franchise decisions relating to liquor and tobacco (p et seq). The majority (Mason CJ, Brennan J (as he then was), Deane and
McHugh JJ) expressly refused to reconsider those decisions (p 593).
Considerations of certainty and the ability of legislatures and governments to make arrangements on the faith of the Court's interpretation of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) were regarded as formidable arguments against a reconsideration.

It remains open to the defendant to pursue the appellate process and press his submissions elsewhere. If he can persuade the High Court to reconsider the earlier decisions, it may overrule the decisions that bind this Court. Until that happens, this Court is required to apply the law as it now stands.

As the law presently stands, the only defence argued on behalf of the defendant must fail. The interests of justice entitle the plaintiff to summary judgment.

By order, the Court gives judgment for the plaintiff on his claim pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p13) [rule 2.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s2.html)
The material placed before me does not quantify the total amount of the claim.
If agreement cannot be reached as to quantum, the matter may be relisted for the purposes of any further argument. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
