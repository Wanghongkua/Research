JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
GZELL J  FEBRUARY 2009  /07 AUSTRALIAN SECURITES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION versus MACDONALD (NO )
 
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT James Hardie Industries NV, the twelfth defendant, seeks to tender 87 financial market analysts' reports covering the period 12 November 1998 to 31
July 2003.
 The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the plaintiff, called
Alan John Humphris, a merchant banker. He examined 63 analysts' reports for the purpose of his first report of 17 March 2008 and a further six reports for the purpose of his supplementary report of 2 September 2008. The analysts' reports are material to an assessment of the circumstances that existed at the time that it is alleged by ASIC that JHINV was, in various respects, in breach of provisions of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth).
 Mr Humphris gave evidence in October 2008. He was cross-examined on behalf of JHINV. None of the 87 reports now sought to be tendered were put to him.  JHINV submits that all bar two of the reports were available to ASIC and it could have put the reports to Mr Humphris. It says that the other two reports could have been obtained under ASIC's compulsory powers or by subpoena. It says that it was not obliged to cross-examine Mr Humphris on the reports and can challenge the assumptions underlying Mr Humphris's evidence by tendering these other analysts' reports.
 I do not agree. If JHINV proposed to rely on the 87 reports to challenge the underlying assumptions upon which Mr Humphris's reports were based, albeit that initially ASIC treated the documents as relevant to the case, it was nonetheless incumbent upon JHINV to put the reports to him in cross- examination.  In my view, the failure to do so in the circumstances of this case debars
JHINV from tendering the reports now. This is a classic Browne versus Dunn (1894) R 67 situation and it is now too late, after the conclusion of the oral evidence in this case over an extended period, to take alternative courses such as allowing ASIC to re-open its case to recall Mr Humphris.  The application of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) and its requirement to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the case enforces my view. ASIC should not now be placed in a position of seeking to re-open its case to have Mr Humphris consider the reports or seek to present a case in reply by recalling Mr Humphris.
 If the common law rule in Browne does not apply, I would exercise my discretion under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and refuse to admit the reports on the basis that their probative value is outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to ASIC or cause or result in undue waste of time. There is a limit to the time available to me to write a judgment in this case. I am rostered back to normal duties in May 2009 and must complete the judgment before then. It would take considerable time for ASIC to have Mr Humphris analyse the additional analysts' reports preparatory to his giving further evidence.
 JHINV submits that some of the reports are relevant to a different issue -
JHINV's sale of its gypsum business in the United States of America. I will allow the tender of those analysts' reports that go to that issue, but will limit their use to that issue.  Subject to my rulings, I order that the documents in the twelfth defendant's list of documents for tender, other than the financial market analysts' reports, to the extent that they are not already exhibits, be admitted as exhibits by entering their digital content in the court record database. I order that such of the market analysts' reports as are relevant to the twelfth defendant's sale of its gypsum business in the United States of
America be admitted as exhibits by entering their digital content in the court
Record database but that, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), their use be limited to that issue.  I order that the digital content of my reasons for judgment be entered on the court record database after their inclusion in Caselaw.
