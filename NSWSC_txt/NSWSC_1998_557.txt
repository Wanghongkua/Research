WORKERS' COMPENSATION - which insurer liable to indemnify employer - [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) , [s 151AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) 
An employee of Caltex claimed damages for industrial deafness suffered prior to 30 June 1987 (when the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) came into force). The trial Judge also heard cross-claims by Caltex to determine which insurer was liable to indemnify it. Quickenden ADCJ held that the appellant was liable. On appeal the appellant sought to argue that liability should have fallen upon the respondent.

HELD: Dismissing the appeal: (1) There was nothing in <case> of the Workers' Compensation Act to prevent the worker amending his statement of claim to limit his damages claim to damage suffered before 30 June 1987. MMI Insurance Compensation Ltd versus Baker [(1997) 41 NSWLR 289] as the former case better supports the objectives of the section as expressed in ss (2). 
ORDER 
Appeal dismissed with costs.

FAI TRADERS INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED versus HIH WINTERTHUR WORKERS COMPENSATION PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an appeal against a judgment of Quickenden ADCJ who held that the appellant was bound to indemnify Caltex Refining Company Pty Ltd ("Caltex") against its liability to pay damages to its employee, Mr David Wilson (the plaintiff), for industrial deafness. The plaintiff commenced employment with Caltex on 27 December 1973 and was still employed by it at the date of trial. He commenced proceedings for damages against Caltex in the District Court on 8 May 1995 without restricting his claim to any particular period. 
If the plaintiff had gone to trial on the original statement of claim, DCR Pt r 2 would have authorised the Court to assess damages for any additional tortious injury to his hearing down to the date of trial. However on 20
November 1996 Gallen DCJ granted the plaintiff leave to amend to confine his claims to deafness caused before 4 pm on 30 June 1987 when the [Workers
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) came into force.

The Judge awarded damages in accordance with the amended statement of claim and there has been no challenge to that award. He also heard cross-claims brought by Caltex to determine which insurer was liable to indemnify it in respect of such damages. The Judge held that the appellant, who was on risk from 1 September 1986 to 30 June 1987, was bound to indemnify Caltex and made orders on that basis. The appeal seeks to establish that the respondent, which was on risk from 30 June 1995 to the date of hearing, was the insurer liable to indemnify Caltex.

The appeal turns on the provisions of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) in the form inserted by Act No. 2 of 1991. The section, so far as relevant, provided: "(1) If an employer is liable independently of this Act for damages for an occupational disease contracted by a worker, the liability is to be taken (for the purpose of this section only) to have arisen when the worker was last employed by that employer in an employment to the nature of which the disease was due.

The purpose of this section is to identify (from among a number of insurers under policies of insurance obtained by a single employer for different periods) one insurer which is to indemnify the employer for the full amount of the damages ... without any right to a contribution from those other insurers.
 ...

This section applies to any liability arising before or after the commencement of this Act and to any policy of insurance issued before or after that commencement".
 [Section
AB(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) defines an occupational disease as including boilermakers' deafness.

Mr Little, who appeared for the appellant, had two principal submissions in support of the appeal. The first, based on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151.html) A was that the plaintiff, by his original statement of claim, had elected to claim damages instead of permanent loss compensation for his deafness caused by exposure to industrial noise after 30 June 1987. The second was that [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) made the insurer on risk at the date of trial liable to indemnify Caltex.
 [Section
A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151a.html) provides that a person is not entitled to both permanent loss compensation and damages in respect of an injury but is required to elect to claim one or the other. Sub section (3) (a) provides that a person makes an election inter alia "by commencing proceedings in a court to recover those damages". The plaintiff appears therefore to have elected to claim damages rather than compensation for his industrial deafness caused since 30 June 1987.

I say "appears to have elected" because, for the purposes of assessing permanent loss compensation but not common law damages, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) of the Act deems a worker's industrial deafness to have happened when notice of injury is given. There may be difficulties in applying [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151.html) A where the date of the injury, for statutory purposes, is different from the date of the injury for common law purposes. However, I am prepared to assume that the plaintiff did make an election by commencing proceedings in the
District Court, and that election terminated his rights to permanent loss compensation.

Mr Little submitted that this election prevented the plaintiff amending to confine his claim to injuries sustained before 30 June 1987, that the amendment should not have been made and should now be disregarded. There is no substance in these submissions. There is nothing in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151.html) A which prevents a plaintiff from amending to limit his claim for damages. Such an amendment will not avoid any election previously made but it will operate, in accordance with its terms, to limit his claim for damages. Indeed both eminent counsel and the Court in MMI Insurance Compensation Ltd versus Baker [(1997) 41 NSWLR 289] assumed this was so. See at 291, 293.

Mr Little's second point, based on [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html), had more substance but it too encountered the decision in MMI Insurance
Compensation Ltd versus Baker. In that case the worker's exposure to industrial noise with the one employer began before 30 June 1987 and continued thereafter. The appellant was the sole insurer before the 1987 Act and the third respondent its sole insurer thereafter. Gleeson CJ said, at 294-5: "The liability of the employer for damages was in respect of a cause of action that arose before the commencement of the 1987 legislation, and was confined to injuries suffered before that time. The hypothesis upon which sub section of <case> proceeds is that, in a case to which the section applies, there are two or more insurers contractually liable to indemnify the employer at least to some extent in respect of the relevant liability. The purpose of the section is to enable a selection to be made from amongst those insurers. In this case however there was only ever one insurer contractually obliged to indemnify the employer in respect of the whole liability in question. In those circumstances there is no factual basis upon which the purpose of the section operates.

To put the matter slightly differently, the purpose of <case> is to deal with a problem which, in the present case, does not arise. The provisions of <case>
AB are intended to solve a certain problem; they cannot be used to create one where it does not otherwise exist".

This decision, from which the High Court refused special leave to appeal, negatives, in a case such as this, the liability of any insurer which only came on risk after the expiration of the period during which the liability was incurred.

Mr Little submitted that the section required the Court to identify the date "when the worker was last employed by" Caltex "in an employment to the nature of which the disease was due". The Judge found that the plaintiff's exposure to excessive noise continued until his duties changed in January 1996.
Accordingly, so Mr Little submitted, the insurer on risk at that time, namely the respondent, was liable to indemnify Caltex for the damages. This date was after the proceedings were commenced so that acceptance of the submission would produce the startling result that the insurer on risk when the proceedings commenced would go off risk and one or more other insurers could go on and off risk while the action was pending until it was heard, or the potentially causative employment ceased.

The plain meaning of <case> shows that the result contended for is not correct. The Judge's decision in the action against Caltex established that it was "liable independently of this Act for damages for an occupational disease contracted by" the plaintiff. The section provides that "the liability", that is the liability for those damages, "is to be taken ... to have arisen when the worker was last employed by that employer in an employment to the nature of which the disease was due".

This liability is of course for damages caused by exposure to industrial noise up to 30 June 1987. In this case the "disease" when last referred to in the section is not industrial deafness simpliciter but industrial deafness caused by noise exposure up to 30 June 1987. This is the same "disease" as that first referred to, namely that for which Caltex is liable to pay damages.

One result of this construction is that the identity of the insurer liable to indemnify the employer can be effected by the date when proceedings for the recovery of damages are commenced by a worker and the period for which they are claimed. However that is the inexorable effect of the plain meaning of the section.

If the plaintiff had persisted in his claim to recover damages for industrial deafness caused by his noise exposure after 30 June 1987, another insurer may have become liable for the whole of those damages. However in all probability the plaintiff would not have recovered any damages for his noise exposure after 30 June 1987 because of the restrictions in Div 3 of Pt 5 of the Act ( see <case> U (1) and Div 3). If so the only damages awarded would have been for the period up to 30 June 1987 and the appellant would have been the insurer liable.

The decision of the trial Judge was correct and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

SHEPPARD AJA: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the judgment to be delivered by Handley JA. I am in agreement with his Honour's reasons and conclusions, and with the orders which he proposes. 
FITZGERALD AJA: The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are set out in the reasons for judgment of Handley JA. I am in substantial agreement with his Honour's reasons. 
The appellant drew our attention to other decisions of this Court, including
CIC Workers Compensation Ltd versus Kellogg (Australia) Pty Ltd,[1] which was not referred to in MMI Insurance Compensation Ltd versus Baker.[2] The submission was made that the two decisions are inconsistent, and that
Kellogg is to be preferred to Baker.
 [Section
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) is set out in the reasons for judgment of Handley JA, and need not be repeated. Taken in isolation, subs (1) is ambiguous. The latter part of the subsection could relate to the time when the injured worker was last employed by the liable employer in an activity of the nature of the activity which caused the worker's disease, or to the time when the injured worker was last so employed during the period to which the employer's liability is referable. Kellogg supports the former view, while Baker favours the latter.

I am of opinion that the approach adopted in Baker is to be preferred, principally because such a course seems to me to satisfy better the purpose of [s151AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) which is stated in subs (2).

I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
