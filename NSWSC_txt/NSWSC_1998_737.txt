KERRY LESLIE GREEN versus GORDON MATHESON & ANOR /91 May 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Application is made by the plaintiff to set aside the order of Master Greenwood of 14 February 1997 pursuant to Part 40 Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules. That order was an interlocutory order which took effect on 14 February 1997. Master Greenwood had made a self-executing order requiring the filing and serving of particulars by 4.00 pm that day. As a consequence of a perceived failure to file and serve those particulars, the statement of claim stood dismissed with costs. The original order made by Master Greenwood provided that if the order was complied with the action was to be transferred to the District Court. In each event, the plaintiff was to pay the defendant's costs of the motion. 
I am informed from the bar table by the representatives of the parties, and it is confirmed by the affidavit of David Maurice Stack sworn 13 May 1998, that in fact the particulars were furnished within time on that day although they were not "filed" since no procedure existed in the Supreme Court for the filing of particulars of that kind. The present application is an application that the order be set aside and the proceedings be transferred to the District
Court. It is not opposed by the defendants.

Without staying to examine whether, in the circumstances, there was any irregularity of any kind in the order being made on the material appearing in the affidavit of David Maurice Stack sworn 13 May 1998 and upon reading what appeared in the order and accepting the concession put from the bar table, I will, as and from 14 March 1997, set aside the order of Master Greenwood dismissing the action with costs and I order the action to be transferred to the District Court.

Costs to be costs in the cause.
