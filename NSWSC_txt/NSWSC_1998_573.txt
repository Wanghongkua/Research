JUDGMENT 
MASON P: This appeal, by leave, challenges Sully J's dismissal of an appeal by way of Stated Case from a decision of a Local Court Magistrate. 
The appellant's motor vehicle was extensively damaged in a collision in 1992.
Repair costs of $39,800 were necessary. The collision was with another car (a
Mitsubishi SE) owned by the respondent (a car rental firm) and driven by the respondent's hirer Mr Azzi. Mr Azzi died as a result of the collision. The hiring was evidenced by a Car Rental Agreement between the deceased and the respondent.

The appellant sued the respondent in the Local Court for the damage to his car relying upon [s51(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s51.html) of the [Insurance Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (Cth) (the Act). (The appellant did not pursue an alternative claim against the respondent at common law that the respondent was vicariously liable for the negligence of its hirer.) [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s51.html) provides: 
Where: the insured under a contract of liability insurance is liable in damages to a person (in this section called the "third party"); the insured has died or cannot, after reasonable enquiry, be found; and the contract provides insurance cover in respect of the liability; the third party may recover from the insurer an amount equal to the insurer's liability under the contract in respect of the insured's liability in damages.

The meaning of "contract of liability insurance" in the Act is elucidated by [s11(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s11.html) and (7) which provide: 
For the purposes of this Act, a contract of general insurance is a contract of insurance that is not a contract of life insurance.

For the purposes of this Act, a contract of liability insurance is a contract of general insurance that provides insurance cover in respect of the insured's liability for loss or damage caused to a person who is not the insured.

The appellant submitted before the magistrate that the Car Rental Agreement contained a contract of liability insurance whereby the respondent had agreed to indemnify the deceased in respect of the deceased's liability to the appellant for damages caused to his motor vehicle from the collision. In other words, the respondent was the insurer for the purposes of [s51(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s51.html) 
The claim pursuant to [s51(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s51.html) failed and was dismissed on 23 June 1995. The magistrate was asked to state a
Case and he did so. On 24 October 1997 Sully J dismissed the appeal by way of
Stated Case. I shall return to his Honour's reasons, which differ in some respects from those of the magistrate. The appellant obtained leave to appeal to this Court on 24 February 1998. However, the following order was made in aid of the appeal: 
Send the Stated Case back to the Local Court Magistrate in order that he may list the proceedings for further hearing, hear such evidence and submissions as are appropriate, decide whether the collision was shown to have been caused by the deceased's negligence, making findings accordingly and amend the Stated
Case as appropriate to include and take account of these findings of fact. 
On 11 May 1998 the matter returned to the magistrate (Mr Bailey SM). He heard further submissions based on the original transcript of proceedings in June
The learned Magistrate then delivered the following reasons: 
In placing submissions before me today, there is no challenge as to whether the deceased was negligent in his manoeuvring of the motor vehicle which resulted in a collision. The dispute between the parties is whether the deceased committed an inadvertent or deliberate act.

Mr Dubler outlined Regulations under the [Traffic
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta77/) which may have been breached by the deceased. Some of those Regulations, on the evidence before the court have clearly been breached, others, on the evidence, require the court to draw certain inferences to determine whether there has been a breach or not. Generally, on the balance of probabilities, the court could draw those inferences.

The Law of Torts by Fleming, states: "Negligence is conduct falling below the standard established for the protection of others against unreasonable risk to them. This standard of conduct is ordinarily measured by what the reasonable man of ordinary prudence would do in the circumstances".

On the evidence before the court, it is clear that on this occasion, the deceased was negligent in the manner in which he manoeuvred the motor vehicle.

I wish to give a decision which will obviate the necessity for the matter to be referred back to me once more. Perhaps to that end I should make comment on the submissions put forward by both Mr Martin and Mr Dubler. The submissions were as to whether the actions of the deceased were inadvertent or deliberate.
 "Inadvertent", according to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, means: `Not properly attentive; inobservant, negligent; heedless. Of actions etc characterized by want of attention; hence unintentional.' 
The same dictionary, defines "Deliberate" as: `Well weighed or considered; carefully thought out; done of set purpose; studied; not hasty or rash ... to think carefully, to take time for consideration.' 
After I interacted with the submissions of the parties, Mr Martin resiled from "inadvertent" and submitted simply that I determine the deceased was negligent. It would appear to me from the above definition, "negligent" and "inadvertent" are interchangeable.

On the evidence before me, I could not say that the actions of the driver (the deceased) was one that was carefully thought out, or that it was not hasty or rash, or that it was thought out carefully with time for consideration. His actions were not deliberate in that sense.

On the other hand, I could not say that his actions in making the manoeuvre was [sic] unintentional - a word that is mentioned in the dictionary for the meaning of inadvertent.

On the evidence before me, there is sufficient for me to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the deceased was intending to do a "U" turn at the time and had in fact commenced that procedure. The manner in which he performed that manoeuvre was negligent.

In consequence of this, the Magistrate amended the Stated Case, inter alia by extending para 2(f) so that it now reads: 
On 13 August 1992 the deceased caused the motor vehicle collision which occurred between the Mitsubishi and the Plaintiff's vehicle in that the deceased drove the Mitsubishi in breach of provisions of the Motor [Traffic
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta77/) and/or Motor [Traffic Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/) in the manner found by me in the additional Reasons for Judgment dated 11 May .

After these judicial snakes and ladders, the appeal comes to this Court.
Initially each side attempted to embrace those parts of the judgments below that were in his or its favour, and to discard the balance. The respondent filed a Notice of Contention and advanced submissions challenging Sully J's determination that the Car Rental Agreement contained a "contract of liability insurance" within [s51(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s51.html)
However, this contention was abandoned during argument.

THE REMAINING ISSUE IN CONTEXT 
The Car Rental Agreement contains conditions touching insurance. Principal among them is condition 19 which is set out below. Because of [s10(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s10.html) of the Act, both the magistrate and Sully J held that such parts of the Car
Rental Agreement as included "provisions of insurance" were to be regarded as a contract of (liability) insurance capable of attracting [s51(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s51.html) [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s10.html) only gives that effect to "provisions of insurance insofar as those provisions are concerned". As indicated, this finding is no longer challenged by the respondent.

The Car Rental Agreement was in the common form of a sheet allowing details of the individual hirer and his or her options to be inserted in appropriate boxes. On the back of the form were many conditions in fairly small print. The appellant relies on several provisions of the Car Rental Agreement as indicating that the respondent effectively bound itself to give the deceased the benefit of insurance cover being liability insurance. As between the respondent and its insurer Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Ltd, it was the respondent's intent that obligations of this nature would be discharged by
Tokio Marine, albeit subject to a very hefty excess of $40,000. However, the deceased was not privy to such arrangements (except perhaps in the technical and presently irrelevant sense addressed in Trident General Insurance Co
Ltd versus McNiece Bros Pty Ltd <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 107] and [s48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s48.html) of the
Act). His putative claim against the respondent under [s51](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s51.html) stands upon the respondent's promises to him under the Car Rental Agreement.

DID THE APPELLANT SATISFY [S51(1)(C)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s51.html) IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXCLUSIONARY PROVISIONS IN CONDITIONS 4(F), 11, 19(A) AND 19(J) OF THE CAR RENTAL AGREEMENT? 
The appellant failed before Sully J because it was found that the deceased's contract of liability insurance with the respondent did not provide insurance cover in respect of the deceased's liability towards the appellant (cf [s51(1)(c)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/s51.html)
Sully J held that the facts relating to the accident took it outside the cover of any contract for liability insurance found within the four corners of the
Car Rental Agreement. This was because of exclusionary provisions found in conditions 4(f), 11, 9(a) and (j) of the Car Rental Agreement.

It is necessary to set out the whole of condition 19: 
DAMAGE INSURANCE
Lessor's insurance will relieve Customer of all liability for loss or damage, subject to the excess provision provided below, and unless excluded by one or more of the following: 
EXCLUSIONS 
Where Vehicle is used or driven in violation of any of the terms of the
Agreement, including authorised area of use.

Where Vehicle is used or driven by any person who is not a duly licensed driver or whose license has been endorsed, or by any driver or Customer who has given a fictitious or false name or address or false age, or by any person while under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics.

Where Vehicle is used or driven for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward for any illegal purpose in any race, speed test or contest, to propel or tow any vehicle or trailer, for driving tuition or for the carriage of a greater number of passengers and or a larger load than recommended by the manufacturer.

Where Vehicle is used or driven by any person who has ever had a motor proposal or insurance declined, cancelled or refused renewal or special terms imposed which in the reasonable opinion of Lessor indicates that the risk or loss or damage to Vehicle is substantially increased by having been driven by such person.

Where Vehicle is used or driven by any person other than Customer who signed the Rental Agreement and any person nominated by Customer and approved by Lessor.

Where Vehicle is returned to Lessor with interior damage.

Where Vehicle is used for the carriage of explosives or flammable liquids.

Theft of Vehicle where Customer does not return keys of Vehicle to rental station.

Where Vehicle is driven into hazardous conditions, such as flood, bush fire, etc.

Vehicle used or driven in breach of Term 4.

Customer does not comply with terms 9 or 10 or 20.

EXCESS PROVISION 
Customer shall be responsible for the first amount of loss or damage arising from each and every accident as shown on Page 1 of this Agreement unless
Customer pays an additional sum nominated as collision damage waiver (CDW) on
Page 1 of this Agreement.

In a box on the front sheet, initialled by the deceased, appears: "RENTER ACKNOWLEDGES $500 LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE" 
Condition 4 relevantly provided:
Customer and any other driver shall at all times use and drive vehicle in accordance with the following: ...

Vehicle must not be used or driven in contravention of the provisions of the Motor [Traffic
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta77/) of the State of
New South Wales or any corresponding enactment or ordinance in other State or
Territories of the Commonwealth of Australia and must not be taken outside the
Commonwealth of Australia.

Condition 11 was also said to be picked up by condition 19(a). So far as relevant, condition 11 contained an agreement by the "Customer" to "exercise the highest possible standard of care with respect to the Vehicle".

Paragraph 2(f) of the Amended Stated Case, when read with the Magistrate's
Additional Reasons for Judgment dated 11 May 1998 (annexed to the Stated
Case), embodied findings to the effect that the negligent act of the deceased when he did a "U" turn across the path of the appellant's vehicle entailed breaches of s4(1) of the Traffic Act 1909 (negligent driving) as well as regulations 72A and 73 of the Motor [Traffic
Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/tr186/). (The latter breaches were capable of description as contraventions of the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act within condition 4(f) (cf Duncan v
Theodore <case>; [(1917) 23 CLR 510] at 543).) 
The contract between the deceased and the respondent would not provide "insurance cover in respect of the liability" of the deceased towards the appellant if the terms of that contract excluded liability in the events which happened. Sully J held that the breach of s4(1) of the Traffic Act 1909 (previously called the Motor Traffic Act 1909) fell within condition 4(f) and therefore in an area of excluded liability for "damage insurance", because of conditions 19(a) and (j). He was correct to do so. The conduct of the deceased as found by the Magistrate fell squarely within condition 4(f), and that conduct was the direct cause of the liability of the deceased towards the appellant. One might be excused for thinking that this result indicates that the "damage insurance" proffered by the respondent to the deceased was unavailable in the very circumstances where one would expect it to be required. However, the stringency of a contractual exclusion condition is not in itself a reason for ignoring that condition, and the appellant was in no way subrogated to the rights (if any) of the deceased against the respondent stemming from any representation implicit in the portions of page 1 of the Car
Rental Agreement that appeared to hold out to the deceased that he had comprehensive insurance cover save for a $500 excess.

Before us counsel for the appellant sought to read down conditions 19(a) and by two alternative arguments.

First, it was submitted that exclusions (a) and (j) could not apply unless it were established that the losses flowing from the deceased's contraventions of the Traffic Act and Regulations were "unintended". This submission gains no support from the language used in the exclusions and condition 4(f). However, counsel for the appellant sought to have condition 19 construed in this way by invoking cases discussing the scope of the principle of public policy which prevents an insured from recovering under a policy of insurance when, despite falling within its literal terms, the insured has brought himself or herself within them by an intentional or deliberate and unlawful act. The paradigm case is Beresford versus Royal Insurance Co Limited [[1938] AC 586], where recovery under a life insurance policy was denied to the legal personal representatives of a deceased who had committed suicide, thereby committing what was a crime as the law then stood. This and the other cases to which we were referred (Tinline versus Whitecross Insurance Association Ltd [[1921] 3 KB 327]; James v
British General Insurance Co Ltd [[1927] 2 KB 311] and Fire & All Risks Insurance Co Ltd versus Powell <case>; [[1966] VR 513)] are all illustrations of the principle that a person will not be allowed to profit from his or her own wrong, where deliberate conduct intentionally brings about the insured event. See also Gray versus Barr [[1971] 2 QB 554.] But the present case does not involve this situation, because the deceased's conduct, albeit criminal, simply took him outside of the closely confined and largely illusory insurance cover.

The Court was referred to passages in Australian Aviation Underwriting Ltd v Henry [(1988) 12 NSWLR 121] at 124, , 127. While these passages indicate the ubiquity of the principles of public policy, they provide no support for the proposition that the court can avoid the terms of the policy by finding that an unintentional crime was involved. Henry recognises that an exclusion clause inserted by an insurer will be read contra proferentem, and applies that principle by reading down an exclusion relating to death resulting from "an insured person's own criminal act" so as not to apply where that criminal act was negligent or inadvertent. See also Australian Associated Motor Insurances
Ltd versus Wright [(1998) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-390.] But Henry does not go any further. While the mere fact that a person commits a crime does not preclude reliance upon insurance cover, at least where the crime is unintentional (Tinline, James, Gardner v
Moore [[1984] AC 548)], it would be entirely fallacious to invert this into the proposition that commission of an unintentional crime brings an insured within the cover of a policy that clearly excludes conduct of the relevant type.

The findings of the learned Magistrate established that the deceased's conduct fell within the exclusions of the liability insurance portions of the Car
Rental Agreement. It was irrelevant that the deceased was not found to have intended the loss which he caused to the appellant.

The second way in which the appellant attempted to escape conditions 19(a) and was to embrace a suggestion proffered by the Bench during argument. It was submitted that the portion of condition 19 dealing with "EXCLUSIONS", especially paras (a) and (j), is to be confined to excluding liability with respect to damage to the hired vehicle alone. On reflection, this submission cannot be sustained, notwithstanding a vigorous application of the contra proferentem maxim. The "EXCLUSIONS" qualified the respondent's liability for "damage insurance", being a liability which (ex hypothesi) indemnified the deceased with respect to his liability to third parties such as the appellant.
In this context, the exclusions are fairly to be read as qualifying such liability in all of its applications. There is nothing in the terms of the exclusions to give them the narrower interpretation suggested by the submission. Indeed, exclusions (c) and (d) indicate that third party liability was in contemplation. It is true that some of the exclusions (eg (h) (theft of vehicle)) seem to have no scope of application except as regards the hired vehicle. But others (eg (k) customer does not comply with terms 9 or 10 or 20) seem to emphasise the generality of the potential scope of the exclusions. The presently critical exclusions ((a) and (j)) are fairly capable of application in the present context. To decline to give that application would be to re- write the contract between the deceased and the respondent, something to be avoided no matter how tempting it is in the light of the broad scope of the exclusions, and their capacity to defeat the apparently granted cover (save for $500 excess).

At approximately 9.00am on the day when the appeal was argued, counsel for the appellant provided his opponent and the Court with notice of an additional argument he wished to raise. It had not previously been foreshadowed in written submissions or in the notice of appeal for which leave had been given.
Nor had it been addressed before the Magistrate or Sully J. Needless to say the Case Stated did not advert to it. The argument was that the operation of [s35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s35.html) of the [Insurance Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (Cth) provided the deceased with insurance cover in respect of his liability in damages to the appellant, notwithstanding the exclusionary provisions deriving from condition 19. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s35.html) indirectly imposes an obligation on an insurer clearly to inform the insured of a term in a contract of insurance which restricts "standard cover" (cf [Part
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/index.html#p5)
Div 1: Standard Cover). If the insurer fails clearly to inform the insured of a term restricting that cover, it may not rely on the restriction. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s35.html) provides: . Notification of certain provisions 
Where - a claim is made under a prescribed contract; and the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim is a prescribed event in relation to the contract, the insurer may not refuse to pay an amount equal to the minimum amount in relation to the claim by reason only that the effect of the contract, but for this sub-section, would be that the event the happening of which gave rise to the claim was an event in respect of which - the amount of the insurance cover provided by the contract was less than the minimum amount; or insurance cover was not provided by the contract.

Sub-section (1) does not have effect where the insurer proves that, before the contract was entered into, the insurer clearly informed the insured in writing (whether by providing the insured with a document containing the provisions, or the relevant provisions, of the proposed contract or otherwise) or the insured knew, or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to have known - where the effect of the contract, but for sub-section (1), would be that the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim arising upon the happening of the event would be less than the minimum amount - what the extent of the insurer's liability under the contract in respect of such a claim would be; or where the effect of the contract, but for sub-section (1), would be that the insurer would be under no liability in respect of such a claim - that the contract would not provide insurance cover in respect of the happening of that event.
 ....

Regulation 5 of the Insurance Contracts Regulations defines "prescribed contract" in such a way that it encompasses the relevant part of the contract between the deceased and the respondent. It is regulation 6 which defines "prescribed events". One such event is where: "(c) the insured ...
 incurring a liability (otherwise than under a contract) to pay compensation or damages in respect of loss of, or damage occurring to, property ... in
Australia, being loss or damages that occurs as a result of the use of: the motor vehicle ...." 
Counsel for the respondent took objection to this argument on a number of grounds, including the fact that the point has been raised too late in the appeal. In our view it is sufficient to observe that the argument is precluded by reference to the principles re-stated in Suttor versus Gundowda Pty
Ltd <case>; [(1950) 81 CLR 418] at 438-9.
The reason why these principles were engaged in the present case is that further evidence might have been led showing that s35(2) was satisfied if the recently suggested cause of action based on s35 had been raised at trial. This is sufficient to preclude the point being raised on appeal.

As to costs, I would only allow the respondent one half of its costs. The respondent advanced a substantial contention disputing that the Agreement contained a contract of liability insurance. This raised an issue of general principle, and it provoked detailed rebutting submissions from the appellant.
It was only when the consequences of the respondent's argument in that regard became apparent during argument in appeal that this line of defence was abandoned.

The appeal should be dismissed, with the appellant paying one half of the respondent's costs.
