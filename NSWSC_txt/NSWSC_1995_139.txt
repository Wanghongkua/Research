ORDER
Appeal dismissed
JUDGE1
COLE JA Section 5D [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) confers upon the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to appeal to the Court of
Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party. Such an appeal is a challenge to the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion ((1) R versus Jermyn [(1985) 2
NSWLR 194] at 202 per Mc Hugh JA.). The Court of Criminal Appeal has a statutory discretion conferred upon it by [s.5D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5d.html) to vary the sentence.
It is established law that, in considering the exercise of the statutory discretion conferred upon it, the Court of Criminal Appeal has regard to the attitude of the Crown in the sentencing court. Generally speaking, in exercising its statutory discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion, even where the sentence imposed is erroneous, "if it appears that the Crown was on notice that there was a real possibility that such an order might be made but refrained from submitting that it would be inappropriate and not within a proper exercise of sentencing discretion" ((2) Everett versus The Queen <case>; [(1994) 181
CLR 295] at 303.). The law was stated by McHugh J in Everett in the following terms: "It is well established that, in the exercise of its discretion to grant leave to appeal against a sentence, a Court of Criminal
Appeal must take into account the attitude of the Crown in the sentencing court. Even when it appears that the sentencing judge has erred in a fundamental way that may affect the administration of justice, fairness to the sentenced person requires that the Crown's concurrence with or failure to object to, a proposed course of action by the sentencing judge must be weighed in the exercise of the discretion.
This is particularly so when the convicted person has been given a non-custodial sentence. Private litigants who appeal against judgments and orders are not usually allowed to withdraw concessions made or concurrences expressed in the course of litigation. As a general rule, neither should the Crown be permitted to depart from a course of action that may have induced the sentencing judge to take the course that he or she did." ((3) [(1994) 181 CLR 303] at 307.)
Sean Patrick Jones was given a non-custodial sentence by Gallen DCJ on 20
April 1995 after a plea of guilty to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, contrary to [s.25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s25.html) [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/). The prescribed penalty is a fine of 2000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 10 years, or both. ((4) [Section 32(h)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s32.html) [Drug Misuse and
Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/).) It is well established that, upon conviction for supplying drugs "any penalty other than a custodial sentence for traffickers in illegal drugs is inappropriate in the absence of exceptional circumstances". ((5) R versus Fabian [(1992) 64 A Crim R 365] at 366 per Kirby P; R v
Clark (Unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal 15 March 1990).
The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against the sentence imposed pursuant to s.5D [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). Mr Jones has contended that, in the exercise of its discretion, this Court should dismiss the appeal because, when counsel for the respondent at the trial advocated a non-custodial sentence, the Crown did not submit to the sentencing judge that such a non-custodial sentence "would be inappropriate and not within a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion". Thus in accordance with the principles recited in Everett, the Court of Criminal Appeal should dismiss the crown appeal in exercise of its discretion.
The factual circumstances of what occurred at the sentencing hearing are not entirely clear. No evidence was presented to the Court regarding those circumstances. Statements, of a hearsay nature, were made by each of counsel for the appellant and the respondent from the bar table. Neither counsel had appeared at the trial. Nor were counsels' addresses recorded. However there are matters appearing from the transcript which, to my mind, make it tolerably clear that the Crown was on notice that there was a "real possibility" that a
non-custodial order might be made.
The events occurred on 23 April 1994. The plea was entered before the sentencing judge after a voir dire hearing on 23 November 1994. After the plea was entered the Crown tendered certain material on sentence. Counsel for the respondent, obviously being aware that the matter would not conclude that day, anticipated an application that the matter be not concluded until February as the respondent's wife was pregnant and expected a child at that time.
Ms Honour, as his first comment after the application was foreshadowed, said: "In view of the antecedents of the accused this might be a case, I'm not urging anyone to apply for it but it does appear to me it might be a case where itd be appropriate to order a pre-sentence report."
The Crown did not oppose the matter standing over to February 1995. There was then an application for reduction in reporting conditions, the respondent seeking a reduction to once a week, he having reported three times per week since being granted bail shortly after his arrest. The changed circumstance of having entered a plea was noted by Gallen DCJ. The Crown then said: "Your Honour, of course the fact of the entry of plea does change the picture somewhat, but nevertheless I'll just take some instructions. Yes, Your Honour we don't object to the application that's made."
Reporting conditions were thus reduced to once per week. Upon that basis and without any opposition from the Crown, Gallen DCJ continued the respondent's bail and adjourned the matter to 24 February 1995, having ordered a pre-sentence report.
Such a report was prepared and dated 31 January 1995.
It obviously was available to each of the Crown and the respondent. The report noted that: "8.1 As Mr Jones has previously responded well to probation and community service, the writer feels that if a custodial sentence was passed Jones would be suitable for recognizance with an order to attend psychological counselling on a regular basis.
As Jones is employed he would also be in a position to pay a fine over a period of time.
 .2 If a custodial sentence is contemplated Jones would be in a position to undertake periodic detention at Grafton prison, however if tins option is considered Jones would be required to undertake a 500 k round trip to carry out his sentence. Tins could have a detrimental effect on his employment." 
Of course, a pre-sentence report in no way inhibits the judge's sentencing discretion. Nor does a statement by the reporting officer of his view of available sentencing options, including non-custodial options as many reports do, give rise to a "real probability" that the sentencing judge may impose a non-custodial sentence. However it is not be overlooked that pre-sentence reports are required before a court may impose a community service order ((6) [Section 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) [Community Service Orders Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/csoa1979292/)), or a sentence of periodic detention ((7) [Section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/csoa1979292/s5.html) (1)(c) [Periodic Detention of Prisoners
Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/).). Nor, here, is it to be overlooked that it was the trial judge who initiated the suggestion of a pre-sentence report being obtained.
The matter was, apparently, further adjourned from February 1995 to 20
April 1995. The respondent had thus been on bail, with which he had complied, for approximately one year. Evidence was led on behalf of the respondent regarding his employment position including the commencement of a business with two employees, the respondent's wife's condition and certain prior circumstances which had affected his wife, and his endeavours to provide a stable home for her and his family of two.
We were informed from the bar table that, in addresses, counsel for the respondent sought a non-custodial sentence. There was no demur to that statement and, in the circumstances, one would expect that counsel would have made that application. To succeed, having regard to authorities such as
Fabian, it was necessary for the respondent's counsel to seek to persuade the sentencing judge of the existence of "exceptional circumstances".
It seems to me that where the respondent had been on unopposed bail for some twelve months, where the trial judge had acquiesced in a consensual application that the matter stand over for a lengthy period until after the birth of the respondent's child, where the sentencing judge had himself suggested the obtaining of a pre-sentence report, where the pre-sentence report at least recognised as sentencing options a non-custodial sentence, and where it was being advocated on the part of the respondent that a
non-custodial sentence in all the circumstances should be imposed, it can reasonably be held that the Crown was on notice that there was a "real possibility" that such an order might be made.
As I understood the position put to us by Senior Counsel for the respondent, and the Crown, it was not contended by the Crown before the sentencing judge that a non-custodial sentence would, as a matter of law, fall within an improper exercise of the sentencing discretion nor, so far as statements from the bar table went, was it put by the Crown that such a sentence was inappropriate. Indeed it is not clear at all what, if any, submissions were put by the Crown in relation to sentence.
It is, however, clear from the terms of his Honour's remarks on sentence that he was considering "the big dilemma ... whether or not this prisoner should be sentenced to a custodial sentence". It is not suggested that when those remarks were made during remarks on sentence the Crown then, or at any other time, put to his Honour that to reach such a finding would be otherwise than a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion, although there may have been submissions put that the finding should not be made.
One course which this Court might have adopted was to adjourn the proceedings so that better evidence could be placed before it concerning what was said at the sentencing proceedings. Neither party sought an adjournment.
The respondent, seeking from this Court the exercise of discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence imposed, carried the onus of satisfying this
Court that the Crown had, when there was a "real possibility" that a non-custodial order might be made, refrained from submitting that to make such an order would not be within a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.
In my opinion the appellant has satisfied the evidentiary onus of establishing that there was such a "real possibility", and the Crown did not submit to this
Court, in those circumstances, that it had submitted to the sentencing judge that such a sentence would constitute an impermissible exercise of discretion.
In those circumstances I am of the opinion that this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, should refuse to interfere with the non-custodial sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.
The appeal should be dismissed.
