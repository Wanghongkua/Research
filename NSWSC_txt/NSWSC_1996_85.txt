Moon versus Gordon [1996] NSWSC 85 (30 April 1996) 
MOON V GORDON /95 
Tuesday 30 April 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG, J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff alleges that she was the de facto spouse of the late William Stanley Littlejohn who died on 21 August 1994. Probate of the deceased's last will was granted to the defendant, Nona Gordon, by this Court in its Probate Division on 3 July 1995. Mrs Gordon is the deceased's ex-wife. However, her evidence is that the deceased died in her bedroom at her house in Cairns early in the morning of 21 August 1994. The beneficiaries under the will are mainly Mrs Gordon and her children including a child of whom the deceased was the father.

In addition to the assets vested in the executrix, the nett worth of which would appear to be $240,000, the deceased had a superannuation policy, the legal owner of which was Prudential Australian Superannuation Limited, the second defendant. There does not appear to have been any "elected beneficiary" under the policy. The second defendant acknowledges that $64,000 is due under the policy. The evidence at present tends to suggest that only $30,000 to $40,000 net will be involved.

The second defendant has filed a submitting appearance. The plaintiff is not entitled to relief merely because the second defendant has filed a submitting appearance; the Court has to examine the case to see whether such a result is just (Trust Co of Australia Ltd versus Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [(1995) 36
NSWLR 654).] 
Ms Steer, solicitor for the plaintiff, asks for an injunction to prevent the second defendant from dealing with or otherwise determining the Death Benefit
Statement Prudential Assurance Policy No 405.6459. An order was made ex parte on 23 February 1996 to this effect. That injunction was continued on 29
February up to 19 March on which day I extended it until I gave my decision in the matter.

I reserved my decision because Ms Steer was unable to satisfy me at the hearing that there was jurisdiction to make such an order, or if there was, this was a proper case for the jurisdiction to be exercised.

The [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) does not contain any provision permitting the Court to injunct a person in whom the estate's assets are vested from dealing with those assets pending the hearing of an application for relief under that Act. The question as to whether such an order might be made and, if so, in what circumstances, has been considered by this Court on a number of occasions. In respect of applications for an order for provision out of actual, rather than notional estate, the matter was first considered in Rayner versus Schuttler - McLelland, J, 29 January 1985.
The present Chief Judge found that there was power to grant interlocutory relief, but said, "like other applications for an interlocutory injunction, it is necessary to consider whether the plaintiff has established a reasonable prospect of ultimate success in obtaining an order which would affect the property in question. ... The other matter ventilated in argument and discussion during the hearing was whether there was any real threat by the administrators to sell the property in any event. On the evidence I am very doubtful whether any such threat has been established, but it may well be that by further correspondence an assertion of right to sell, for reasons not essential to the administration of the estate, may be made which would sufficiently found injunctive relief." His Honour dismissed the motion with costs without prejudice to a further application should circumstances change.

In Massie versus Laundy - 7 February, 1986, unreported, I held that there was power to grant an injunction against an executor from distributing the estate prior to the hearing of an application under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/). My decision in part rested on the decision of Vaisey, J in Re Simson [[1950] Ch 38] at 42, that it was the paramount duty of an executor to avoid embarrassing the Court by distributing whilst an application under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) was pending.

However, in Deguara versus Mercieca - 23 August 1988, unreported, Powell, J thought that my decision in Massie versus Laundy and that of Zelling, J in Re
Gough which had reached the same result, were unconvincing. The matter came up for decision again before me in Packo versus Packo [(1989) 17 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281989%29%2017%20NSWLR%20316 "View LawCiteRecord" ) I there granted an injunction based upon the inherent jurisdiction to preserve the subject matter of proceedings, or alternatively, on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s23.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).
I cited the decision of the High Court in Tait versus The Queen <case>; [(1962) 108 CLR 620], where the High Court had stayed execution of a capital sentence so that it was able to deal with the defendant's appeal in proper conditions.

Packo versus Packo, as far as I am aware, has never been judicially criticised, and indeed it was the subject of a note by Mr Starke QC in [(1990) 64 ALJ 439], which note appeared to endorse the decision. Mr Starke said at p 440, "an order for an interlocutory injunction to restrain distribution of the assets of an estate is one that the Supreme Court is slow to make unless entirely satisfied that there are no obstacles in the way, such as hardship.
 "However, if the granting of an injunction is justified by the overriding justice of the case, and safeguarding orders can be duly made, the order will be made for injunctive relief. This is particularly so, where in the absence of an injunction there could be irretrievable damage to the statutory rights of the applicants." 
I adhere to the view that I set out in Packo, at least in the situation where one is dealing with actual estate. It seems to me that there is jurisdiction to preserve the subject matter of proceedings before a court and in a proper case the Court will grant an injunction.

In Gough, Zelling, J said at pp 562-3 that, "in general Courts would be very loath to grant injunctions in applications of this kind because the executor has his year in which to get in his estate". However, his Honour thought that in Gough he should grant an injunction because of the attitude of the executor in putting up the real property for sale when there was no particular reason for doing so, and where the inflationary factors would mean that the estate would be depreciated in value by the time the application actually came on for hearing.

At general law, it was very difficult for a beneficiary under an estate to obtain an injunction against an executor against whom it was alleged he or she was committing waste. The authorities are dealt with in Kerr on
Injunctions 6th Ed (Sweet & Maxwell 1927) at p 504. The general rule is stated by the learned author as, "The court will not restrain an executor from parting with the assets unless a case of past or probable misapplication of them has been made out." The author then deals with certain annuity cases including Norman versus Johnson <case>; [(1860) 29 Beav 77]; [54 ER 555.] The learned writer then continues, "The principle upon which these cases proceeded was, that until an annuity is actually due there is no legal title, and the liability is only in contingency. Where, however, the liability in future is certain, the case is different, and the assets may not be parted with." In Norman versus Johnson, Mr Manners had given his daughter
Louisa on the latter's marriage an annuity of [sterling]200.0.0. a year for life secured by a bond of [sterling]3,000.0.0. In due course Mr Manners died and his daughter Anne Johnson became his executrix. Louisa commenced a suit in equity to prevent Anne wasting and misapplying the estate. Romilly, MR made a declaration that the bond was secured on the testator's real estate, but then said, "the annuity never having been in arrear, the Plaintiffs who come merely for their own protection must pay the Defendants' costs." The reporter adds the note "The case is distinguishable from King versus Malcott (reported <case>; [(1852) 9 Hare 692]; [68 ER 691)] where not only nothing was due, but there was no certainty that anything would ever become due." 
However, these cases are even stronger than the present one because under the law of trusts the annuitants were beneficiaries who had the right to approach the Court for general administration. Accordingly their locus standi was not in doubt, merely their right to relief and the question as to who was to pay the costs. In the instant case the plaintiff is not the beneficiary under any trust, all she has is a statutory right. Moreover qua the notional estate as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s28.html) of the [Family Provision Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) makes clear, the Court is not to make an order designating property as notional estate unless the deceased person left no estate or an estate insufficient to allow the making of proper provision. Where there is an actual estate of $240,000 and there are children and other persons to whom the deceased owed obligations to make provision, it is very difficult for an applicant such as the present to show that the notional estate would ever fall into her clutches.

Ms Steer and her colleagues and associates in the firm where she works, seem to have taken the view that the plaintiff had the right to freeze all the assets of the estate including the notional estate until the proceedings could be heard. This is a total misconception. There is great doubt in my mind as to whether any order can be made restraining a stranger to the estate, who holds notional property under the terms of a trust or contract, from making a distribution to other persons who are not parties to the proceedings. That is not a matter I have to decide in the present case and it is best left for when a decision is necessary: I merely record my great doubts about the matter.
However, if there is jurisdiction to make the order then the plaintiff needs to show that there is (a) an arguable case that she will obtain an order and that the actual estate will be insufficient to meet the quantum of her order; and (b) that unless an injunction is given (either against the person who is holding the property in trust or, probably more correctly, the persons to whom it is distributed), the Court's order will be in vain.

Ms Steer cited to me a series of decisions, none of which, with respect, had anything to do with the present point. She cited in particular Tobin v
Executor of Hardy's Estate (1992) DFC [95-125]; Tobin versus Executor of
Hardy's Estate (No 2) (1992) DFC [95-130]; Light versus Anderson (1992) DFC [95-120] and Shields versus Toohey, McLelland, CJ in Eq, 24 November 1995. As
I say, none of these give me any assistance at all on the present point.

I did deal with the point in Wentworth versus Wentworth - 11 June 1992, unreported. I reviewed the authorities and indicated that I would assume that there was jurisdiction to grant a restraining order to prevent notional estate being dissipated pending a hearing, but in the circumstances of that case, it was not appropriate to make such an order.

In the instant case, it does not appear on the material before me at the moment, that with an actual estate of some $240,000 net and other claimants on the testator's bounty, that the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable prospect of being able to attack the notional estate. There is also, at the moment, no evidence as to what the second defendant is going to do with the notional estate. It may be that if the second defendant makes a determination to pass the notional estate to someone with few assets, that the plaintiff's case will be stronger than it is at this present moment.

Accordingly, in my view there is insufficient material on which to base an injunction.

Accordingly, the plaintiff's present motion should be dismissed with the plaintiff to pay the costs of the second defendant. The second defendant and any other person who is affected by the injunction should have leave to move for an enquiry as to damages occasioned by the injunction which the plaintiff undertook to pay when she obtained the injunction. Any such application must be made no later than 14 days after the determination of the final proceedings.
