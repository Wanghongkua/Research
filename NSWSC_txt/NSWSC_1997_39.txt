Application of Vector Capital Ltd [1997] NSWSC 39 (18 February 1997) `APPLICATION OF VECTOR CAPITAL LTD` `4201/96` `TUESDAY 18 FEBRUARY 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is the final hearing of a summons to approve a scheme of arrangement and to confirm a reduction of capital.` ` This case is similar to a number that have passed through the court recently where there has been an international restructuring of corporate enterprises involving people both in Australia and overseas. The method used is a scheme of arrangement under section 411 of the Corporations Law to bind individual shareholders, particularly those who have not actually consented to the restructuring, together with a reduction of capital. The basic idea is for the
Australian company to become a wholly owned subsidiary of a new entity with minimal share capital.` ` On 7 January 1997 Santow J thoroughly examined the commercial aspects of the present scheme and reduction of capital and convened a meeting of the members of the company to consider the scheme of arrangement. He appointed a Ms Alice
Cheng, or failing her, Mr Anthony Lee, to be chair person at the meeting and gave virtually the standard directions to make sure that the meeting was properly advertised.` ` I am satisfied on the evidence now presented that all of his Honour's directions were faithfully carried out. There are only, it seems to me, so far as the scheme is concerned, two possible problems. The first is that Ms Cheng did not take the chair, but Mr Lee did. The reason for this was that Ms Cheng was unable to return to Australia from Hong Kong, not through her own fault but because of factors beyond her control. It seems to me that authorities, such as Re Wilson and Son and the Eastern Counties Navigation and Transport
Co Limited [(1892) 8 TLR 264], mean that if the primary person nominated by the court to chair the meeting does not chair the meeting, some explanation as to why they did not must be provided.
The explanation provided is sufficient in this particular case.` ` The other possible problem is that the order did not fix any particular quorum for the meeting. Three members, present in person or by proxy, constitute a quorum under the Articles of Association and it would seem that only two people were actually present, though one of those had proxies for about five corporations. I agree with ` `Mr Gleeson's submission that even though the same proxy is proxy for more than one person, that proxy is present as the representative of five different people. Accordingly, there was a quorum present.` ` Section 411 provides that for a scheme of arrangement to bind people who did not consent to the arrangement two conditions must be satisfied; (a) a meeting convened in accordance with the order of the court must resolve to agree to the scheme by the prescribed majority; and (b) the scheme must be approved by order of the court. All the court does is approve the scheme. The scheme will not be valid, however, unless the meeting has also resolved to agree to it.` ` Although it has not been the practice in the past to make a declaration as to the proper resolution under section 411(4)(a), it seems to me appropriate that that be done so that a person searching in the Australian Securities
Commission can see that both limbs of section 411(4) have been satisfied.` ` Accordingly, I make a declaration and order that the scheme be approved and
I make orders in accordance with the short minutes marked "A".` ` The other aspect of the matter is the reduction of capital. Resolutions were purportedly passed at an extraordinary general meeting of the company held on February 1997. Resolution 10 is as follows:` `"Resolution 10.` `` `THAT` `` `(a) subject to confirmation by the Supreme Court of New South Wales under section 195 of the Corporations Law;` `` `(b) subject to and conditional upon Resolutions 1 - 7 (inclusive) being passed; and` `` `(c) subject to and conditional on the Directors of the Company resolving to allot and issue:` `` ` (i) 4,661,500 ordinary shares paid up to A$0.40 per share to applicants applying on the application form to be attached to the Company's prospectus dated 29 November 1996 in accordance with resolution 1;` `` ` (ii) 3,700,000 ordinary shares paid up to A$0.40 per share to Omnitech in accordance with resolution 3; and` `` ` (iii) 911,000 ordinary shares paid up to A$0.316 to Peter Au as final payment for the 1995 purchase by the Company of Lik Hang Holdings Limited shares;` `` `in accordance with Article 31.3 of the Company's Articles of Association and with effect from the date a certified copy of this resolution and an office copy of the order of the Court are lodged with the Australian
Securities Commission, the issued share capital of the Company be reduced:` `` `FROM A$5,477,875 share capital and A$4,542,569 share premium divided into ,911,500 fully paid ordinary shares of A$0.25 each;` `` `TO A$925,000 share capital and A$555,000 share premium divided into ,700,000 fully paid ordinary shares of A$0.25 each;` `` `BY` `` `(a) paying off A$4,552,875 share capital and A$1,086,605 share premium by distributing 14,220,7120 Omnitech shares pro rata to Vector shareholders other than Omnitech and cancelling 18,211,500 fully paid ordinary shares in the
Company of A$0.25 each, being all shares in the Company other than those held by Omnitech; and` `` `(b) cancelling A$2,900,964 share premium."` `` ` It will be seen that that is a conditional resolution for the reduction of capital. Conditional resolutions provide some problems when coming to the question of confirmation under section 195 of the Corporations Law. The first problem is whether the Court can confirm something which is not to happen until after the Court makes its order. The second is to comply with section (6) of the Corporations Law.` `` I was troubled with the first point until I read again what Needham J had said in Ramsay Health Care Ltd versus Elkington [(1992) 7 ACSR 73] at 77-78.
His Honour then made it clear that the word "confirm" when used in section 195 means the Court's approval of the decision of the members. So long as the
Court can see as at the date of confirmation that there have been no future events between the date of the meeting and the date the Court is asked to confirm the resolution, and the Court cannot see anything that is left unfulfilled as at the date of the order that is likely to affect the substratum of the members' decision, then the Court can confirm that decision.
Thus, even though there are some mechanical matters still to be attended to after the Court's order, the Court can confirm a conditional resolution to reduce capital.

The other problem was dealt with by L W Street CJ in Eq in Re Castlereagh
Securities Ltd [[1973] 1 NSWLR 624] and by 
M McLelland CJ in Eq in Re Bellara Medical Products Ltd [(1996) 14 ACLC .] 
The latter case at 333 made it clear that section 195(6) means that at the time the Court makes its order confirming the reduction, all conditions precedent must have been satisfied. However, it does not matter that at the time of the resolution there were conditions to be satisfied. See also In re
Castiglione, Erskine & Co Ltd [[1958] 1 WLR 688]; Re Tip-
Europe Ltd [[1988] BCLC 231] and Re Advance Bank Australia Ltd (No 2) [(1997) 15 ACLC 248], 261.

The relevant conditions having now been fulfilled, including the condition that the scheme be approved, which I did fifteen minutes ago, I can now make the orders for reduction, though there are two points I must mention before concluding these reasons.

The first is that Santow J carefully looked at the funding arrangements and was satisfied that the problems which Lockhart J directed his mind to in Re
Hunter Resources Ltd <case>; [(1992) 34 FCR 418] were not a problem in the instant case.

The final matter of concern is that Mr Lee, who presided at the meeting, did not hold any shares. He moved the relevant motion. In my view, he should not have done so for two reasons: first, it is not appropriate an impartial chairman should move motions; and, secondly, more importantly, he was not qualified to do so because he was not a shareholder. If a motion is invalidly moved, in my view, it cannot be passed. However, it is quite clear that what happened at that meeting was in accordance with the wish of the company as a whole, the matter is a technicality and the appropriate validating order must be made under section 1322 of the Corporations Law.
