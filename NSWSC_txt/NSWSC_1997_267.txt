Bonanno versus Lelliot /96 July 1997 
Master Malpass 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division /96 - Bonanno versus Lelliot 
JUDGMENT 
MASTER: These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 3 December 1996. The plaintiff claims damages arising out of personal injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident that took place on 22 March 1992. The accident occurred in Western Australia. The plaintiff alleges a cause of action founded on negligence. 
On 13 December 1996, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion. It seeks an order extending the relevant limitation period pursuant to section 60C of the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/), (the Act). The plaintiff has sworn an affidavit himself. He has been cross-examined. His solicitor (Mr Symons) has sworn an affidavit. The defendant relies on an affidavit sworn by Mr Galvin (a Claims Supervisor employed by the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia ). He has tendered certain medical reports.

The evidence offered in support of the application is parsimonious. The plaintiff was a passenger in a taxi when it was struck by another vehicle.
After the accident, he consulted Dr Barkhouse. He complained of pain in his lower back and of being struck on the head. A diagnosis of ligamentous strain of the cervical and lumbar spine was made.

SGIC was the third party insurer of the motor vehicle which struck the taxi.
In April 1992, the plaintiff notified an employee of SGIC of the accident. He was sent a Notice of Intention to Make Claim Form. After about two weeks, he returned to Sydney. He continued to experience lower back and neck pain. He continued to receive treatment during the period between 1992 and 1996. During this period, he travelled overseas. He experienced an episode of intense pain in the lower back (March/April 1995). He experienced other incidents (including one in Marseille) during that time.

In late 1994, he formed the view that he had a serious back problem. He came to see Mr Symons after speaking to someone at Legal Aid. This was within months of seeing Mr Symons. He gave instructions to Mr Symons in January 1995.
At that time, there were no limitation problems. His solicitor made unsuccessful attempts to resolve the claim on an unlitigated basis.

The affidavit of Mr Symons was sworn on 11 March 1997. It comprises five paragraphs and consists mainly of annexures. In the final paragraph of that affidavit, he said, inter alia:- "I have come to the conclusion that it is in the plaintiff's best interest that formal proceedings be conducted considering the lapse of time which has occurred and the continuing problems that he has been experiencing." 
A Notice of Intention to Make Claim Form dated 2 December 1996 was sent by Mr
Symons to SGIC. It seems that there was no contact between the plaintiff and
SGIC during the period of April 1992 and January 1995.

The material does not seek to directly explain why the plaintiff did not seek legal advice at an earlier time. The contents of correspondence advance the contention that the plaintiff had hoped that his problems would resolve with time. The affidavit material is silent as to his knowledge of the relevant limitation provisions. The plaintiff's oral evidence suggests that he had a lack of knowledge. Mr Symons is silent as to advice (if any) given by him. The material suggests that this may be one of those cases to which the observations made in Morrison versus Judd (Court of Appeal, unreported, 10
October 1995) have application.

Section 60C is in the following terms:- 
C. (1) This section applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury, but does not apply to a cause of action arising under the [Compensation to Relatives Act 1897](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/). 
If an application is made to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of action to which this section applies, the court, after hearing such of the persons likely to be affected by the application as it sees fit, may, if it decides that it is just and reasonable to do so, order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended for such periods, not exceeding 5 years, as it determines. 
In exercising the powers conferred by section 60C, the Act requires the
Court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the matters enumerated in section 60E). The Court must first decide that it is just and reasonable to make an order. Once that decision has been made, the
Court is then empowered to make an order. It is a discretionary power. The onus rests with the plaintiff to show an entitlement for relief (Brisbane
South Regional Health Authority versus Taylor <case>; [(1996) 70 ALJR 866] and BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Limited versus Giudice (& Ors) (Court of Appeal, unreported, 7 March 1997)). The observations made in
Taylor are of general application to provisions enabling an extension of a limitation period.

The hearing took place (finally) on 10 June 1997. There had been an earlier misadventure. I shall now refer to the position between the parties as it stood at the conclusion of the hearing. At that time, only oral submissions had been made.

There was dispute between the parties as to whether or not the Act applied to the circumstances of this case. The problems have arisen because the claim is made in respect of a motor vehicle accident that took place in Western
Australia and the plaintiff has chosen to prosecute the claim in New South
Wales. I gained the impression that limited research had been made in respect of the question of the applicable law. The plaintiff had taken the view that the claim was not governed by provisions of the Motor Accidents Act, 1988 (the MA Act). The defendant had adopted the contrary view.

Section 52(5) of the MA Act provides that the Act does not apply to or in respect of proceedings in respect of a claim. It was common ground that an application for leave made pursuant to section 52(4) of the MA Act could not presently succeed. There are procedural requirements (such as the giving of notice of a claim) which have not been met.

Largely, the oral argument that did take place was at best superficial and relatively unhelpful. My attention was not drawn to either the Choice of Law (Limitation [Periods)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/pa100/), 1993 or to the case law that had preceded its enactment. Prior to its enactment, what had been said in McKain versus R W Miller & Co (SA) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 1] had application. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/pa100/s5.html) provides as follows:-
If the substantive law of a place, being another State, a Territory or New
Zealand, is to govern a claim before a court of the State, a limitation law of that place is to be regarded as part of that substantive law and applied accordingly by the court.

This section was clearly intended to reverse the effect of part of the decision in McKain. In Gardner versus Wallace <case>; [(1995) 70 ALJR 113], Dawson J said of the Victorian equivalent of this provision (which is in similar terms) that the effect of it is not entirely clear and that its wording may be based upon a misconception of what had been decided in
McKain.

Following the reserving of judgment, Counsel for the plaintiff forwarded written submissions to my chambers. These submissions contained, inter alia, the following:- "Subsequent to the conclusion of the hearing in this matter at about 12 noon on 10 June 1997, I came across the [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/). A copy of which is annexed hereto.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/s4.html) provides that the Legislation applies to this injury.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/s5.html) provides that if, as is the case in this matter ultimately at trial, the substantive law of a place, being another State ... is to govern a claim before a Court of the State, the limitation law of that place is to be regarded as part of that substantive law and applied accordingly by the Court.

The Plaintiff would submit that the Western Australia [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consolact/la1935133/) [Section (1)(c)(vi)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consolact/la1935133/s38.html) provides for a six year limitation period. By reason of [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consolact/la1935133/s5.html) of [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/) 
Section 38(1)(c)(vi) of the Western Australian Legislation is to be treated as substantive.

The choice of applicable Law rules were considered by the High Court, Brennan,
Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Stevens versus Head <case>; [176 CLR 433] at to 457, such that the forum will apply the substantive law of the place of the tort.

Accordingly, [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/s5.html) of the [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/) having determined that the provisions of Section 38(1)(c)(vi) are substantive, this
Court would apply the six year limitation period.

This submission, if upheld, would render the Notice of Motion filed by the
Plaintiff seeking an extension pursuant to [Section
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60c.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) , the
Plaintiff's Motion redundant.

I have forwarded a copy of these additional submissions to Mr J Morris,
Defendant's Counsel." 
These submissions produced written submissions by way of response from Counsel for the defendant. The submissions were as follows:- "1. These submissions are prepared in response to the written submissions dated 10 June 1997 filed on behalf of the Plaintiff.
It is submitted on behalf of the Defendants that the application of the [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/) to the present case is misconceived. See: Samulski versus Swinbourn [(1996) ATPR -389](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%20ATPR%2081%2d389 "View LawCiteRecord" ) (copy enclosed); Thompson versus Hill [22 MVR 289]; Gardner versus Wallace <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 95.]
Indeed, if a case is justiciable in the forum in which it is brought, the law to be applied, whether considered substantive or procedural, is the law of the forum (Samulski versus Swinbourn at pp 63,413-63,414; Thompson versus Hill;
Gardner versus Wallace)
Accordingly, it is incorrect for the Plaintiff to submit that the
Limitations Act 1935 (WA) applies to the current proceedings. As the proceedings have been brought in New South Wales, the law of that State applies.
It is submitted that whether or not the appropriate limitation period is imposed by the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) or the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) , the limitation period has expired and the Plaintiff must seek leave prior to proceeding.
In any event, it is submitted that the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) is the appropriate Act under which the Plaintiff must seek leave. That Act is not limited to claims for accidents only in New South Wales, but for claims arising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle, simpliciter. Further, if a claim is to be brought in New South Wales for damages arising out of the use of a motor vehicle in another State, the law of the forum applies, that being the provisions of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) (see
Samulski versus Swinbourn and [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/), [ss.2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s2a.html), [2B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s2b.html) and [40](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s40.html)).
Accordingly, it is submitted: contrary to the Plaintiff's written submissions, the present Notice of
Motion filed by the Plaintiff is not redundant; and the Plaintiff should have sought to move the Court pursuant to the [Motor
Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/); and even if it were brought under the Limitations Act 1969 on the evidence before the Master the application should fail.
 (8). Accordingly, the Plaintiff's Motion should be dismissed." 
For present purposes, the relevant question is whether or not section 60C has application in this case. When regard is had to the material placed before the
Court and the submissions made by Counsel, I am not persuaded that it has application in this case. In the light of this finding, the application must fail. It is unnecessary for me to form any view on other submissions as to the relevant limitation provisions. I would be loathe to deal with that question in the absence of full argument.

In any event, it seems to me that the present application is doomed to failure for another reason. The power to order an extension of a limitation period is discretionary. The plaintiff bears the onus of satisfying the Court that the discretion should be exercised in his or her favour. In my view, on the material placed before the Court in this application, the plaintiff would not discharge that onus. I shall now turn to the discretionary considerations that arose in this case.

Generally speaking, the principal matters agitated may be referred to as matters of delay, lack of satisfactory explanation for delay and prejudice.

There has been significant delay. The material offered to explain delay falls well short of what may be regarded as being sufficient. Delay of itself gives rise to a general presumption of prejudice (see Taylor at p 873). There is no evidence of actual prejudice. However, the evidence demonstrates the real possibility of significant prejudice.

In Taylor at p 873, McHugh J said:- "The general rule that actions must be commenced within the limitation period should therefore prevail once the defendant has proved the fact or the real possibility of significant prejudice." 
There was no reason for the insurer to investigate the claim, at least prior to about 1995/1996. The evidence is silent as to whether there was any police investigation. As the plaintiff alleges that he was the passenger in the vehicle, it may be that liability will not be a real issue. There may have been investigation in respect of another claim. There was no reason for the insurer to have the plaintiff medically examined prior to about 1995/1996. It is possible that the credibility of the plaintiff may be of importance in assessing his problems. The medical picture is complicated by the presence of degenerative changes and the 1995 episodes. In the circumstances of this case, it seems to me that the material demonstrates the real possibility of significant prejudice.

There is little in the material to give any guidance as to the potential quantum of the claim. However, if an order is made, the plaintiff requests that the proceedings be remitted to the District Court. If an order is not made, the plaintiff will be barred from prosecuting the claim. If an order is made, the defendant will lose the benefit of the limitation defence.

It may be that there was other material available to the plaintiff and helpful to his case which was not put before the Court in this application. If that is so, it can always be used in any other application that the plaintiff may be advised to bring.

I dismiss the Notice of Motion. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the
Notice of Motion. The exhibits may be returned.
