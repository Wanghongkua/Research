REGINA versus BRENDA LEE HAINES /98 June 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: Mr. Sri, I am not prepared to grant bail in this case. In particular, I am satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk, in the light of the allegations of the commission of offences whilst on bail, and bearing in mind the nature of the offences. In particular, I consider the stealing from dwelling houses accompanied by a loaded syringe poses an unacceptable risk to the community. 
I do, however, say this. Whilst this is a refusal of bail by the Supreme Court and attached to that are the usual consequences under the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/), nonetheless, since that matter of institutional and rehabilitative care to enable something appropriate to be done during the interim has not been canvassed, it would not be inappropriate, in my view, for a further application to be made in the event that some reasonable proposal of that nature were to be put forward, although it would be a matter for some other judge to decide whether or not the application should be entertained on that basis.

Otherwise, the application is refused.
