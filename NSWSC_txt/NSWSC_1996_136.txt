Priestley JA, Handley JA, Cole JA 
CATCHWORDS: MOTOR ACCIDENTS - [MOTOR ACCIDENTS ACT 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) S 77 - WHETHER PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY MUST BE CONNECTED TO PHYSICAL INJURY.

EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Upheld 
The appellant was the conductor of the Indian Pacific train on 4 December 1991 when it collided with a truck, killing the driver. Pursuant to [s 54](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s54.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/), he brought proceedings against the driver's compulsory third party insurer for "nervous shock/post-traumatic stress disorders". The trial judge held that the case was outside <case> and the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action. It was common ground that the plaintiff had not suffered any physical injury by impact. Section 77 relevantly provides that damages for psychological or psychiatric injury are only to be awarded to: (a) persons who suffered "injury" and (i) were in a vehicle involved in the accident or (ii) at the scene of the accident. The trial judge held that <case> (a) required that the psychological or psychiatric injury be attached to or be a consequence of physical injury.

HELD - upholding the appeal: (1) Section 77 does not confer a cause of action but confines common law and statutory causes of action for psychological injury within the limits of the section; (2) The distinction between ordinary physical injury and psychological or psychiatric injury in any event is illusory: Coyle versus John Watson Ltd [[1915] AC 1] applied; (3) The statement of claim therefore disclosed a cause of action.
 
JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Handley JA.
 
HANDLEY JA: The appellant, the plaintiff in the proceedings below, was the conductor on the Indian Pacific train on 4 December 1991 when it collided with a truck at a level crossing near Parkes. The driver of the truck, a complete stranger to the appellant, was killed in the accident. The appellant brought proceedings in the District Court against the driver's compulsory third party insurer pursuant to [s 54](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s54.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) alleging that as a result of the driver's negligence and the accident he suffered "nervous shock/post-traumatic stress disorders".

When the action came on for hearing before his Honour Judge Christie QC the defendant asserted that the case was outside <case> of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) and therefore the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action. The trial judge entertained this objection as a preliminary point, heard argument, and gave judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff has appealed.

The trial judge heard no evidence and must therefore have assumed, for the purposes of the preliminary point, that the facts alleged in the statement of claim were true. This Court must necessarily adopt the same course and this was accepted by counsel for both parties. The statement of claim does not disclose in what manner it is alleged that the plaintiff came to suffer nervous shock or a post-traumatic stress disorder, there is no allegation as to where the plaintiff was on the train at the time, what he then saw or heard, and what, if anything, he did after the accident which might have caused him to suffer the injuries alleged. The trial judge made no finding on any of these questions but decided the case on a pure question of law as on a demurrer under the common law system of pleading. We were however informed without objection that the plaintiff did not allege that he had sustained any physical impact in the accident.

Section 77 provides: "No damages for psychological or psychiatric injury will be awarded in respect of a motor accident except in favour of - a person who suffered injury in the accident and who - was the driver of or a passenger in or on a vehicle involved in the accident; or was, when the accident occurred, present at the scene of the accident; or a parent, spouse, brother, sister or child of the injured person or deceased person who, as a consequence of the injury to the injured person or the death of the deceased person, has suffered a demonstrable psychological or psychiatric injury and not merely a normal emotional or cultural grief reaction".

The collision between the train and the truck was a motor accident within the meaning of the definition of that expression in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (1) because of the involvement of the truck. It may also have been a motor accident because of the involvement of the train (see definition of "Motor
Vehicle"), but there is no need to express a concluded view on this question.
"Injury" is defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (1) as meaning: "`Injury' means personal or bodily injury, and includes: 
Pre-natal injury; and ...

Psychological or psychiatric injury; and 
Damage to artificial members, eyes or teeth, crutches or other aids or spectacle glasses".

The definitions in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (1) are expressed to apply "in this Act" and under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s6.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) they apply unless a contrary intention is disclosed. There is a presumption in favour of applying the statutory definition (see Police versus Thompson (1966)
NZLR 813 CA).

The trial Judge said: "It seems to me that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s77.html) (a) is capable of being read ... in a way that the only persons who can claim psychological or psychiatric injuries are persons who have suffered injury in the accident and who also fulfil the requirements of both sub section (i) and/or sub section (ii) that is that their psychological or psychiatric injury must be attached to and/or form part of and/or be a possible sequelae of an injury suffered in the accident ... I am of the view that the defendant's initial submission that the plaintiff is, in the absence of any physical injury, debarred from seeking damages against the defendant is a correct submission".

Mr Hislop QC, who appeared for the appellant, submitted that "injury" in the first line of para (a) had its defined meaning and therefore included a psychological or psychiatric injury. On this basis the plaintiff qualified either because he was a passenger in a vehicle "involved in the accident" or because he was, when the accident occurred, present at the scene of the accident. The factual bases of these allegations have not been investigated and the Court is only concerned with whether a cause of action is disclosed.

Mr Ellicott QC who appeared for the respondent supported the Judge's reasoning and submitted that "injury" in its context in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s77.html) (a) meant physical injury of the ordinary kind. In his submission the purpose of the section was to limit claims for nervous shock to those persons who suffered physical injuries of the ordinary kind, and to exclude claims for mere nervous shock. He sought to support these submissions by reference to the current state of the common law in relation to liability for nervous shock as expounded in Jaensch versus Coffey <case>; <case>; [(1992) 1 AC 310.] These submissions on the position at common law were not helpful, because [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s77.html) does not purport to confer any cause of action. It allows causes of action for psychological injury at common law, or under the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1944404/) within the limits imposed by the section and excludes other causes of action for such injury. The section confers no rights. Its operation is wholly negative.

The only question in this appeal is the construction of <case>. The respondent's argument that injury in para (a) means ordinary physical injury would make sub para (ii) redundant. It is almost impossible to conceive of circumstances in which a person could suffer an ordinary physical injury "in the accident" without at least being present at the scene when the accident occurred. In these circumstances the existence of sub para (ii) strongly suggests that injury does not have the limited meaning contended for by the respondent.

In any event the distinction between ordinary physical injury and psychological or psychiatric injury is illusory. As long ago as 1914 Lord Shaw said in Coyle versus John Watson Limited [[1915] AC 1] at 14: "On principle, the distinction between cases of physical impact or lesion being necessary as a ground of liability for damage caused seems to have nothing in its favour - always on the footing that the causal connection between the injury and the occurrence is established. If compensation is to be recovered ... in respect of an occurrence which has caused dislocation of a limb, on what principle can it be denied if the same occurrence has caused unhinging of the mind? The personal injury in the latter case may be infinitely graver than in the former, and to what avail - in the incidence of justice, or the principle of law - is it to say that there is a distinction between things physical and mental? This is the broadest difference of all, and it carries with it no principle of legal distinction. Indeed it may be suggested that the proposition that injury so produced to the mind is unaccompanied by physical affection or change might itself be met by modern physiology or pathology with instant challenge". (emphasis supplied) 
This view was echoed in Bourhill versus Young <case>; [[1943] AC ] at 103 by
Lord Macmillan who said: "The distinction between mental shock and bodily injury was never a scientific one, for mental shock is presumably in all cases the result of, or at least accompanied by, some physical disturbance in the sufferer's system. And the mental shock may have consequences more serious than those resulting from physical impact".

Later again in R versus Miller [1954] 2 QB 282 at 292, Lynskey J held that a hysterical and nervous condition could constitute actual bodily harm for the purposes of the crime of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. As the Judge said: "There was a time when shock was not regarded as bodily hurt, but the day has gone when that could be said".

See also Mount Isa Mines Ltd versus Pusey <case>; [(1970) 125 CLR 383] at 395, 403 and 415. Accordingly, the distinction between mental and physical injury which was fundamental to the construction accepted by the trial judge has long been regarded as illusory or non-existent.
Moreover the distinction finds no support in the definition of injury which refers to "personal and bodily injury" which, on the authorities referred to, would cover cases of psychological or psychiatric injury in any event. It also finds no support in the text of <case> itself, and the existence of para (a) is an indication to the contrary.

It was suggested that the appellant's construction would leave para (a) without any effective operation, but this is not the case. Persons within para having close ties to a victim can claim for psychological or psychiatric injury whether involved in or present at the accident or not. However others cannot claim for nervous shock inflicted remotely or indirectly. Persons in this class can only claim if they were involved in the accident, or were present at the scene "when the accident occurred".

In my judgment therefore the appellant's statement of claim disclosed a cause of action which was not excluded by <case>. The following orders should be made: 
Appeal allowed; 
Set aside the judgment for the defendant entered in the District Court; 
Remit the proceedings to the District Court for trial; 
The respondent to pay the appellant's costs of the first trial and of this appeal, but to have a Certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act in respect of the costs of the appeal if qualified.
 
COLE JA: I agree with Handley JA.
