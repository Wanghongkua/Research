JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
McCLELLAN CJ at CL 
WEDNEDAY 26 SEPTEMBER 2007 /2007 ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES versus WINTERS 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: The Attorney-General for the State of NSW applies for an order pursuant to [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s17.html) of the [Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/) that the defendant, Christopher Paul Winters, be detained in a correctional centre for a period of five years. In the alternative the Attorney General seeks an order pursuant to [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s17.html) of the Act that the defendant be subject to extended supervision for a period of five years. The summons in which relief was claimed sought the imposition of various conditions in the event of an order being made pursuant to [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s17.html)
Those proposed conditions have been modified during the course of the hearing.
 On 13 June 2007 Bell J made orders pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s16.html) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s21.html) for the interim detention of the defendant. Pursuant to [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s15.html) her Honour also directed that two qualified psychiatrists be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant. This was done and
Dr O'Dea and Dr Allnutt were appointed. They have provided written reports and given oral evidence during the course of the proceedings.
 On 14 September 2007 I made orders providing for the continuing detention of
Mr Winters. Those orders were as follows: . I order that Christopher Paul Winters be detained in a correctional centre for one year from today.
 . Pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s21.html) of the act, I issue a warrant for the committal of Christopher Paul Winters to a correctional centre for the duration of the continuing detention order in order 1 above.
 As well as making those orders on 14 September 2007 I granted leave to Mr
Winters to file a motion seeking a stay of the proceedings. I ordered that that motion be dismissed. I now publish my reasons for the orders which I have made.

The defendant and his offences Mr Winters was born on 27 May 1966 and is 41 years old. During his childhood he lived with his family in Cootamundra. He was subject to both physical and sexual abuse as a child. In around 1996 he moved to Wagga Wagga where he was a student.

Sentenced to overall sentence of imprisonment for 9 years, commencing on 18
June 1998, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months expiring on 17
Sept 03  The 13 sex offences against children, over the period between January 1997 and June 1998, which led to Mr Winters' imprisonment involved 9 male victims aged between 8 and 15 years old. By reason of the fact that Mr Winters has been sentenced to imprisonment following his conviction for "serious sex offences" within the meaning of the Act, he is a "sex offender" within the meaning of <case> of the Act and is amenable to an application for an order under it.
 The defendant was sentenced by Payne DCJ on 18 March 1999. Her Honour gave an account of the offences in the following terms: "Count 1, between 26 April 1998 and 10 June 1998 the complainant in this matter, ... nine years old, visited the home of the prisoner at 17 Dennis
Crescent, Wagga Wagga. Whilst in the house the complainant climbed into the roof cavity to retrieve a tennis ball. As he did this, the prisoner pulled the complainant's pants down and squeezed his penis.

Count 2, also between 26 April 1998 and 10 June 1998, the complainant ...
again visited the prisoner at his house. On this occasion the prisoner gave the complainant cigarettes and magazines picturing naked women.

The prisoner then sucked. the complainant's penis.

On four other occasions during this period of time the prisoner indecently assaulted and committed acts of indecency upon this complainant. The prisoner allowed the complainant to play on his computer in return for taking his lower clothing off, fondled the complainant's penis and showed the complainant his own penis.

Count 3, between 1 February 1998 and 18 June 1998, the complainant in this matter, ... aged ten years, visited the prisoner at his home. The prisoner asked the complainant to suck his penis but the complainant refused. The prisoner then sucked the complainant's penis whilst the complainant was playing on the computer, causing it to become erect.

Count 4, also between 1 February 1998 and 18 June 1998, the complainant ... visited the prisoner at his home. The complainant was playing on the prisoner's computer when the prisoner said, 'I've got a surprise in my pocket.' The complainant put his hand into the prisoner's jeans pocket and found there was a hole in the bottom of the pocket. The prisoner was not wearing underwear and the complainant's hand touched the prisoner's penis.

During the same period, the prisoner on two other occasions sucked the complainant's penis whilst he was, playing on the computer at the prisoner's home.

Count 5, between 1 January 1997 and 31 January 1997, the complainant in this matter, ... nine years of age, visited the prisoner at his home. The complainant was watching television with the prisoner when the prisoner lay down on his back. The prisoner then pulled the complainant on top of him so he was lying face to face and then rubbed the complainant's lower body up and down on his genital area. The prisoner and the complainant were both clothed at the time.

Count 6, between 1 April 1997 and 10 April 1998, the complainant in this matter, ... eight years of age, visited the prisoner at his home. The prisoner pulled down the complainant's lower clothing exposing the complainant's genitals.

The same thing happened a number of times whilst the complainant was visiting the prisoner over this period of time.

Count 7, on 13 June 1998 the complainant in this matter, ... nine years of age, visited the prisoner at his home with some friends. The prisoner told the complainant and his friends to climb into the roof cavity through the manhole and watch the prisoner whilst he showered. The complainant did this, watching the prisoner masturbating in the shower through a hole in the ceiling over the shower recess.

Count 8, between 1 January 1997 and 18 June 1998 this complainant, ... was at the prisoner's home when the prisoner 'dacked him'. This involved the prisoner pulling the complainant's lower clothing down and exposing his genitals.

During the same period of time there were other occasions when the prisoner pulled the complainant's lower clothing down. The prisoner also took his own clothes off and "jumped all over us and lays on us, and that".

Count 9, between 1 September 1997 and 31 December 1997 the complainant in this matter, ... thirteen years of age, visited the prisoner's home. The complainant was in the lounge room playing on the prisoner's computer when the prisoner came into the room, naked from the waist down with his penis in full view. The prisoner walked up to the complainant and said, 'Suck my dick, suck my dick.' The complainant declined and the prisoner then went and put some pants on.

On two other occasions during this period the prisoner asked this complainant to suck his penis and once fondled the complainant's penis through his clothing.

Count 10, between 1 September 1997 and 31 December 1997, the complainant in this matter, ... eleven years of age, visited the home of the prisoner. The complainant was playing on the prisoner's computer when the prisoner exposed his penis and said to the complainant, 'Suck on this.' The complainant ignored the prisoner and did not do as he was asked.

On one other occasion during this period whilst the complainant was visiting the prisoner's home, the prisoner exposed his penis and again asked the complainant to suck it. Again the complainant refused.

Count 11, between 1 January 1998 and 30 April 1998, the complainant in this matter, ... nine years of age, visited the prisoner's home. The prisoner 'dacked' the complainant, pulling down his lower clothing and squeezed the complainant's penis.

Count 12, also between 1 January 1998 and 30 April 1998 the same complainant, ... was at the prisoner's home when the prisoner tied the complainant to a bed in a spare bedroom with rope. Whilst the complainant was tied on his back to the bed, the prisoner pulled the complainant's lower clothing down and poked his penis with his hand. The prisoner also sucked the complainant's penis whilst he was tied up.

Count 13, between 1 April 1998 and 30 April 1998, the complainant in this matter, ... nine years of age, visited the prisoner at his home. The complainant was playing on the prisoner's computer when the prisoner pulled the complainant's lower clothing down and then sucked his penis.

On other occasions the prisoner 'dacked' the complainant, pulling his clothing down, exposing his genitals. The prisoner also on one occasion tied this complainant to a bed naked and left him there. The complainant was eventually able to free himself and escaped from the house through the roof." Her Honour described the offences as serious, the most serious being counts and 13. Her Honour found there was no suggestion of force in relation to any of the counts in the indictment. However, the Crown challenged this finding in these proceedings having regard to the fact that one complainant was tied up.
Her Honour also found that none of the offences involved a breach of trust.
The defendant took advantage of the vulnerability of young boys and gained their interest and attendance at his house by allowing them to use his computer and on an occasion by giving a boy cigarettes.
 The defendant admitted most of his serious criminal acts although he did not accept all of the allegations. The Crown conceded that although he was reticent in an earlier interview when later interviewed he gave a frank account of various matters.
 When the offences were committed the defendant was aged between 30 and 32.
He was taken into custody on 18 June 1998. The sentencing judge found that his prior record is not one which disentitled him to some leniency. He had never previously been ordered to serve a community service order or a sentence of periodic detention or full time custody. Until the offences for which he had been sentenced his record was free of any entry since September 1990.
 Her Honour determined that there were special circumstances in the defendant's case. Those circumstances required a longer than usual additional term. The special circumstances which the sentencing judge identified were that this was the defendant's first full-time custodial sentence, the nature of the offences and the need for on-going counselling and rehabilitation to assist him to reintegrate back into the community. This need was greater because of the mental disability which it was identified affected the defendant. As it happens her Honour's intention that there be a supervised re- entry into the community has been entirely lost.

The legislative regime The objects of the Act are provided in <case> which states: "The objects of this Act are to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as: to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders." A "serious sex offence" is defined in <case> of the Act and means any one of the following: "(a) an offence under Division 10 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/index.html#p3) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), where: in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for seven years or more, and in the case of an offence against an adult, the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation (within the meaning of the provision under which the offence arises), an offence under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s38.html), [111](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s111.html), [112](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s112.html) or [113](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s113.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) that has been committed with intent to commit an offence under Division 10 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/index.html#p3) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), where the offence intended to be committed is punishable by imprisonment for seven years or more, and includes: an offence committed elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if committed in New South Wales, would be a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act, and any other offence that, at the time it was committed, was a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act." The Act provides that the court may make an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order. Section 17 of the Act provides: Determination of application for continuing detention order 
The Supreme Court may determine an application for a continuing detention order: by making an extended supervision order, or by making a continuing detention order, or by dismissing the application.

An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme
Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the
Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.

In determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant: the safety of the community, the reports received from the psychiatrists appointed under section 15 (4) to conduct psychiatric examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination, the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment, the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs, the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order, the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the [Child Protection (Offenders
Registration) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpra2000403/) or the [Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/), the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature.
 [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/index.html#p2) applies to an extended supervision order made under this section in the same way as it applies to an extended supervision order made under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/s9.html)" Both an extended supervision order and a continuing detention order may be made for a period not exceeding five years. Further orders may be made which would extend the effective period of supervision or detention beyond five years [(s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/s10.html) and [s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/s18.html) The court may at any time vary or revoke an order [(s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/s13.html) and [s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/s19.html) A person who is released under an extended supervision order and fails to comply with the requirements of the order is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for a maximum of two years [(s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cppoa2004457/s12.html)
Further orders may be made in relation to that person which would have the effect of continuing their detention or release under supervision at the completion of the sentence imposed for any breach.

The nature of the legislation and some problems When the legislation was introduced into the Parliament the Minister identified the problem which the Bill was intended to address in these terms: "One particular concern that is dealt with by this scheme relates to a handful of high-risk, hard-core offenders who have not made any attempt to rehabilitate whilst in prison. These offenders make up a very small percentage of the prison population, yet their behaviour poses a very real threat to the public. These concerns are compounded where the offender never qualifies for parole and is released at the end of their sentence totally unsupervised. The bill addresses this problem by allowing this small group of high-risk offenders to be placed on extended supervision, or, in only the very worst cases, kept in custody. The Department of Corrective Services has advised that only a small number of offenders would fall into this very high-risk category." Later the Minister said: "Clauses 8 and 16 enable the Supreme Court to make interim supervision or detention orders so that an offender can be kept under supervision or in detention pending determination of an application. This power is important in cases where it appears that the offender's period of custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined. It allows the offender to be detained for up to 28 days, but upon renewal of the order the total period for which an offender can be kept under interim supervision is three months.
This limit will ensure that people are not held on rolling orders, and will encourage expeditious determination of these matters. Clause 9 provides that the Supreme Court may make an extended supervision order only if it is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. The test for making a continuing detention order is contained in clause 17. Before making a continuing detention order the Supreme Court must decide that a supervision order would not be sufficient to deal with the risk of a prisoner reoffending. It may make a continuing detention order only if it is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept in custody." With respect to the matters listed for consideration in clauses 9(3) and (4) the Minister said: "Clauses 9(3) and 17(4) contain a non-exhaustive list of matters the court must consider before making an order, including reports from psychiatrists and the results of any assessment prepared in relation to determining the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence. The indicia are meant to guide the court in distinguishing the small number of high-risk offenders who have not made any attempt to rehabilitate whilst in prison. Clauses 10 and 18 provide that the maximum term for either order is five years, but nothing prevents the Attorney General from making further applications so long as the principal test continues to be satisfied. Clause 7 specifies the kind of conditions that can be imposed on a supervision order, which are similar to those that a person on parole may be placed on. Clause 12 makes it an offence punishable by a fine of 100 penalty units or imprisoned for two years, or both, for a person to fail to comply with the requirements of a supervision order." The Minister recognised that after an order has been made the circumstances of an offender may change. He said that, if that occurred clauses 13 and 19 provide a power in this Court to deal with any change in circumstances.
Although the Act as legislated contains the acknowledged power to vary or revoke a supervision or detention order in the event that a supervision order is breached or proves impossible to implement it contains no power to require the offender to be returned to custody. Revocation of a supervision order would have the consequence that the person remains at large without supervision or an obligation to comply with any conditions. Given, as this case demonstrates, that there may be conditions which the court imposes which later turn out to be incapable of being complied with by the offender, for example, an identified place of residence or program of continuing treatment, it may be that it is in the interests of the offender and the community that the person be returned to custody. As I understand the legislation this can only presently occur in relation to an offender who has been released under a supervision order if that person fails to comply with the requirements of the order in circumstances where an offence against <case> of the Act is committed.
This seems to me to be a crude and potentially impractical arrangement. There may be many circumstances where the requirements of an order cannot be complied with although the offender may not be guilty of an offence. It may be that although required to take anti-libidinal medication the side effects are such that the physical or psychological health of the offender is endangered and the prescribing doctor can no longer provide the treatment. It does not seem appropriate that the only mechanism to control this situation is to identify a breach of <case> or, more significantly await the commission of a further offence before considering whether the offender should be returned to custody.
 There are other issues. The Minister indicated in the Parliament that the concern of the legislation was the "handful of high-risk, hard-core offenders who have not made any attempt to rehabilitate whist in prison." The concerns were said to be compounded "where the offender never qualifies for parole and is released at the end of their sentence totally unsupervised." This problem was said to be addressed "by allowing this small group of high-risk offenders to be placed on extended supervision, or, in only the very worst cases, kept in custody." There will be cases, of which Mr Winters on past experience may be one, where prison based treatment has not been possible or cannot be completed. Mr
Winters was removed from treatment when he attempted suicide. Where a person has not been treated, but is contemplated as suitable for release under supervision, counselling will almost certainly be a condition of the release.
Ongoing counselling is provided by the State when treated prisoners are released to parole. The evidence before me also indicates that it has been provided to untreated prisoners after release, but who were released before the legislation came into force. If, as was suggested in this case, such counselling is not to be offered by the State or funded by government the consequence may be that few, if any, untreated high risk offenders could ever be released under a supervision order. This would be an inhumane consequence of legislation intended for the rehabilitation of the offender and the safety of the community. Similar problems have been identified and commented on in
Western Australia: see Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia v Williams  <case> esp at [53] and [55].

The test under <case> and <case> of the Act The proper construction of the test provided by <case> and (3) has been considered on previous occasions and was debated in these proceedings. Neither party accepted that Bell J in Attorney General for the State of New South
Wales versus Tillman  <case> identified the correct test.
 Both <case> and <case> provide that a relevant order may be made "if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence." In Attorney-
General for the State of New South Wales versus Gallagher [[2006] NSWSC ] I said at [34]: "The meaning of those words has not been fully argued on this application.
However, for the present purposes I accept that before an order can be made I must be satisfied of the likelihood that the defendant will reoffend to a high degree of probability. It presently seems to me that the act imposes a standard of proof higher than the ordinary civil standard but less than the criminal standard beyond reasonable doubt. The caution that an order can only be made "if and only if" the Court is relevantly satisfied emphasises the care with which the Court must approach the question of whether to make orders imposing continuing restrictions, in whatever form, on a person's liberty. One potential difficulty with the subsection is the conjunction of that requirement ie that the Court be satisfied to a "high degree of probability", with the question of whether the offender is "likely to commit a further serious sex offence." The word "likely" presently appears to me to be used in its ordinary meaning which, as the High Court pointed out in Boughey versus The
Queen (1986) 161 CLR at 10 conveys the notion of "substantial - a real and not remote - chance regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 percent": see also R versus SLD <case>; [(2003) 58 NSWLR 589] at 32; Teremoana [(1990) 49 A Crim R 207] at ; Dowling versus Dalgety Australia Limited [(1992) 34 FCR 109] at 136." After my decision in Gallagher the Court of Appeal in Victoria considered the relevant provisions of the Serious Sex Offenders Monitoring Act 2005 in TSL versus The Secretary to the Department of Justice [2006] VSCA. Under s 11 of the Victorian Act the court may only make an extended supervision order "if it is satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that the offender is likely to commit a relevant offence." Callaway AP noted that the Legislature had provided a test of considerable precision. Instead of providing that an order could be made in circumstances where the court was satisfied that a person was a serious danger to the community the Act provided that the court had to be satisfied that the offender "is likely to commit a relevant offence." The Court held that the test in Boughey <case>; [(2006) 14 VR 109]; [(2006) 166 A Crim R 69] that likely meant a "substantial - a "real and not remote" - chance" adopted by Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ placed the threshold too low. Callaway AP concluded that: "The expression "to a high degree of probability" was included to show that, in this context, "likely" connotes a high degree of probability. On this second reading of the italicised words, the court must be satisfied that there is a high degree of probability that the offender will commit a relevant offence." (at 113 [9]) In Tillman Bell J considered my tentative view together with the views of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in TSL. Her Honour was not persuaded to follow the Victorian decision and, leaving aside matters of comity, I would not favour the construction adopted in TSL. Although the standard of proof requires a high degree of probability this does not inform that which must be proved. Requiring proof to a high degree of probability that someone actually did a particular act is different from requiring proof to a high degree of probability that it is possible that the person did that act. Her Honour was of the view that likely meant "probable" as distinct from "possible." Although she did not state whether she accepted that it meant "more probable than not,"
I infer that this was the meaning which her Honour accepted to be appropriate.
 In the present case the Attorney General originally accepted the approach favoured by Bell J in Tillman. Furthermore, the Attorney initially accepted that her Honour had understood the expression to mean "more probable than not." However, this submission was later withdrawn and the Attorney General submitted that "likely" meant "could well happen." On behalf of Mr Winters it was submitted that, having regard to the context, the section requires that the relevant fact must be established to a high degree of probability. It was submitted that "likely" should be qualified by the words "if and only if" and "high degree of probability." Accordingly, it was submitted that a proper interpretation of the test requires the court to be satisfied that the prospect of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence is at a higher degree than "more probable than not" or significantly higher than "above 50%" although less than beyond reasonable doubt.
 I indicated in Gallagher that there had not been full argument with respect to these issues. That argument has now occurred. As the High Court pointed out in Boughey the meaning to be given to the word "likely" may vary depending on its context. The present Act operates to potentially constrain the liberty of an offender who has completed the entire sentence for the offence for which he or she was convicted. The Parliament was of the view that this may be necessary "to ensure the safety and protection of the community" and "facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders." Both the Macquarie Dictionary and the Shorter Oxford Dictionary treat "likely" and "probable" as synonymous. However, this may not be entirely helpful. Given the range of possible meanings of "probable", "likely" will have a similar capacity to alter its meaning depending on the context. The most recent discussion of these problems, but in relation to the meaning of the word "probable" is found in Darkan versus The Queen <case>; [(2005) 227 CLR 373] where the High Court confirmed that probability can denote a variety of degree of confidence depending upon the nature and purpose of the statute in which it is found (at [23]). A probability of success may not mean more "probable than not" (at [27]).
 In R versus Hallett [[1969] SASR 141] the appellant complained about the manner of the use of the word "likely" in directions given to the jury by the trial judge on the issue of malice. The direction was as follows: "The states of mind which are sufficient to constitute malice ... may consist of knowledge that the act which causes death is likely to cause death." 
The Court held that in that context the words "probable" and "likely" meant "more than a 50 percent chance of the event happening" (at 153).
 In Australian Telecommunications Commission versus Kreig Enterprises Pty Ltd [(1976) 14 SASR 303] the Supreme Court of South Australia considered the effect of s 139B of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901 (Cth) which provided that a person doing any work was liable to pay compensation to the Commission for damage to its property where that person had "reasonable cause to believe that the doing of the work is likely to interfere with or damage property of" the Commission.
Bray CJ said, in some contexts, "probable" may be regarded as stronger than "likely" and in other contexts "likely" may be stronger than "probable" (at ). He explained at 312-3: "...the ordinary and natural meaning of the word is synonymous with the ordinary and natural meaning of the word "probable" and both words mean, to adopt the expression of Lord Hodson in the passage previously quoted, that there is an odds-on chance of the thing happening. That is the way in which statutes containing the words have usually been construed: see, for example,
Re Bayer Products Ltd's Application [[1947] 2 All ER 188], per
Lord Green MR at 191, per Asquith LJ at 193 Dowling versus South Canterbury
Electric Power Board [[1966] NZLR 676]; Transport
Ministry versus Simmonds [[1973] 1 NZLR 359.]
Particularly is this so when the statute is a penal statute (see Transport
Ministry versus Simmonds [[1973] 1 NZLR 359], or, I think, where, as here, an additional liability in tort beyond the common law liability is being imposed.
 ...I think that is the meaning which should be attached to the word "likely" in subs (1)(a). It is the natural and ordinary meaning and there is nothing to show that another meaning was intended. Like the learned special magistrate, therefore, I think that "likely" in the subsections means "probable" and I think that that means that there is a more than fifty per cent of the thing happening." In Tillmanns Butcheries versus AMIEU <case>; [(1970) 27 ALR 367] the Federal Court considered whether conduct constituted a secondary boycott within the meaning of <case> of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth). The question was whether there was a "likelihood" of substantial damage arising from the union's conduct. Bowen CJ with whom Evatt J agreed, thought that the word "likely" had shades of meaning that varied, including "more probably than not" "some possibility, more than a remote or bare chance" or that "the conduct is inherently of such a character that it would ordinarily cause the effect specified." Deane J at 383 doubted the efficacy of the more or less than 50 per cent chance test, favouring the view in relation to <case>, that "likely" was not synonymous with "more likely than not" but meant that there was a "real chance or possibility" that the conduct would cause the loss and damage.
 In Sheen versus Fields Pty Ltd [(1984) 58 ALJR 93] the High
Court considered the interpretation of r 1, CL21 of the rules made under the
Factories and Shops Act 1960 (Qld) requiring an employer to provide eye protection where there was a "likelihood of injury to the eyes of an employee." Gibbs CJ, with whom Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed, said at pp -96: "Likelihood" meant "a real or not remote" chance or possibility "regardless of whether it was less or more than 50 per cent" and applied the approach of Deane J in Tillmanns Butcheries.
 In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd versus Mirror Newspapers <case>; [(1984) 55 ALR 25] the Federal Court considered whether the publication of statements, including statements of opinion made in the ordinary course of the publication of news in those parts of a newspaper which were not advertising material, constituted conduct which was misleading or deceptive or "likely to mislead or deceive" within the meaning of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth).
Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ at 30 said: "Conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a 'real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 per cent'; cf Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd versus Australasian Meat Industry
Employees' Union <case>; [(1979) 27 ALR 367] at 380 per Deane J at 346; Sheen versus Fields Pty Ltd [(1984) ALR 345]; [58 ALJR 93.]" In Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs versus Binnie [(1980) VR ], the
Victorian Supreme Court considered the meaning of "likely" in the context of [s (1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/foia1982222/s31.html) of the [Freedom of Information Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/foia1982222/) which provides that: "...a document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act would, or would be reasonably likely to - (e) endanger the lives or physical safety of persons engaged in or connection with law enforcement or persons who have provided confidential information in relation to the enforcement or administration of the law." The Court held that the qualifying adverb "reasonably" in the expression "reasonably likely", as used in <case>(e), requires the word "likely" to be given a meaning less definite than "probable." The expression speaks of a chance of an event occurring or not occurring which is real, not fanciful or remote. It does not refer to a chance which is more likely than not to occur.
 In Jabarula versus Poore <case>; [(1989) 42 A Crim R 479] the Northern Territory Supreme Court considered the meaning of the word "likely" in <case>(e) of the Criminal Code: A person is excused from criminal responsibility for an act or its event if the act was committed because of provocation upon the person ... provided (e) the act was not intended and was not such as was likely to cause death or grievous harm; ..." Kearney J followed the majority in Boughey and concluded that "likely" in that context "conveys the notion of a substantial or real chance as distinct from a mere possibility (at 482-3).
 In R versus Hind <case>; [(1985) 80 A Crim R 105] - the court considered whether an alleged act was regarded as being "likely" to endanger human life to satisfy <case>(b) of the Queensland Criminal Code.
Pincus JA said (at 141) that "likely" in <case>(b) of the Code conveyed "the idea that the act in question created a substantial or real chance of danger to human life, regardless of whether that chance was more or less than 50 per cent." In Re Bullivant's Natural Health Products Pty Ltd & Minister for
Health and Family Services [(1996) 43 ALD 305] the
Administrative Appeal Tribunal considered the meaning of the word "likely" in the context of Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Cth) reg 6A which provides that: "any labelling, packaging or presentation of therapeutic goods that is likely to result in those goods being mistaken for or confused with confectionary or toys is an unacceptable presentation of the goods." The tribunal said at [64] that the provisions concerned were not penal provisions but part of the Act's overall scheme to establish standards of manufacturing, production and distribution of therapeutic goods in a manner which ensures that they are of a certain quality, safe, efficacious and available in a timely fashion. In light of this, the tribunal said: "We have concluded that it [likely] does not, in the context of the Act and the non-penal provision with which we are concerned, mean 'more likely than not', 'a more than a 50% chance of a thing happening' or 'odds on'. This conclusion is consistent with cases such as Tillmanns Butcheries and
Boughey's case. It is not consistent with Kreig's case but we distinguish that case on the basis that it was concerned with the imposition of an additional liability. That is not so in the context in which we are considering the word." In Minister Administering the [Crown Lands
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/) versus Deerubbin
Local Aboriginal Land Council (No 2) [(2001) 50 NSWLR 665], Chief
Justice Spigelman, after citing the statement from the joint judgment in
Boughey held that the word "likely" in the expression "likely to be needed" for an essential public purpose in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1982 "is not used in the sense of more probable than not but is used in the sense ...
of a "real or not remote chance." (at 674) Australian Gas Light Co versus Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) <case>, concerned a proposal by AGL to acquire shares in a company as part of a scheme to acquire an interest in a power station and coal mine. The issue was whether the acquisition would have the likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market, in contravention of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s50.html) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth).
 French J discussed the interpretation of the word "likely" explaining that: "The meaning of 'likely' reflecting a 'real chance or possibility' does not encompass a mere possibility. The word can offer no quantitative guidance but requires a qualitative judgment about the effects of an acquisition or proposed acquisition. The judgment it requires must not set the bar so high as effectively to expose acquiring corporations to a finding of contravention simply on the basis of possibilities, however plausible they may seem, generated by economic theory alone. On the other hand it must not set the bar so low as effectively to allow all acquisitions to proceed save those with the most obvious, direct and dramatic effects upon competition ... at [41]." 
See also Macartney versus The Queen <case>; [(2006) 31 WAR 416]; Attorney General versus David [[1992] VR 46]; Poighand versus NZI
Securities Australia Ltd <case>;
FCR 363; [109 ALR 213]; R versus Sheppard [[1981] AC 394]; R versus Wills [[1990] 2 Crim LR 714]; Attorney-General versus Greater Manchester Newspapers Ltd [[2001] All ER 32.] Legislation which provides for the incarceration of an individual because of a concern that they may commit an offence in the future is at least unusual. It is at odds with the assumption that the penalty imposed by a sentencing judge, within the parameters of the legislation which provides for the offence, will adequately punish and also provide appropriately for the offender's rehabilitation. The evidence before me, which I discuss below, unequivocally indicates that for any person classified as a "serious sex offender", even with treatment said to be of "world's best practice" and whether or not subject to supervision, is at risk of reoffending when released. Whatever the level of that risk may actually be, and this may be debated, it is a real and not fanciful risk. Accordingly, if the meaning of "likely" preferred by the majority in Boughey and contended for by the
Attorney General was adopted for the present legislation the consequence would be that, even if treated, any person who has been previously convicted of a serious sex offence would always come within the jurisdictional test provided in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s17.html) and [s 17(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s17.html)
There would always remain the real chance that they will reoffend.
 If the legislation was to be applied in this manner the Court would not be called upon to make a decision as to the likelihood of an offender reoffending. Every relevant offender would be likely to reoffend. This could not have been intended by the Parliament.
 When construing legislation a court must be careful to apply the words of the legislature without imposing an impermissible gloss Khoury versus Government
Insurance Office  <case>; [(1984) 165 CLR 622] at 638 and Victims Compensation Fund Corporation versus Brown & Ors <case>; <case>.
However, where the word used by the Parliament has shades of meaning which may alter its impact it is important to identify the meaning which was intended.
As the authorities show the meaning of the word "likely" can vary significantly depending on its context. However, having regard to the purpose and effect of the legislation, notwithstanding my tentative view in
Gallagher, in my judgment, in the Act, "likely" means "more likely than not" and it is that test which must be applied in <case> and 17. For relevant purposes the court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that it is more likely than not that the offender will commit a further serious sex offence.
It follows that the defendant's argument that the chance of reoffending must be significantly higher than 50% must also be rejected.

Matters relating to the defendant's time in custody The defendant has been in custody since his arrest in relation to the various offences. In the course of his incarceration he has on occasions exhibited behaviour consistent with a continuing tendency to commit sexual offences. However, he was, for a time, administered anti-libidinal medication during which there were no reports of unsatisfactory conduct. He chose not to continue with the medication because of side effects, including breast enlargement, which caused him embarrassment in the prison environment.
 Mr Winters was admitted to the custody based intensive treatment (CUBIT) program. However, he was a reluctant participant and was concerned that his intellectual disability and problems with reading and writing may make the program difficult. He was also concerned that the program mixed rapists with paedophiles which would cause conflict. Notwithstanding his reluctance he was admitted to the program but was withdrawn when he attempted to commit suicide by climbing over a high balcony during a therapy session. The reason for his suicide attempt was an apparent inability to come to terms with his offending.
The defendant remains effectively untreated. He has expressed views critical of the program and of the people responsible for running it.
 The defendant rejected contact with the Parole Board and on an occasion in expressed the view that upon release he would reoffend. I shall return to that matter later.

The evidence of the psychiatrists 
Dr O'Dea Dr Jeremy O'Dea was one of the forensic psychiatrists appointed by the court. In his written report Dr O'Dea records that the defendant now identifies himself as of exclusive adult homosexual orientation. He reported this orientation notwithstanding the fact that before being taken into custody he had lived, although at times intermittently, with a de facto female partner for a period of 3 to 4 years. Dr O'Dea recorded the defendant's psychosexual history in the following terms: "Mr Winters told me that he now identified himself as of exclusive adult homosexual orientation. He told me that , '... I always thought I was straight [of adult heterosexual orientation] ... I though I may be bi[sexual] ... but then I came jail ...'. He told me that he was currently in a relationship with a fellow male inmate whom he told me had a further 2 years to serve in custody related to sex offences.

Mr Winters did not report an awareness of sexual attraction to children, either male children or female children. However, he went on to state, '...
what's on television ... with shows such as Home and Away ... there is some attraction to young adults ... aged 14/15/16/17 ...', but he told me that this attraction was not of a sexual nature. He also stated that, 'it's the touching that gets me into trouble.' 
He told me that from the ages of 7 to 11 years a maternal aunt approximately 4 years his senior (who subsequently committed suicide), " ...
used to suck my penis ... on a regular basis ... basically every weekend ... down the creek ... ", at his maternal grandparents property at
Cootamundra. He told me that he did not disclose these alleged events at the time, " ... I enjoyed it ... I thought everyone did it ... ". However he told me that he now saw this kind of behaviour as a problem, but did not elaborate. He told me that from the ages of 7 to 11 years another older maternal aunt,." ... used to grab me to see if I had an erection ... if I didn't I soon would have ... ".

Mr Winters told me that around the same time, a maternal uncle in his twenties, " ... used to think it was hilarious to pull my pants down and apply a docking ring [a rubber band used to castrate lambs] to my genitals ... ", in front of his other siblings. He told me that his maternal uncle did not do this to his other siblings, " ... as far as I can recall it was all focused on me ... my mother was there and she thought it was funny too ... ".

He told me that he had engaged in heterosexual intercourse initially at the age of about 15, " ... I didn't go much on it ... it was painful ... I just had trouble getting penetration ... ".

He told me that at the age of about 17, he had engaged in consensual sexual activity with a male schoolmate from the Cootamundra Catholic School, " ... I was asleep at this birthday party in his bedroom ... and stayed the night ... ". He told me that the sexual activity continued for some time, " ... we used to ride on a motor bike and take turns of sucking one and other off ... ".

He told me that a few months later, in 1983 at the age 17, he was "raped" by an 18 year old male whom he had known since he was 5 years of age. He told me that he had attended the same school and worked with this man at the abattoirs. He told me that they had been walking the streets of Cootamundra in the early hours of one morning when they decided to go to the railway station to get something to eat. Mr Winters told me that, " ...we cut through a park ... he asked me to suck his penis and grabbed hold of my hair and forced me to suck his penis ... I thought it was over ... I got up ... but I was pulled to the ground ... my shorts were pulled down ... and then I was anally raped". He told me that he did not tell anyone of the alleged assault at the time and felt guilty about this lack of disclosure as, '[the alleged offender] got another kid younger than me the following night".

He said that after the alleged sexual assault, " ... I didn't like anyone touching me or coming anywhere near me ... I wouldn't allow myself to get close to anyone or for anyone to get close to me". He told me that from the age of 17 to his late twenties, " ... there was nothing [sexual] ... I wouldn't let anyone get anywhere near me ... then I met [my ex-de facto] 
He told me that he lived with his de facto partner for a period of 3 to 4 years prior to their separation and her departure from the housing commission residence in October 1997, " ... I didn't get anything out of the relationship with [his ex-de facto] ... I had sex but it was more one sided - her side ...
she would basically drag me into the bedroom and fuck my brains out ... there was nothing in it for me ... she was a nymphomaniac ... I was happy with once a day ... she had to have it three, four, five or six times a day ... it became like a job ... ". He told me that he had experienced problems with erections and ejaculation through this relationship. He told me that he had ended the relationship, " ... I felt that she was rooting behind my back ... I told her to pack her bags and piss off and don't come back ... ". He told me that from October 1997 to June 1998 he lived alone in the Department of
Housing residence in Wagga Wagga.

Mr Winters did not report awareness of any specific sexually deviant urges or fantasies, nor problems with gender. He told " ... [exhibitionism] ... that really pisses me off ... when I was with [his ex-de facto], for some reason she loved to talk to me whilst I'm on the throne and I didn't like that ... ".
He went on to say, " ... I find "S and M" [sadism and masochism] quite stimulating ... once or twice [I have] had it done to me ... [I] haven't actually done it [myself] ... ". He then went on to say, " ... a person here has rubbed his whiskers across my body ... I like that ... ".

He told me that, " ... in my younger days I used to get older friends to get triple rated porn videos for me ... [I] haven't seen that many ... they don't interest me any more ... ". He told me that the content of the pornographic videos was mainly of female homosexual activity. He told me that he did not remember viewing pornographic videos of male homosexual activity." Dr O'Dea recorded Mr Winters' psychiatric history in the following terms: "I note that Mr Winters was admitted to Wagga Base Hospital in 1988 for 8 days with diagnoses of " ... Suicide attempt ... Overdose ... Personality
Disorder - borderline, avoidant ... the main immediate pressure was another court appearance ... ". He told me that during that time he was treated by a
Canberra based psychiatrist Dr Tym, "for a couple of months". I note that at the time he was being treated with antidepressant medication for a major depressive illness, and had a history of alcohol abuse and dependence and dysthymia. He told me that, " ... I used to drink to forget ... that's the way
I handled anything ... my father's death ... the rape ... the incidents with my [mothers siblings] .... ". He told me that he had not received psychiatric treatment from that time until his incarceration in 1988." Dr O'Dea concluded that Mr Winters is not suffering from a major psychiatric illness. However, he has a history of border-line intellectual functioning, alcohol abuse and dependence, and cannabis use. The doctor said that: "He also has a history of a personality disorder with anti-social, border line and avoidant traits, and on-going difficulties in coping with stress and interpersonal relations." Dr O'Dea concluded that Mr Winters has a specific sexual attraction to pre- pubertal children, in particular, a specific sexual attraction to pre-pubertal male children. He accordingly described his sexual disorder (or paraphilia) as being paedophilia, focused predominantly on male children. He concluded that his difficulty in controlling his sexual urges was related "at least in part to his level of intellectual functioning, his personality, and his social and interpersonal skills." The doctor utilised both clinical assessment and an actuarial assessment known as Static-99. The actuarial assessment process is explained by Dr Allnutt and I have included his discussion below. Dr O'Dea said: "From a full clinical psychiatric risk assessment and risk management perspective, and as judged by actuarial risk assessment instruments (such as the Static-99 - the widely used actuarial risk assessment instrument aimed at estimating future risk of recidivism of sex offenders), Mr Winters would be considered as having a significantly high risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviour in the longer term.

Although Mr Winters risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours would be considered significantly high, I do not consider that the current evidence regarding the assessment of risk is sufficiently advanced to predict with sufficient accuracy Mr Winters' precise likelihood of engaging in further sex offending behaviours on release into the community. His score on the
Static-99 of 7/12 places him in the group of individuals with a high risk of engaging in further sex offending in the long term. Limitations in the use of this tool are widely discussed, including by the authors of the instrument. As implied in the name, the instrument measures static and therefore for the most part unchangeable parameters. The margins of error for risk estimates using this test, particularly in endeavouring to make risk predications for an individual with an individual score, are so high as to significantly reduce the appropriateness of relying on this score alone to make decisions about release into the community.

Focus from a psychiatric perspective should more appropriately be on management and minimisation of the risk of Mr Winters engaging in further sex offending behaviours. I note the documented and reported problems Mr Winters has experienced to date in participating in psychological treatment alone for his sex offending. His level of intellectual functioning, his apparent denial and minimisation of his ex offending behaviours, and his personality problems characterised by a limited repertoire of apparently maladaptive and inappropriate coping skills under stress, are likely to limit the efficacy of psychological treatment programs alone, in helping him to manage and minimise his risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the long term.

With these limitations in mind, and on the basis that Mr Winters does have specific sexual focus on male children, and apparent ongoing problems managing his sexuality in custody, it would seem reasonable to conclude that recommencement of testosterone lowering medication is likely to prove the most successful intervention in managing and minimising his risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the long term. It is of note that Mr
Winters has agreed to receive such medication in the community.

I would recommend that testosterone lowering medication be part of a structured and supervised management program on Mr Winters release into the community. This program should involve alcohol and other drug counselling aimed at helping Mr Winters remain abstinent from alcohol and other drug use in the long term. Attention should also be given to helping him cope better with stress and helping him enhance his sexual and social skills. Housing, employment and educational support would also be important components of such a program." 
Dr Stephen Allnutt Dr Allnutt was also appointed by the court. He is a forensic psychiatrist who conducted a clinical evaluation of Mr Winters for approximately 3½ hours.
He provided the following account of the report by Mr Winters of his offending: "Mr Winters explained that in 1987 he was aged 21, single and unemployed.
He was living with his parents. He was not taking any medication. He was not seeing a mental health worker and he had no recent contacts with psychiatric services, or admissions to psychiatric hospitals. He was using alcohol. He had been drinking heavily since age 12/13. By the time of the offence in 1987 he was drinking, he estimated, several litres of Bacardi a day. He tended to drink all day, every day, except for weekends and when he didn't drink he would experience tremulousness and cravings. He noted an increases tolerance for alcohol over time, in order to achieve the same effect.

He said he drank to forget what had happened to him between the ages of 7 and 11 - he explained that two aunts and one uncle had sexually abused him. He said at age 17 he had also been raped by a person he went to school with.
After these experiences he had become distant from others, he felt less trusting of other people. He never reported the rape because at the time he was drunk and he thought he might be charged for underage drinking. He said also the person knew where he lived and so for years he had slept with a carving knife under his pillow. He used to have nightmares reliving this experience. He avoided talking about the incident as much as possible. He described being hypervigilant, startling easily after this. He noticed that these symptoms continued for about the next ten years and gradually receded in that time. His alcohol consumption helped him feel better, in regard to these symptoms. He became less caring about his self-image he said and that this tended to remain with him.

He explained that in 1987 his victim was a four year old stranger and that the offence occurred around midnight. He had been drinking all day and had consumed about three litres throughout the day and night. He had vague memories of leaving the pub to go home. He recalled walking home. He recalled the next day he was arrested. He said from the time that he walked home, until the time that he woke up, he had no recollection of the offence.

He appeared before a Magistrate, who gave him bail. His conditions were to report to the Police and not drink alcohol. In that time he continued to drink, but he continued to report, although at times he was late, but not breached for this.

Two weeks after the first offence, in about December 1987, under similar circumstances as the first offence, he said that he was charged with offences against two boys aged seven years and five years, both strangers. Again he said he had no recollection of the offending, but recalls being questioned about the offending.

He said he was arrested a few days after the time that the offences allegedly occurred. He again appeared in front of a Magistrate. He was incarcerated for a period and then granted bail, with additional conditions.

In 1988 he was admitted to Wagga Base Hospital for a psychiatric assessment at Gissing House. He remained there for several weeks. He thought that a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder was made during this admission.

In about July 1988 a Dr Tym prescribed him antidepressant medications. He had been referred by the hospital to Dr Tym for treatment. He said he saw Dr
Tym for about two to three months, every fortnight to monthly. At the time that he saw Dr Tym he was depressed. He ended up taking an overdose of antidepressant medication. At the time that he took the overdose, he said he felt harassed by local Police. He was subsequently admitted to Wagga Base
Hospital ICU and then transferred to Gissing House for a further several weeks. He was discharged, but on this occasion said that no follow up was arranged. He never saw Dr Tym again.

After discharge he continued to live at his parents' house and remained on bail, with no breaches of bail. He stopped drinking alcohol as part of his bail conditions. He did not commence the use of any drugs. He had no contact with mental health workers. He continued to work casually on occasions. He was not involved in any relationships and he did not take any medication.

In 1989 the Court case occurred. He thought he might have been given a four-year good behaviour bond, with three hours community service and a $1,500 fine. Both offences were dealt with on this occasion. He had to attend AA, which he did for several months; then he attended drug and alcohol counselling. He said he continued to remain abstinent of alcohol until 1996, age 30.

Between 1989 and 1996 he studied, doing his Year 10 Certificate, he remained unemployed. In 1994 he engaged in a defacto relationship, which lasted 3½ years. His partner was nine years his senior. They had a sexual relationship. He found the relationship sexually unsatisfactory. At the time he said the problem was that he thought he was heterosexual. He said his sex drive was less than hers. Otherwise, they were comfortable with each other's personalities. Their relationship broke up because he thought that she was having affairs. In the later stages of the relationship he recommenced using alcohol again, which he described as a "trusty friend the bottle". There were no other significant events during that period of time and he still had no contact with mental health workers and there were no medical problems.

In 1996 he was aged 30, at that time he was still in his defacto relationship. He was not working. He was not seeing a mental health worker. He was not taking any medication. He had had no further admissions to psychiatric hospitals, following his second admission to Gissing Hospital. He was drinking, "on and off', once to twice a week, he was brewing his own beer, a few bottles at a time. There were no significant stressors. His relationship with his defacto was deteriorating; they were having frequent fights.

He was unsure of the dates when the next cluster of offending occurred. He believed that the Facts had stated that it had occurred some time between 1996 and 1997. A victim used to visit with his younger brother and other friends; they used to come to his home and watch pay television and visit his defacto.
They started visiting more frequently. He was told that the offending involved
D, M, J, S but that the only offending that he could recall engaging in was pulling their pants down (dacking). In regard to T and V's charges, that he had tied them up and sucked their penises, he had no recollection of this. He said, "It never happened by me". He denied that he had tied them up. He said that the children would come around to watch TV and talk to his defacto; this was the nature of his contact with them. He went on to explain that at one stage they had asked him to show them his penis. He refused. He said this involved J, S, T and V. He said they were all around eight years of age. They wanted to know what a man's penis looked like. He thought that this event had occurred in the lounge room. After they had made this request he declined. He said as a consequence they climbed into the roof, through a cavity, stating that there was a manhole in the bathroom ceiling that they had crawled through and that they had then watched him in the shower. He said he had known this because he could hear their giggling. He thought he had left the shower immediately when this happened. He denied that he had ever masturbated. He denied that he had ever had an erection. He also denied that he ever told them to go into the ceiling to watch him. He said that the boys had spied him on numerous occasions, over a period of one to two months, between 1997 and March to June 1998. He said he told his defacto about it. He recalled them having a fight. I asked him why he never closed the hole, he answered, "Good question,
I never thought of it". I asked him why he never told their parents, he answered, "I was thinking along the lines, but would they believe me?" I asked him why he had allowed them to come back to his house after this. He told me that in the early part of 1997 they stopped coming because he decided to put his foot down. Over a number of months he didn't see them, then near the end of 1997 "D's older cousins" came around to the house. They wanted a place to smoke cannabis, he recalled having" a cone" with them.

He broke up with his defacto and she moved out. Some of the boys then revisited him and asked him if his defacto was there and he told them he had, "f*cked her off months ago". They asked if he still had a computer and asked if they could play the computer. He told them to come back later that morning.
At the time he said he was feeling lonely. He had broken up with his defacto and he felt depressed. His sleep was poor. He was staying up playing computer games. His appetite, energy and motivation remained adequate. He had no suicidal ideation. By this stage he said he was drinking once a fortnight, a bottle of beer of his home brew. V and T returned later that evening with S and J to play computer games. Over the next three months they regularly visited him to play computer games. He denied any offending. He then said that
M and his younger brother K started to come over around August/September
They made a complaint to their stepfather in January 1998. They alleged him walking in to the bedroom naked, asking them to have oral sex.
They said that there was one occasion when they had seen him naked. He said that this happened to be in the kitchen, when the boys walked in unexpectedly.
He said he recalled hearing the door open. His defacto at that time was out and he thought it was her coming home from TAFE. He admitted that he used to "dack" them. He said he did this to all of them. He said he did this in retaliation, because they would pull his lower clothing down, he would then turn it around and do it to them. At the time he never thought that this was inappropriate. He did this because his uncles, when he was a child, used to pull his pants down and apply rubber bands to his penis. He justified his "dacking" his victims on the lines that if the "kids" pulled his clothing down, he would pull theirs down. He felt the need to retaliate against the boys because he himself had been abused as a child.

He said he was arrested in June 1999 and had been in gaol since then.
Other than the "dacking" he denied all other offences." Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion: "Re: Psychiatric Illness 
In my opinion, at the time that I saw Mr Winters, he was not manifesting significant symptoms of a major mood or psychotic disorder. He did, however, endorse some difficulties with sleep, fluctuating concentration, variable motivation, variable decision making and intermittent suicidal thoughts, but not to the extent that I believe that they impacted significantly on his functioning, although at times anxiety might have reduced his motivation to engage in his occupation in the gaol. As a consequence, Mr Winters manifests some symptoms of an Adjustment Disorder, related to his current circumstances.
He described some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as a result of having been sexually abused (age 7 to 11) from which he recovered over a period of about 10 years There was evidence that in the past he has experienced episodes of depression, requiring admission to psychiatric hospital, with suicidal ideation and previously he has been treated with antidepressant medication. He describes feeling somewhat anxious in group situations, particularly when he feels judged by others and on occasions experiences panic attacks in group situations. He also describes episodes of panic, characterised by shortness of breath, palpitations, tightness in his chest - similar to episodes of asthma, during times that he is in situations of conflict. These symptoms could be consistent with a mild to moderate Social
Phobia, in that he manifests avoidant behaviours, triggered by social situations, and with associated somatic symptoms and cognitive distortions that people are judging him.

He has a history of Alcohol Abuse, and in my view Dependence, that occurred with significant abuse between the age of 15 and 22, but ongoing use commencing at aged 30. There was no significant Substance Abuse, although he did use cannabis for a period of time.

He describes coming from a relatively difficult developmental background, having lost his father at age seven, in unfortunate circumstances, at a vulnerable age, feeling to a degree responsible for his father's death as a consequence of an interaction that he had had with his father the night before. He, however, did obtain ongoing support from a stepfather. There appears to have been a period where is mother suffered a depression which might have impacted on her relationship with him. He had difficulties during his school years and manifested problems with authority figures, although
There was insufficient evidence to conclude significant behavioural disturbances, suggestive of Conduct Disorder in childhood. He has manifested, in my view, a capacity to pursue gainful employment, in the absence of alcohol abuse; however, his Alcohol Dependence Disorder has marred his employability.
He also has manifested capacity to pursue long-term committed relationships, however, these are likely made more difficult as a consequence of probable underlying ambivalence about his sexual preference and orientation, causing some conflict for him. I note that in the past he has been diagnosed with a
Borderline Personality Disorder. In interview with me he describes a volatile mood and has in the past manifested some self harm behaviour; and difficulties with identity. Avoidant personality disorder had been considered by other clinicians. It is difficult to distinguish between avoidant personality disorder and social phobias. It is likely that he manifests avoidant, antisocial and borderline personality traits.

He suffers from gout, osteoarthritis, stomach ulcers and reflux, asthma and psoriasis. There was no significant evidence of liver disease, thromboembolic disease, or metabolic conditions in the past. He has had a CT scan and an EEG and is unaware of the results of this; I would assume that they were negative if this was the case.

He is currently exposed to the significant stressor of evaluation under the Serious Sex Offender legislation.

His functioning, in my view, remains adequate." Dr Allnutt addressed the question of the risk of Mr Winters reoffending. He used both a clinical and actuarial approach.
 "Clinical Assessment 
Factors associated with increased risk of sexual recidivism: 
Mr Winters has manifested sexually offending behaviour over a period of 11 years between 1987 and 1998, which occurred between the age of 21 and 32. The offences have involved children of both male and female sex; between the age of seven and about nine years of age. Some of the victims have been strangers; other victims have been acquaintances; no victims have been members of his family. There have been three clusters of sexual offending, resulting in convictions of peep and pry; two convictions of sexual intercourse with a person under age ten; one conviction of sexual intercourse with a person between age ten and 14; four convictions of aggravated indecent assault with a person under age ten; three convictions of aggravated act of indecency against a person under age ten; three convictions of an act of indecency against a person a person under age 16. Overall, in my view, the conclusion can be drawn that the sexual offending has been of a chronic nature given the period of time over which this occurred; to a degree it is diverse in that he has crossed sexual boundaries and has been charged with a variety of sexual offences.

There was evidence of the use of physical restraint in at least some of the offences, involving deliberate physical coercion of his victims. In addition to this, it would be reasonable to be of the view, that given the age of his victims, there was psychological coercion.

Mr Winters reports he has no recollection of much of the offending, particularly his first two offending clusters. He describes that at the time he was intoxicated on alcohol. He has in past however had recollection of the second cluster of offences even though he now denies memory for this. However, with regard to the third group of offences, the evidence suggests that at the time he was probably not intoxicated, yet he continues to deny the offences to a significant degree (I assume that the offences have been properly proven).
He has also reportedly endorsed more offences than he has been convicted for only to retract this at a later date. In light of this, I think it would be reasonable to be of the view that, he is currently engaging in a process of extreme denial and minimisation.

He denies recollection of his offending in the first and second cluster of offences and is denying much of the third group of offences. I am unable therefore to assess his understanding and awareness of the motivations, triggers and circumstances that might lead him to offend in the future, based on his understanding of his past offending.

Mr Winters states that he does, at times, have difficulty coping with stress and is unable to identify any specific stress management strategies, other than smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. In the past alcohol abuse has been the most significant way that he has utilised to manage his stress.
He does, however, identify that speaking to people is helpful for him.

He, himself, has been a victim of child sexual abuse and physical abuse.
He described the sexual abuse has being experienced by him as an expression of love. It is likely that his childhood experiences gave him some justification for his own offending.

His offending behaviour has occurred over a reasonably lengthy period of time. He has been convicted of inappropriate sexual behaviour with children.
There was evidence for sexually arousing behaviours involving male and female children, not related to him under the age of 13; his sexual expression not exclusive to children. Based on this, I believe that a diagnosis of
Paedophilia bisexual type, extra-familial and inclusive is applicable. He reported masochistic sexual behaviour in the past.

He has a long history of significant Alcohol Abuse and Dependence. His alcohol intoxication has been present during the first 2 clusters of sexual offences. It is likely that at the time of those offences he was alcohol dependent.

He has in the past experienced suicidal ideation and engaged in suicidal behaviour and is prone to impulsivity at times he expresses his anger by engaging in minor property damage.

He has a history of prior non-sexual offending, which is relatively minor, dating back to 1983 involving negligent driving and supplying Indian Hemp, speeding, using offensive language. There was no history of violent offending.

There do not yet appear to be clear plans about his future accommodation or employment.

Having previously breached a supervision order there was reason to be concerned about future breaches. He has in the past breached a supervision order and offended sexually while on this bail, this, however, did occur at a relatively young age. There was report of numerous infractions while he has been in prison, which suggests some difficulty with rule adherence. There are multiple complaints of sexually unwanted advances during his incarceration and at least one complaint of unwanted sexual touching the genital of another inmate. He has a history of variable compliance.

He manifests social phobia and social anxiety symptoms, which have impacted, on his engagement with the CUBIT program. As a consequence he has been unable to capitalise on this program.

Factors that are ambiguous: 
Mr Winters voices a view that offending against children is "despicable and unacceptable". He achieved a moderate score on the Bumby Molest Scale He acknowledges that it is against the law. He also acknowledged that such behaviour has negative effects on the victim. He acknowledges that he had no right to offend, but only to the degree that he should not have pulled their pants down. Thus it appears that he at least has a cognitive understanding that such offending behaviour is unacceptable. There were a number of reports that voiced concern about his motivation to continue sexual offending in 2004.
It is however notable that in soon after these reports he first consulted a psychiatrist about anti-libidinal medication. A recent assessment in 2005 noted that his attitude towards the offences and his motivation to engage in treatment had improved.

He has in his life had one significant committed relationship, lasting 3½ years. He has lived with a woman for that period of time and thus appears capable of engaging in committed relationships. Given his paedophilic tendency, it is probable his homosexual conflicts and possible that his paedophilic preference interfered with the sexual relationship with his female partners. He has more recently come to accept that he is of homosexual orientation and reports having pursued an age appropriate sexual relationship with another inmate. This suggests capacity for committed intimate age appropriate relationships in the future.

He has manifested motivation to pursue treatment in that he has trialed anti-libidinal medication. However his motive appears to have been to primarily achieve parole. Secondarily his motive is probably to reduce his sex drive; in that while he denies sexual offending I suspect he is aware of his sexual difficulties but is not reporting this. Of further concern about his motivation to accept he has not been prepared to enter a "stepping-stone" program.

He appears to have a history of employment difficulties, related to his alcohol abuse; but he presents as an individual who does have the capacity to engage in gainful employment as long as he remains abstinent from substances.

Factors associated with sexual recidivism that are absent or are strengths: 
I did not conduct a psychopathic checklist but note that one was completed in 2005 in which he scored in the non-psychopathic range.

He has in the past suffered from Depressive Disorder, with multiple episodes of depression and suicide attempts and thus has a predisposition to experiencing depression. There has not been evidence for significant depressive episodes at the time of his offences; although he might have experiences some symptoms of adjustment disorder. I do not believe however that in the past depression made a significant contribution to his offending.
There have been concerns that he might have suffered brain damage and manifest intellectual impairment however testing has shown him to have borderline IQ.
In interview with him he presented as someone with adequate intellectual capacities.

He manifests a capacity to pursue a lengthy period of abstinence should he choose to do so.

Mr Winters presents as an engaging individual, with reasonably good interpersonal and social skills. He does not present as an individual who would have significant difficulties in establishing social relationships with others in one to one interactions. However, at this stage, as a consequence of his charges and incarceration, he has become more socially isolated, although he does have the ongoing support of his family. He is however easily anxious in social situations where he might be the centre of attention.

He presents as an individual who is capable of planning for his future. He has so far considered moving in with his mother. He is aware that staying with his sister would be inappropriate.

He manifests cognitive capacity to consent to accepting or refuse medication.

The frequent reports of sexual behaviour towards other inmates appears to have diminished after he commenced anti-libidinal medication in about
September 2004 which suggests that such medication might be effective in assisting him to conform his sexual behaviour.

On clinical assessment I would place him more in the moderate-high range of sexual recidivism in the medium term because he has strengths.

Actuarial Assessment 
Utilizing an actuarial tool, I am guided by the Static 99, which is an instrument designed for the prediction of sexual recidivism in sex offenders.
It was developed in Canada and the United Kingdom. It produces estimates of future risk based on the number of risk factors present in any one individual.
The probability estimates provided by the Static 99 are reconviction rates.
Any recidivism estimates provided by the Static 99 are group estimates and cannot be applied to the individual; such estimates can only act as a guide.
Most particularly, these group estimates were derived from sexual offender follow up in Canada and the United Kingdom and therefore are more applicable to that population than an Australian population. Official recidivism rates, particularly reconviction rates probably vary form jurisdiction to jurisdiction and can be influenced by a number of factors including the capacity of the jurisdiction's ability to detect sexual offending, report accurately on the rates of sexual offending. It is also influenced by the legal process that operations of that jurisdiction that result in conviction.
It would be appropriate for me to note that there was current argument in the empirical literature about the accuracy of actuarial instruments and concern about the use of actuarial instruments. There was also evidence that supports the view that these instruments, while acknowledging their limitation, have greater accuracy in correctly predicting recidivism in the longer term than clinical assessment but few studies that have compared the two methods in sexual offender groups. Overall the Static 99 as an actuarial instrument can act as a guide but should be cautiously and judiciously applied to the individual.

Utilising the Static 99, if he had been a subject of the original study he would score on the following factors: two convictions for prior sexual offences (2); greater than four prior sentencing dates (1); previous convictions for non contact sex offences (1); unrelated victims (1); strangers as victims (1); males as victims (1). Thus Mr Winters scores 7 on the Static
He falls into a high-risk group according to the Static 99. Of individuals in the original study on which the Static 99 has been based, those of who scored 7 on the Static 99 - 43% sexually re-offended in five years; 43% in ten years and 53% in 15 years. (These figures differ from those provided by the psychologists which are referred to at [....]. I am satisfied that the psychologists' figures should be accepted). The overall recidivism rate for the study group, who were evaluated in the Static 99 study, was 18% in five years, 22% in ten years and 15% in 15 years. These percentages, for the reasons outlined above, are not necessarily applicable to Mr Winters specifically. They are used to illustrate that compared to the subjects who were evaluated in the study on which the Static 99 study was based, if he had been a subject of that study, he would have fallen into a high-risk category when compared to others in the study.

Synthesis 
Mr Winters manifests high loading of clinical and actuarial risk factors but also manifests strengths, which explains the mild degree of diversion between the actuarial and clinical assessment. If he re-offended the most probable scenario would be that of grooming of male pre-pubescent victims through the use of incitements or physical coercion with sexual behaviours involving touching and exposure with the aim of achieving sexual gratification which could result in at least moderate psychological harm. Less likely is the risk of physical harm in the form of physical assault. Signs of impending offending and situations that might herald increased risk would include: non- compliance with supervision orders, unsupervised contact with children, stress, depression, substance abuse, engagement with children in the context of computers or computer games or any recreational activity, apparently innocent but potentially inappropriate behaviours with children such as play fighting, tickling, "horsing around", loitering, evidence of voyeuristic or exhibitionistic activity, the establishment of a casual relationship with children under the age of 16, or the establishment of relationships with women with children under 16 years of age." In relation to the problem facing the court, which Dr Allnutt described as the "ultimate issue", he expressed the opinion that it was not possible with reasonable medical certainty to predict whether an individual will reoffend.
Although a person may be placed in a group with an identifiable level of risk for that group that does not mean that a particular individual within that group will be one of those that in fact offends. Dr Allnutt expressed the view that the defendant will require intensive supervision, treatment and monitoring when in the community. Having regard to his previous history with anti-libidinal medication Dr Allnutt expressed concern about the feasibility of Mr Winters being safely prescribed hormonal anti-libidinal medication.
However, the doctor concluded that it would be preferable if Mr Winters pursued both biological and psychological treatments. He believes that his access to children and opportunity to offend should be minimised. Mr Winters needs to develop a better understanding of his antecedents and motives, develop coping skills and learn strategies to manage his deviant sexual interest, address his vulnerability to substance abuse and manage his depressive and anxiety disorders. If the court decided to make an extended supervision order Dr Allnutt made the following recommendations: "Whether or not he is given an "extended supervision order" or a "continuing detention order" he requires further sex offender rehabilitation and close monitoring by a clinicians expert in this field. Access to children and opportunity to offend needs to be minimised. He needs to develop better understanding of the antecedents and his motives; develop better coping skills medication learn strategies to manage deviant sexual interests; address his probable justifications; address his vulnerability to substance abuse; and manage his depressive disorder and anxiety disorder 
If the court decides to make an "extended supervision order" then: 
He should not reside in any environment that allows him easy access to children; for example, near schools, parks or child amusement or recreational areas.
 
He will require assistance in acquiring proper accommodation.
 
Any sign of non-compliance with supervision orders, unsupervised contact with children, stress, depression, substance abuse, engagement with children in the context of computers or computer games, apparently innocent but potentially inappropriate behaviours with children such as play fighting, tickling, "horsing around", loitering or the establishment of a relationship with children under the age of 16 should be regarded as a "red flag" and investigated immediately.
 
He requires intense monitoring, face to face with clinicians with experience in treating and supervising sex offenders in the medium to long term. This monitoring should be at least weekly to bi-weekly at the time of release with more frequent contacts at times of increased risk or the emergence of dynamic factors. The responsible clinicians would determine the frequency of contacts.
 
He requires regular unpredictable drug screens.
 
It would be preferable if he could also be subject to random and unpredictable breath testing.
 
He should agree to abstain from the use of substances and alcohol absolutely.
 
He would benefit from ongoing drug and alcohol counselling in the community and in my view should pursue Alcoholics Anonymous.
 
In my view he needs an opinion from an endocrinologist with regards to his risk for osteoporosis and with regard to his other side effects.
 
He requires a bone scan.
 
Anti-libidinal hormonal medication should be prescribed by a psychiatrist if he consents and if it is medically safe to do so. He would have to take into consideration the side effects that he is being exposed to and consider his level of tolerance in this regard.
 
He is also eligible for treatment with SSRI's, particularly given his social phobia and proneness to depression. It is possible that is he is consenting that he could be provided a lower dose of Depot Provera or Androcur adjunct with an SSRI, which could have a compounding effect on his sex drive while at the same time lowering the risk for side effects due to the hormonal preparations.

The Community Forensic Mental Health Service could provide the psychiatric oversight and monitor the medication.

He should agree to ongoing 6 monthly to yearly consultations with an endocrinologist as long as he takes hormonal medication.

He could pursue further rehabilitation with a community treatment program such as the Community Treatment Programme at Forensic Psychology Services program as he requires further sex offender rehabilitation. However he might not be able to enter this programme as the programme focuses on treatment of the sex offenders who fall into the low to moderate risk groups. It would be preferable if he were provided individual therapy at least initially.

He should be encouraged to integrate with an appropriate social group of his choice, as long the group is not antisocial.

He should be encouraged to pursue gainful employment.

In my view there should be strict demand for compliance to supervision orders and mental health workers monitoring him should not tolerate non- compliance.

A management plan should be in place prior to his release with the agreement of all clinicians involved.

A condition of release should be that he allows the communication of confidential information between all agencies involved in his care.

All agencies involved in his care should communicate with each other regularly about his progress.

If the court decides to make a "continuing detention order" then: 
He should pursue a sex offender rehabilitation program such as the CUBIT program while incarcerated.

In my view he needs an opinion from an endocrinologist with regards to his risk for osteoporosis and with regard to his other side effects.

He requires a bone scan.

Anti-libidinal hormonal medication should be prescribed by a psychiatrist if he consents and if it is medically safe to do so. He would have to take into consideration the side effects that he is being exposed to and consider his level of tolerance in this regard.

He is also eligible for treatment with SSRI's, particularly given his social phobia and proneness to depression. It is possible that is he is consenting that he could be provided a lover dose of Depot Provera or Androcur adjunct with an SSRI, which could have a compounding effect on his sex drive while at the same time lowering the risk for side effects due to the hormonal preparations.

The Community Forensic Mental Health Service could provide the psychiatric oversight and monitor the medication.

He should agree to ongoing 6 monthly to yearly consultations with an endocrinologist as long as he takes hormonal medication.

The Department of Corrective Services should consider a one to one program for him at least initially. The Department of Corrective Services should be approached in this regard to ascertain their view on this suggestion.

A trial of anti-libidinal and SSRI or an SSRI alone would be helpful." 
Dr Olav Nielssen  Dr Nielssen was engaged by the defendant's solicitors to provide an opinion. He is a psychiatrist. Dr Nielssen concluded that the defendant has a disorder "of abnormal sexual interest, homosexual paedophilia." His history of alcohol and cannabis abuse indicate that he also has a substance abuse disorder.
 Dr Nielssen stated that Static-99 required careful application. Even offenders assessed to be at high risk by the Static-99 methodology "have only an even chance of committing another sexual offence in the fifteen years after release from prison." Dr Nielssen identified that Mr Winters' intellectual disability has affected his capacity to obtain employment and also to maintain sexual relationships. He will need assistance with both if he is released from custody. He is of the opinion that Mr Winters' sexual disorder requires "indefinite treatment by a psychiatrist or community sex offender service with a combination of libido lowering medication and counselling. The object of counselling would be to enquire about his sexual interests and activity and attempt to discourage any at risk activity and promote an acceptable life style such as adult homosexual relationships. Dr Nielssen said: "I do not believe Mr Winters should be compelled to complete the CUBIT program for several reasons. Firstly, there is little evidence that his completion of CUBIT would make any different to his risk of reoffending, as there is no published evidence that CUBIT or similar custody based programs conducted elsewhere significantly reduce recidivism rates. Secondly, Mr
Winters was discharged from the program on a previous occasion because he was reported to have become suicidal. It seems he interpreted the behaviour of other members of the group to be similar to the teasing he experienced at school and the program brought up aspects of his own abuse in early life.
Thirdly, Mr Winters does not have the intellectual capacity or social skills to fulfil the expectations of the program." Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that it would be unfair to keep Mr
Winters in custody to complete a program that cannot be guaranteed to improve his prognosis or prepare him for release in any practical way.

The evidence of the psychologists 
Ms Katherine Sahm Ms Katherine Sahm is a psychologist employed with the Forensic Psychology
Services, Sex Offenders program division in the NSW Department of Corrective
Services. She has worked as a psychologist with the Department since 1998, working exclusively in relation to sex offenders. Since November 2004 she has worked as a forensic psychologist where she has conducted and redeveloped a community based treatment program for sex offenders who are assessed as presenting a low-moderate risk of reoffending. She has also been responsible for preparing risk assessment reports for Probation and Parole in relation to sex offenders.
 Ms Sahm has also worked as a forensic psychologist within CUBIT. The CUBIT program is psychological group counselling which is available to offenders within prison who have been assessed as presenting as a moderate to high risk of reoffending. Before working with the Department of Corrective Services Ms
Sahm has worked as a psychologist in a number of institutions in the United
States of America.
 Ms Sahm has carried out a risk assessment of the defendant. For this purpose she has used the actuarial risk assessment instrument - Static-99.
 Ms Sahm scored Mr Winters as a 7 on the Static-99 scale. This places him in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders. It is accepted that individuals placed in this category reoffend at a rate of 39% over 5 years, 45% over 10 years, and 52% over 15 years.
 Ms Sahm also carried out an assessment using an instrument of risk assessment known as SVR-20. This is carried out by a structured clinical interview. Using this technique Ms Sahm concluded that Mr Winters should be assessed as high risk for sexual violence.
 Ms Sahm also considered the dynamic risk factors personal to Mr Winters.
Although actuarial assessment provides information about how similar a given individual is to the group of offenders who are known to reoffend, it does not provide any information about whether the individual will be amongst those who reoffend. Accordingly, psychologists have developed a range of dynamic risk factors from which they endeavour to assess the likelihood of a particular individual being a recidivist. The factors which are looked at are intimacy deficits, social influences, attitude towards sexual assault, sexual self regulation and general self regulation, acute variables, which represent factors that can fluctuate within shorter periods of time: substance abuse, anger/hostility and opportunity for victim access.
 Ms Sahm reported in relation to each of these matters and concluded that the defendant continues to be "high risk for sexual reoffending." She said that: "the significant factors that would lead him to offend appear to be poor intimacy deficits, poor emotional controls and the use of sex as coping, and general self regulation issues. In addition, Mr Winters' history of abuse and sexual abuse is likely to impact on his successful resolution of these issues." Ms Sahm recognised that Mr Winters had not presented as amenable to treatment throughout his incarceration and at times actively obstructed those who were endeavouring to help him. However, when she assessed him she found that his behaviour had ameliorated somewhat, although he continued "to present questions regarding the minimisation of his offending and the level of sexual deviance and preoccupations. In addition, he has presented a history of self- harm and high emotionality with poor control of his behaviour. The changes he has made are recent and would require more time to have a sustaining positive impact." Ms Sahm recommended that Mr Winters complete an intensive sex offenders treatment program to address his risk factors. Because of his assessment as high risk for sexual reoffending and history of poor stability in the community and while incarcerated, she was of the view that he would not be suitable for the community based sex offender treatment program.
 Upon the assumption that he was released Ms Sahm gave evidence of the potential for Mr Winters to receive treatment in the community. She believes that apart from providing anti-libidinal medication it would be necessary to provide Mr Winters with upwards of 300 hours of face to face intervention with a psychologist with further follow up care. As I have already indicated such treatment is not presently available within the community.

The evidence of David Bright Mr David Bright is also a forensic psychologist. He is the therapeutic manager of custody based intensive treatment sex offender programs at the NSW
Department of Corrective Services. He has held this position since June 2003.
 Mr Bright has worked with Static-99 since about the year 2000 and believes it to be a valid and reliable tool for risk assessment of sexual offenders and prediction rates of recidivism. Mr Bright is also familiar with the dynamic risk assessment procedure.
 Mr Bright gave evidence that a fundamental principle of sex offender treatment programs is that the intensity of the program should match the risk at which the offender had been assessed. This is the basis upon which the
Department of Corrective Services provides programs. The CUBIT program commenced in 1999 and is run as a "therapeutic community" in which offenders practice newly acquired skills, behaviours and attitudes on a daily basis, with advice and feedback from specially trained psychologists and custodial officers. The program is designed to encourage participants to take responsibility for their offending behaviour, examine victim issues, identify their offence cycle and develop a detailed relapse prevention program. The program runs on average for about 8 months.
 Changes were made to the CUBIT program in 2005. These changes were designed to make the program available to more offenders. Changes have also been made to make the program less confrontational allowing for offenders who might not previously have completed the program to receive a full course of treatment.
 In his affidavit Mr Bright indicated that there is not presently any community based treatment program for high risk sex offenders. He said: "this is not surprising, in my view, given the inherent risks to the safety of both staff and the community that would arise from the involvement of untreated high risk sex offenders in such an environment." This statement raises a dilemma which I have already commented on. It is apparent that there are offenders who, for one reason or another, may have been unable to complete a CUBIT program when in custody. This has so far proved to be the case for Mr Winters. Because of the risk of self harm he was unable to complete the program. If it was to remain the position the lack of community based treatment arrangements would have the consequence that such a person may, if assessed by reference to the criteria which officers of the
Department of Corrective Services impose, never be released.
 These difficulties were discussed during the proceedings and I was told that steps had been taken to arrange for community based group treatment programs to be provided. Indeed, I understand that two psychologists have been engaged for the purpose of running such a program. This is a positive step towards resolving the difficulty. However, there are people, of which Mr
Winters on past experience may be one, who cannot cope with group based treatment. They need one on one care. It is suggested that this may be less effective than group treatment but the evidence for this conclusion is not persuasive. However, although there are experienced psychologists in the community who can provide this care there is no funding available to pay for it. It would seem that the Act has been brought into law with the assumption that all high risk offenders can be effectively treated in group sessions in custody.
 In his affidavit Mr Bright indicates that treatment in the CUBIT program is not offered to a sex offender who would not be able to complete it. The consequence is that because arrangements have not been made for earlier treatment it is not uncommon for persons seeking to ensure eligibility for parole to defer application for release to ensure that there is sufficient time for completion of the program. In his opinion the research confirms that if the program is not completed the benefit which treatment may bring is unlikely to be achieved.
 Mr Bright has attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programs. Together with others he has conducted a pilot study which has examined the effectiveness of the CUBIT program. The available research suggests that for offenders in the high risk band 39% are expected to recidivate sexually based on Static-99. Mr Bright found that the identified rate of recidivism for CUBIT treated men was 10%. However, Mr Bright's study has significant limitations. The Static-99 rate was for recidivism over a five year period and the study of CUBIT treated men was confined to a period of .36 years. Further, Mr Bright's study looked at all offenders and did not attempt to assess the effectiveness of treatment for high risk offenders.
 Mr Bright was able to observe Mr Winters during the time when he unsuccessfully participated in the CUBIT program. He believes that Mr Winters' low self-esteem may have been the cause of his inability to complete the program in 2001.
 He said that efforts have been made in recent years to motivate Mr Winters to reenter the CUBIT program. These efforts have been unsuccessful. He has shown a resistance to the treatment program. However, Mr Bright said that Mr
Winters' resistance has more recently ameliorated and there is evidence that he is now more amenable to participation than he was previously. Mr Bright is now of the view that the suicidal ideation and behaviour which Mr Winters previously exhibited during the program may have dissipated and that Mr
Winters has developed a calmer and more stable personality. Mr Bright is also of the opinion that Mr Winters has the cognitive capacity to successfully complete the program.
 In his affidavit Mr Bright expresses the following conclusions: "In my view, Mr Winters' risk of re-offending on release from custody remains high. He has been assessed as a high risk on the basis of both static and dynamic risk factors. On this basis, in my view if Mr Winters does not manage his risk factors upon release, and if the stable dynamic risk factors remain unresolved, he will continue to present a high risk of re-offending.
Moreover, if the acute dynamic risk factors become apparent following his release from custody (for example hostility and access to victims) he could present as an imminent risk of re-offending.

In order to manage his risk of re-offending, in my view Mr Winters will need to address the dynamic risk factors which are relevant to his overall risk of re-offending. The dynamic risk factors have been described above, and in his case would include (but not be limited to) the following: general self regulation; in other words, more effective coping strategies and an ability to deal more effectively with his emotional reactions; relationship skills, which includes learning to build satisfying and close personal relationships with other adults; sexual self-regulation, which could include anti-libidinal medication, but should also examine more effective coping strategies and also address sexual coping and cognitive and behavioural techniques to reduce deviant arousal; hostility and anger, including learning ways of dealing more appropriately with anger and addressing thinking patterns that drive hostility.

Mr Winters has not completed the CUBIT treatment program for moderate to high risk sex offenders. Mr Winters is an untreated and high risk sex offender. In my opinion, CUBIT is the only treatment program that is suitable to address Mr Winters' needs because of its high intensity nature and the benefits and aspects of the program to which I have made reference above. Such custodial-based treatment also allows for the treatment of high risk sex offenders in an environment that provides for community and staff safety. An integral part of the CUBIT program, is its group therapy component. As indicated above, there is no community based group therapy program that is available for high risk sex offenders.

Completion of CUBIT would, in my view, assist in enabling Mr Winters to be able to manage his risk of re-offending upon his release into the community.
Such cognitive behavioural treatment could be supplemented by anti-libidinal medication, if considered appropriate to prescribe (following assessment by a psychiatrist experienced in the treatment of anti-libidinal medication to sex offenders and consented to by Mr Winters).

If Mr Winters were to be the subject of an interim detention order under the 2006 Act, steps could be taken to find him a place in the PREP pre- treatment program within a matter of days of such order being made (assuming that Mr Winters signed the standard consent form).

Mr Winters could remain in the PREP pre-treatment program until such time as he is either released or until a longer period of detention is ordered.
Thereafter, if the Court were to make a continuing detention order under the Act, such that it was clear that there would be sufficient time for him to complete the CUBIT program while in custody (that is, not less than 8 months), steps would be taken promptly to find Mr Winters a place within the
CUBIT program (assuming he signed the standard consent form)." 
The evidence of Graham Rendell Mr Rendell is a qualified psychologist and is registered as a clinician with the NSW Commission for Children and Young People. He is a senior psychologist with the sex offender programs in the psychological programs divisions of the Department of Corrective Services where he is the southern regional supervisor. He is responsible for all sex offenders for which the department is responsible within the southern region both custodial and in the community.
 He impressed me as having considerable practical experience in managing sex offenders in the community. He has a realistic approach to the problems of both the offender and his or her safe reintegration into the community. Mr
Rendell has known Mr Winters within the prison system and considers him to be an untreated high risk sex offender. In his affidavit he provided a comprehensive statement of the factors which would need to be considered before Mr Winters could be released on an extended supervision order. During the course of the proceedings these matters were considered by the parties and in particular at meetings attended by the various experts. Resulting from those meetings counsel for Mr Winters tendered a draft plan for the management of Mr Winters should he be released under an extended supervision order. I shall discuss the details of that draft plan below. Mr Rendell expressed the view that if that plan was put in place and maintained Mr Winters could be satisfactorily released under an extended supervision order. I shall discuss his view about that matter and the views of the other experts in greater detail below.

The evidence of Mr Ware Mr Ware is the Statewide clinical coordinator of sex offender programs within the Department of Corrective Services. In that role he oversees the assessment, clinical and therapeutic intervention initiatives of the department in the management of sex offenders. He has responsibility for the planning, directing, implementing and evaluation of all sex offender programs.
He is a psychologist.
 Mr Ware has reviewed the meta-analytic studies which have been undertaken of sex offender treatment efficacy studies in the last 10 years. He said that "each found, at the least, a small but significant treatment effect; that is sex offender treatment was effective in reducing reoffending." He said that these studies are particularly informative given the very large sample sizes used. The studies he considered were those of Hall [(1995), Alexander ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%20Alexander%201999 "View LawCiteRecord" ), Gallagher Wilson Hirschfield Coggeschall and McKenzie (1999) and Hanson and colleagues (2002). Mr Ware considers the most significant meta-analysis was the Hanson study. It was conducted in 2002 and was a meta-analysis of 43 studies combing over 9,000 sexual offenders from the United States, Canada,
United Kingdom, and New Zealand.
 Mr Ware considers that the overall findings of that study demonstrate "a reduction of 7%", that is the offence rate was reduced from 17.4% (untreated) to 9.95% (treated). In the course of his evidence Dr O'Dea commented that a weakness in these studies may be that they look at all sex offenders rather than at high risk offenders. It could be that treatment is either more or less effective with high risk offenders than the general body of offenders.
 Mr Ware commented upon the preliminary research which attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of the CUBIT program. This was the study undertaken by Mr
Bright. Although he believes the results to be encouraging Mr Ware accepts that it has significant limitations. Apart from the difficulty of a small sample size there is no comparison with untreated sexual offenders.
Nevertheless he believes that the CUBIT program "most likely is effective at reducing reoffending" although he is unable to identify the extent to which it is effective.
 Mr Ware has reviewed the findings of Ms Sahm, Mr Bright and Mr Rendell. He says that a number of issues are clear: "(a) Mr Winters has been assessed as a high risk sexual offender.
 he has not completed treatment.
 a number of dynamic risk factors have been identified for Mr Winters (these are clearly articulated within each of the dynamic risk factors sections of the report by Ms Sahm). Each of these factors has been reliably and empirically linked to the risk of recidivism (for example sex self regulation skills). As they are amenable to change, they are therefore targeted within treatment.

Mr Winters has not satisfactorily addressed these dynamic risk factors, and as such there is no significant or compelling evidence that Mr
Winters has reduced his risk of reoffending." Mr Ware is of the view that the CUBIT program is the most appropriate and beneficial treatment for Mr Winters. He says in his affidavit that there are no other appropriate treatment options within the Department of Corrective
Services, either within a custodial or a community setting. Mr Ware has also considered other treatment options which were suggested. In relation to individual sex offender treatment delivered by a psychologist he concluded that there is little research available to suggest that individual treatment for sex offenders assessed to be a high risk of offending is effective. In any event he indicated that the Department's sex offender programs branch does not have the resources necessary to provide individual treatment and will not commit such resources in light of the limited information suggesting that it is actually beneficial. He concluded that "Mr Winters has been assessed as a high risk sexual offender and, consequently, requires an intensive treatment program (that is an estimated 300 hours) that is not possible with individual treatment." The Department conducts a program of non-residential treatment for lower risk and lower need sexual offenders referred to as "CORE". It provides 100 contact hours 5 hours for every week for 20 weeks. He says that Mr Winters would not be suitable for this program because he has been assessed as a high risk sexual offender.

The evidence of Ms Howell Ms Jennifer Howell is a clinical psychologist with considerable experience in the treating of sexual offenders. She has worked with a number of high risk sex offenders on parole. Some of the persons she has treated have been released from prison without completing the CUBIT program.
 Ms Howell was able to interview Mr Winters before giving her evidence. She expressed the view that she would be able to effectively treat him should he be released to the community pursuant to a supervised order. She was made aware of the draft plan which had been prepared and believed it to be appropriate.
 Ms Howell has accreditation as a clinical assessor for the child sex offenders scheme. She is a member of the Australian and New Zealand
Association for the treatment of sexual abusers. She is also a member of the international association for the treatment of sexual abusers. She has had considerable experience working with people who, because of different disorders, find it difficult to participate in group therapy.
 Ms Howell was of the opinion that if Mr Winters was released he should have a counselling session at least twice a week. She agreed that part of his treatment should involve anti-libidinal medication supervised by a psychiatrist. Her fees are on a sliding scale with a maximum of $180 per hour.
Her services are not covered by Medicare because the individuals do not have a diagnosed mental illness. I shall refer to some other aspects of her evidence in detail later in these reasons.

The evidence of Viviane Fahs Viviane Fars is employed by the Commissioner of Corrective Services as the co-ordinator of the "special visitation group." She gave evidence that should
Mr Winters be released pursuant to an extended supervision order the "special visitation group" would be able to provide accommodation for him immediately.
The accommodation would be a three bedroom residence where he would be the only resident. The accommodation would initially be available for a six month period during which time assistance would be given to Mr Winters to find alternative accommodation within the community. This would be done in coordination with the Department of Housing.
 If released Ms Fars' group would be responsible for monitoring Mr Winters' behaviour within the community. She is presently responsible for approximately offenders who are considered to be high risk and whose progress requires monitoring. They are initially given intense monitoring and if their progress is satisfactory are given over to a district office to continue the service.
If Mr Winters was released, monitoring for a five year period would be available. Upon initial release Mr Winters would be monitored by a team of four people who would be responsible for implementing a case plan prepared for
Mr Winters. The job of the officers responsible for managing the plan is to assist the offender to assimilate into the community and also ensure compliance with his or her obligations.

The evidence of Mr Dentrinos - Mr Winters intends to reoffend Mr Theodore Dentrinos is a corrections officer based at Junee Correctional
Centre. His evidence is of considerable significance in the resolution of this matter. In March 2004 Mr Winters was an inmate at Junee Centre. Mr Dentrinos interviewed him. He said in an affidavit that Mr Winters displayed a negative attitude during the interview. He described him as "smug and dismissive in respect to the crimes of which he had been convicted." He said that Mr Winters told him that he was expecting to do his full sentence and did not intend to undertake treatment programs.
 Mr Dentrinos said he asked Mr Winters whether he intended to reoffend when released. He said that Mr Winters said "Yes" and grinned when he said this. Mr
Dentrinos said that he took Mr Winters seriously and believed that what he was saying was his genuinely held intention. He did not "regard him as joking or trying to wind me up in any way." Mr Dentrinos was not cross-examined.

Electronic monitoring Evidence was given by Sue Knight of the offender compliance and monitoring unit with respect to the utility of electronic monitoring of offenders.
Equipment is now available which would allow the tracking of an offender's movements. When used in conjunction with a "schedule of movements" the system can be used to notify and alert monitoring staff if an offender moves to places which have been identified as not available to him or her. Static monitoring can be utilised when an offender is restricted to a particular location. GPS monitoring can be used to track the movements of an offender within the community.
 In Gallagher I commented upon the effectiveness of electronic monitoring in relation to a sexual offender who has been released to the community.
Although it allows the tracking of an offender's movements it provides little protection if a person is intent upon committing an offence.

Submissions on behalf of the defendant The defendant opposed the making of a detention order but did not oppose the making of an extended supervision order. The defendant accepted that all of the expert evidence confirms Dr Allnutt's opinion that "you cannot prescribe a particular percentage risk to Mr Winters. He falls into the group and it has been shown that 50% of that group have reoffended over a period of years." The defendant submitted that, even assuming Mr Winters has been correctly classified pursuant to Static-99 as a high risk offender, this evidence would only indicate that he is in a group of which 50% have reoffended in 15 years.
It was submitted that when the Act contemplates the maximum period of detention or supervision as being 5 years this statistic could not justify an order having regard to the statutory threshold.
 Mr Winters submitted that an error had occurred in his classification on the Static-99 scale. The evidence, which I accept, is that he has had a prior intimate relationship which lasted for over 2 years. This would have reduced his score from 6+ to 6 taking him from the high risk group. However, because of a suggestion that the relationship was intermittent and not continuous Ms
Sahm was of the view that it should be excluded. The defendant further submitted that his charge and conviction records are unreliable and that he should not have been scored for a non-contact sex offence because the two "peep and pry" offences were pleas in satisfaction of attempted rather than completed sex offences. If this submission is correct Mr Winters should have been scored in the "moderate/high risk" group of offenders with a score of 5.
The available evidence suggests that persons with a score of 5 reoffend at a rate of 33% over 5 years and 40% over 15 years.
 The defendant also criticised the use of Static-99 and submitted it was not a relevant tool. It was pointed out, in my view correctly, that the identified reoffending rates do not discriminate between the seriousness of subsequent sex offences and do not identify whether they were serious sex offences. In the two previous decisions of this Court this aspect was not examined. Tillman and Quinn scored 8 ([2007] NSWSC 605 at [66]) and 9 ([2007] NSWSC 873 at [147]) respectively on Static-99 and both had been shown to have committed offences while on parole. The defendant is in a different position and has not committed sexual offences following any period of incarceration.
 Apart from the meaning of the word "likely" there is a further difficulty in applying <case>. The section contemplates the making of a continuing detention order if the court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to reoffend by committing a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. In Tillman Bell J accepted the submission that adequate supervision "means supervision adequate to eliminate; or at the very least, substantially reduce the likelihood that the defendant will reoffend" (at [17]).
 In the present case the defendant submitted that when referring to adequate supervision the legislation does not contemplate supervision with the effect of "elimination or at the very least substantial reduction" of the likelihood of reoffending. It was submitted that it should be understood as supervision which reduces the risk below either a high degree of likelihood of reoffending or making it "less probable than not." The latter submission is consistent with my finding as to the test to be applied pursuant to <case>.

The risk of Mr Winters reoffending Because Mr Winters did not oppose extended supervision, his risk of reoffending if released without supervision was not discussed at any length.
 As I have already discussed Mr Winters has been assessed by the psychologists using actuarial analysis together with dynamic risk assessment.
Although the result of the Static-99 analysis is challenged by the defendant as incorrect he falls into a group which, even if not defined as high risk has an identifiable risk of reoffending. If high risk he falls into a group with a % chance of recidivation within 5 years, 45% in ten years and 52% in fifteen years. The risk is of course lower if he is in a medium to high risk category.
 There has been considerable discussion during the course of the evidence about the significance of the classification of an individual using Static-99.
I accept that although a useful "tool" it has significant limitations when being used to predict the likely future behaviour of an individual. Although it may have validity in identifying the group into which a particular individual falls the propensity for that individual to offend in the future may be at the higher or lower end of individuals in that group.
 The relevant statutory provisions do not directly respond to this method of assessment. Accordingly, during the course of concurrent evidence sessions a number of the witnesses were asked their view of the chance of Mr Winters reoffending. Dr Allnutt said that assessing someone as high risk under
Static-99 is relative: "All that Static-99 is saying is that this person falls into the highest risk groups as compared to the highest rate of recidivism for that group, that's all it says. Then the next thing one needs to consider, because the question is how much risk are people prepared to tolerate - I'm not talking about this case in general; I'm just talking about this in general, if we take it out of the court and take it out of this, how many deaths is an anaesthetic department prepared to .... tolerate to say that its service is working adequately. Probably one in a hundred thousand or one in a thousand, certain percentage. If it was one in a hundred, that's 1% they might say your service is at high risk.
 Dr Allnutt said that he did not think in any scientific sense we can answer the question. Each expert is likely to have a different view about the matter. Because they are assessing the prospective behaviour of an individual there is a lack of objective material to justify the validity of any predictions. Without consideration of a management plan Dr Allnutt thought it was difficult to say whether or not Mr Winters would be likely to reoffend.
 Ms Sahm answered the question by saying that it was difficult to answer because Mr Winters has not been forthcoming about his offending. When asked "can you predict the degree of probability of him reoffending at all Ms Sahm answered: "Well, that's - that is a bigger question than I can answer." Dr Nielssen said: "It's kind of inappropriate to ask psychiatrists to make predictions really about people and especially when there seems to be such a scatter gun approach of everyone who gets a 6 and above in Static-99. But having said that, I can see the advantages of having the condition to have either parole supervision or this kind of supervision for someone like Mr Winters and he needs a bit of help and needs a bit of supervision, so that's not a bad call and then I'm confident that the treatment plan we have all agreed to, you know would reduce the risk from the - about a 39% risk to something a good deal lower." Mr Bright was asked his opinion as to whether there was a more than 50% chance of Mr Winters reoffending if released to the community. He responded by saying that he did not know of any process or procedure that any clinician can use to make that kind of prediction.
 Ms Howell was of the opinion that no-one could say to a high degree of probability that it was likely that Mr Winters would commit a further serious sex offence if released unsupervised.
 Mr Ware said: "I know of perhaps no-one that could make that prediction with 50 percent probability whether someone would commit a sexual offence without supervision or not." Mr Rendell expressed his opinion in the following terms: "To my rather simplistic way of thinking it is only becoming clear to me in the last hour really that on the statistical information that we have been selectively discussing here for some time, the risks are 50/50 over 15 years, on a guy in that group, That's all we know. And if, as his Honour mentioned, the call is about being some proportion above 50 percent, I couldn't possibly say. I can hardly say if they are the basic statistics you come from and then you throw in the management plan clearly it has got to be reduced on some level. That's really a simplistic way that I see it so I wouldn't make a call.
I think it is a very tough call." 
The management plan Apart from being asked their opinion as to the risk of Mr Winters reoffending the witnesses were asked to provide assistance in determining whether adequate supervision could be provided for Mr Winters if he was released into the community. As I have indicated the parties worked in cooperation to prepare a draft plan of management to provide the conditions if he was released under an extended supervision order. The plaintiff prepared a response to the plan. I have annexed a copy of each document as Annexures A and B to these reasons.
 The proposed management plan was discussed with each of the experts when evidence was given concurrently. Dr O'Dea was of the view that it was appropriate as was Dr Nielssen. Dr Nielssen said that it was "a very good plan" and although "we can't completely eliminate risk but we cannot predict it but it will be greatly reduced in its current form with the plan in its current form from the base line which was already 50/50." Dr Allnutt said that the plan "is a reasonably appropriate management plan to manage a high risk offender. Whether or not it is going to be effective in this particular case or ... going to reduce his risk is very difficult for me to say." Mr Bright was asked by counsel: "Do you accept whatever level his risk may be, that that particular proposed management plan with the two visits to Ms Howell would appropriately manage his risk were he to be released into the community, that is manage his risk?" He responded: "If he were to hold to the management plan as Dr Allnutt outlined, I think that there are indications that he would manage his risk and I would be more confident in that the longer he was in treatment." However, Mr Bright did not believe the management plan was the best treatment for Mr Winters. In his opinion this would be provided by participation in a group based therapy such as CUBIT. Because CUBIT is not presently available in the community Mr Bright could see no alternative but the continued incarceration of Mr Winters.
 Mr Ware was asked to comment on these matters. He responded: "If I may, at the end of the day, as I suggested earlier, clinically we need to make a decision based on the evidence and the information and the fact that we have and - and this is where the probability becomes difficult for us, but we have got a man here that, if I understand it correctly, has stated an intention to reoffend. Has not completed any treatment at all. The issues that were involved in the initiation and facilitation of his offending have not been addressed. We have got no evidence they have been addressed. In fact, if anything, we have got evidence in a very highly structured environment he was still engaging in sexual behaviours. So - and there is a number of other things yet to be addressed and, as Dr Allnutt said, anti-libidinal medication is not a hundred percent fix-all, knock-out drug. Men will reoffend while on anti-libidinal medication so even though we can't say 50% chance, in my view on the balance of all these particular - or that source of information, I would have grave concerns and often the other very non-clinical test that I would perhaps ask myself is would I be happy if this man lived next door to my children." Later, he said: "The issue for me is that the plan, as David Bright was saying, needs to take some time to kick in and we have got evidence that this man, Mr Winters, has been non-compliant with anti-libidinal medical on two previous occasions.
In a different context, admittedly. So I think the best judge or whether this is -a judgment of whether this is an acceptable plan would be in the future and that is a very difficult position for us to be in." Mr Rendell said the plan has some merit and supervision and monitoring is well covered. However, initially he said that he had some concerns about the vagueness of the psychological treatment and was concerned whether Mr Winters would be sufficiently motivated to adequately participate in it. He would have greater confidence if there was an established relationship between Ms Howell and Mr Winters before he left prison.
 Later, Mr Rendell acknowledged: "I also feel that if he were released today under that plan that, I dare say, that he could be managed adequately. I also feel that, as is not uncommon in almost any form of psychological therapy, that early on often the problem gets worse rather than better for a period of time. So I would expect that we would feel more comfortable the longer Mr Winters was engaged if positively treated. And the final thing I think for me is that it's been spoken of many times, the risk elevate - or keeps elevating over a very long period of time, so if this plan were implemented and Mr Winters were released into the community, I wouldn't feel comfortable unless it was implemented for the full period of time that's been nominated." Ms Howell said of the plan: ""I agree with Mr Rendell with the plan in place. I think Mr Winters could be managed in the community. The only other possible factor in terms of immediate risk may be that Mr Winters is very aware, I would think, that he runs a great risk of being reincarcerated should he offend and in terms of, you know, early days in the community. I think that Mr Winters has demonstrated to me some interest in participating in a community-based option and I think he's very aware of the risks, so I like the idea of the plan. I think that it does adequately meet Mr Winters' needs in terms of management in the community." Ms Sahm expressed the view that without supervision, it would seem likely that Mr Winters could reoffend. When asked whether the plan was acceptable to manage Mr Winters' risk she said: "I would have to say no." When asked her opinion in the context of a proposed management plan if Mr Winters was released she said "I think that there is enough to suggest that a multi- disciplinary case management plan for offenders in the community has the best outcome and this plan would suggest that it covers that." Each of Mr Bright, Ms Sahm, Mr Ware and Mr Rendell were asked this question: "DALTON: So, what his Honour, as I understood, was looking for was whether each of you agreed and it was clear, it was clear from the psychologists, that you all considered it is an optimal desire, I believe, that he do CUBIT but what his Honour was asking, as I understood it, was in CUBIT not being available, he not doing CUBIT, is the plan that is being developed adjustment to its intensity to be two visits a week at least with the psychologist an acceptable management plan for the appropriate management of his risks? I am not suggesting there is no risk at all." Their respective answers were: "BRIGHT: I would say yes in that case.
 
SAHM: Yes.
 
WARE: Yes.
 
RENDELL: Yes." 
Conclusion The decision which I am required to make has two steps. Section 17(2) requires the Court to determine whether an offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if not kept under supervision. That question must be answered having regard to my understanding of the correct approach to the statutory test. The evidence of each of the psychologists and psychiatrists reveals considerable uncertainty with respect to this question. However, the stated intention of Mr Winters is to reoffend. No evidence was called from Mr
Winters or any one else to deny this intention. For that reason I am relevantly satisfied. Mr Winters does not oppose the making of an extended supervision order.
 Accordingly, it is necessary for me to determine whether adequate supervision can be provided by an extended supervision order. If it cannot, I must consider whether a continuing detention order should be made (see
Gallagher NSWCA [38]). I have already discussed the standard by which the adequacy of the supervision must be assessed. In Tillman Bell J accepted that the supervision should, at the least, substantially reduce the likelihood that the defendant will reoffend. Mr Winters argues for a lower threshold.
 Whatever be the appropriate test, whether or not adequate supervision can be provided under an extended supervision order depends on the likely effectiveness in this case of the draft Risk Management Plan and whether Mr
Winters will both comply with it and respond to the contemplated treatment.
 I have previously related the essential evidence of each of the experts on the effectiveness of the proposed plan if Mr Winters is released. Dr O'Dea and
Dr Nielssen were satisfied that the plan was appropriate. Dr Allnutt had some reservations.
 I place particular confidence in the evidence of Mr Rendell. He has had very considerable experience with sexual offenders, both inside and outside the prison system. He does not, as do the other psychologists, presently have a professional involvement with the CUBIT program in the way which they have.
However, he has had the opportunity, over many years, to consult with, supervise and observe the behaviour of, sexual offenders, particularly when released from the prison system. His confidence that the plan would provide appropriate management of the defendant's risk of reoffending, in my view, should be given very considerable weight. To my mind, it is of greater significance than any reservations of the psychologists involved with the
CUBIT program. It must be remembered that, although there is evidence that the
CUBIT program does have positive outcomes, that evidence is limited, and whether it has any significant benefit for high risk offenders is still uncertain.
 The conditions proposed, if Mr Winters was released, are strict. Although his movements could not be completely controlled, and an opportunity for reoffending entirely excluded, those conditions can be monitored and, if his behaviour suggests a risk of reoffending, action could be taken to bring him to counselling. The continuing administration of anti-libidinal medication will, based on past experience, significantly reduce his sex drive. Of course, his continuing ability to accept this form of medication remains uncertain.
 But for two matters, I would have been satisfied that adequate supervision could be provided by an extended supervision order. In the words of the statute, the consequence of the two problems is that I cannot be satisfied that adequate supervision could be provided by an extended supervision order.
 The conditions of such an order would generally follow those in the draft plan presented by Mr Winters. Although the detail would require further consideration, the plan contemplates a program of intensive one-on-one treatment with Ms Howell, or another appropriate psychologist. Ms Howell is available to provide that treatment, and she is confident that it would be effective. She has very considerable experience in treating sex offenders, and
I have complete confidence in her judgment.
 However, the capacity to fund Ms Howell's services has proved an ultimate stumbling block in this case. I have been told that no funds are available from the Government to provide for her fees, with the consequence that the contemplated treatment would not be available.
 The practical effect is that legislation has been put in place which provides for the retention of persons such as Mr Winters in prison beyond the completion of their sentence who, if appropriate community resources were provided, could be released. It is not difficult to envisage, having regard to the evidence in this case, a circumstance where the effect may be that a person is incarcerated indefinitely. It could only be in the most extreme of cases that the legislature intended that an offender who had served his sentence would never again be released.
 These problems have been confronted in other States: see The State of
Western Australia versus Alvisse  <case> in which Murray J records the fact that the need for suitable community based treatment has been identified and is being addressed [47].
 However, the need for an attempt to be made at effective treatment in Mr
Winters' case is confirmed by the evidence of Mr Dentrinos. As I have already indicated he said that Mr Winters has said that he intends to reoffend when released. Whether this statement was made with intent, or merely designed to cause alarm, I cannot assess. Mr Winters did not give evidence. However, that statement, together with the lack of available treatment, persuades me that, whatever be the relevant standard, and in any event even to the threshold contended for by the defendant, adequate supervision of Mr Winters cannot be provided by an extended supervision order.
 Without intensive psychological counselling, Mr Winters' risk of reoffending would remain largely undiminished, particularly when his ability to continue anti-libidinal medication has not been confirmed.
 In these circumstances, I have come to the view that a continuing detention order should be made.
 The Attorney General asks for an order for a period of five years. To my mind this is not appropriate. As I have indicated, if I was confident that the management plan could be implemented and carried out, I would have made an extended supervision order.
 The psychologists who gave evidence before me believe that Mr Winters should be treated in the CUBIT program before his release. They also believe that he should now be able to complete that program which may enable his release, pursuant to an extended supervision order with conditions which can be adequately resourced. The CUBIT program takes a minimum of eight months and can be completed within twelve months. In these circumstances, an order which provides for Mr Winters to be detained for twelve months from today's date is appropriate. This will enable Mr Winters to undergo the CUBIT program and receive appropriate medication with an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of the treatment regime. It will require the Attorney General to make an application within the twelve months period if he seeks to continue Mr
Winters' detention or facilitate his release under supervision.

Abuse of Process As I have indicated Mr Winters filed a Motion in which he sought the following order: "to temporarily stay proceedings until such time as government funding is made available or services otherwise provided for the psychological treatment the defendant should receive pursuant to the post release plan recommended upon the evidence." The defendant submitted that the Attorney General's conduct in instituting the proceedings constitutes an abuse of process, which justifies an order for a stay. The foundation for that submission is the identified lack of funding for intensive psychological counselling for Mr Winters within the community.
 This Court has inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings as an abuse of process (Williams versus Spautz <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 509] at 518). The power to stay proceedings is confirmed by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s67.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/). Pursuant to [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) r 13.4, the court may order that the proceedings be dismissed, if it appears that the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the court.
 The circumstances which may constitute an abuse of process vary and the categories are not closed. (Batistatos versus Roads and Traffic Authority  <case>; <case> per
Gleeson CJ, Gummow J, Hayne J and Crennan J). Proceedings that are: (i) instituted for an improper or illegitimate purpose; (ii) seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging or 'productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment' such as unreasonable delay (at [14]); are frivolous, vexatious or oppressive, especially if they raise anew a res judicata; (iv) foredoomed to fail; (v) instituted in an inappropriate forum; or (vi) liable to bring the administration of justice into disrepute may all be an abuse of process (see Batistatos at [14]-[15]; Williams v
Spautz <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 509)] There are two policy considerations of particular relevance in criminal proceedings but which to my mind are relevant to proceedings under the legislation invoked by the Attorney General in the present proceedings: "The first is that the public interest in the administration of justice requires that the court protect its ability to function as a court of law by ensuring that its processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. The second is that, unless the court protects its ability so to function in that way, its failure will lead to an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice." (Batistatos at [8]) The defendant submitted that the Attorney General maintained these proceedings in the full knowledge that his office will not pay for or organise the intensive one-on-one psychological treatment for Mr Winters contemplated in the draft Risk Management Plan, and furthermore in the knowledge that no other government agency will fund or provide the necessary treatment. Because the proposed psychological treatment cannot be provided it was submitted that the court's capacity to make an extended supervision order was entirely removed.
 The defendant emphasised that Ms Howell had given evidence that she was privately treating two high risk serious sex offenders, one of whom had not completed the CUBIT program, and that funding for this treatment was provided through the Probation and Parole Service. In these circumstances, the defendant submitted that the application was "unfair, oppressive and constitutes an abuse of process". Counsel relied on an analogy with Dietrich v The Queen <case>; [(1992) 177 CLR 292.] In that case, an indigent accused charged with a serious offence was denied legal aid funding for his representation. The High Court held that as a result he was denied a fair trial. His lack of legal representation denied him a real chance of acquittal. Likewise, on behalf of
Mr Winters it was submitted that through no fault of his own (as he does not have any private funds) but because no government funding is available, he could not receive the psychological treatment which was agreed to be required if he was released.
 In these circumstances the defendant submitted that: one of the court's available discretionary options was frustrated or effectively removed, with the full knowledge of the plaintiff; and therefore the application was an attempt to manipulate this Court into a position where it will be forced to grant a continuing detention order and act as a "mere instrument of government policy"; the defendant cannot receive a fair hearing; and these proceedings constitute "an affront to the community's sense of confidence in the public administration of justice".
 The plaintiff emphasised that the Attorney General's Department does not fund the provision of private psychological counselling services to individuals. The responsibility of providing psychological treatment for offenders rests with the Department of Corrective Services, which operates its own programs such as CUBIT, which are group-based programs. No one-on-one or community-based treatment programs are provided. The plaintiff submitted that the evidence confirms that although Ms Howell has been paid when treating two high-risk serious sex offenders the circumstances were exceptional. I accept this submission. It was further submitted that the unavailability of funding by the plaintiff for the one-on-one private psychological treatment of the defendant in the community was not a matter of unfair discrimination. Funding for such an arrangement is simply not available from any potential source, be it government or charitable. It was submitted that decisions as to whether or not to provide funding were policy questions to be determined by government and it was a legitimate exercise of the discretion to deny funding for one-on- one counselling.
 The plaintiff submitted that the lack of one-on-one counselling in the community does not frustrate the purposes of the Act. CUBIT, with its group therapy approach and 24 hours support of participants in a therapeutic community, provides for the rehabilitation for persons such as the defendant and protection of the safety of the community. It was submitted that in these proceedings, the Court is "being asked to do no more than apply the terms of the Act to the circumstances of the Defendant on the evidence as presented".
There is no evidence of improper purpose on the part of the Attorney General or any attempt to have the court act as an instrument of government policy.
 The plaintiff submitted that the defendant's complaint was properly characterised as one concerning the fairness of the outcome of the application under the Act rather than the fairness of the hearing or process. It was submitted that the defendant's reliance upon Dietrich was misplaced, given that the decision in that case was about the right to a fair trial and not the outcome of that trial. Any unfairness of the outcome following the proper application of the legislation was a matter for the Parliament.
 Finally, the plaintiff submitted that these proceedings are not manifestly unfair and would not otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people, simply because of the unavailability of an essential feature of a risk management plan. There can be any number of reasons outside the control of the defendant and the Attorney General or any other government agency, which might prevent a critical feature from being available to a particular defendant.
 In my judgment the Attorney General's submission must be accepted. The plaintiff does not complain, and nor could he, that the proceedings in this
Court were unfair. Both Mr Winters and the Attorney General have been provided with extensive opportunities to place evidence before the court and make relevant submissions.
 Mr Winters' application for a stay was made in anticipation that I would find that in the absence of intensive one-on-one counselling in the community, in the exercise of my discretion Mr Winters should not be released. This outcome became increasingly likely as the concurrent evidence sessions occurred. As it happens the lack of community based treatment is material to my decision to make a detention order. However, the fact that it is not available to Mr Winters is as a result of two factors. Firstly, as a matter of policy the government has presently determined that it will not support one- on-one counselling in the community other than in extraordinary circumstances.
Secondly, Mr Winters' personal impecuniosity means that he cannot meet the cost of treatment from his own resources.
 Whether Mr Winters' failure to complete the CUBIT program during his prison term was due in any degree to his own choice or was entirely a product of his psychological difficulties I could not determine. The Attorney-General places substantial responsibility on Mr Winters. The desirability of Mr
Winters completing a treatment program is not questioned. Whether he can now do so in group session has yet to be determined. During the course of the next twelve months Mr Winters' response to group treatment will become apparent. If it happens that he remains unable to complete a group based program I would expect that the responsible authorities will endeavour to ensure that alternative treatment is available.
 The confined treatment regime which is presently available is a result of decisions taken by government on the advice of the experts who are available to it. However, the evidence before me, leaving aside the question of the required financial resources, suggests that there are significant questions as to whether group therapy within a penal institution is the only appropriate treatment for some offenders. There are also questions as to the effectiveness of group treatment in reducing the likelihood of recidivism amongst a person classified as a high risk sex offender. If the evidence justified a conclusion that treatment would be of no benefit to any individual the discretion given to the court by the legislation would have to be exercised with this fact in mind. It would only be in the most extreme case that a person would never be released although the stringency of any conditions controlling their activities in the community would require careful consideration.
 In the present case the need for Mr Winters to receive counselling is not doubted. If, which is not the case, no counselling of any form was available, the court would nevertheless have to consider whether Mr Winters should be released. Given that, because of the cost, treatment is only available within the prison system I have been required in the exercise of my discretion to determine whether release under supervision would be appropriate.
 The fact that the policy decisions of government confine the range of treatment options which are available does not mean that by bringing the present proceedings and arguing that a form of treatment is essential if Mr
Winters is to be released the proceedings are an abuse of process. If the
Attorney General argued that treatment was essential, but no treatment regime was available at all, to my mind the proceedings would not be an abuse. The proceedings would be brought in accordance with the legislation enacted by the
Parliament. However, in these circumstances, the exercise of the discretion would be informed by the fact that facilities which the Attorney General said were essential were simply not available.
 In my judgment Mr Winters' submission that the position is analogous to that in Dietrich is not correct. Abuse of process is essentially concerned with the conduct of the proceedings. A fair hearing entails fairness of the process. Perceptions of the fairness of the outcome is another matter.
 In Dietrich, the denial (through no fault of the indigent accused) of legal aid and legal representation directly affected the accused's right to a fair trial. In the present case, the lack of funding to provide one-on-one psychological treatment for the defendant does not affect, directly or indirectly, the fairness of the hearing although it is relevant to the decision which must be made.
 It may be that the decision which a court will make in the exercise of its discretion will be judged by the Attorney General or the offender to be unfair. In that event the decision can be reviewed, in accordance with the relevant principles by the Court of Appeal. However, if it is the situation that the court's decision is a result of the legislative policy, reflected in the Act when applied to the circumstances of a particular individual, the court would never be justified in refusing to exercise jurisdiction (see
Fardon versus Attorney General for the State of Queensland <case>; <case>).
 The constitutional validity of the Act cannot now be doubted (see
Fardon). Under the Act this Court exercises the discretion provided by <case> having regard to the evidence before it and independently of any instruction, advice or wish of the legislative or executive branches of government. No policy is imposed on the Court, in a manner analogous to an administrative decision-maker acting under dictation.
 For those reasons I made the following orders: . The notice of motion filed by the defendant on 14 September 2007 is dismissed.
 . I order that Christopher Paul Winters be detained in a correctional centre for one year from today.
Pursuant to <case> of the Act, I issue a warrant for the committal of
Christopher Paul Winters to a correctional centre for the duration of the continuing detention order in order 2 above.
