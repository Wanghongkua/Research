STATE REVENUE 
JUDGMENT  
Synopsis Oakland Property Holdings Pty Limited acquired two commercial properties in
New South Wales, each for a stated price and each subject to an obligation on the part of the vendor to repay portion of the purchase price. The Chief
Commissioner of State Revenue assessed duty on the stated purchase price.
Oakland submits that in the one case it should have been assessed on the net amount after deducting the refund and in the other case upon the unencumbered value of the property, which was greater than the net amount.
 
The statutory regime Relevantly for present purposes, duty is charged on an agreement for sale or transfer of dutiable property under the [Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/), [s (1)(b)(i).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s8.html)
Land in New South Wales is dutiable property in terms of [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s11.html)
Duty is charged as if the agreements for sale were transfers of the dutiable property in terms of [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s9.html)
Duty is charged on the dutiable value of the dutiable property in terms of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s19.html) [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s21.html) defines the dutiable value of the dutiable property. It was in the following terms: "The dutiable value of dutiable property that is subject to a dutiable transaction is the greater of: the consideration (if any) for the dutiable transaction (being the amount of a monetary consideration or the value of a non-monetary consideration), and the unencumbered value of the dutiable property." [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s23.html) defines the unencumbered value of dutiable property as the value of the property determined without regard to any encumbrance to which the property was subject.
 
The Chatswood property Oakland executed an agreement for sale of land at Chatswood as purchaser.
The agreement specified a price of $26,500,000, a deposit of $1,250,000 and a balance of purchase price of $25,250,000.
 At the same time as it executed the contract for sale, Oakland executed a deed with the vendor that provided: "At the same time as the Purchaser pays the balance of the Purchase Price to the Vendor, the Vendor agree [sic] to pay the Purchaser the amount of $1,625,000 to be applied towards payment by the Purchaser of any fitout rebate or fitout allowance that is payable to any prospective tenant of the
Property." The settlement statement showed a balance of purchase price of $25,250,000 subject to adjustments and from which was subtracted $1,625,000 described as: "LESS SIDE DEED ALLOWANCE: 
Vendor to allow to purchaser." The deed required the vendor to provide the purchaser on settlement with a letter in specified form addressed to the Chief Commissioner. The vendor did so. The letter contained the following: "We confirm that an amount of $1,625,000 has been applied in reduction of the purchase price of the property sold in accordance with the deed dated 12
December 2006 between Oakland Property Holdings Pty Ltd and Help St Pty Ltd." Two valuers jointly valued the unencumbered value of the Chatswood property at $22,500,000. The Chief Commissioner did not challenge that valuation.
 Oakland submits that the duty should have been calculated on $24,875,000 as the effective consideration for the dutiable transaction it being greater than the unencumbered value of the Chatswood property.
 
The Macquarie Park land In another transaction Oakland executed an agreement for sale of land in
Macquarie Park as purchaser. The stated price was $23,000,000 with a deposit of $2,300,000 and a balance of purchase price of $20,700,000.
 Again, at the same time as it executed the contract for sale, Oakland executed a deed which contained the following: "If the Purchaser completes the Contract of Sale by 5.00pm on 30 June , then at the same time as the Purchaser pays the balance of the Purchase
Price to the Vendor, the Vendor agrees to pay the Purchaser the Repayment
Amount, representing a partial repayment of the Purchase Price. The Repayment
Amount is to be applied towards payment by the Purchaser of any fitout or capital works rebate that is payable to any prospective tenant of the
Property." 
The Repayment Amount was defined to mean $1,670,928.
 The settlement statement showed purchase price, deposit and balance of purchase price of $21,850,000 to which adjustments were made. The final adjustment was: "Less repayment amount $1,670,928." Again the deed required the vendor to provide Oakland with a letter, which it did. The letter, addressed to the office of the Chief Commissioner, included the following statement: "We confirm that an amount of $1,670,928 has been repaid to Oakland
Property Holdings Pty Limited and applied in reduction of the purchase price of the property sold." The valuers put a figure of $22,000,000 on the unencumbered value of the
Macquarie Park land, which, again, was not challenged by the Chief
Commissioner.
 Oakland submits that duty should have been charged on $22,000,000 being greater than the consideration for the dutiable transaction that Oakland maintained was the net figure of $21,329,072 after deducting the Repayment
Amount.
 
Analysis  In Archibald Howie Pty Ltd versus Commissioner of Stamp Duties  <case>; [(1948) 77 CLR 143] at 152, Dixon J said of the word "consideration" in the context of the [Stamp Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/), that it should receive the wider meaning or operation that belongs to it in conveyancing rather than the more precise meaning of the law of simple contracts. Consideration was the money or value passing which moved the conveyance or transfer.
 In Shop and Store Developments Ltd versus Commissioners of Inland Revenue [[1967] 1 AC 472] at 503, Lord Wilberforce said: "In the first place, the phrase "consideration for the transfer or conveyance" seems to me to refer clearly and naturally to that which passed to the transferor company "for" the transferred properties." Both these passages were endorsed by the majority of the High Court in
Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (New South Wales) versus Dick Smith
Electronics Holdings Pty Ltd <case>; <case>-[72] where their Honours concluded: "The criterion in the Act of consideration "for" the transaction, being the Agreement for the sale and transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser, upon whom <case> imposes the liability to pay the duty, looks to what was received by the Vendors so as to move the transfers to the Purchaser as stipulated in the
Agreement." Oakland submitted that the mere form of the documents and whether comprised in one instrument or, as here, in a contact for sale and a deed was not determinative. The court could look at the real nature or substance of the transaction in order to ascertain whether the instruments are properly characterised by their purported description and the form they take. Reference was made to what was said by Phillips JA in Coles Myer Ltd versus Commissioner of
State Revenue <case>; [[1998] 4 VR 728] at 746.
 It was submitted that the "rebates" in each case effectively reduced the consideration for the transaction with the effect that duty should have been determined by reference to the net amount in the case of the Chatswood property and the unencumbered value with respect to the Macquarie Park property.
 The fact that on each settlement the "rebate" was set off so that cheques for a net amount were drawn, cannot alter the proper construction of the contracts for sale and the deeds. Similar considerations apply to the vendors' letters. Their opinions cannot influence the proper construction of the documents in question.
 True it is that the economic effect of the transactions was that Oakland was out of pocket by the net amount in each case. But consideration for the purposes of the [Duties
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/), [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s21.html) is not a matter of economic equivalence. It is question of determining whether the deeds, upon their proper construction reduced the stated consideration in the contracts for sale.
 The amounts payable under the deeds were not expressed to be in reduction of the purchase price. The deeds were couched in terms that if the balance of the purchase price was paid, the vendors would make the payments to which they had agreed. What was contemplated, then, in each transaction was the payment of the balance of the purchase price by Oakland. That is highly suggestive of two separate transactions in each case: one for the purchase of the land; the other a payment by the vendor to offset fitout costs and the like.
 In the case of the deed with respect to the Macquarie Park property, the addition of the words: "representing a partial repayment of the Purchase
Price" cannot dictate the conclusion that that is what the payment was.
 And, in any event, a partial refund of purchase price is different from a rebate of the purchase price. A rebate is an allowance similar to a discount, which has the effect of reducing the purchase price before payment of it. A refund occurs after the purchase price has been paid by a payment from vendor to purchaser. In the former case there is but one transaction. In the latter case there are two transactions.
 And the latter is the present situation. In each case, under one transaction Oakland was obliged to pay the purchase price under the contract for sale while under another transaction, the vendor was obliged to pay
Oakland upon completion of the first transaction.
 This interpretation of the provision in the deeds is enforced by their second recitals. They state that provided the contracts for sale are completed in accordance with their terms, the vendors agree to make the payments.
 Thus, if there was no completion of the transactions in accordance with the terms of the contracts for sale, there was no obligation on the vendors to make the payments.
 The moneys payable under the two deeds were not at large. Oakland was obliged to utilise the payments to offset fit out rebates and the like. This is in contrast to a refund of purchase price where the purchaser is entitled to use the money as seen fit.
 The payments under the deeds were neither rebates of the purchase price nor refunds of the purchase price. The payments were, as the deeds, in ordinary
English provided, consideration for Oakland's promise to use the moneys to offset any fit out rebates and the like it was required to extend to tenants of the properties.
 
Conclusion In the case of the Chatswood property, Oakland has failed to establish that the Chief Commissioner ought to have calculated duty on the amount of $24,875,000 being the purchase price of $26,500,000 less the payment under the deed of $1,625,000.
 The Chief Commissioner was entitled to assess duty on $26,500,000 as the consideration for the dutiable transaction under the [Duties
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/), [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s21.html), it being greater than the unencumbered value of the Chatswood property of $22,500,000.
 With respect to the Macquarie Park property, Oakland has failed to establish that the consideration for the dutiable transaction under the [Duties Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/), [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s21.html) was $21,329,072, being the purchase price of $23,000,000 less the payment under the deed of $1,670,928 so that the Chief Commissioner ought to have calculated duty on the amount of $22,000,000 under [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s21.html) on the basis that the unencumbered value of the property was greater than the consideration.
 The Chief Commissioner was entitled to assess duty on $23,000,000 as the consideration for the dutiable transaction under the [Duties
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/), [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s21.html) it being greater than the unencumbered value of the Macquarie Park property of $22,000,000.
 The summons is dismissed with costs.
