WILLIAM HANS MCCORRISTON versus SAMUEL MCCORRISTON /95 
WEDNESDAY 22 MAY 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
MEAGHER JA, POWELL JA, BEAZLEY JA 
CATCHWORDS: COSTS - SUCCESSFUL PLAINTIFF AT COMMON LAW SEEKS TO RECOVER COSTS IN WORKERS COMPENSATION PROCEEDINGS 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED EX TEMPORE 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED DISMISSED 
JUDGMENT 
MEAGHER JA: In this matter the worker sued in the first instance for Workers Compensation and was successful in that regard. The Compensation Court on 29 August 1994 made a number of orders in his favour. The fifth of those orders was; that the respondent, that is to say the employer, pay the applicant's costs forthwith after they had been agreed or taxed.

Later the employer took out proceedings before his Honour to vary or correct the costs order previously made on the basis that the worker was prosecuting his common law rights, as he was entitled to do, and did not wish to accept the monies owing to him under the Workers Compensation Award.

His Honour found favour with the employer's application to revise the previous order. His Honour on 26 April 1995 made the following order; that the applicant's solicitors have no costs in relation to the proceedings herein.
That in fact was a revocation of the order I have recited made by his Honour.

What his Honour in effect decided was, that if the applicant worker wished to indulge in the luxury of conducting two parallel streams of litigation, one at
Workers Compensation and one at Common Law, he should not expect to be entitled as of right to have his employer pay the costs of the Workers
Compensation proceedings.

There can be no doubt that he can prosecute both sets of proceedings but there is no reason why he should expect to do so entirely at his employer's expense.
His Honour had jurisdiction under [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s17.html) of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/), and no question of res judicata arises.

In my view, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

POWELL JA: I agree.

BEAZLEY JA: I agree.

MEAGHER JA: The order therefore, is the appeal be dismissed with costs.
