REGINA versus NATHAN ROBERT REYNOLDS /98 July 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: Mr. Jauncey, with the very best will in the world, what you have said really relates to matters that are already embraced by his Honour's decision. That decision was on 3 June 1998, it is now only mid-July. The matters will be before a court within roughly a month, all of them. I have no right nor power to overrule a judgment of another judge of this court who has already dealt with these very matters. As to the first matter you raise, his Honour contemplated the prospect of acquittals. As to the second matter, that is merely a normal hiccup in listing. It is clear to me that in those circumstances, in the light of the case law on s.22A, I should not entertain this application and I decline to do so. 
The application will be marked "not entertained pursuant to s.22A of the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/)". I will place
Mr. Justice Dunford's judgment back on the file.

I am sorry Mr. Reynolds, bail is refused.
