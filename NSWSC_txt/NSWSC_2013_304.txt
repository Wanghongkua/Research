JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: These reasons are given and orders made in each of matters 2013/28972, Dowdon Civil Contractors Pty Ltd versus Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer and 2013/38808, Hansen Yuncken Pty Ltd versus Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer. 
Each of the applicants is a defendant in proceedings which were commenced in the District Court of New South Wales (No 2011/291295) and have been removed to the Common Law Division of this Court (No 2013/24950). Hansen Yuncken was apparently the builder of a construction site. Dowdon was apparently a contractor to Hansen Yuncken. Dowdon in turn engaged Sporty's Transport Pty Ltd, of which the plaintiff in the Common Law proceedings, Mr Mark Milton Mahlberg, was an employee. Mr Mahlberg was injured in an accident on 13 September 2008. He sued Hansen Yuncken for damages on 24 May 2012.
Dowdon was joined as a defendant in the District Court proceedings on 24 May 2012, although not so identified in the proceedings filed in this case. 
Sporty's Transport Pty Ltd was wound up on 12 October 2011. There is some suggestion that this Court, on 30 March 2012, granted leave to Mr Mahlberg to proceed against Sporty's, his employer, as a company in liquidation, but it has not been possible at this stage to verify whether that is so. Dowdon and Hansen Yuncken wish to claim contribution from Sporty's - or more accurately from Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer, as insurer of Sporty's. 
Each applicant has filed a summons claiming the following relief:
Leave be granted, nunc pro tunc, to the Applicant pursuant to [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to issue a
Cross-Claim against the Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer in respect of proceedings commenced in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney, file no 2011/291255, and continue with those proceedings.
In the alternative, that leave be granted, nunc pro tunc, pursuant to [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that the
Applicant be at liberty to file a Cross-Claim in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) naming the Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer as a Cross-Defendant.
That each party bear its own costs of this Application.
Such further orders as the Court deems fit.
Pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html), a person may recover from the insurer of a deregistered company an amount that was payable to the company under the insurance contract if the company had a liability to the person, and the insurance contract covered that liability immediately before registration. 
A number of observations need to be made about that provision. First, it refers to a company that is deregistered. A company in liquidation is not thereby deregistered; deregistration is a subsequent process that follows completion of the liquidation. The company search in evidence indicates that Sporty's remains under external administration and has not yet been deregistered. Accordingly, it would seem that [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) is not, at least at present, applicable. 
Secondly, if the section were applicable, there is no requirement to obtain leave before invoking it. The section gives a right to proceed directly against the insurer of a deregistered company. Accordingly, the first claim in each originating process, for "leave" pursuant to [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) to issue a cross-claim against the Workers Compensation Nominal Insurer, is misconceived.
The second claim for relief is expressed as a claim for leave "nunc pro tunc" pursuant to [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) of the (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to file a cross-claim pursuant to [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), [s 6.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) So far as the evidence discloses, no such cross-claim has yet been filed so the words "nunc pro tunc" are misconceived. Further, if what is sought is leave under [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), [s 6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html), then the references to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) are misconceived.
It seems to me that what the applicants probably want is leave pursuant to [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), [s 6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html), to commence proceedings to enforce the statutory charge created by that section against the relevant workers compensation insurer. Such leave is to be obtained, not from the Corporations Court, but from the court in which it is proposed to commence those proceedings. So far as appears at the present, the appropriate jurisdiction to consider that application would be the Common Law Division of this court, in which the substantive proceedings appear to be. 
I observe that there is no requirement to obtain leave under [s 6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) if the provisions of subsection (2) apply. [Section 6(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) provides: 
If, on the happening of the event giving rise to any claim for damages or compensation as aforesaid, the insured (being a corporation) is being wound up, or if any subsequent winding-up of the insured (being a corporation) is deemed to have commenced not later than the happening of that event, the provisions of subsection (1) shall apply notwithstanding the winding-up.
The insured in this case, being Sporty's, is being wound up. So far as the evidence discloses, the winding up commenced on 12 October 2011. The event giving rise to the claim for damages occurred on 13 September 2008, which was before the insured was wound up and before the deemed commencement of the winding up. Accordingly, subsection (2) does not apply, and leave is required. 
Although the insurer has indicated that it consents to being joined as a defendant, it is not at all clear that it consents to a grant of leave under [s 6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html), which invokes additional considerations (such as whether the insurer is entitled to disclaim). In any event, it seems to me that, if the matter is to be pursued, it should be pursued in conjunction with the substantive proceedings, as the proviso in [s 6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) contemplates.
I therefore order that the proceedings be transferred to the Common Law Division, to be listed in connection with proceedings 2013/ 24950.
