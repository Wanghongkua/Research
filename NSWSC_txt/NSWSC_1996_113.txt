MOREPINE PTY LTD V CRUSH PACIFIC INDUSTRIES PTY LTD /94 
Wednesday 8 May 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG, J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Crush Pacific Industries Pty Ltd ("the Company") was wound up by order of Master Macready on 15 February 1995 and Mr John Peter Smith of Messrs Horwath & Horwath was appointed liquidator. I will refer to Mr Smith as "the liquidator". The application for winding up was made by Morepine Pty Ltd to which I will refer as "the plaintiff".

The first paragraph of Master Macready's judgment is as follows:- "This is an application by the plaintiff for winding up based upon the actual insolvency of the defendant.

The plaintiff had previously brought proceedings based upon inter alia the just and equitable ground.

However, those other grounds were abandoned at the commencement of the proceedings and the matter proceeded only on the basis that the company was insolvent. There is no reliance upon failure to comply with a statutory demand in order to establish insolvency." 
In due course, the plaintiff's solicitors filed a bill of costs in the sum of $28,562.97 alleged to be costs "claimed in accordance with fee agreement". In addition, disbursements of $30,029.85 were claimed so that the plaintiff's solicitors claim to be paid pursuant to <case>(b) of the Corporations Law totalled the sum of $58,592.82.

On 12 March 1996, the liquidator filed a motion for directions as to the amount payable to the plaintiff pursuant to <case>(b) of the Corporations
Law and the amount of the bill of costs to which priority was to be afforded pursuant to that paragraph. Mr Hirst, solicitor, appeared for the liquidator and Mr R Freeman of counsel, appeared for the plaintiff.

It was established in the liquidator's affidavit or from concessions from the bar table, that the following were the basic facts:- 
A. The liquidator has funds available to him in the liquidation in the amount of $56,407.94.

B. The costs of obtaining an order for winding up which is given priority pursuant to <case>(b) are usually assessed in the region of $3,000 to $5,000.

C. The remuneration and expenses of the liquidator amount to $48,307.57.
Section 556(1)(a) expenses of $6,904.94 have been directly charged to the liquidator's bank account relating to the administration.

D. If the plaintiff's costs are paid in full there will be insufficient funds to pay any dividend at all to the unsecured creditors.

E. The plaintiff's costs are based on a cost agreement allowing a charge of $230 an hour plus disbursements.

F. The liquidator has received advice that the quantum of the plaintiff's solicitors' bill did not appear to be excessive on a party and party basis.

G. Master Macready's order was "That the plaintiff's costs be paid in accordance with the Corporations Law." 
Section 556(1) of the Corporations Law sets out a list of the ranking of payments which a liquidator is to make. So far as is relevant, it provides as follows:- "Subject to this Division, in the winding up of a company the following debts and claims must be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts and claims: first, expenses ... properly incurred by a relevant authority in preserving, realising or getting in property of the company, or in carrying on the company's business; if the Court ordered the winding up - next, the costs in respect of the application for the order (including the applicant's taxed costs payable under <case>) ... " 
Section 466 provides that: "(1) The persons ... on whose application any winding up order is made shall, at their own cost, prosecute all proceedings in the winding up until a liquidator has been appointed under this 
Part.

The liquidator shall, unless the Court orders otherwise, reimburse the applicant out of the property of the company the taxed costs incurred by the applicant in any such proceedings." 
Taxation of costs has now passed into history so far as this Court is concerned. "Taxation", pursuant to [ss
J](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208j.html), [208K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208k.html) and [208L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208l.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) means that the quantum of costs is to be determined by a costs assessor. A question that arises is how to marry <case> of the Corporations Law with these provisions of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).

Mr Freeman says that the case is extremely simple. The evidence shows that the plaintiff has run up a bill of costs in the sum claimed by its solicitors and under <case> it is entitled to an indemnity for those costs out of the company's assets. The evidence showing that a costs assessor would likely allow all these costs as reasonable on a party and party basis, there can be no argument because <case>(b) gives these costs second priority and in doing so, uses the word "must" when dictating the order for payment.

Mr Hirst, on the other hand, says that the Court can always "otherwise order" under <case>. The costs in the instant case have been increased above the normal because the just and equitable ground was originally included in the proceedings and only abandoned on the day of the hearing and the plaintiff entered into a costs agreement with its solicitor which has meant that the costs are far higher than they otherwise would have been. The riposte to this last point is that the law recognizes costs agreements, [ss
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208d.html) and [208H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208h.html) of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) limit unfair costs agreements and exclude them when costs are payable as a result of an order by a court. Within those exceptions, however, costs agreements should be able to be enforced.

Section 466 derives from <case> of the Companies Code which was examined in cases such as Niemann versus Commissioner for Corporate Affairs Vic <case>; [(1984) 9 ACLR 675.] Section 556, however, was only introduced into the Law by Act No 210 of 1992. Prior to its insertion, the order of priorities set out in the Bankruptcy Act applied. I have not found anything in the Explanatory
Memorandum to that Corporate Reform Act, 1992 which would assist on its construction.

There is no power in the Corporations Law for a court to do what is just in its own eyes with respect to the priorities set out in <case> of the Law. The
Law takes the form of requiring a pari passu ranking of creditors (s 555) subject to the priorities in <case> and it will be noted that <case> provides that the following claims "must" be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts. Accordingly, if the claim made by the plaintiff is for "costs in respect of the application for the order", then it wholly ranks in category .

The real problem is, what are the costs in respect of the application? It would seem that this is a wider category than the mere legal costs for two reasons. First, the wide words "in respect of" are employed, and secondly, the words in brackets "(including the applicant's taxed costs payable under s )" indicate that something more than those costs is included in the category.

As to the first point, the phrase "in respect of" is capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity: State Government
Insurance Office versus Crittenden <case>; [(1966) 117 CLR 412], 416; State Government Insurance Office versus Rees <case>; [(1979) 144 CLR 549], 553. However, normally one applies what Mann, CJ said in
Trustees Executors & Agency Co Ltd versus Reilly <case>; [[1941] VLR 110], 111, "The words `in respect of' are difficult of definition, but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation between the two subject-matters to which the words refer." 
One does read in English texts such as Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Ed
Reissue Vol 7(2) para 1806, that the Court may vary the order of priority in exceptional circumstances. However, when one looks at cases such as Re
London Metallurgical Co [[1895] 1 Ch 758] and In re
Bright; Ex parte Wingfield [[1903] 1 KB 735], as well as the text in Halsbury itself, it is quite plain that, first, priority is set out in Rules rather than in an Act and, secondly, that the English Rules themselves are subject to any order of the Court. In Australia, the priority is set out in the Act and there is no such escape clause.

Accordingly, one needs to go back to <case> of the Act to see what is covered by "the costs of the winding up". One can see that this means taxed costs, but that the Court has a discretion as to what order it will in fact make as to costs; see Re Mailrite Pty Ltd [(1985) 3 ACLC 528.] In the instant case, Master Macready ordered that costs be paid in accordance with the Corporations Law and that order was passed and entered. Normally when an order is passed and entered that is the end of the matter. Of course, an order of the Court which is ambiguous may be interpreted either in the initial proceedings or, in a proper case, by subsequent declaratory proceedings.

In the instant case, there is no real problem about interpreting the order because <case> must refer to a time subsequent to the making of the order of the Court. The liquidator is not a party to the proceedings when the winding up order is made and so has no opportunity to make submissions as to the form of the costs order. The liquidator has the right under <case> to seek the
Court's order that he should not reimburse the applicant the taxed costs ordered to be paid in the proceedings. Although there is no equivalent for costs and expenses over and above the taxed costs which are caught up by s (1)(b), this, to my mind, makes little difference.

When one looks at the bill in the instant case one can see considerable problems with it if one is just looking at it in terms of fairness between the plaintiff, the liquidator and the unsecured creditors. On the one hand it can be said that, on the evidence, the bill would be allowed by a costs assessor, but on the other hand, it is based on a costs agreement which, by virtue of s
G, should not be taken into account by a costs assessor if he or she is considering what costs are to be paid pursuant to an order of the Court.
Accordingly, although the bill may be a very proper one for the solicitor to render his or her client, because of the costs agreement, the amount that should be payable by a third party, at least in the spirit of <case>, may need to be discounted.

When one looks at the actual bill, one can see that this may very well be so in the instant case. Apart from the problem that this was not an ordinary creditors' winding up summons for debt but was by an insider whose complaint was not only insolvency, but also (up to the initial hearing) was for winding up on the just and equitable ground, more work was put into the case than would normally be the situation. Furthermore, the bill does tend to show an inordinate length of time taken by the solicitors for the plaintiff to do work which other lawyers would be expected to do in a fraction of the time. One glaring example is an entry of 5 August 1994 - "Perusing documents relevant to proceedings being two lever arch binders being documents relevant to the operations, conduct of the business of the defendant, dealings with the plaintiff and representatives thereof and relevant to solvency of the defendant from March 1993 to July 1994 [brief to counsel and delivery thereof to counsel this day] 830 pages solicitor engaged 6 hours 45 minutes $1552.50".

Judges of this Court are used to perusing exhibits and appeal books etc containing far more than 830 pages and are usually allowed about an hour to do this. If the only purpose of perusing the documents was to see whether they are relevant to go to counsel, almost seven hours for the task would appear to be ludicrous. I use the word "appear" advisedly because it may be when fuller details come out, the charge may be able to be justified. The next day there is another charge of $808.83, again merely for perusing the pleadings in earlier proceedings and the affidavits in those proceedings which is claimed took the solicitor 3 hours 31 minutes. I will not give further examples, though there are many, but the mere look of this bill makes one wonder whether solicitors should be paid for spending an extremely long period of time just looking at documents when the result will be that they will be rewarded for sitting and reading, whilst the unsecured creditors and the liquidator will be left without a cent.

However, when one looks at what little authorities there are as to what is normally included in the costs allowed to a plaintiff in proceedings to wind up an insolvent company, one can see that ordinarily the Court takes a fairly benign view. Doubtless this is because the plaintiff has gone out of his or her way at personal expense to bring about a just result in the interests of creditors as a whole. Thus, in Brights's case, supra, the costs of rehearing on appeal was allowed and in Re The Universal Non-Tariff Fire
Assurance Co [(1875) 23 WR 464], Malins, VC permitted a petitioner not only its costs of the petition, but also an associated action at law where the company had compelled the petitioner to establish its claim at law.

On the other hand, Re A & N Thermo Products Ltd [[1963] 1 WLR ], makes it clear that the plaintiff does not have open slather. In that case all that a petitioning creditor need have done was to allege and prove the existence of a voluntary winding up. However, the petitioner proved every possible matter which might be raised by the company in opposition. Plowman, J held that there was no warrant for doing so. His Lordship said at 1346, "Although a petitioning creditor may, for tactical reasons, wish to put in his petition allegations which are not strictly relevant to his cause of action (if I may borrow another expression from pleading), if he does so, he must, I think, do so at his own risk as to costs. I see no reason for visiting other persons, the company, with costs attributable to allegations which are irrelevant to the case which the petitioner is setting out to make in the first instance." 
The present motion is merely one filed by the liquidator for directions. The plaintiff was given notice and appeared by counsel, but strictly speaking, it is not a party.

I would advise and direct the liquidator as follows:-
He should request full particulars of any amounts in the bill which he considers to be calling out for explanation. There may be no legal obligation on the solicitors to answer these requests, but it may be that they will prefer to answer these requests in writing rather than give evidence in open court.
The liquidator should, bearing in mind the "normal" costs of a winding up petition and taking in account the extra work that really had to be done in the instant case to prove insolvency, formulate an estimate as to what he considers the proper costs of what the application to wind up should have been.
The liquidator should then endeavour to settle the matter with the plaintiff and/or its solicitors.
If no settlement is obtainable, the liquidator should apply under <case> of the Corporations Law for the Court to "otherwise order".
On such application, the liquidator will need to be aware of the cost implications of bringing such application, and if he considers that commercially speaking the exercise is not worth the effort, then he should not bring the application. Of course, the plaintiff will also have to consider the question as to whether it is worthwhile insisting on the full amount of its bill and having to have its solicitors cross examined as to their efficiency and ability and the risk that they will pay the costs of the application under s 466(2) if they are found wanting in any major particular.

In my view the best thing to do is to merely publish these reasons at this stage. Short minutes may be brought in on 3 June at 9.50 am provided that should arrangements be made with my Associate more than a week before that day, some other day that week can be substituted for the convenience of counsel. The liquidator is to be at liberty to make an notice of motion for an order under <case> of the Law returnable on that day, but if he does so, the matter will only be in my list for directions and it may well be that the proper order is to direct that it be heard by a Master.
