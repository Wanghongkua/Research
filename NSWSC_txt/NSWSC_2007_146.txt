WEDNESDAY 28 FEBRUARY 2007  /07 LEON LEWIS MACGILLIVRAY BOVAIRD & ANOR versus MONICA CATHERINE BOVAIRD & ORS  
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT   Leon Lewis MacGillivray Bovaird, the plaintiff, is the only son and only child of Monica Catherine Bovaird, the first defendant. Mr Bovaird has cared for his mother since the death of his father and is seeing to the discharge of her expenses.  Mrs Bovaird commenced proceedings against the executors of her deceased brother's estate in this Court. One of the executors is Diana Catherine
Fallon, the second defendant. She is the applicant before The Guardianship
Tribunal, the third defendant, for an order that a financial manager be appointed with respect to Mrs Bovaird.  Mr Bovaird seeks an order that Ms Fallon's application in The Guardianship
Tribunal be stayed until further order.  Mr Bovaird has lost confidence in the activities of the Tribunal as a result of a number of incidents that have occurred in the conduct by it of that application.  Undertakings have been given on his behalf limiting the amounts of money that would be disbursed by him from his mother's funds. One such undertaking was recorded in writing but wrongly recorded by the Tribunal. There was an indication that a directions hearing would first occur instead of which, without notice to Mr Bovaird, the matter was set down for hearing and set down without due regard to his convenience.  The attitude that has been taken by Ms Fallon with respect to the disbursement of moneys by Mr Bovaird has been to oppose any payments with respect to costs. It was submitted by Mr Harper SC, who appears for Mr
Bovaird, that there was a clear attempt by Ms Fallon to use the proceedings before the Tribunal for a forensic purpose with respect to the matters in dispute in the Supreme Court.  Mr Harper submitted that the proceedings before the Tribunal should be stayed because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to deal with an abuse of its process. In my view, that specialist Tribunal is entitled to have regard to such matters in making its determinations.  Counsel appearing for Ms Fallon has pointed out that the application, which is listed for hearing before the Tribunal tomorrow, is for the appointment of a financial manager. It does not seek, and counsel has informed the Court that
Ms Fallon will not seek, the appointment of Ms Fallon as the financial manager.  Mr Harper submits that the appropriate person to be appointed as financial manager is Mr Bovaird. The legal officer assisting the Tribunal has indicated that the Tribunal has the capacity to accept a late cross-application and would likely do so by entertaining an application by Mr Bovaird to be appointed as the financial manager.  There is no dispute between the parties that a financial manager should be appointed, it being a matter of agreement between the parties that Mrs Bovaird is incapable of managing her affairs. The dispute before the Tribunal with respect to the application is the identity of the person or persons to be appointed.  There is another matter that is to be heard by the Tribunal tomorrow before the application for the appointment of a financial manager and that is the question whether or not the matter should be referred to the Supreme Court under [s
L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/s25l.html) of the [Guardianship Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/).  Mr Harper submits that if the Tribunal is to consider that question all the more reason for the Court to take over the determination of the application and for the stay his client seeks to be made.  [Section
K(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/s25k.html) of the [Guardianship Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) is in the following terms:  "The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to make a financial management order other than an interim financial management order in respect of a person if the question of the person's capability to manage his or her own affairs is before the Supreme Court."  In my view, what is required to exclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a real question in issue in the proceedings before the Supreme Court. There is no real question in issue in this Court as to Mrs Bovaird's ability to conduct her affairs because it is common ground that she is incapable of managing her affairs and a concession has been made to that effect.  It would be a strange result indeed if the mere filing of a document in this Court alleging an incapacity to manage affairs, when that was no real issue in dispute in that respect, could deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.  The Tribunal has been set up as an expert Tribunal to deal with matters such as the appointment of persons as financial managers of others. It will be of assistance to this Court to have the views of the Tribunal even if the
Tribunal takes the view that the matter should be forwarded or transferred to the Supreme Court.  The question of who should be appointed financial manager is a matter for which the Tribunal is peculiarly qualified to make a determination. Those qualifications are generally lacking in the Supreme Court.  It is for these reasons that I am of the view that the matters should proceed tomorrow before the Tribunal and I dismiss the notice of motion. I order the plaintiff to pay the second defendant's costs.
