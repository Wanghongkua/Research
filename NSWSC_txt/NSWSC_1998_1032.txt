COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA versus STEPHEN TREVOR & ANOR /96 July 1998 
Carruthers AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the Bank) has appealed from a judgment dated 11 December 1997 of Master Harrison in which she dismissed notices of motion dated 6 November 1997 by the Bank for summary judgments in these matters, pursuant to Part 13, rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules. The notices of motion were heard together by the Master, as were the appeals to this
Court.

It is convenient, however, that I deal first with certain aspects of the
Trevor matter. On 16 August 1996 the Bank commenced proceedings by way of a default statement of claim against Stephen Trevor (first defendant) and his wife, Pina Theresa Trevor (second defendant) seeking, firstly, an order that the defendants give the Bank possession of the land comprised in Certificate of Title, Folio Identifier 20/235645, commonly known as 6 Wingate Place
Guildford in this State; secondly, an order that the Bank have leave to issue a writ of possession forthwith in respect of such land; thirdly, judgment for the Bank in the sum of $265,537.69, together with interest thereon pursuant to s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). The subject premises are the home of Mr and Mrs Trevor. The statement of claim recited that the defendants had mortgaged the premises by mortgage, dated 5 April , to the Bank in respect of certain advances set forth in the mortgage.
Further that it was a term of the mortgage that the parties would observe the provisions set forth in the Memorandum filed in the Land Titles Office as
E212677, which provisions were deemed to have been incorporated in the mortgage. The statement of claim then alleged default in the terms of the mortgage and sought the orders which I have indicated.

Mr Trevor did not defend the proceedings and default judgment has been signed against him. However Mrs Trevor filed a verified defence on 25 October 1996.
In paragraph 14 of that defence she asserted that the "alleged mortgage" was unjust within the meaning of the [Contracts Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) and gave the following particulars: "(a) The provisions of the mortgage and its legal and practical effect were not accurately explained to the Second Defendant before it was executed by her.

The Second Defendant was not provided with and did not receive a copy of all the terms of the said mortgage and in particular Memorandum E212677 and the said mortgage was signed by her without knowledge of the terms and conditions of that Memorandum.

The Second Defendant did not receive legal advice as to the effect of the document purporting to be the said mortgage before it was executed by her." 
Alternatively by paragraph 15 the second defendant sought to rely upon the provisions of [s.42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) i.e.
she alleged that the Bank was guilty of engaging in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. Before I turn to those particulars, it is necessary to note that the mortgage was executed to provide Varota Pty Limited (Varota) with a fixed rate term advance of $150,000 (the loan account). Further, the Bank was to provide Varota with an overdraft facility of $70,000 (the overdraft account).

Mr Trevor, and Mr Hanley (the first defendant in the cognate matter), were directors of and shareholders in Varota. That company was engaged in providing fire protection services and, because of the non-availability of additional finance from an expected source, it became necessary for financial accommodation to be obtained from the Bank, such accommodation being secured, in part, by the mortgage referred to in these proceedings, and a mortgage over the Hanleys' home referred to in the cognate proceedings.

In addition, Varota had on 5 April 1994 by deed of equitable mortgage in favour of the Bank created a fixed and floating charge over all its assets, stock and debtors. Against this background I set out the particulars relied upon by Mrs Trevor pursuant to the provisions of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/): "(a) The Plaintiff is a corporation engaged in trade and commerce.

On or about 16 March 1994 the Plaintiff through the First Defendant acting as its agent represented to the Second Defendant that the said mortgage was secondary security to a deed of mortgage held by the Plaintiff creating a fixed and floating charge over all the assets, stock and debtors of Verota
Pty Limited.

PARTICULARS 
Deed of Equitable Mortgage dated 5 April 1994 between Commonwealth Bank of
Australia and Verota (sic) Pty Limited.

On or about 16 March 1994 the Plaintiff through the First Defendant acting as its agent represented to the Second Defendant that the Plaintiff would not enforce its rights under the said mortgage until it had exhausted its rights under the said Deed of Equitable Mortgage between the Plaintiff and
Verota (sic) Pty Limited dated 5 April 1994.

In reliance on the representations referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) above the Second Defendant executed the said document purporting to be a mortgage and referred to in paragraph 1 of the Statement of Liquidated Claim.

Verota (sic) Pty Limited (in liquidation) at all material times had debts owing to it in excess of $400,000.

The Plaintiff in breach of the representation referred to in paragraph has not taken and has refused to take any action pursuant to its rights under the said Deed of Equitable Mortgage against the assets and has not sought to recover any debts of Verota (sic) Pty Limited (in liquidation).

By reason of the matters in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) the Second
Defendant says that the representations referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) were misleading contrary to the provisions of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/)." 
The representation in paragraph (c) must be taken to be a representation with respect to a future matter within the meaning of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s41.html) (1) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) which is in the following terms: "For the purposes of this Part, where a person makes a representation with respect to any future matter (including the doing of, or the refusing to do, any act) and the person does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading." 
On 11 March 1997, the plaintiff Bank filed an affidavit of Ruth Jacqueline
Chan dated 7 March 1997 annexing details of the subject premises, and a copy of the mortgage together with the memorandum of mortgage E212677 deemed to have been incorporated in the mortgage.

The affidavit disclosed that as at 28 February 1997 the amount of principal and interest owing under the mortgage was $174,813.11 together with accruing interest, and the amount owing under the overdraft account as at the same date was $129,878.97 with accruing interest.

On 29 April 1997 an affidavit of Mrs Trevor dated 24 April 1997 was filed in support of the above defences. Mrs Trevor deposed that in 1991 she commenced working part-time for Varota attending to general office duties. Sometime later she was appointed secretary of the company and was given responsibility for debtors and creditors. She said that in discharge of her duties she followed instructions given to her by her husband or by accountants employed or engaged by Varota.

In 1994 her husband informed her that Varota could expect an injection of funds to the order of $600,000 from one David Elliott. This was dependent upon
Varota substantially increasing its turnover and providing work and some shareholding for Mr Elliott. As a consequence Varota secured additional work and engaged an extra 20 staff members. According to Mrs Trevor, Mr Elliott then "reneged on the deal and provided no financial assistance to Varota Pty
Limited". As a consequence her husband informed her that Varota would have to approach banks to borrow enough money to meet the obligations which it had assumed. An application for finance was made unsuccessfully to Westpac Banking
Corporation. Varota then approached the Bank where Mrs Trevor's brother-in- law, Joseph Lopino was employed. Mrs Trevor said that to the best of her knowledge and belief Mr Lopino submitted to the Bank an application for a loan account of $150,000 and an overdraft account of approximately $70,000 on behalf of Varota. Both applications were approved. As to the circumstances under which relevant documentation was signed, she said that in or about March (the precise date of which she cannot recall) Mr Lopino came to her home at Guilford with some documents. Mr Trevor was present at the time.

She believed that the documents which Mr Lopino had with him enabled Varota to borrow $150,00 from the Bank and to put the overdraft account into place. She signed the documents which, she contends, comprised only two or three pages.
She did not read the documents and they were not explained to her by Mr Lopino or anyone else. She did not obtain any legal or other advice about the legal or practical effect of the documents before she signed them. She said that having signed the documents she handed them back to Mr Lopino who left her home shortly thereafter.

Mrs Trevor said that, as secretary of Varota she was aware when she signed the documents that Varota was owed approximately $500,000.00, and she believed that, as and when these monies were recovered, Varota would be in a position to service any loan from the Bank and ultimately repay that loan. She believed that as well as the amounts owed by debtors, the assets of the company would be used by the Bank if the company were wound up. Given the size and turnover of Varota she assumed that there would be sufficient assets to meet the debts of the Bank.

An affidavit dated 14 May 1997 by Mr Trevor was also filed in support of the defence. Mr Trevor stated that he discussed Varota's financial difficulties with Mr Lopino in February or March 1994, and Mr Lopino said words to the effect: "The Commonwealth Bank is associated with a Development Bank which has an office directly across the road from you. They may be able to assist you. I will investigate it for you." 
And on a later occasion in 1994 Mr Lopino said (in the presence of other persons) words to the effect: "The Commonwealth Bank may be able to assist Varota with a 10 year interest only loan. You may be able to obtain finance to the value of $230,000 if the directors offer security." [Paragraph 13] 
He also said: "In the event that the company has financial difficulties, the Bank would normally appoint a receiver to recover the money from the company's assets and that any shortfall would be taken from the sale of security. The Bank does not like taking possession of security and is not in the business of selling houses." [Paragraph 13] 
Mr Trevor deposed that on the evening of the same day, he said to his wife: "We have the option of giving Mr Elliott 25% of the company which we would have to buy back for $150,000 to be repaid in 2 years or borrow a $150,000 repayable in 10 years from the Commonwealth Bank in addition to the $70,000 overdraft facility. I understand from Joe (Mr Lopino) that the Bank would recover its money from assets of the company before seeking recovery from the security." 
Mrs Trevor replied: "We should proceed with the loan from the Commonwealth Bank." 
Shortly thereafter Mr Hanley informed Mr Trevor that he and his wife also agreed to proceed with the loan. Mr Trevor passed this information on to Mr
Lopino who assisted him in making an application to the Bank for the advances.

Mr Trevor deposed that in March 1994, after he and Mr Hanley had signed the relevant Bank documentation at Varota's office, he returned home one evening from work and (the affidavit continues): "Mr Lopino was in my home with some documents which my wife Pina Trevor also signed. I observed him place the documents on the dining room table and indicate to Mrs Trevor where she was to sign".

On 24 October 1995 the directors of Varota appointed an administrator of that company. On or about 27 October 1995 Mr and Mrs Trevor and Mr and Mrs Hanley attended the offices of the Bank at Martin Place where they were interviewed by Mr Peter Wall and another officer of the Bank. Mr Wall said words to the following effect: "The Bank does not see any value in appointing a receiver as the Bank believes that only 20% of the debtors would be realised and, given the level of monies owed to parties who rank ahead of the Bank, the Bank will be pursuing the security that it holds." 
Mr Wall then said words to the following effect: "Could you offer any explanation or solution?" 
Mr Trevor said: "Not until the effect of the administration and future of the company is known to us." 
Mr Wall said words to the following effect: "You should expect the Bank to take possession of your houses as soon as possible." 
The Bank filed an affidavit dated 10 June 1997 by Joseph Anthony Lopino, described as a bank officer in the employ of the plaintiff Bank, having joined the bank in August 1980. His history with the Bank is recorded and, relevantly, it is to be noted that between November 1993 and November 1994 he was Assistant Relationship Manager at the Bank's Fairfield Business Banking
Centre. He deposed that between August 1993 and April 1995 his wife Rose Marie
Lopino (Mrs Trevor's sister) was employed by Varota as a secretary and receptionist.

Mr Lopino responded to specific paragraphs contained in the affidavit of Mr
Trevor dated 14 May 1997. He specifically denied the statements attributed to him in paragraph 13 of that affidavit. He does accept that he said to Mr
Hanley and Mr Trevor: "Based on the value of both of your properties, we would probably be able to consider approving a loan of around $230,000. That's about the right lending margin." 
Mr Lopino deposed that on or about 22 March 1994, at Varota's office, he handed the following documents to Messrs Trevor and Hanley relating to their respective mortgages.

A standard letter from the Bank known as a [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letter. It stated (inter alia): "Prior to signing the document you should satisfy yourself that you understand the full nature effect of your liabilities to the Bank and obtain appropriate advice, legal or otherwise, if you are at all uncertain of you position. 
The relevant mortgage.

A pre-printed memorandum of mortgage with registered dealing number
E212677.

Mr Lopino deposed that [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letters are always given to third party intending mortgagors together with any other relevant mortgage documentation. He said that Messrs Trevor and Hanley each signed the mortgage on this occasion and he took the signed documentation away with him.

Mr Lopino deposed that he later left the Trevor mortgage documents and a [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letter addressed to Mrs Trevor at her home but the mortgage was not executed by her until a short time later; such execution taking place at the Varota office.

Without descending into further detail, it is sufficient for present purposes to note that there are significant conflicts between Mrs Trevor's version of the signing of the mortgage and that of Mr Lopino. In particular there is a marked conflict in relation to the documentation produced by Mr Lopino to Mrs
Trevor. If Mrs Trevor's version is accepted she did not receive the [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letter or the pre-printed memorandum of mortgage with registered dealing number E 212677.

I turn then to the Hanley matter. This matter followed the same path as the
Trevor matter. The defences filed by Mrs Hanley were in similar terms to those filed by Mrs Trevor, with the exception that Mrs Hanley asserted that the mortgage was not granted for any benefit to her.

In support of her defences an affidavit dated 28 April 1987 by Mrs Hanley was filed. The property which is the subject of the Hanley mortgage is 9 Bujara
Place Bangor, which is the Hanley family residence. Mrs Hanley has never been a director, officer, employee or shareholder of Varota or participated in any business decisions or activities of the company. She is by profession a physiotherapist. She said that in early 1994 her husband had informed her that
Varota had plenty of work but needed an injection of cash. He then referred later to the fact that an arrangement with an investor had fallen through and that the company was going to arrange bank finance. She said that towards the end of March 1994 her husband said to her words to the following effect: "The Bank will lend us some money could you sign this document?".

He then handed her a document consisting of about two or three pages and she said: "I am not sure about this. Is it likely to put the home at risk?".

Her husband replied: "If anything ever happened the Bank would have first call on the company's assets (By this I took him to mean Varota Pty Limited). The house is only to be used as a top-up if the assets of the company are insufficient. However, the assets of the company are sufficient to cover the amount borrowed".

Mrs Hanley deposed that she took the document to work on the following day where she signed it. It was witnessed by a secretary employed at her place of work. She then took the document home and handed it to her husband. She deposed in paragraph 12: "I believe that the document comprised three pages and that I read the document before I signed it. However I have some difficulty understanding complex written documents. I believe that I suffer from a form of dyslexia although I have never had this diagnosed. 
I did not obtain any legal advice about the practical or legal effects of the document before I signed it. I recall that I left for New Zealand very shortly after I signed the document and that in the few days prior to leaving I was in a considerable rush both at work and at home." 
She deposed that the when she was shown memorandum number E212677 by her solicitor in about March 1997 it was the first time that she had seen the memorandum.

An affidavit dated 11 May 1997 by Mr Hanley was also filed on Mrs Hanley's behalf. He said that when he was informed, in about the middle of February , by Mr Trevor that the Bank was prepared to make appropriate finance available to Varota, Mr Trevor said words to the following effect: "In the event that the bank ever recalls the monies owed, it would firstly recover against the assets of Varota Pty Limited. If there was any short fall in that recovery the equity in our properties would be used to top up the shortfall." 
Mr Hanley said that he passed the information on to his wife before she signed the mortgage document. He did not seek any legal advice about the effect of the mortgage.

He said that two representatives of Price Waterhouse on behalf of the Bank attended at Varota's office after the appointment of the administrator. They spoke to the administrator for an hour. The administrator had at that time been involved for only two days and had only a preliminary and vague picture of the financial position of Varota. At no time did the Bank's representative speak to either himself or, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, to Mr Trevor, although both of them were able to provide a more detailed overview of the status of the business.

He asserted: "The Bank did not appoint a receiver or pursue the assets of the company but took action under the Mortgage that had been executed by myself and my wife over our family home. This was entirely inconsistent with my understanding of the basis upon which the mortgage [was] granted." 
Again there are significant conflicts between Mr & Mrs Hanley, on the one hand, and Mr Lopino on the other, as to the circumstances under which the mortgage was signed by Mrs Hanley, and the documentation which was provided to her.

On 8 November 1997, the Bank filed the notices of motion for summary judgment against both Mrs Trevor and Mrs Hanley in the sum of $327,152.78 and for leave to issue writs of possession forthwith. The applications were supported by the affidavit of Iain Malcolm Stevens dated 30 October 1997, a bank officer employed by the Bank, asserting his belief that neither defendants had a defence to the Bank's claim, or any part thereof. Annexed to this affidavit was correspondence together with documentation relating to the liquidation of
Varota. This documentation included a letter to the Bank from Pinn Deavin & Associates, Insolvency Practitioners, dated 17 October 1997, enclosing a cheque for $18,873.91 being net proceeds received to that date with regard to asset sales of Varota.

Before I turn to the proceedings before the learned Master, it is important to note the relevant legal principles applicable to the proceedings before her.
The plaintiff's notices of motion for summary judgment were based upon the provisions of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/index.html#p13), rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules. It is well established that the party seeking judgment under this rule bears the onus of satisfying the Court that there are no arguable grounds of defence and, therefore, no real question to be tried: see for example Singh versus Varinder Kaur.[1] Importantly, the fact that the plaintiff affirmatively carries the onus means the defendant does not have to establish his or her defence: see Gemeinwirtschaft versus City of London
Garages.[2] The onus upon the plaintiff extends to establishing that there is no real question either of fact or law to be tried. Thus it has been held that the existence of a fairly arguable question of construction may warrant the refusal of summary judgment: see Shurmur versus Young.[3] 
It is important to note in the instant case that the defendants have put evidence before the Court in support of their statutory defences, and the Bank has put on evidence which in some respects, on material issues, is in clear conflict with the evidence of the defendants. It is clear from the authorities, that in determining the proceedings before the Master it was appropriate for her to assume that (unless it was inherently incredible) the evidence of the defendants would be accepted in preference to that of the plaintiff where they were in conflict. It is also important to note that the onus which a plaintiff assumes in seeking to obtain summary judgment where defences have been filed under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) is particularly burdensome. This is obvious from the wide ranging enquiry which the Court must make under [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html) of the Act and the wide discretionary remedies available to the Court. Indeed in
Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Limited versus Pollard,[4] Rogers J said in regard to such a case: "... It seems to me that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Wells v
Allott [[1904] 2 KB 942] should guide me to the conclusion that it is inappropriate that a defence of the kind here under consideration should be dealt with on an application for summary judgment." 
That observation of Rogers J receives some force from the fact that although, from time to time, this Court has entertained motions for summary judgment where defences have been raised under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/), I have been unable to locate a case in which the motion for summary judgment has succeeded. The most recent case appears to be the judgment of Sperling J in
Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd versus Biviano.[5] 
The relevant provisions of the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) were considered by the Court of Appeal in West versus AGC (Advances) Ltd.[6] At /621, in a passage which already has become something of a locus classicus, Mc Hugh JA said: "The definition of `unjust' in [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s4.html) is not exclusive. It is in my opinion a mistake to think that a contract or one of its terms is only unjust when it is unconscionable, harsh or oppressive.
Contracts which fall within any of those categories will be `unjust'. But the latter expression is not limited to the so-called `tautological trinity'. The [Contracts Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) is revolutionary legislation whose evident purpose is to overcome the common law's failure to provide a comprehensive doctrinal framework to deal with `unjust' contracts. Very likely its provisions signal the end of much of classical contract theory in New South Wales. Any contract or contractual provision, not excluded from the operation of the Act and which the court considers is unjust in the circumstances existing at the time when it was made, may be the subject of relief under the Act. Moreover, the provisions of [s9(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html) do not exhaustively indicate the criteria as to what can be taken into account in determining whether a contract or any of its provisions is unjust. The provisions of [s9(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html) of the Act are concerned for the most part with matters of procedural injustice. But the court is entitled to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, subject to [s9(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html), and the public interest." 
This passage sends out a significant warning (as to the wide range of matters which may be raised in defences under the Act) to judges or masters charged with the responsibility of determining whether a plaintiff has established that a defendant seeking to raise a defence under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) has no arguable case.

When these matters came before the Master certain parts of the evidence already on file were relied upon by all parties. Two matters of evidence merit specific consideration.

Firstly, the Bank relied upon evidence that in December 1994 the Bank agreed to an increase in Varota's indebtedness to the Bank to $287,300 against the security of the mortgages. Both Mrs Trevor and Mrs Hanley signed acknowledgments of such increase in indebtedness. Those acknowledgments include the following statement: "I clearly understand that my mortgage will also secure the payment to the
Bank of interest and any costs, charges and expenses with which the Bank shall be at liberty to debit and charge the account of the Debtor or for which I am liable under my mortgage." 
It would appear that those acknowledgments were returned to the Bank in
February 1995.

Secondly, documents disclosed by Mrs Hanley in her discovery included a letter dated 16 March 1994 from the Bank signed by Mr Lopino, assistant manager, referred to earlier as the S.33 letter. No such letter was included in Mrs
Trevor's discovery documents.

Neither counsel before me sought to challenge Master Harrison's succinct statement of the relevant facts. Accordingly (although it involves some duplication of what I have already said) I set them out below: "Mr Lopino is a bank officer with the plaintiff and he is married to Mrs
Trevor's sister, Rose Lopino. Mr Lopino, who was not told of the unsuccessful attempt to gain finance with the Westpac Bank, was asked by the directors to assist them in obtaining finance with the plaintiff. Mr Lopino completed the application for the loan and declared to his employer, the plaintiff, his relationship with the directors of Varota. The loan was subsequently approved by bank officers other than Mr Lopino. The loan was for $150,000 and an overdraft account for approximately $70,000 was also approved.

Rose Lopino commenced employment with Varota as a receptionist in late August
Mr Lopino regularly picked up his wife from work and Mrs Trevor says that they had discussions at this time. 
In March 1994, Mrs Trevor says that Mr Lopino brought the mortgage documents to her and her husband at home. She says that she did not read the document, the document was not explained to her by Mr Lopino or anyone else. She says that she did not obtain any legal or other advice about the legal or practical effect of the document before she signed it.

Mrs Pina Trevor says, that in 1991 she commenced working for Varota for two days per week attending to general office duties. Sometime later she was appointed as company secretary for Varota, and was given responsibility for debtors and creditors. She says that she had no formal training in accounts or the duties of company secretary. In relation to the duties as company secretary she followed instructions given to her by her husband or accountants employed by Varota. However, she also gave evidence that she was aware when she signed the mortgage that Varota was owed $500,000 by debtors and if these moneys were recovered, the company would be in a position to service the loan.

Mrs Hanley says that her husband told her that the bank would lend her some money if she signed some documents. She says that she was not sure about signing, and asked if it was likely to put the home at risk. Mrs Hanley says that she was told that if anything ever happened the bank would have first call on the company's assets. She was told that the house was only to be used as a top-up if the assets of the company were insufficient, but it was told that the assets of the company were sufficient to cover the amount borrowed.

Mrs Hanley took the document which her husband handed to her and took it to work the following day. She signed the document at work. Mrs Hanley said that the document consisted of three pages and that she read the document before signing it. However, she had some difficulty in understanding complex written documents and believes that she suffered from a form of dyslexia although this has not been diagnosed.

Mrs Hanley said that she did not obtain any legal advice about the practical or legal effects of the document before signing it. She recalls that she left for New Zealand very shortly after having signed the document and that in the few days prior to leave (sic) she was in a considerable rush both at work and at home."[7] 
Master Harrison summarised the defences (at page 2) as follows: "Both defendants raise defences under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/), namely that the legal effect of the documents signed were not explained. They had no reasonable opportunity to obtain independent legal advice, and a copy of the memorandum was not provided. They also claim breach of [s.42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) and that the bank by its conduct is estopped from relying on mortgages as against the second defendants. In addition, Mrs Hanley says, that there was no benefit obtained by her in relation to entering into the transaction." 
As to the defendants' assertion that they had no reasonable opportunity to obtain independent legal advice, the Master noted the Bank's contention that any defence based on an absence of opportunity to obtain independent advice, or an absence of independent advice, failed at the threshold because the Bank offered the opportunity and warned the wives to obtain such advice in the [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letters. It was the Bank's contention that this was the most which the Bank was required to do when no circumstantial disadvantage, namely age, illness or lack of education is pleaded or sought to be put in evidence.

The Master observed that neither of the defendants specifically recalled sighting a [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letter prior to signing the mortgage, and the Master obviously took the view that the Bank's evidence in relation to the [S.33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s33.html) letters did not nullify the contentions of the defendants insofar as the absence of legal advice was concerned.

The Master also noted the Bank's contention that the acknowledgment by each defendant of Varota's increased indebtedness returned to the Bank in February foreclosed any defences they may have under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) or the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/). However, the Master observed, that such acknowledgments may be of little relevance to the circumstances under which the mortgage documents were executed some 10 months earlier.

The Master noted also, in this context, that the defendants asserted they were under pressure to sign the acknowledgments, because "the crunch time was approaching" with regard to Varota's ability to pay its weekly wages, with a consequential threat by employees that they would walk out if they were not paid.

With regard to the defences under [s.42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) the
Master noted the defendants' assertion that they were induced to execute the mortgages by Mr Lopino's representation that the Bank would not rely upon the mortgages until it had fully pursued its rights under the equitable charge over the assets of Varota.

The second defendants argued before the Master (although this matter was not pleaded) that the Bank, by refusing to allow for the continued trading of
Varota caused a "fire-sale" of the assets of Varota to occur, which rendered them liable to greater exposure under the mortgages than was ever contemplated by the parties.

The Master observed that not only was this claim not pleaded but no affidavit evidence was put on to support the claim. There was however evidence before her (she noted) in relation to the Bank's representations (through Mr Lopino), in relation to what was referred to as the "top-up". By this is meant the representation that the Bank would not rely upon the security of the mortgage except to "top-up" any deficiency flowing from a proper winding up of
Varota.

In this regard the Master noted the submission by the Bank that the "top-up" argument on the part of the defendants must fail because the mortgages were in fact only being used to "top-up" the deficiency from the winding up of
Varota. That liquidation was, at the date of the hearing, complete, and had only returned to the Bank the sum of about $28,000.00, with no possibility of any further dividend. However, the Master observed the defendants' arguments went further than the Bank's contention. They argued that they should have had the assets realized at "non-fire-sale prices" and, consequently, that there had been a breach of representations made to them on behalf of the Bank.

With regard to the defences under the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) the
Master said: "The second defendants submit that the plaintiff is estopped from relying upon the house mortgages until it has properly pursued its rights under the charge over the assets of the company. The second defendants contend by the evidence that, at the critical time of assessment of its risk at the time of the commencement of the administration, the plaintiff consciously failed to observe the terms of the priority represented to the defendants, to improve its position. They say that they were induced by the representations made at that time, and expressly relied upon them in agreeing to execute the mortgage securities." [One difficulty with this submission, as explained by the Master, is that at the time of the hearing before the Master the liquidation of Varota was complete.] 
The Master continued: "The second defendants also allege that the plaintiff by refusing to allow for the continued trading of Varota caused a fire-sale of the assets of Varota to occur, and they suffered damage. 
This claim is not pleaded in their defences. Nor is there any affidavit evidence to support this claim by the second defendants." 
During the course of argument before the Master the issue of economic duress was raised by the second defendants. In this regard, I note the following passage from the Master's judgment: "The plaintiff refers to Crescendo Management Pty Limited versus Westpac Banking
Corporation [(1988) 19 NSWLR 40] and
Hawker Pacific Pty Limited versus Helicopter Charter Pty Limited [(1991) 22
NSWLR 298], and says that as a matter of law, refusing a request to exceed agreed limits until further security was received is not withholding the defendants' property or otherwise within the concept of economic duress or compulsion. The plaintiff also says that the documents on their face do not show such a situation, let alone that there was any link between such a situation and the alleged reason the wives signed the acknowledgment of indebtedness and security sent in December 1994.(sic) 
According to McHugh JA (As he then was) in Crescendo, the proper approach in determining economic duress is to ask whether any applied pressure induced the victim to enter the contract, and whether that pressure went beyond what the law is prepared to countenance as legitimate.

The defendant (sic) should be given an opportunity to amend their defences, and put on further evidence if they want to allege economic duress."[8] (emphasis as per original) 
Thus the second defendants were relying upon a claim of economic duress in relation solely to the acknowledgments of indebtedness executed in December .

It also appears that during the course of argument before the Master a submission was put, on behalf of the second defendants, that the relationship between Mr Lopino, as a representative of the Bank, and the second defendants was one of undue influence. In this regard the Master said in her judgment: "The second defendants also assert that Mr Lopino, as a brother in law of Mrs
Trevor, and a bank officer was in a relationship of influence with them. The second defendants say that Mr Lopino did not provide documents to them directly. Documents were provided to them via their husbands, although Mr
Lopino gave the mortgage documents to Mr Trevor in Mrs Trevor's presence.

The second defendants returned the acknowledgments increasing the amount of borrowings to the Bank at a time when the company was in severe financial difficulties. While these events occurred about 10 months after the mortgage was signed, it illustrates the relationship between husband, wives and bank, albeit when the company's financial position deteriorated. In view of this evidence and the relationship between the bank manager, the first defendants and the second defendants, it is my opinion, that the evidence of their relationship should be tested at the trial. There may or may not be relationships between the parties that give rise to an order being made under the Contract Review Act but this cannot be determined at a summary application where deponents are not cross examined. In my view, I cannot say that it is clear that there are no real questions to be tried."[9] 
The Master then concluded the judgment (apart from the question of costs which is not necessary for me to consider) as follows: "The second defendants indicated that they wished to amend their defences at this hearing to reflect the alleged duress and the effect of the plaintiff not allowing Varota to continue to trade. Amendments should be granted to allow each party to argue its case on its merits. I allow the second defendants to make such amendments." 
It is clear from the Master's judgment that the Bank had failed to satisfy her that the two pleaded defences i.e. under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) and the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) were unarguable. In addition the Master obviously formed the view that it was open to the second defendants to plead further defences, firstly, in relation to the alleged failure of the Bank to adhere to its representations and permitting a "fire-sale" of Varota's assets; secondly, to plead economic duress and, thirdly, a relationship of undue influence.

On 17 January 1988 the Bank lodged appeals against the Master's judgment pursuant to the provisions of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/index.html#p60), [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s10.html) of the Rules. It is significant to note the manner in which those grounds are formulated. The notice of appeal consists of 11 grounds and I quote them verbatim. Each appeal has identical grounds and it is sufficient to quote the grounds in Mrs Hanley's matter: "The appellant appeals to the Court constituted by a Judge from the decision of Master Harrison of 11 December 1997.

GROUNDS
The Master erred in failing to find the Plaintiff had afforded an opportunity to obtain independent advice prior to the execution of the relevant mortgage.
The Master erred in failing to find the Plaintiff had advised the Second
Defendant to obtain relevant legal and other independent advice before executing the relevant mortgage.
The Master erred in failing to find that the Second Defendant was aware of the nature and effect of the relevant mortgage when she executed further
Letters of Acknowledgment dated 16 March 1994 and returned those documents to the Plaintiff in February 1995.
The Master erred in failing to find the Plaintiff was not legally obligated to provide further funding to Varota Pty Limited to enable it to continue trading.
The Master erred in failing to find that there was no evidence of economic duress or compulsion in relation to the execution of the relevant mortgage by the Second Defendant.
The Master erroneously on the evidence failed to find that the Second
Defendant had adduced no evidence which would be capable of constituting a defence under [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html) of the [Contracts Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/).
The Master erred in failing to find on the evidence that the Second
Defendant had not established a relationship of undue influence which could legally give rise to any defence on behalf of the Second defendant.
The Master erroneously found that there may have been a relationship of influence between Mr Lopino and the Second Defendant. 
The Master erroneously failed to take into account the relevant evidence which clearly demonstrated that at the time the relevant mortgage was executed any alleged relationship of influence between Mr Lopino and the Second
Defendant had no relevance to the execution of the mortgage.
The Master erroneously failed to find that the Second Defendant had no relevant defence to the Plaintiff's claim.
The Master erroneously failed to order that the defence of the Second
Defendant should be struck out and the Plaintiff should be entitled to an order for Summary Judgement of the property described as Certificate of Title
Folio Identified 8/260878 and known as 9 Bujara Place, Bangor in the State of
New South Wales.

ORDERS SOUGHT
The Plaintiff be granted summary judgment pursuant to Part 13 of the
Supreme Court Rules against the Second Defendant in the sum of $327,152.78.
The Plaintiff be granted summary judgment pursuant to Part 13 of the
Supreme Court Rules for possession of the whole of the land comprised
Certificate of Title Folio Identified 8/260878 and known as 9 Bujara Place,
Bangor in the State of New South Wales.
Leave be granted to the Plaintiff to issue a Write of Possession forthwith in respect of the land referred to in paragraph 2 above.
That the Respondent pay the Appellant's costs of this appeal.
Such further or other orders as the Court deems fit." 
The majority of these grounds of appeal, if I may respectively say so, misconceive the function which the Master was required to perform. As I have already indicated, the Master was required to determine whether the Bank had established that the second defendants had raised no arguable grounds of defence. It was inappropriate for her in so deciding to indulge in a fact finding exercise along the lines contemplated by most of the grounds of appeal. It was quite appropriate for the Master to have approached her task upon the assumption that the evidence of the second defendants was capable of acceptance if the matter went to trial, albeit that there was conflicting evidence available to the Bank. In other words the evidence available to the second defendants was not inherently lacking in credibility.

The notices of appeal are confined to the judgment of the Master of 11
December 1997 and seek summary judgment in the terms sought in the original default statement of claim.

There is a complication in this appeal by reason of the fact that pursuant to the leave granted by the Master to the second defendants to amend their defences, verified amended defences in each case were filed on 20 January
The grounds of appeal which were filed on 17 January 1998 do not specifically address the leave granted by the Master. However, the argument before me addressed the amended defences.

Briefly stated, the amended defences amplified each defence under the [Fair
Trading Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) alleging that the Bank failed to honour its alleged representation to maximise the return from the liquidation of Varota. Each such defence is now pleaded in more detail and particularizes documentation discovered by the Bank in the proceedings, which allegedly supports each defence. The `fire sale' defence is also specifically pleaded in each amended defence which also particularizes documents discovered by the Bank alleged to support that defence.

Finally, an additional defence was pleaded in each case to the effect that even if the relevant mortgage was found to be, as at the time of its execution, a valid and binding obligation upon the particular second defendant, (which is denied), the taking by the Bank of the form of acknowledgment of further indebtedness secured by the mortgage, was in circumstances which were tainted by duress. In the circumstances, it is asserted that it would be unconscionable for the plaintiff to have the benefit of the mortgage as against each particular second defendant which therefore should be set aside as void and of no effect.

In his forceful argument on behalf of the Bank before me, Mr Burton of counsel described that last defence as "hopeless". Perhaps `fragile' might be a better description.

It should be observed that no formal application has been made to the Court by the Bank to strike out the additional grounds to which I have just made reference. Those grounds should, in my view, be allowed to stand.

It is clear from what I have already said that the Bank assumed a very demanding onus when it moved for summary judgment in the light of the statutory defences which had been raised by the second defendants. Having given careful and anxious consideration to the submissions made on behalf of the Bank, I am quite unpersuaded that the Master erred in the exercise of the discretion which was vested in the Court. It is now well established that an appeal to a Judge from a Master is to be dealt with in the same way as an appeal to the Court of Appeal, namely, by way of rehearing which is not a rehearing de novo: see G.I.O. versus Weeks.[10] Taking this approach I am not convinced that the Master's judgment is flawed either in fact or law insofar as the then defences were concerned. I am also of the view that it was open to the Master to grant leave to the second defendants to raise the additional defences which were "aired" during the course of argument before her. One should concede that there are difficulties in the second defendants' cases.
However they are not difficulties of such a nature as to entitle the Bank to summary judgment. Particularly bearing in mind the wide discretion vested in the Court under both the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) and the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), I am of the view that the second defendants are entitled to be heard on their defences under those Acts.

These matters should proceed to trial as expeditiously as possible so that the merits can be determined in the conventional fashion.

In each case the appeal is dismissed and the appellant is pay the respondent's costs.
