EQUITY DIVISION  
BARRETT J  
THURSDAY 9 OCTOBER 2003  /03 - KEM WEICHOREAK KANG-KEM versus MARILYN JEAN PAINE & ANOR  
JUDGMENT  In the course of cross-examining the plaintiff yesterday afternoon, Mr
Thomson, counsel for the defendant, asked him a question about a document he identified as having been sent or given by him to an accountant for the purpose of preparation of the defendant's income tax tax return by the accountant. Objection was taken by Mr Johnson, counsel for the plaintiff, by reference to [s.128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [[Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) ](/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), that is, on the ground that the answer might tend to prove that the witness had committed an offence under an
Australian law. The apprehended offence consists, in substance, of attempting or conspiring to procure the inclusion of false information in a tax return knowing it to be false, or perhaps aiding and abetting such conduct.  Mr Johnson sought and, with the concurrence of Mr Thomson, I granted leave to take instructions from his client in the midst of cross-examination as to whether he wished to maintain the objection that had been taken on his behalf.
The objection is maintained and I must therefore follow the procedure laid down by [s.128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).  The first task is that imposed by [s.128(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html), that is, to decide whether there are reasonable ground for the objection. That entails a brief consideration of the provisions of Commonwealth law. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to refer first to s.8C(1) of the [[Taxation Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/taa269/) ](/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (Cth) which makes it an offence, among other things, not to give information to the Commissioner of Taxation in the manner in which it is required under a taxation law to be given. Section
C(2) says that an offence under s.8C(1) is an offence of absolute liability so that under [s.6.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/taa269/s6.2.html) of the Criminal Code a defence of mistake is not available. Reference should also be made to Pt 2.4, Div 11 of the Criminal Code which makes an attempt to commit an offence the equivalent of the offence itself and deals in like manner with aiding and abetting, incitement (or, as the Code puts it, "urging") and conspiracy.  It seems to me that the conduct of the plaintiff is, at a prima facie level, at least capable of being regarded as contrary to these legislative provisions. I record therefore that I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the objection taken under s.128(1) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). I must therefore continue in one of two ways. I must proceed under [s.128(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html), unless I am satisfied as to all three matters specified in [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html), in which event I have a discretion to proceed in the way that [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) specifies.  The first matter to which [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) directs attention is whether the evidence concerned may tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under or is liable to a civil penalty under an Australian law. Having regard to the provisions of
Commonwealth taxation law to which I have referred, I am satisfied that that question must be answered in the affirmative as regards the particular evidence sought to be adduced from the plaintiff.  The second question posed by [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) is whether the evidence does not tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under or is liable to a civil penalty under a law of a foreign country. Since we are here dealing with actions which may have assisted or constituted fraud or evasion as against the Commonwealth revenue authority, I am satisfied that the evidence in question does not have this tendency.  The final question under [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) is whether the interests of justice require that the plaintiff give this evidence. Such guidance as there is in the case law as to that aspect of the enquiry suggests that, in the first instance at least, the interests of justice are to be approached by reference to the proper and just determination of the current proceedings. That seems to me to be the basis on which
Tamberlin J proceeded in Versace versus Monte <case> at paragraph 11. The approach of the Full Family Court in In the Marriage of
Atkinson [(1997) 136 FLR 347] was the same. The court there emphasised the importance of the provision by parties to matrimonial property settlement disputes of full and accurate information about their financial circumstances. The court therefore entertained "not the slightest doubt" that the interests of justice demanded that the husband give the evidence that he objected to giving about his income sources, which it appeared may have involved illegal gambling.  I also have guidance from the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal
Appeal on the ambit of [s.128(5)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) and the considerations relevant to a decision as to where the interests of justice lie. The cases to which I refer are Cureton versus Blackshaw Services Pty
Ltd <case> and R versus Collisson <case> In the former, Sheller JA, with whom Meagher and Beazley JJA agreed, observed that in this particular context the interests of justice should be construed broadly and encompass, in a particular case, questions going to the credit of the particular witness. In the Collisson case, the Court of
Criminal Appeal held that the reliability of the particular evidence was a factor going to a proper determination of where the interests of justice lay.
It was decided that the trial judge had properly declined to regard [s.128(5)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) as satisfied where the evidence, being evidence of an accomplice, was inherently unreliable. It might be said by similar reasoning that the greater the tendency of the evidence to play a significant part in the reaching of a proper decision, the more its reception is required in the furtherance of the interests of justice.  The present dispute has, as its centre, the question whether the plaintiff and the defendant carried on the restaurant business in partnership or whether, as the defendant contends, she was the sole proprietor. The ways in which receipts and revenues from the business were dealt with in books of account and in taxation returns will be very material to and are likely to play a significant part in the fully informed and just determination of the controversy between the parties. Applying the words in the Atkinson case,
I would say that the interests of justice, as they apply in this case, demand that the plaintiff give the evidence he objects to giving about the conveying of instructions to the accountant about income from the business. In addition, it has been clearly indicated already that the plaintiff's credit will be put in issue. Any part he may have played in promoting the filing of false taxation returns will be material to that. Bearing in mind what was said by the Court of Appeal in the Cureton case, this is another factor pointing towards a positive decision in relation to [s.128(5)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html)  In summary, I am satisfied that the conditions in [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) are fulfilled. That being so, the opening words of [s.128(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) have the result that, of the two paths resulting from the bifurcation referred to by Hamilton J in Lewis versus Nortex Pty Ltd <case>, the path I must follow is that laid down by [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html), so that I must consider whether to exercise the discretion conferred by that section.  Given the positive conclusion already reached under [s.128(5)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) as to the requirements of justice, any decision to exercise the [s.128(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) discretion against requiring the witness to give the answer would, it seems to me, have to proceed from some clearly seen concern that a greater evil of some kind would result from the giving of the evidence. Since exercise of the discretion in favour of the adducing of the evidence must, by [s.128(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html), be accompanied by a protective certificate, the possibility of exposure of the witness to incrimination or penalty must be disregarded in the search for any such greater evil and, since no other evil has been suggested or is apparent,
I conclude that there is none.  The outcome, therefore, is that the plaintiff will be required to give the evidence in question, notwithstanding its tendency to incriminate him or to expose him to a penalty, and a certificate under [s.128(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) will be given to him in respect of the evidence so that, at least so far as the law of New South Wales is concerned, that evidence cannot be used against him in any Australian court, except in a criminal proceeding in respect of alleged falsity of the evidence itself.  The certificate will be in Form 1 in the schedule to the Evidence
Regulation 1995 and, as contemplated by that form, will have attached to it a copy of the relevant transcript. Because the decision of the court to give the certificate has now been pronounced, cross-examination of the plaintiff will continue and the actual issue of the certificate will be dealt with when the transcript becomes available at its conclusion.  There were indications yesterday that the same issue might arise in relation to the other aspects of the plaintiff's evidence. That has been confirmed this morning. The appropriate course will be for the objection to be taken by reference to s.128 on each occasion and for me to indicate, after submissions if necessary, whether this present ruling also applies in relation to that new objection. I shall proceed on that basis.
