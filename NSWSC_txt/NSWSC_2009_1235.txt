MONDAY 16 NOVEMBER 2009  /07 PAUL GERARD WESTON versus PUBLISHING AND BROADCASTING LIMITED &
ORS 
JUDGMENT These proceedings were commenced by statement of claim filed on 25 May 2007.
 The plaintiffs named in the statement of claim are Paul Gerard Weston, special purpose liquidator of One.Tel Limited, and One.Tel Limited itself. The relief sought is declaratory relief, an order for the payment of money pursuant to [s
FF(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588ff.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) and damages. There are eighteen defendants.
 Under [rule .2(4)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s6.2.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), originating process in the Supreme Court is valid for service for six months after the date on which it is filed. Under [rule .12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s1.12.html), the court may extend any time fixed by the rules. That power has been exercised in this case on four separate occasions in relation to the time fixed by [rule .2(4)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s6.2.html)
The time for service of the statement of claim was extended to 25 May 2008, then to 25 November 2008, then to 25 May 2009 and later to 25 November 2009.
 I now have before me an application for a further extension of time, that is, until 25 May 2010.
 I approach that application on the basis I stated as follows when the first of the earlier applications came before me (see Weston versus Publishing and
Broadcasting Ltd <case> at <case>): "The decided cases make it clear that the court's discretion in this respect is broad and that the court need see no more than "good reason" to make the extension sought: see, for example, Buzzle Operations Pty Ltd v
Breirl  <case>,
FAI Insurances Ltd versus Mainprize [[2006] NSWSC 554], Kleinwort
Benson Ltd versus Barbrak Ltd [[1987] AC 597], Rich versus Packer & Ors; Rich versus Long & Ors  <case> and Zhang versus Semin <case>" The present position is that the special purpose liquidator is well advanced with negotiations to obtain litigation funding for the purposes of the proceedings. It is clear from the evidence that the continued unavailability of the judgment in the ASIC versus Rich proceedings has caused that process to be delayed. It is understandable that a potential funder - and the special purpose liquidator himself - will wish to review the findings in that case in some detail before making a decision to proceed. This is because of a substantial overlap between issues of fact in that case and issues of fact in these proceedings.
 Publication of the judgment in ASIC versus Rich has implications also for another matter that must be taken into account on the present application. I refer to the question of prejudice to the defendants. They are aware of the proceedings. Indeed, they made an unsuccessful application for leave to be heard when the first application for extension of the time for service came before the court: see Onefone Australia Pty Ltd versus One.Tel Limited; Weston v
Publishing and Broadcasting Limited <case> The defendants are also aware of the significance of the judgment in Asic v
Rich. As was noted when the last application for extension of service was before the court (see Weston versus Publishing and Broadcasting Limited <case>; <case> and [16]), key defendants may be taken to have accepted that matters of controversy between the special purpose liquidator and those defendants can sensibly be left to await the outcome of ASIC versus Rich.
 There was discussion in Tolcher versus Gordon <case>; <case> about the weight that should, in cases such as the present, be afforded to a desire not to proceed until the outcome of some other proceeding is known or attempts to obtain litigation funding have been successful. As to the latter matter, the observation in the later case (at [82]) that it would be inappropriate to allow an extension of time for service "where a significant cause of the delay has been the willingness of the plaintiff to do nothing about service while awaiting a decision from a litigation funder" stands in contrast to the statement in the earlier case (at [107]) that "it would have been both imprudent and irresponsible for the claimants to institute the proceedings without having litigation funding in place" (the reference to institution of the proceedings was, in the context, a reference to service).
 In my opinion the latter observation is apposite to this case and the continued delay while awaiting the ASIC versus Rich decision - something that, in any event, can be said to have a measure of acquiescence from the defendants - is the appropriate and responsible course for the special purpose liquidator to take.
 Good reason for a further extension of time for service has been shown. The extension of time sought will therefore be granted, as will the special purpose liquidator's separate application in other proceedings for an enlargement of his functions to enable him to seek the extension of time. As noted in earlier judgments, the defendants' ability to seek, if and when served, an order discharging the order extending time is assured by [rule .11(1)(e).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s12.11.html)
