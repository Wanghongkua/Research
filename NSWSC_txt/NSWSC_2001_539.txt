JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On interest claimed under <case> of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) - T9374 - entry of judgment) HIS HONOUR: Interest in each action has been claimed under section 94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). The concept of interest in defamation actions, the availability of it on an award of damages, was first, to my recollection, dealt with in a principled way by the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax & Sons Limited versus Kelly [(1987) 8 NSWLR 131], see particularly the judgment of McHugh JA at 143 to 144.
 In paragraph 5266 of my reasons for judgment, I set out the factors, in summary form, that led to the computation of the awards actually made. I did not, as there was no requirement upon me, (as there would have been no requirement upon a jury), differentiate in quantification terms between the various components of the award to which I refer in that paragraph.
 Entitlement to vindication as of the date of publication, of course, is quite clear and it is clear from what I have said in the written reasons and what I said orally this morning that that was a substantial component of the award.
 I am of the view that the proper approach in a case such as this, the amount and quantum being entirely a matter for me, that it accords with principle as to the continuum over which the initial loss has been sustained, (as well as with avoiding the artificiality of trying, for the purposes of interest, to allocate sums of money to particular components), in that followed by Simpson
J in Vilo in John Fairfax & Sons Limited  <case>; that two percent represents a fair and just outcome as the appropriate rate to be applied.
 Accordingly, in action number 20223 of 1995, I will award interest at two percent from 13 March 1995 to 27 June 2001, 2267 days, a total of $34,160.25.
There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $309,165.25.
 In action number 20592 of 1996, for the period 7 May 1996 to 27 June 2001, days, interest will be awarded in the sum of $25,698.63 and I enter judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $275,698.63.
