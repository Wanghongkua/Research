JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
By originating process filed 23 April 2013, the plaintiffs, John Raymond Gibbons and Kieran William Hutchison as deed administrators of A.F.G. Insurances Limited (subject to deed of company arrangement) ("Company") seek orders for the appointment of Mr Campbell-Wilson as joint and several administrator of a deed of company arrangement concerning the Company upon the resignation of Mr Gibbons taking effect on 30 April 2013. 
The application is supported by an affidavit of Mr Gibbons, who indicates that his resignation is prompted by his retirement from his role as a partner of Ernst & Young on 30 April 2013. The application is also supported by an affidavit of Mr Hutchison, who is presently one of the joint administrators of the deed, and was previously resident in Sydney, but is now located in the Cayman Islands. In these circumstances, Mr Gibbons expresses the sensible view that it is considered prudent and desirable to appoint a Sydney based partner of Ernst & Young to replace him as joint deed of administrator, on his retirement, where most of the work to be undertaken to finalise the deed administration will be undertaken, subject to supervision, by Ernst & Young staff located in its Sydney office. The application is also supported by an affidavit of Mr Campbell-Wilson, who is proposed to be appointed as joint administrator together with Mr Hutchison. His evidence is that he is generally familiar with the background of the A.F.G. administration as he previously worked as case manager on that administration and was part of the original Ernst & Young team which worked on the matter in the first six months after appointment in 2002. Mr Campbell-Wilson is qualified for appointment, so far as he is a registered liquidator, and gives evidence that he is not aware of any issues, circumstances, relationships or conflicts of interest that would preclude his appointment as a deed administrator of A.F.G. 
It is plain that the Court has power to make orders in the form sought, although the question of the source of the Court's power is one which involves a little complexity. On one view, which appears to have been adopted by Barrett J in Re Application of Vouris <case>; <case> I noted that the Court had power to replace a joint deed administrator, either under [s 449D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s449d.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) on the basis noted in Re Vouris, or otherwise under [s 447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), which was the approach adopted by Barrett J in Free and Ors above. 
I do not consider that it is necessary to determine whether the Court's power arises under [s 449D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s449d.html) or alternatively under [s 447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html), since the Court plainly has such a power under [s 447A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) In the present circumstances, it seems to me that there is a compelling case for the exercise of such a power, where Mr Campbell-Wilson is qualified to be appointed as administrator and where there is obvious practical convenience in the appointment of a second joint administrator resident in Sydney to the company. 
For these reasons, I make the following order:
An order pursuant to [s
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s449d.html), or alternatively [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), that Mr
Philip Campbell-Wilson be appointed as a joint and several deed administrator of A.F.G. Insurances Limited (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) with effect from 30 April 2013.
