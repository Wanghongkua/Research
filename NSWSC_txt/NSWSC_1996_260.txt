Mutuality of estoppels existed because, on a construction of [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) of the [Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1942](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/), <case>; [(1967) 118 CLR 271] at 
MAHONEY P: This appeal raises for consideration the concept of privity in the law of estoppel by judicial decision.

The facts are not seriously in issue. On 28 July 1986, Mr Stewart, the plaintiff-appellant, was, he claimed, employed by Mr Maitland, originally a defendant in the present proceeding. Mr Stewart claimed that he suffered injuries to his back. He claimed worker's compensation from Mr Maitland in a proceeding in the Compensation Court.

On 20 July 1987, Mr Stewart sued Mr Maitland in the Supreme Court. He alleged that Mr Maitland had been negligent in relation to a motor vehicle which, he claimed, he was employed to drive. His claim was that, because Mr Maitland had been negligent in relation to the work that Mr Stewart was to do and the equipment upon the vehicle, Mr Stewart suffered injuries in two or possibly three incidents.

While the claim was pending in the Supreme Court the claim for worker's compensation was determined. On 30 April 1990 his Honour Judge Burke of the
Compensation Court gave an award for the respondent Mr Maitland. He held, inter alia, that Mr Stewart "did not receive injury on 28 July 1986". His
Honour made other findings but, in my opinion, he found that the injuries which Mr Stewart claimed to have suffered had not been suffered.

Subsequently, the statement of claim in the Supreme Court proceeding was amended by, inter alia, joining Government Insurance Office of New South Wales ("GIO") as a defendant.

In July 1992 the Supreme Court proceeding came before Sharpe J for trial.
Having regard to the provisions then operative of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) of the [Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/), his
Honour, apparently by consent, gave leave to Mr Stewart to discontinue against
Mr Maitland. GIO then moved for a verdict by direction. (Other parties had been added in the proceeding. It does not appear precisely what occurred in relation to them and no point has been made in respect of them).

Sharpe J noted, and it is not now in question in this proceeding, that a decision of the Compensation Court may give rise to an estoppel of the kind here present: Egri versus DRG Australia Ltd [(1988) 19 NSWLR 600.] He concluded that GIO could set up against Mr Stewart an estoppel based upon the
Compensation Court decision. The estoppel is against the allegation in the proceeding by Mr Stewart that he suffered the injuries in respect of which the
Supreme Court proceeding has been brought. Sharpe J held that GIO could set up such an estoppel. He held - and it is not now in issue - that, if there be such estoppel, there must be judgment for GIO.

It appears from the papers before this Court that final judgment was entered in respect of GIO and two other defendants. The appeal has proceeded upon the basis that that judgment finally determines the proceeding at trial level.

Mr Stewart has appealed to this Court against the judgment. Counsel for Mr
Stewart has confined his submissions before this Court to whether the issue of estoppel was correctly determined and, in that regard, has limited his submissions to two matters: whether there was "a similarity of issues" in the
Compensation Court and the Supreme Court proceedings and whether there is privity between the respondent party in the Compensation Court proceedings Mr
Maitland and the respondent party in the Supreme Court proceeding GIO.
IDENTITY OF ISSUES: 
To establish an estoppel it is necessary that there be shown an identity between the issue previously decided and the issue to be decided in the proceeding in which the estoppel is to be set up: Ramsay versus Pigram <case>; [(1967) 118 CLR 271] at 277. Where the issue in question is an issue of fact, difficulty is sometimes experienced in defining precisely what that issue is.
From time to time such difficulty has arisen when a finding of the
Compensation Court has been called in aid in proceedings in the Supreme Court.
Egri is an instance of this. In some cases it is proper to define the issue determined by the Compensation Court in broad terms, eg, as "injury"; in other cases the issue may be defined more precisely, eg, by a statement of the particular kind of injury involved: at 601-2.

No problem of this kind has, I think, arisen in the present case. I do not understand it to be in dispute that the injuries which Mr Stewart alleged as the basis of his claim in the Compensation Court are the same injuries as he alleges as the basis of his claim against GIO in the Supreme Court proceeding.
In that sense, there is, in my opinion, an identity of issues.

There was, perhaps, an initial suggestion that what his Honour Judge Burke found in the Compensation Court proceeding was not that the injuries did not occur but that the claim for compensation should be dismissed for other reasons. If and insofar as that is an issue before this Court, my conclusion is that the basic finding made by his Honour was that to which I have referred. Other findings were or may have been made or suggested by him in the course of his dismissal of Mr Stewart's claim. But if several findings were made that would not mean that the finding here in question could be relied upon. The finding that no injuries occurred was, in my opinion, the basic reason why the claim was dismissed.
IDENTITY OF PARTIES: 
GIO was, of course, not a party in the Compensation Court proceeding.
Accordingly, if an estoppel is to be established, GIO must show that it is, in the relevant sense, a privy of the party in that proceeding, namely Mr
Maitland. The determination of who is a privy and in what circumstances is not easy to determine. It has been said that authorities of assistance in this regard are not extensive: see Carl Zeiss Stiftung versus Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2) [(1967) AC 853] at 936, per Lord Guest; see generally Spencer Bower &
Turner on Res Judicata (2nd ed) p 209. There is no golden thread which one may follow through the decisions; insofar as there are categories or descriptions of the classes of cases in which there is or is not privity, the verbal formulae employed in relation to them are, at the least, indeterminate and, no doubt, necessarily so.

In Ramsay versus Pigram <case>; [(1967) 118 CLR 271], Barwick CJ: at 279; saw privies as of three classes: blood, title and interest. These categories are adopted in Spencer Bower &
Turner: at 209. In Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed) Vol 16, par 1543, the authors, citing Coke on Littleton 352a, group the instances under blood, law and estate.

In order to determine whether, in the present case, GIO is a privy of Mr
Maitland, it is necessary to examine more closely the basis upon which it is the defendant in the Supreme Court proceeding. Under the general law, the defendant would, of course, have been Mr Maitland: it was the negligence of which he was alleged to be guilty which was claimed to have caused the injuries in question. Had Mr Stewart been able to proceed against Mr Maitland, there would accordingly have been the necessary identity of parties to ground the estoppel.

But, by reason of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) of the [Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/), as it was at the relevant time, Mr Stewart could not sue Mr Maitland but was required to sue GIO. It is accepted for the purposes of this appeal that Mr
Stewart's claim for damages was one to which [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) applied. In respect of such a claim [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) provided that such a claim, "... being a claim which, but for this section, could be made against the owner or driver of the motor vehicle, shall be made against the Government Insurance Office and any proceedings to enforce any such claim for damages shall be taken against the Government Insurance Office and not against the owner or driver of the motor vehicle." [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) provided: "14(3). In respect of a claim referred to in subsection (1), the Government
Insurance Office shall, except as provided by [section
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14d.html), be liable as if it were the owner or driver of the motor vehicle in relation to which the claim is made." [Section
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14d.html) provided: "14D. The Government Insurance Office shall not be personally liable to pay any amount payable in satisfaction of any claim made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mvpia1942396/s14.html) ... but every such amount shall be paid by the Government Insurance Office out of the Transport Accidents Compensation Fund." 
The Act does not make clear, in terms, what precisely is the operation of these provisions. It is, if analysis is to be pressed, not clear whether the effect of <case> is to prevent a cause of action arising against an individual in the circumstances there referred to and to substitute for that cause of action a cause of action against GIO, or whether, on strict analysis, the cause of action otherwise arising against the individual under the general law remains but the "making" or "taking" of it against the individual is permanently stayed.

Nor is it clear whether the precise rights and obligations which the individual, Mr Maitland, would have had in such a proceeding are, in effect, transferred to GIO and enforceable by and against it. I am inclined to think that it would be open to GIO, as the defendant whom the claim is "taken against" "as if it were the owner or driver ...", to plead a defence of contributory negligence. It is not clear, from the terms of the section alone, whether, for example, admissions made by a person who would ordinarily be the defendant driver of the vehicle would be admissible against GIO in the Supreme
Court proceeding: cf The Nominal Defendant versus Hook <case>; [(1965) 113 CLR 641.] 
Nor is it clear whether GIO, in a proceeding brought against it, could bring a cross-action or counter-claim. Section 14(3) provides that GIO shall "be liable as if it were the owner or driver" of the vehicle but does not, in terms, allow it to bring a cross-claim, eg, for damage to the vehicle which might be able to be brought by the owner of the vehicle or by the driver for the benefit of GIO or his insurer. GIO would, as such, have no right in respect of such a matter. Whether and to what extent it would be entitled to plead, in partial satisfaction, payments already made by the owner or driver does not appear.

I have referred to these questions because they are, I think, relevent in deciding the extent to which GIO has, or has not, been merely substituted for the individual who would, in the statutory circumstances, be liable to be sued and to respond to such a claim.

On what basis is GIO to be treated as the privy of Mr Maitland? In my opinion,
Ramsay versus Pigram does not establish or illustrate the application of any principle which dictates the answer to this question. In that case the plaintiff had sued the Government of New South Wales for injuries suffered by him in an accident involving a motor vehicle driven by an on duty police officer. The defendant Mr Ramsay who represented the Government sought to set up an estoppel. The estoppel was based upon an action in the District Court in which the police officer had sued the existing plaintiff for damages in respect of the accident. The existing plaintiff had denied negligence and pleaded contributory negligence by the police officer. Both of these defences were rejected. Mr Ramsay contended that the finding that the police officer was not guilty of contributory negligence could be the basis of an estoppel in his favour in the instant proceeding against the plaintiff's contention that he had been injured by negligence for which the Government was responsible.
The estoppel was rejected for two reasons: because the issues in the two actions were not identical and because there was no privity of interest between Mr Ramsay and the police officer. It is the latter ground which is here relevant.

Barwick CJ: at 279-80; saw the relevant claim to privity as privity in interest. He held that, for such to exist, "the privy must claim under or through the person of whom he is said to be a privy". He concluded that the
Government did not claim through the police officer or the police officer through it. The Chief Justice said: "In every respect the action between the respondent and the police officer was personal to each of them, neither being in any sense in relation to the action or any of the issues involved in it, representative of another. Nor can it be said that the Government in any sense claims under or in virtue of the police officer or of any right of his, or that it derives any relevant interest through him." 
His Honour: at 278; had seen the interests or issues involved as different in each of the two cases. He saw the Government's responsibility for what the police officer had done as being, as he assumed, "the master's responsibility ... for the breach of his duty by the act of his servant" and referred to the observations of Kitto J in Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Co Ltd v
Long <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 36] at 61.
Accordingly, the Chief Justice appears to have held that, if and in so far as the claim against the Government was based, and based only upon, what the police officer had done (assumedly) as a servant of the Government, that did not mean that there was a privity in interest between the police officer and the Government.

His Honour went on to discuss the effect of <case> of the Motor Vehicles (Third
Party Insurance) Act 1942-1951 and the effect it was claimed to have to make the police officer the deemed servant of the Government. He saw the legislation as having "no operation at all in the prior action" and "no more in this action than at most (to) make the Government and the driver joint tortfeasors". This he concluded did not give them a privity of interest.

McTiernan J: at 282-3; dealt with the matter on a somewhat different basis. He saw the submission for Mr Ramsay as being that as Mr Ramsay's liability was "purely vicarious and dependent upon the doctrine of respondeat superior" there was a community of interest between him and the police officer. His
Honour said: "This proposition is, I think, in conflict with the requirement of mutuality which has been accepted as being essential in cases of estoppel similar to the present case. No substantial reason has been advanced for departing from the well-established principle that no one can take advantage of a judgment unless he would also have been concluded by the judgment had it gone against him. No finding in the action in the District Court at Gundagai, if Thrift had lost it, could have operated as an estoppel against the present appellant in a subsequent proceeding." 
This appears to involve that if a servant be found guilty of negligence in one action, that does not necessarily bind the master in a subsequent action. That is not the present case: to this I shall subsequently refer. Cf the Carl
Zeis case (1967) AC at 911, 936-7, 946, 968-9.

Windeyer J: at 289-90; saw the position at common law as involving the relationship of "joint tortfeasors" and, as his Honour concluded, there was no estoppel based upon that alone.

In my opinion, the present position is different from the positions discussed in Ramsay versus Pigram. Subject to one matter, the effect of <case> is merely to substitute GIO for Mr Maitland as the defendant in the claim arising out of the use of a motor vehicle. The liability of GIO is determined, and determined only, by those facts which, had <case> not been passed in the relevant form, would have determined the liability of Mr Maitland. In such a case, there would, in my opinion, be privity for purposes of the estoppel, viewed either as the result of "an act in law" in the sense referred to in Halsbury and the authorities there referred to: see Halsbury, supra, at par 1543(xi); or as involving privity in interest in the sense referred to in, eg, Ramsay v
Pigram.

There are two matters to be considered in this regard: the effect of <case> and the requirement of mutuality to which McTiernan J referred in Ramsay v
Pigram.

Section 14(3) adds to the provision in <case> by providing, in a sense, the mode of liability of GIO: GIO is to "... be liable as if it were the owner or driver of the motor vehicle in relation to which the claim is made". On one construction, those words would suggest the imposition of a personal or direct liability, as distinct from the derivative <case> liability. On another construction, it indicates merely that GIO is to be liable only and precisely as if the (actual) owner or driver of the vehicle would be liable under the general law. I am inclined to think the second construction is correct. On this basis, it is proper to treat the liability of GIO as derivative in the sense to which I have referred.

There is perhaps an apparent difficulty in applying the concept of mutuality, according to its terms, in such a case as this. This is a case in which the nature of the liability imposed upon GIO is such that GIO could seldom, if ever, be seen as plaintiff in a relevant proceeding. But if the plaintiff Mr
Stewart had succeeded in the Compensation Court proceeding, the estoppel created would no doubt equally bind GIO and in that sense the estoppel here in question is mutual.

There is, in my opinion, good sense in holding that the estoppel exists in the present case. It is clearly established in this State that findings in the
Compensation Court may operate as an estoppel in a common law claim in this
Court. It could not have been the intention of the legislature, in enacting s as it did, to interfere with such a position or to achieve the result that
GIO could not, standing in the shoes of its (insured) defendant, raise a similar estoppel. There appears no point in taking a different view of the effect of the provisions. No purpose will be served by doing so.

I am conscious that it has been said that estoppels are odious and that they should not be upheld unless they satisfy precisely the provisions of the law: see Baxendale versus Bennett (1878) 3 QBD 525 at 529 per Bramwell LJ. But equally there is authority that estoppel, by res judicata and otherwise, performs a useful public function in reducing or putting an end to litigation and preventing an individual being vexed twice for the same cause: Lockyer v
Ferryman [(1877) 2 App Cas 519] at 530; see generally the Carl Zeiss litigation at 909 et seq, 946. The mischief with which the new <case> was to deal - the establishment of GIO as a general insurer - would not be furthered by destroying the previously available estoppel. The constitution of the then established statutory fund would not be forwarded.
These matters are, I think, relevant in determining the effect which the legislature intended the amendments to <case> to have.

For these reasons I am of opinion that the decision of Sharpe J was correct. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

WADDELL AJA: I agree with the President.
