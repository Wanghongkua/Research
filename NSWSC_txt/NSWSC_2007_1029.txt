JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
ROTHMAN J  NOVEMBER 2007  /06 THE CHINESE CULTURAL CLUB LIMITED versus THE DIRECTOR OF LIQUOR AND GAMING  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: The Director of Liquor and Gaming made complaint before the
Licensing Court of New South Wales about the conduct of the Chinese Cultural
Club. Those proceedings were, by decision of the Licensing Court, permanently stayed, but costs were not awarded.  The Club appeals the decision of the Licensing Court given on 17 July 2006 denying the Club its costs against the Director. Some general background to the proceedings is needed.  
Proceedings Below on Stay  The Complaint contained thirteen grounds and numerous particulars. An amended Complaint was filed that withdrew some allegations but increased the particulars for those that remained.  The details of the Complaints are, in their entirety, irrelevant to the current proceeding, but some general example is needed to understand how the question now before this Court arises.  The Director lawfully seized a number of documents from the Club. The
Director had not complied with the requirements to give proper receipts and copies: see section 58 of the [Registered Clubs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) .
Those documents were in the possession of the Director for some time. They were eventually returned to the Club (or some of them were) approximately one month before the hearing below.  Over 10,000 documents were returned relating to conduct going back as far as years. No one now knows the identity of the documents seized from the Club, which are copies and which are originals, or whether other documents were seized by the Director and are now unable to be located.  The charges in the Complaint related, amongst other things, to irregularities in the administration of the Club (e.g. the failure to hold any or sufficient meetings to approve actions) disproved by documents held by the
Director at the time Complaint was filed and unknown to the Club because of the lack of receipts and/or copies.  These circumstances forced the Director into withdrawing a number of charges. The Club applied for and was granted a permanent stay of the
Complaint proceedings, after 19 days of hearing. The Licensing Court said in its decision of 31 January 2005:  "Continuity in establishing the provenance of many of the documents is totally compromised from the date of seizure onwards. For example there is evidence that the seized documents included both originals and copies of documents, but in many cases we do not know which is which. The Complainant has not been able to tell us the whereabouts of originals of a number of documents (of which we have copies) referred to in Mr Cross' affidavit. We do not know in any particular case whether the original was seized or left with the Club, or if seized, whether it is lost, or is somewhere amongst the documents now returned, or is even amongst documents that might remain unknowingly with the
Complainant. This is not a question so much of admissibility, as of the ability of the parties and the Court to look at documents on which serious allegations are based and to draw conclusions as to their provenance.  
Not only does the Complainant now not know what documents had been in its possessions prior to the return of approximately 10 000 documents to the Club, it concedes some documents are now missing and on the evidence of Mr Greig some documents might even unknowingly still be in the possession of the
Complainant.  
These events of the past cannot now be corrected. The loss of continuity in relation to documents creates a serious injustice to the Club, particularly considering the onus on the Club."  Further the Licensing Court concluded:  "d. If the Inspectors had complied with their duties under Section 58 and 59 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) - as they were asked to do by the Club in October 1999 - the Club would not have been left to speculate. It would have had not only receipts for documents, but a certified copy of each document.  e. At least some of the documents now identified by the Club's Solicitor in his affidavit from amongst the late-returned documents, and not described in the Club's evidence up to this point, are clearly relevant, and helpful to the
Club.  f. It is an interesting submission - and not one we accept - that the Club should have known, but the Director/Complainant could not be expected to know, what were the documents the Director had been holding for so long.  
We accept that prejudice to the Club is cumulative in this case."  
The Licensing Court concluded that the community's reasonable expectation that the prosecution would proceed does not outweigh the right of the Club to a fair trial nor the damage to the administration of justice in the hearing continuing. The Licensing Court granted a permanent stay of the Complaint.  
Decision on Costs  Following the order of the Licensing Court permanently staying the
Complaint, the Club sought an order for costs. The Club submitted, inter alia, that the Director ought to be liable to pay the costs of the proceedings and not be in a better position, in relation to costs, than if the Complaint had proceeded and been lost.  The Licensing Court refused the Club's application for costs. It said:  "22. The Court has given careful consideration to the issue raised by the
Complainant as to why the Club should not be placed in a better position by obtaining a permanent stay than if the complaint was determined and the provisions of S.62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) applied.
The Court, in our view, has a discretion to award costs in the 'principal proceedings'. But, how should we exercise that discretion? We infer a legislative intent to protect the Director (or other party not advancing its pecuniary interest) from costs orders in 'principal proceedings' except in the limited circumstances set out in s.62(2) of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/). In this particular case we conclude it would be repugnant to common sense if the Club were put in a better position with proceedings undetermined than it would enjoy if it were wholly successful in fully heard and completed proceedings.
We believe that the discretion vested in the Court should not be exercised to award the Club its costs of the 'principal proceedings', but that in exercising its discretion to award costs it should only award the costs incurred by the Club in obtaining the permanent stay of proceedings.  
In relation to the costs of the costs application, as each party was partially successful having regard to the matters upon which the respective parties' submissions have been upheld, each should bear its own costs."  
Legislative Framework on Costs  Otherwise than on the specific question of costs that is now before the
Court, it is sufficient to understand that the jurisdiction of the Licensing
Court below derived from an interaction of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) and the [Liquor Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/) .
No one suggests that jurisdiction did not exist to decide as it did on the substantive question and no appeal or application for review has been pursued in relation to it.  On the issue of costs, there are two provisions of most relevance: [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/s16.html) of the [Liquor
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/) and section 62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/). I set them out:  [Liquor Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/)  "16(1) The costs of any proceedings in the court (other than proceedings for an offence) including the costs of any ancillary proceedings shall be paid by or apportioned between the parties in such manner as the court in its discretion orders and, in default of any such order, follow the event. 
If the court orders an applicant under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/index.html#p3) to pay costs, the court may also order that a person who is directly interested in the application, or in the business (whether proposed or actual) to which the application relates, or in the profits of that business, is to be jointly and severally liable (with the applicant) for the payment of those costs. 
Except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, costs shall not be awarded against an unsuccessful opponent of an application or a complainant on the grounds specified in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/s68.html) (d) if the court is satisfied:  that the person opposing the application or making the complaint had no direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the refusal of the application and no expectation of such an interest, and  that his or her opposition or complaint was not malicious, vexatious or frivolous. 
Where an order for an amount of costs and expenses is made under subsection (1) and the prescribed documents are filed in the office of a Local
Court having jurisdiction under the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) at or nearest the prescribed place at which the application that led to the order was heard, the order may be enforced as a judgment of that Local Court for the payment of that amount in accordance with the order of the court."  [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/)  "62(1) The Licensing Court:  in determining an application made under this Act to which an objection may be taken, may order that:  the applicant pay to any objector the objector's reasonable costs and expenses in making the objection, or  any objector or any person who the Licensing Court is satisfied is directly or indirectly interested in the taking of any objection pay to the applicant the applicant's reasonable costs and expenses in answering the objection, or  in determining a complaint under section 17 may order that:  the registered club against which the complaint is made pay to the complainant the complainant's reasonable costs and expenses in making the complaint, or  the complainant pay to the registered club the registered club's reasonable costs and expenses in answering the complaint,  within such time as may be specified in the order. 
Except in such circumstances as may be prescribed, an order shall not be made under subsection (1) for the payment of any amount by an objector or complainant if the Licensing Court is satisfied that the objection or complaint is based exclusively on considerations of public interest and is not malicious, frivolous or vexatious and that the objector or complainant has no direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the refusal of the application or any expectation of such an interest or in the upholding of the complaint. 
Any amount ordered to be paid under subsection (1) may be recovered as a debt in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
So long as any amount ordered to be paid by a registered club under subsection (1) remains unpaid after the time ordered for the payment thereof, the certificate of registration of the club shall be deemed to be not in force."  
The Appeal to this Court  The Club appeals to this Court. It is granted the right to appeal from any adjudication of the Licensing Court on any ground that involves a question of law: section 42(1) of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) is in the following terms:  "42(1) A person aggrieved by an adjudication of the Licensing Court in proceedings under this Act may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court on a question of law."  The Grounds of Appeal in the Summons were amended before the Court to include a new Ground 1A. The Grounds as amended are:  "1. That the court below erred in failing to exercise its discretion by ordering the Defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings.  
A. That the court below erred in making the following errors of law:  
That the plaintiff bore the onus of proof in relation to the matters under s62(2) of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/).  
That there was some evidence as to the way in which questions which would have arisen under s62(2) would have been decided.  
That regard might be had to questions which would have arisen under section 62(2).  
In failing ot have regard to the principle that the successful party should be compensated for costs incurred, in the absence of any ground making such an order unjust.  
In holding that making an order for costs in favour of the plaintiff was contrary to the legislative intent evidenced by s62(2).  
In concluding that it was reasonably open in the circumstances which lead to a permanent stay of proceedings to order costs otherwise than in the favour of the plaintiff. 
That the court below erred in exercising its discretion as to costs by giving effect to perceived policy considerations arising from s62 of the [Registered Clubs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/). 
That the court erred in the exercising of its discretion in failing to have regard to the fact that in default of a costs order made by it, costs would follow the event. 
The court below erred in failing to hold that it could not be satisfied that the Complaint and Summons was not frivolous or vexatious. 
That the court erred in failing to have regard to the failure of the
Defendant to comply with s59(3) of the [Registered Clubs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) and to the failure of the Defendant to withdraw particulars of the Complaint and
Summons after it became clear that they could not be established."  With the exception of Ground 1, which deals with the effect of the adjudication of the Licensing Court, all of the grounds involve an allegation of an error of law and an error on a question of law. Each centres on the proper construction of section 62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) and the proper policy to apply to the making of an order for costs. The Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal.  
Approach to Costs  The Club was wholly successful in the proceedings commenced by the
Complaint. The ordinary rules, reiterated by section 62(1) of the [Registered
Clubs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/), is that costs follow the event. Even if, as is the case, some of the grounds in the Complaint are criminal, quasi-criminal, or penal, the promulgation of section 62(1) necessarily imports the general proposition that costs follow the event: Milne versus Attorney-General for the State of Tasmania <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 460]; Latoudis versus Casey <case>; [(1990) 170 CLR 534]; Ohn versus Walton [(1995) 36 NSWLR 77.]  It is said, correctly, that the decision to award costs is an exercise of discretion. But even such an exercise may be challenged in an appropriate case: House versus The King <case>; [(1936) 55 CLR 499.] In Milne, supra, the High Court said:  "And, in all the circumstances, we do not think that the respondents should be precluded from challenging the order made as to costs. The ground of attack is not merely that a discretion has been wrongly exercised. It is a general rule that a wholly successful defendant should receive his costs unless good reason is shown to the contrary, and no reason to the contrary was shown in this case." (Per Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Williams, Fullagar and Taylor JJ at 477).  Want of logic is not an error of law and something more must be shown:
ABT versus Bond <case>; [(1990) 170 CLR 321] at 356. The difference between error of law and error of fact has traditionally followed the analysis of the Chief Justice Sir Frederic
Jordan, in Australian Gaslight Co versus Valuer-General <case>; [(1940) 40 SR 126:]  "In cases in which an appellate tribunal has jurisdiction to determine only questions of law, the following rules appear to be established by the authorities: 
The question what is the meaning of an ordinary English word or phrase as used in the Statute is one of fact, not of law. This question is to be resolved by the relevant tribunal itself, by considering the word in its context with the assistance of dictionaries and other books, and not by expert evidence; although evidence is receivable as to the meaning of technical terms; and the meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law:
Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax versus Pemsel. 
The question whether a particular set of facts comes within the description of such a word or phrase is one of fact. 
A finding of fact by a tribunal of fact cannot be disturbed if the facts inferred by the tribunal, upon which the finding is based, are capable of supporting its finding, and there is evidence capable of supporting its inferences. 
Such a finding can be disturbed only (a) if there is no evidence to support its inferences, or (b) if the facts inferred by it and supported by evidence are incapable of justifying the finding of fact based upon those inferences. Thus, if the facts inferred by the tribunal from the evidence before it are necessarily within the description of a word or phrase in a statute or necessarily outside that description, a contrary decision is wrong in law. If, however, the facts so inferred are capable of being regarded as either within or without the description, according to the relative significance attached to them, a decision either way by a tribunal of fact cannot be disturbed by a superior Court which can determine only questions of law." (Citations omitted.)  To that, in the current context, must be added the principles espoused by the Court of Appeal in Haines versus Leves [(1987) 8 NSWLR 442:]  "It is important to note again that the jurisdiction of this Court is limited to hearing appeals "on a question of law": see the Act, <case>. It is not for us to substitute our views on the interpretation of the facts. That is a function reposed by Parliament in the Tribunal. Law operating on fact, there is no gulf between them. They interact in the process of decision making. But the stringency of the limitation in the entitlement of this Court to examine factual determinations was recently stressed by the Court in an appeal from another specialist tribunal, the Compensation Court of New South Wales.
Appeals from that Court are, relevantly, also limited to questions of law. In
Azzopardi versus Tasman UEB Industries Ltd [(1985) 4 NSWLR 139] the majority (Glass JA, with whom Samuels JA agreed) stressed that in appeals such as the present, the legislation does not allow the Court to correct errors of fact. It does not permit the Court to review even a finding of fact which is said to be perverse or contrary to the overwhelming weight of evidence or even against the evidence and the weight of the evidence. Nor may the Court review findings on the facts which are alleged to ignore the probative force of the evidence which is all one way, even if no reasonable person could have reached the decision made and even if the reasoning by which the Court arrived at its finding was demonstrably unsound. In all such circumstances, the Court concluded, no error of law would be shown to attract the jurisdiction of this
Court. The findings and interpretation of the facts are matters reserved to the Tribunal below. Only if there is no evidence to support a finding, or if the ultimate finding of fact necessarily demonstrates a misdirection on the applicable statute may this Court offer relief, within its remit on questions of law. In Azzopardi I suggested that perversity and illogical reasoning could attract the jurisdiction of the Court. But this was a minority view. The majority opinion is the binding rule. It must be observed in this case. It provides the basis for the consideration of the appeal by this Court." (Per
Kirby P at 469-470).  The Licensing Court exercised its discretion by construing the provisions of section 62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) in accordance with the policy inferred by the Licensing Court. The passage from the judgment on costs, extracted at [11] above, displays that the Licensing
Court commenced from the proposition that there is a "legislative intent to protect the Director (or other party not advancing its pecuniary interest) from costs orders."  The High Court in Project Blue Sky versus ABA <case>; [(1998) 194 CLR 355] enshrined the purposive approach to statutory construction.
The task, it said, was "to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have" (per McHugh,
Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at 384). Some have taken this beyond that which seems to have been intended. It is to be remembered that the judgment immediately thereafter commented:  "Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction may require the words of a legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning."  Earlier, Barwick CJ in Buckman versus Flanagan <case>; [(1974) 133 CLR 422] had stated:  "The policy of the Act will be found in its express provisions. It is not proper, in my opinion, to suppose some policy and then to construe the language used by the Act in order to effect that policy. Of course, if the language of an Act as a whole discloses the purposes the Act is intended to effect, particular expressions can take their meaning to conform to that policy." (at 427)  The commencement point of the Licensing Court to construe the legislation so as to protect the Director discloses error. In Latoudis, supra, the
High Court said:  "Once that proposition is accepted, as in my view it must be, there is no sound basis for drawing a distinction in relation to the award of costs against an unsuccessful informant between summary proceedings instituted by a police or other public officer and those instituted by a private citizen. In the case of proceedings commenced by a private prosecutor which terminate in favour of the defendant, the private prosecutor should in ordinary circumstances be ordered to pay the costs, even if he or she initiates the proceedings for a public rather than a private purpose.  
In ordinary circumstances it would not be just or reasonable to deprive a defendant who has secured the dismissal of a criminal charge brought against him or her of an order for costs." (per Mason CJ at 542)  Further, Toohey J, in the same case said:  "What has emerged from a number of decisions is recognition that costs are awarded by way of indemnity to the successful party and, expressly or impliedly, that they are not by way of punishment of the unsuccessful party....  
If a prosecution has failed, it would ordinarily be just and reasonable to award the defendant costs, because the defendant has incurred expense, perhaps very considerable expense, in defending the charge. (Latoudis, supra, at -563, 565)"  
And McHugh J said:  "Likewise, a successful defendant in summary proceedings has a reasonable expectation of obtaining an order for the payment of his or her costs because it is just and reasonable that the informant should reimburse him or her for liability for costs which have been incurred in defending the prosecution.
Consequently, a magistrate ought not to exercise his or her discretion against a successful defendant on grounds unconnected with the charge or the conduct of the litigation. The fact that the informant has acted in good faith in the public interest or may have to meet the costs out of his or her own pocket is not a ground for depriving the defendant of his or her costs." (at 569)  In the present circumstances, the Licensing Court was entitled to qualify the ordinary conclusion as to costs by the purpose disclosed by section 62(2) of the Act. But the commencement point, qualified only by section 62(2), is that ordinarily the successful party is entitled to costs.  The policy disclosed by section 62(2) is an exception to the general rule.
The Licensing Court is required to be satisfied of three criteria:  that the complaint is based on consideration of public interest;  that it was not malicious, frivolous or vexatious; and  that the complainant had no direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the ... upholding of the complaint.  The Licensing Court considered none of the above in the proper context. It inferred a legislative protection for the Director, where none is disclosed in the Act. The Director may, more often than others, fulfil each of the criteria, but the Director is treated equally with others.  Further, the "protection" is not directed at those without a pecuniary interest (direct or indirect), but at those that fulfil each of the criteria.  Lastly, because the provisions of section 62(2) are an exception to the operation of the general provision in section 62(1), it is for the complainant, in this case the Director, to satisfy the Licensing Court.  Whether the power to award costs is being exercised under section 62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) or under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/s16.html) of the [Liquor
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/), the policy and considerations of each are so similar as to defy, in these circumstances, the identification of any different criteria to be considered.  The parties agreed below that the application (the Complaint) had not been determined. If that were so (on which, by virtue of the agreement, I do not comment), then no provision of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) dealt with the question of costs.  In those circumstances, the provision in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/s16.html) of the [Liquor
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/) dealing generally with the jurisdiction of the Licensing Court to award costs is not abrogated by any special provision: cf Saraswati versus R <case>; [(1991) 172 CLR 1] at 24. Section 62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) is not expressed in terms that imply that the circumstances there adumbrated are the only ones in which a costs order may be made. Rather section 62 of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) is an additional empowering provision and a specific exception.  Finally, I should deal with the effect, if any, of the issue of "onus" in the "protection" suggested by the Licensing Court. As earlier stated the onus in section 62(2) of the [Registered Clubs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) (and [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/s16.html) of the [Liquor
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/)) is on the party seeking to depart from the general rule set up in sub-section (1).  It is, in this case, for the Director to establish that the Complaint was, inter alia, not vexatious or frivolous. In the instant proceedings, the documents held by the Director were a complete answer to some, at least, of the Grounds in the Complaint. A proceeding is vexatious if, regardless of the motive of the litigant that commenced them, they are obviously untenable or manifestly groundless: Attorney-General versus Wentworth [(1988) 14
NSWLR 481] at 491. This does not mean that simply because a party proves unsuccessful, the test would be satisfied: R versus Moore; ex parte FMWU <case>; [(1978) 140 CLR 470] at 473.
However, it does mean that costs may be awarded where a party institutes a proceeding in circumstances where, on the facts known to the party instituting it, there was no substantial prospects of success: see by analogy Canceri v
Taylor [(1994) 1 IRCR 120]; Kanan v
APTU <case>; [(1992) 43 IR 257] at 304.  
Conclusion  Errors of law infect the exercise of discretion by the Licensing Court in its decision on costs. Those errors include a misconstruction of the policy to be applied derived from the statutory powers; the failure to consider the "vexatious" nature of at least some parts of the Complaint; and the incorrect onus placed on the Club to prove its entitlement in circumstances where, having succeeded, it was entitled, without more, to costs.  The next aspect is the question of the order that should be issued, if any.
In the view formed, the Licensing Court has applied the wrong test, it has considered irrelevant matters and it has failed to consider relevant (and required) matters. The discretion has miscarried and the decision ought to be quashed.  The Court of Appeal in Ohn versus Walton, supra, dealt with a similar situation. It said:  "When legislation confers a power to order costs it is, in the absence of any contrary indication, to be understood as conferring a power to be exercised for that purpose.  
Two things follow: 
The usual rationale of making a costs order is that it is just and reasonable that the successful party should be reimbursed for costs incurred, in the absence of grounds connected with the charge or the conduct of the proceedings which make it unjust or unreasonable that there should be such reimbursement. 
The test of whether an order for costs should be made against an unsuccessful plaintiff or complainant is not whether he or she has done anything to warrant punishment. It is whether, in the circumstances, the defendant or respondent should be compensated.  
The majority also held that these principles are equally applicable to a case where a complainant or informant is acting under a public duty to lay a complaint or information." (Per Gleeson CJ at 79)  
It also said:  "Whether the Medical Tribunal be a court or not, the principles enunciated by
Mason CJ and McHugh J are of general application and should be applied by a tribunal such as the Medical Tribunal, absent contrary legislation or regulation....  
An appeal lies to this Court with respect to a question of law, but not an exercise of discretion. However, the orders made by the Medical Tribunal exhibit a disregard of relevant principles thus constituting an error of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in House versus The King [(1955) 95
CLR 499.] It follows that the appeal must be upheld." (Per Cole JA at )  While there may be error of the kind that would allow the Court to overturn the decision below, it is the Licensing Court that heard the proceedings, it is the Licensing Court that is better able to judge the extent to which the
Complaint was vexatious and to assess whether the whole, or a proportion (and, if so, what proportion) of costs should be awarded.  I make the following orders:  
Appeal allowed;  
Decision of the Licensing Court of 17 July 2006 dismissing the application of the Chinese Cultural Club Limited for costs of the proceedings brought against it by the Director of Liquor and Gaming be set aside;  
The question of costs be remitted to the Licensing Court to determine in accordance with law;  
The Director of Liquor and Gaming pay the costs of the Chinese Cultural
Club Limited of and incidental to these proceedings;  
To the extent otherwise entitled, the Director of Liquor and Gaming having a certificate under the [Suitors' Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) .
