John Ham and Raymond Ham held beneficial interests in land under the [Real
Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) (the "Act") as tenants in common. These interests were held subject to a life interest which came to an end in 1988. In 1989 the land was transferred by way of sale to Mr and Mrs Camley who believed that they were dealing with both brothers. In fact, it was Raymond alone who executed various documents, forging his brother's signature.

On 24 October 1991, John Ham filed a Cross Claim against the Registrar-General for damages for deprivation of his interest in the land pursuant to [s126(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the Act. At this date, Raymond Ham had not been declared bankrupt. However, it was found that he lacked funds to meet his debts as they fell due, including his liability to damages under [s126(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html), (b) and (3). By the time of trial in 1997, John Ham had died and the proceedings were continued by his legal personal representatives, the respondents in the appeal.

Young J held that the word "insolvent" in [s126(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) means unable to pay his, her or its debts as they fall due. Accordingly, his
Honour held that Raymond Ham was "insolvent" at the date of commencement of proceedings and that John Ham's estate was entitled to recover damages from the Torrens Assurance Fund.

HELD, dismissing the appeal: 
A person seeking to invoke the provisions of [s126(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the Act must establish that the relevant fact upon which he or she seeks to rely exists at the time of the commencement of the proceedings. It is irrelevant that that fact may no longer exist at the time of the hearing.

REGISTRAR-GENERAL versus HARRIS & Anor 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: John Ham and Raymond Ham held beneficial interests in land under the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ("the Act"). John had a two thirds interest and Raymond a one third interest as tenants in common. The beneficial interests arose under Terms of Settlement filed in proceedings brought in 1959 against their late father's estate. The brothers held their interests subject to a life interest which came to an end in 1988. In 1989 the land was transferred by way of sale to Mr and Mrs McCamley who believed that they were dealing with both brothers. In fact it was Raymond alone who executed various documents, forging his brother's signature. One such forged document was a Withdrawal of Caveat which purported to withdraw a Caveat lodged by John in 1962 to protect his equitable interest in the land. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the Act gave John statutory causes of action for damages against his fraudulent brother, and against the Registrar-General as nominal defendant. So far as relevant, [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) provides: 
Compensation for party deprived of land . (1) Any person deprived of land or of any estate, or interest in land: in consequence of fraud; ...
 may bring and prosecute in any Court of competent jurisdiction an action for the recovery of damages.

An action under subsection (1) shall, ... subject to subsections (3), (4) and (5), be brought and prosecuted against the person: ...
 upon whose application the erroneous registration was made; ....

In every case in which the fraud, error, omission, or misdescription occurs upon a transfer for value, the transferor receiving the value shall be regarded as the person upon whose application the transferee was recorded as registered proprietor in the folio of the Register.
 ....

In any of the following cases, that is to say: ...
 when the person liable for damages under this section is dead, bankrupt, or insolvent, or cannot be found within the jurisdiction, such damages with costs of action may be recovered out of the Torrens
Assurance Fund by action against the Registrar-General as nominal defendant.

By the time of trial in 1997 John had died, and the proceedings were continued by his legal personal representatives who are the respondents to this appeal.

Raymond Ham was served but did not appear. Young J held that it was clear that the respondents (as executors of John Ham's estate) had a cause of action pursuant to [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) against Raymond for damages in consequence of fraud. Raymond was ordered to compensate John's estate in a sum in excess of $200,000. But this judgment was worthless in view of Raymond's financial position.

Young J also held that John's estate was entitled to recover damages from the
Torrens Assurance Fund ("the Fund") pursuant to [s126(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html)
That decision is the subject of this appeal.

The issue arises in this way. On 24 October 1991 John filed a Cross Claim against the Registrar-General which propounded the claim under [s126(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html)
At this date, Raymond Ham had not been declared bankrupt. However, it was found that he then lacked funds to meet his debts as they fell due, including his liability to damages under [s126(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html), (b) and (3). In other words, he was insolvent in the lay sense of the word.
But he was not made bankrupt until 1993 (pursuant to a petition presented by a bank). What is at issue in the appeal is whether Raymond Ham was "insolvent" according to the terms of [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) in 1991. The appellant contends that he was not, because of the absence of "some public or overt fact or event [marking] the commencement of a voluntary [or involuntary] sequestration" (cf R versus Davison <case>; [(1954) 90 CLR 353] at 365 per Dixon CJ and McTiernan J).

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF [S126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) has stood in its present form, with immaterial exceptions, since 1900. When Mr
Heydon, Commissioner for the Consolidation of the Statute Law, certified the
Bill for the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) he provided a Memorandum informing the reader that: 
This Bill consolidates the whole or part of six Acts.

The original Acts are very badly drawn, but such large interests are governed by them that it has been reluctantly decided that it would be too hazardous to use a free hand in reforming their arrangement and language.
 ...

Clause 126. This most confused section would have been dealt with more freely but that its subject matter is very important, and its real meaning obscure.
 ...

I certify that save as aforesaid this Bill solely consolidates and does not alter, add to, or amend the law as contained in the Acts therein consolidated.

Section 126 re-enacted s117 of the Real Property Act 1862. So far as relevant the 1862 section provided: 
Any person deprived of land ... in consequence of fraud ... may bring and prosecute an action at law for the recovery of damages against such person as the Governor ... may appoint as nominal defendant and in any other case against the person upon whose such land the application was brought under the provisions of this Act or who acquired title through such fraud ... provided further that ... in case the person against whom such action for damages is directed to be brought as aforesaid shall be dead or shall have been adjudged insolvent or cannot be found within the jurisdiction then and in any such case such damages with costs of action may be recovered out of the assurance fund by action against the Registrar-General as nominal defendant.

It can be seen that the presently critical portion of the enactment proceeded from "shall have been adjudged insolvent" in 1862 to "is ... bankrupt, or insolvent" in 1900.

YOUNG J'S REASONS 
Young J pointed out that the time proceedings were commenced was the relevant time for determining the operation of s126(5)(b) (see Saade versus Registrar-
General  <case>; [(1993) 179 CLR 58] at 68-9). The learned judge then referred to s126 as a practical scheme for compensation requiring a purposive construction to meet its beneficial objective. Section 126 complements provisions such as ss41, 42, , 43A, 124 and 135 which give indefeasibility of title to registered proprietors in certain circumstances. His Honour recognised that the present form of s126 is replete with ambiguities (see generally New South Wales Law
Reform Commission, Torrens Title: Compensation for Loss, Report 76, 1996).

The judge then addressed the Registrar-General's specific submission that "insolvent" in s126 means "adjudged insolvent". He noted that the argument could take many forms, but the strongest version of it was that, when the Real
Property Act was consolidated in 1900, there were two types of people whose estates had been sequestrated: those who had been made insolvent under the Insolvency Act 1841; and those who had been made bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act 1898.

Young J observed that the Registrar-General's argument also drew strength from the reference in s131(2) to a right of recovery of moneys paid in respect of a claim on the Fund against "the estate of such insolvent or bankrupt".
Section 131(2) also appears to contemplate that the insolvent or bankrupt will have his or her estate administered by "the Official Receiver in
Bankruptcy". (In its original form in 1900, the words were "the official assignee".) As against this, there were difficulties in completely merging s131(2) with s126(5). These include the fact that it is not necessarily the case that the insolvent mentioned in s126(5) remains insolvent at the time the
Registrar-General makes the claim under s131(2). His Honour continued: 
Accordingly, although s131(2) points toward the construction that "insolvent" means "adjudged insolvent", it does not seem to me that it goes the whole way.

His Honour then reviewed the arguments in favour of the claimant. Citing Re
Muggeridge's Settlement [(1859) 29 LJ Ch 288] and
Re Bevin [[1936] NZLR 789], he noted that the normal meaning of "insolvent" is "unable to pay his or her debts as they become due". Secondly, he repeated that the purpose of the scheme was to make sure that people who have been deprived of their actions in an ejectment by the Torrens system should not go away empty-handed. Thirdly, he concluded that Registrar-General v
Behn [[1979] 2 NSWLR 496 (Holland]; , [1980] 1 NSWLR 589 (CA), [(1981) 148 CLR 562 (HC)] supported the claimant, because an award against the Fund was made in that case on the basis of a fraudulent dealing by an "insolvent" company. The company (Cornic
Loan & Credits Pty Ltd) was without funds, but there was no finding that it had been "adjudged bankrupt" or ordered to be wound up.

These three arguments led the learned judge to conclude that the word "insolvent" in s126(5)(b) means unable to pay his, her or its debts as they fall due.

THE APPELLANT'S CHALLENGE TO YOUNG J'S REASONS 
Counsel for the appellant have submitted that Young J's interpretation of the word "insolvent" does not give sufficient weight to the legislative history.
The appellant's submission, in essence, is that: 
The term "insolvent" was originally used in the relevant provision of the
Real Property Act 1862 to refer to persons adjudged insolvent under the insolvency laws then in force.

When the insolvency laws were replaced by bankruptcy laws, the reference to bankruptcy was added. There remained, however, persons to whom the insolvency laws were applicable. That was the reason for retaining the reference to insolvency in the Real Property Act consolidation of 1900.

Nothing has occurred since 1900 to require that a new or expanded meaning be given to "insolvent" in s126(5)(b).

This submission was developed in detail as follows. When the Real Property Act was passed, the only law relating to insolvency in New South Wales was the Insolvency Act 1841. The 1862 Act's predecessor to s126 (s117) made no reference to "bankrupt", confining itself to the phrase "shall have been adjudged insolvent". Other references to insolvency in the 1862 Act are also to be read as references to the technical sense of the word involving a change of status consequent upon formal steps having been taken by a creditor or the debtor (see ss3 (definition of "Transmission"), 50, 75 and 123).

It was submitted that the relevant alteration in language between s117 of the Act and s126 of the 1900 Act (whereby "shall have been adjudged insolvent" was replaced by "is ... bankrupt, or insolvent") did not betoken a change in meaning. The word "adjudged" was otiose.

Next it was submitted that that the principles of construction of consolidating statutes are to be applied and that they support a presumption against an intention to effect any substantive amendment. The parliamentary debates contain nothing to suggest an intention to effect a substantive amendment. Adoption of the lay meaning of "insolvent" brings uncertainty and problems of proof.

Young J's reliance upon the Behn decisions was said to be misplaced, because the present issue was not argued at any stage in the litigation.
Indeed, there is a contradictory dictum of Gibbs CJ (Registrar-General v Behn <case>; [(1981) 148 CLR 562] at 567) where his Honour said: 
The words of section 126(5) show that the damages recoverable out of the
Assurance Fund are the damages for which the person who is insolvent is liable "under the section", that is the damages recoverable under subsection (1).
This conclusion is supported by the provisions of sections 131 and 132; the fact that the money paid out of the fund is recoverable from the estate of the insolvent indicates that it was contemplated that the fund was not liable for any greater amount than that for which the insolvent was liable to the person deprived of the land. (emphasis added) 
Finally, the appellant relied upon the opinion expressed in Hogg, The
Australian Torrens System (1905) where the learned author said (at 990-1): 
The words "bankruptcy" and "insolvency" are (except in the case of New
Zealand) used in the Torrens Statutes with reference to their meaning in the respective local enactments relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, and usually in a semi-technical sense to indicate the status of a debtor whose property - whether by "adjudication" of his person as a bankrupt, or "sequestration" of his effects for the benefit of creditors - is being administered under the protection of the Courts with a view to liquidation.
 (The author added a footnote referring to the principal Bankruptcy or
Insolvency Acts of the various States. This included the New South Wales
Bankruptcy Act 1898.) 
INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed relevantly defines "bankrupt" to mean "a merchant, trader, or other person whose property and effects, on his becoming insolvent, are administered and distributed for the benefit of all his creditors, under that system of statutory regulations called the Bankrupt or Bankruptcy Laws". (The earliest such law was passed in 1542.) This and other definitions in that work distinguish between insolvency as a state of affairs and bankruptcy as a formal consequence thereof. One such reference is a statement of Lord Ellenborough CJ in 1817, when he spoke of a man who "knew himself insolvent, and when ruin and bankruptcy were staring him in the face" (Simpson versus Sikes <case>; [(1817) 6 M & S 295] at <case>; , [105 ER 1253] at 1261).

However, the Oxford English Dictionary also gives examples of "bankruptcy" being used to denote a general state of impecuniosity; and definitions of "insolvency" involving a formal status. Wharton's Law Lexicon (14th ed) points out that the noun "insolvent", when distinguished from "bankrupt", was an insolvent who was not a trader: for (in England) only a trader could originally be made bankrupt in the sense of obtaining an absolute discharge from debts, while the future estate of an insolvent remained liable for debts even after discharge. In his monograph Bankruptcy and Insolvency in London during the Industrial Revolution (1985) Ian Duffy demonstrates at length the legal distinctions between the Bankruptcy Laws and the Insolvency Laws as each evolved in England during the period 1750-1850. Until the mid nineteenth century, the benefits and burdens of the bankruptcy laws only fell on traders of various categories. The petitioner had to establish that the debtor was a trader who had committed an act of bankruptcy. There were various offences, some even punishable by death. A complex and much-abused system operated to gather assets and divide them among creditors. Subject to these matters, bankruptcy was a privilege because it could result in discharge from indebtedness.

By contrast, the insolvency laws addressed the plight of non-traders. The principal remedy - imprisonment - was harsh, extremely dilatory, and (unlike bankruptcy) did not lead to release from indebtedness short of payment. From the early nineteenth century there were English statutes "for the relief of insolvent debtors" (53 Geo III c1 & 2 (1813), 102 Vic c110, ss23ff ), primarily designed to relieve against the rigours, inadequacies and dangers of imprisonment. In England the distinction between insolvent and bankrupt in their formal senses was gradually broken down, culminating in the application of the bankruptcy legislation generally to non-traders with the
Bankruptcy Act 1861. By the Bankruptcy Repeal and Insolvent Court Act 1869, all the enactments on the subject were repealed, and provision was made for winding up and terminating all matters pending under the Acts for the relief of insolvent debtors.

This parallel system was not replicated in New South Wales. Imprisonment for debt (through the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum) was severely curtailed from 1846 onwards (see 10 Vic No 7, An Act to simplify the Law abolishing
Imprisonment for Debt).

In 1839 the Supreme Court of New South Wales confirmed that the English
Bankrupts Act 1825 (6 Geo IV, c16) was not in force in New South Wales: see
Ex parte Lyons; In re Wilson [(1839) 1 Legge 140.] This ruling spurred the legislature to pass the Insolvency Act 1841 (5 Vic No 17), which was in force when the Real Property Act 1862 was passed. Its long title was: 
An Act for giving Relief to Insolvent Persons, and providing for the due
Collection, Administration, and Distribution of Insolvent Estates, within the
Colony of New South Wales, and for the Prevention of Frauds affecting the same.

Unlike the situation then prevailing in England, the Insolvency Act 1841 dealt compendiously with traders and non-traders. And it used the expression "insolvency" both in the lay sense, and as a description of the formal status which current English statute law described as "bankruptcy". As will be demonstrated below, it was not until 1887 that the New South Wales legislature commenced to use "bankruptcy" to describe the formal status.

The New South Wales Insolvency Act 1841 bears many of the hallmarks of a modern bankruptcy statute. It provided for the appointment of a Chief
Commissioner of Insolvent Estates and other ministerial officers (s1). Debtors were enabled to declare themselves insolvent by petition and to surrender their estate for the benefit of creditors (s3). And creditors could obtain sequestration orders based upon stipulated "acts of Insolvency" (ss13, 5).
Various dealings by persons "actually Insolvent" (s6) or "being Insolvent" were avoided. Certain payments made by or to a person "knowing himself to be Insolvent" were declared fraudulent (s12). These and other provisions (eg ss31, 53) indicate that "insolvent" could be used (even in a statute) to describe a person unable to pay debts as they fell due, even though formal process had not yet been taken to sequestrate that person's estate. At other times, the Act spoke of a person's estate being "surrendered or sequestrated as Insolvent" (s107) with formal notification thereof in the Gazette (s34).
These latter references connote some formal step or determination, including official recognition capable of being described as "adjudged insolvent".
Provision was made for discharge from the status of insolvency (s16).

The Insolvency Act 1841 was amended a number of times. In 1887 the various enactments were repealed upon the commencement of the Bankruptcy Act 1887, described in its long title as "An Act to amend and consolidate the Law relating to Insolvency and Bankruptcy and to provide for the due collection, administration, and distribution of Insolvent and Bankrupt Estates, and for the prevention of frauds affecting the same." 
The 1887 Act followed the English Act of 1883 in using "bankruptcy" to denote the formal steps capable of being taken in response to an "available act of bankruptcy". It enabled sequestration orders to be made by a Judge of the
Supreme Court upon the petition of a creditor or the debtor, whereupon "the debtor becomes a bankrupt" (s5(II)). "Bankruptcy" was defined to include a composition or arrangement made under the provisions of the Act (s3).

Part VII of the Bankruptcy Act 1887 dealt with "Jurisdiction". Bankruptcy jurisdiction was transferred from the Supreme Court, or a Judge thereof, or the Chief Commissioner for Insolvent Estates, to the Supreme Court in its
Bankruptcy Jurisdiction, to be exercised by "the Judge in Bankruptcy". By way of transitional provision, s127(2) stipulated that: 
Whenever the terms `Insolvency' or `Insolvent' are used in any statute in force at the date of the passing of this Act such terms shall include the terms respectively `Bankruptcy' and `Bankrupt', and wherever the `Chief
Commissioner of Insolvent Estates' is mentioned or signified in any such statute the term shall be interpreted to mean the Judge in Bankruptcy.

All matters arising out of the repealed Insolvency Acts were transferred to the Judge in Bankruptcy (s131).

The Bankruptcy Act 1887 was amended in 1888 and 1896. The Bankruptcy Act
Amendment Act 1888 made further transitional provision preserving the appropriate operation of the "Acts relating to Insolvency" preceding the 1887
Act.

A further consolidation occurred in 1898 with the passing of the Bankruptcy
Act 1898. Once again there were transitional provisions addressing estates vested in official assignees before the passing of the Bankruptcy Act 1887 (see ss106, 133(3)). In particular, s133(3) provided that: 
Whenever the terms "Insolvency" or "Insolvent" are used in any statute now in force, such terms shall include the terms "Bankruptcy" and "Bankrupt" respectively, and wherever the "Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates" is mentioned or signified in any such Statute, the term shall be interpreted to mean the Judge.

As the nineteenth century progressed, legislators came to distinguish insolvency and bankruptcy more clearly, reserving the latter expression for the formal status stemming inter alia from a judicial determination or some other step that brought a relevant legislative scheme into operation (such as assignment of assets to trustees for the benefit of creditors). As indicated, the differentiation occurred much earlier in England than it did in the
Australian colonies.

In Hunt versus Fripp [(1897) 58 LT 516] Byrne J in
England accepted expert evidence as to the law of Victoria, finding that the "[Insolvency Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ia1890149/)" of that colony, so far as applicable to the case at hand, did not differ materially from the English bankruptcy law.

When the Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) was framed, legislative power to make laws with respect to "bankruptcy and insolvency" were conferred on the federal Parliament [(s51(xvii)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html)
The meaning of "insolvency" in this context has not been explored. However, the meaning of [s44(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s44.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) has. That section renders incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator a person who "Is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent". In Nile v
Wood <case>; [(1988) 167 CLR 133] the High Court held that the adjective "undischarged" attaches to both "bankrupt" and to "insolvent". In other words, insolvent in that context is not adjectival and merely describing a person who cannot pay his or her debts as they fall due. Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ said (at 139): 
It is ... part of a composite reference to the status of a person who has been declared bankrupt or insolvent and who has not been discharged from the condition.

Because of this, the exposition of [s44(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s44.html) does not assist with the more opaque s126 of the Real Property Act.

However, their Honours went on to explain (at 140); 
At the turn of the century some Australian Colonies had bankruptcy laws (Bankruptcy Act 1898 , Bankruptcy Act 1892 (WA), Bankruptcy Act 1870 ); some had insolvency laws: [Insolvency Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ia1890149/) (Vict),
Insolvency Act 1874 (Q), Insolvent Act 1886 (SA). In each case the statute provided for the adjudication of a person by a court as either a bankrupt or an insolvent. In each case the statute provided machinery for the discharge of the person so adjudicated. It is true that the word "insolvent", standing on its own, is not a term of art and may mean no more than unable to pay debts that are due: Re Muggeridge's Trusts. But against a statutory background such as the Insolvent Act 1886 (SA), the term has been held to mean adjudicated insolvent: In re Salom; Salom versus Salom <case>; [[1924] SASR 93.] 
This passage supports the appellant's case to a degree, because it reinforces the perceived interchangeability of the terms "bankrupt" and "insolvent", if viewed from a national perspective. The South Australian case of
Salom to which reference was made involved the 1903 will of a testator domiciled in South Australia, where an interest was given subject to a proviso that if the beneficiary became insolvent or attempted to sell, charge, encumber or dispose of his estate, then such interest should cease. In the light of the Insolvent Act 1886 (SA) that was current at the time the will was made, and the wording and context of the particular will, it is hardly surprising that insolvent was construed in its specialised or technical meaning of adjudicated insolvent on proof of a sufficient act of insolvency.
But the case is of little assistance in construing the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) .

The existence in England and Australia of formal, statutory mechanisms to deal with "bankruptcy" or "insolvency" did not mean that legislatures or courts were ignorant of the condition of insolvency in its lay sense of inability to pay debts. Depending on context, "insolvency" could mean at least one of three different concepts: inability to meet debts; the technical sense of being the condition or standard of inability to meet debts, upon the occurrence of which the statutory law enabled a party such as a creditor or the debtor to some curial relief; or the status of a person by whom or against whom curial relief has been granted or some other formal step actually taken. See Re Bevin.

There are many cases where judges have grappled with whether "insolvent" was used in a statute or other legal context in one or other of these different senses. In England at least the choice was usually seen as one between construing a reference to insolvency as "ordinary acceptation [as] a person who cannot pay his debts" (Parker versus Gossage [(1835) 5 LJ Ex 4] at 5 per
Parke B) or in the sense of a person who has taken the benefit of an enactment passed for the relief of insolvent debtors (Parker; The Princess
Royal (1845) 9 Jur 433).

The differences in statutory nomenclature between England and Australia require caution in handling the English cases. Nevertheless there are statements of general application to the effect that "insolvent" and "insolvency" may be construed in its lay sense. It all depends on context. In
Re Muggeridge's Settlement, a settlement created a life interest in remainder, determinable (in favour of another member of the family) inter alia in the event of the life tenant being "bankrupt or insolvent". In this context Wood VC held that "insolvent" did not possess its technical meaning.
He regarded it as "now settled that it is not a technical term, but simply means a person who is incapable of paying his debts". In Attorney General for British Columbia versus Attorney General for Canada [[1937] AC 391] at 402, Lord
Thankerton, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said: 
In a general sense, insolvency means inability to meet one's debts or obligations; in a technical sense, it means the condition or standard of inability to meet debts or obligations, upon the occurrence of which the statutory law enables a creditor to intervene, with the assistance of a Court, to stop individual action by creditors and to secure administration of the debtor's assets in the general interest of creditors; the law also generally allows the debtor to apply for the same administration.

The non-technical meaning was applied in James versus Rockwood Colliery Co [(1912) 106 LT 128] and London and Counties Assets Co Ltd versus Brighton Grand
Concert Hall and Picture Palace Ltd [[1915] 2 KB 493 (CA).] Each case involved the construction of Articles of Association of a company which provided that the office of director was to be vacated if the director "became bankrupt, lunatic or insolvent" (James) or "became bankrupt or insolvent or compound with his creditors" (London and Counties). In each case "insolvent" was construed in its lay sense. In the later case
Buckley LJ referred to several nineteenth century cases on the meaning of "insolvent", observing that "they all state that `insolvency' means commercial insolvency, that is to say, inability to pay debts as they become due". These two English cases distinguished an earlier House of Lords decision in Reg versus Saddlers Co <case>; [(1863) HLC 404], [11 ER 1083] on the basis that the context in the later cases provided nothing to suggest that the word "insolvent" was ejustem generis with bankrupt, or that it was critical that the insolvency date from a particular time. In James, Lush J said (at 130): 
The context in which the word `insolvent' is used in the present case is different, and the proper rule to apply in determining the meaning to be given to it is to ask oneself first what the word means as ordinarily used, and then to see whether the context in which the word is used and the object of the article are such as to lead one to give the word a meaning other than it ordinarily bears.

I agree.

INTERPRETING "INSOLVENT" IN [SECTION 126(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) 
After this excursus I proceed to the task at hand: [Section (5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) has stood unamended since 1900 (save for the presently irrelevant alteration from "assurance fund" to "Torrens Assurance Fund"). Since the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) is not a constitution capable of attracting the notion of an expanding "denotation" (cf
Kartinyeri versus The Commonwealth [(1998) 72 ALJR 122] at [132]) the meaning of "insolvent" should be taken as fixed at 1900. And the provision should be construed from the standpoint of the draftsman and Parliament in (contemporaneous exposition) (Corporate Affairs Commissioner of New
South Wales versus Yuill <case>; [(1991) 172 CLR 319] at 321-2, 331).
In New South Wales the ordinary or natural meaning of "insolvent" in 1900 was the lay sense of the word: see cases discussed above. In addition to the usual canons of statutory interpretation, this meaning draws support from (a) the contrast within the subsection between "bankrupt" and "insolvent" and (b) the fact that the New South Wales parliament had ceased to use "insolvent" as its description of the formal status of "bankruptcy" (voluntary or involuntary) since 1887.
True, it was possible that there may in 1900 still have been persons who or whose estates could be said still to have the formal status of insolvency, stemming from some judicial determination or "public or overt fact or event [marking] the commencement of a voluntary sequestration" (R versus Davison at ) stemming from the Insolvency Act 1841 (as amended) when it was in force prior to 1887. But there was nothing in the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) or any other statute in force at that time to deem "insolvent" in [s126(5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) to have this anachronistic meaning. The transitional provisions in the
Bankruptcy Act 1887 (s127(2)) and the Bankruptcy Act 1898 (s133(3)) deemed "insolvent" to include "bankrupt", but in terms this was only where the word "insolvent" appeared "in any statute in force" at the date of the passing of those respective Acts. These transitional provisions could not directly extend the meaning of "insolvent" in [s126(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). In any event, the collocation of "bankrupt" and "insolvent" in [s126(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) meant that some work had to be found for the latter term. It is possible that the word was intended to pick up persons whose estates had prior to 1887 been "adjudged insolvent" (in the language of the Real Property Act 1862), but this is a speculative rather than an indicated intent.
The legislative history of s126 (which I have recounted) precluded any inference that parliament necessarily intended that "insolvent" (in the 1900
Act) should mean the same as "should have been adjudged insolvent" (in the Act). Normally, one assumes that a change of language signals a change of meaning. Such assumption may be strengthened where the greater part of the relevant statute is a pure consolidation, but the critical provision is not.
The enigmatic comment about clause 126 in the certificate of the Commissioner for the Consolidation of Statute Law certainly does not enable the reader to infer conscious continuity of meaning. Quite the reverse. The certificate reveals that clause 126 was an exception to pure consolidation, and that the section had been amended, albeit not "freely". The appellant's submission that the change merely deleted as otiose the word "adjudged" is circular, and cannot be accepted to boost the strength of the appellant's case.
The Commissioner's certificate acknowledged that the real meaning of clause 126 was "obscure". In that situation, a court should be slow to divine a purpose undisclosed in the language and arguably at variance with it (in that the subsection distinguishes "bankrupt" and "insolvent"). The obscure message of legislative history (putting the matter at its highest) and doubtful ambiguity of "insolvent" (when viewed solely in its linguistic context) do not bring [ss33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s33.html) or [34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s34.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) into play.
One is therefore left with Scalia J's descriptive injunction that "judges interpret laws rather than reconstruct legislators' intention" (Immigration and Naturalisation Service versus Cordoza-Fonseca <case>; [480 US 421] (1987) at 452-3. Cf Evans versus Marmont <case>; [(1997) 42 NSWLR 70] at 80, 86).
Even if s126 were to be seen as an attempted consolidation of its predecessor (which it clearly was not), it would not follow that a court was obliged to interpret it as if enacted in 1862 (when existing statute law would arguably have construed "insolvent" to mean "adjudged insolvent") as distinct from 1900 (when existing statute law gave no such meaning to "insolvent"). In
Maybury versus Plowman <case>; [(1913) 16 CLR 468] at 479, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ adopted what Lord
Watson had said in Administrator-General of Bengal versus Prem Lal Mullick [(1895) LR 22 Ind App 107] at 116: 
The respondent maintained this singular proposition, that, in dealing with a consolidating Statute, each enactment must be traced to its original source, and, when that is discovered, must be construed according to the state of circumstances which existed when it first became law. The proposition has neither reason nor authority to recommend it. The very object of consolidation is to collect the statutory law bearing upon a particular subject, and to bring it down to date in order that it may form a useful code applicable to the circumstances existing at the time when the consolidating Act is passed.
The subject matter of s126 clearly qualifies it for a beneficial interpretation, however much the sorry history of attempts to make claims on the Fund suggests to the contrary. I see no reason why claims should be frustrated by a niggardly interpretation. "After all the Assurance Funds are not State funds, but were built up as insurance funds by the contribution of landowners; furthermore very little of the accumulated funds has been disgorged. (Whalan, The Torrens System in Australia, 1982 p352) 
This is reinforced when one recognises that the compensation principle is one of the key planks of the Torrens system. As the New South Wales Law Reform
Commission observed in its report, Torrens Title: Compensation for Laws, , Report 76 (quoting Whalan op cit, pp345-6): "The scheme of the Act is to provide a fund for compensating all persons who are deprived of their land by the operation of the Act, and reason and justice require that no qualification should be put upon the rights so given which is not in express terms imposed by the statute. ... In short, the provisions aim to form the second part of the complement that, under the Torrens system, a man is to have either his interest in the land or adequate monetary compensation therefor."
The strongest argument favouring the appellant is based on references in other sections of the Act as enacted in 1900 which refer to insolvent in the sense of a status consequent upon steps invoking a statutory regime. These are ss3 (definition of "transmission" as the acquirement of title consequent upon "bankruptcy, insolvency" etc); 54(1) (reference to the surrender of a lease "under the provisions of any law at the time being in force relating to bankrupt or insolvent estates"); 90 (transmission "upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the registered proprietor", a provision explained in
Commissioner Heydon's memorandum as appropriate because "there may still be some old cases to which the words `or insolvency' may still be appropriate"); (2) (reference to a debt "due from the estate of such insolvent or bankrupt").
 (Some of these provisions have been amended since 1900.) Like Young J, I acknowledge the force of this reasoning. However, there are two characteristics of s126(5)(b) which are not shared by any of the foregoing provisions, ie conscious alteration from the 1862 model, noted by Commissioner
Heydon; and a context freed from an express reference to something suggesting the formal status, ie the references to a law, an estate or devolution of title to property.
In its principal formulation, the appellant's case involved the plea that "insolvent" should be read as if the words "adjudged insolvent" were used. Yet the case does not satisfy the principles governing when courts may perform this exercise (cf Bermingham versus Corrective Services Commissioner of New
South Wales [(1988) 15 NSWLR 292).]
Notwithstanding the differing uses of "insolvent" in the nineteenth century, indeed because of such differences, a court would require fairly unambiguous legislative history or evidence of purpose to turn s126 into the consolidation provision that the Commissioner indicated (by words and conduct) it was not.
In Stuart versus The Queen <case>; [(1974) 134 CLR 426] at 437 (cited by McHugh J in R versus Barlow (1997) 188 CLR at 19) Gibbs J pointed out that: it may be justifiable to turn back to the common law where the Code contains provisions of doubtful import, or uses language which had previously acquired a technical meaning, or on some such special ground ... If the Code is to be thought of as `written on a palimpsest, with the old writing still discernible behind' (to use the expressive metaphor of Windeyer J in Vallance versus The
Queen <case>; [(1961) 108 CLR 56] at 76), it should be remembered that the first duty of the interpreter of its provisions is to look at the current text rather than at the old writing which has been erased; if the former is clear, the latter is of no relevance.

These ideas apply a fortiori to the present situation.
The appellant's argument that Young J's conclusion brings uncertainty and problems of proof is unpersuasive. The law is used to identifying "insolvency" in a number of contexts. The present tense "is bankrupt, or insolvent" indicates that s126 is not a situation where it was critical to know when "insolvency" started (cf London and Counties at 502).
I have not found it necessary to consider whether Behn requires this result. I agree with the appellant that the point now in issue does not appear to have been debated at any stage in the Behn litigation.
Nevertheless, there are statements consistent with the respondent's submissions that cannot lightly be overlooked: see eg Gibbs CJ at 567-8.
At the end of the day there are indications pointing either way. That is not unusual in matters of statutory construction. It may well be that the subjective intention of those who drafted s126 was to use "insolvent" in its formal sense. But that is an ultimately speculative and irrelevant consideration (see Dobbie versus Davidson [(1991) 23 NSWLR 625] at -5). In Yuill, Brennan J observed (at 321) that it is not strictly accurate to describe statutory construction as the search for the intention of
Parliament. His Honour preferred Lord Reid's description in Balck Clawson
Ltd versus Papierwerke AG <case>; [[1975] AC ] at 613: "We often say that we are looking for the intention of Parliament, but that is not quite accurate. We are seeking the meaning of the words which
Parliament used. We are seeking not what Parliament meant but the true meaning of what they said." 
I agree.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

REGISTRAR GENERAL v. HARRIS & ANOR.

JUDGMENT 
POWELL JA: The circumstances in which the Court has been called upon to determine the only question which has been argued on the hearing of this appeal are, if I may say so, decidedly odd. Despite the fact that the hearing at first instance - the tender of evidence, submissions of counsel and the delivery of an ex tempore judgment occupying some 24 pages - concluded within the day, none of the evidentiary material - which seems to have been rather sparse - which was tendered on the hearing was made available to this Court on the hearing of the appeal. The result is that it is quite impossible for the Court to be satisfied that any of the findings of fact made by Young J - some at least of which appear to me to be rather suspect - can be justified. 
However, as the Appellant has sought to maintain only one ground of appeal, namely that: "His Honour erred in law in not holding that the word `insolvent' for the purposes of [s.126(5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) meant adjudged insolvent." and as no Notice of Contention was filed on behalf of the Respondents, it appears that the Court must proceed upon the basis - unsatisfactory though it seems to be - that the Appellant accepts that, at the relevant date - a matter to which I will shortly turn - the deceased's brother, although not adjudged insolvent, was nonetheless unable to pay his debts as they became due from his own money and that the Respondents accept that, if the meaning to be attributed to the word "insolvent" in [s.126(5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)") is "adjudged insolvent", the appeal must be upheld, the Orders made by Young J set aside and the Cross-Claim dismissed.

I say that proceeding upon this basis seems unsatisfactory primarily because
Young J's conclusion upon the factual issue which has given rise to this appeal was as follows (AB 83-84): "
 .........

Accordingly, in my view, the word `insolvent' in [s.126(5(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) means unable to pay his, her or its debts as they fall due.

Therefore, I need to look at the facts. Mrs. Donohoe says that the evidence would not satisfy me that the fraudster was insolvent as at 24 October 1991.
Under [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s140.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), I have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fraudster was insolvent on that day. The facts are that the fraudster had a business in Cairns. It closed down in February 1990 because he or his company could not pay the rent.
He then ceased living in Cairns and lived with his daughter at her expense. By he was receiving a pension and told his trustee in bankruptcy in 1993, which the trustee in bankruptcy seems to accept, that he was ill. The only inference is that he ceased working after the restaurant in Cairns failed in , was not able to earn income, had assets as disclosed in the statement of affairs of some $420 and that the estate was administered in bankruptcy without paying a dividend anywhere near a hundred cents in the dollar.

The only contrary material is that Westpac Bank granted the fraudster a business loan together with his partners in 1992. However, this is equivocal and the point has not been strengthened at all by any corroborative evidence of the loan. It could well have been a loan that consolidated previous loans or there may have been a guarantee by the partners. The mere fact that it was made does not seem to me to alter the balance of the evidence, and I find as a fact that, from 1990 through to August 1993, the fraudster was insolvent." 
If I may say so, the basis for the conclusion which his Honour recorded in the last sentence of this extract seems to me to have been a very insubstantial one.

It is clear enough that, in order that the deceased - and after his death, the
Respondents, as executors of his will - might, in the circumstances, recover damages against the Assurance Fund, it was necessary for him - and them - to establish that, at the relevant date: the deceased had been deprived of an estate or interest in the subject land in consequence of fraud [(s.
(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html); the deceased's brother was the person "upon whose application the erroneous registration was made" [(s.126(2)(b))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html); the deceased's brother was insolvent.

Although, in the end, Young J - in my view correctly - adopted, as the relevant date, the date of the filing of the Cross-Claim, his Honour appears to have doubted (AB 73-74) the correctness of his so doing, despite the decision of the High Court in Saade v. Registrar-General ((1993) <case>; [179 CLR 58).] The bases upon which Young J founded his doubts appear to have been, first, that the question was not considered by me at first instance (Saade v. Saade 1 December 1989 (unreported)), or by the Court of Appeal (Registrar General v. Saade 18 June 1992 (unreported)); and, second, that "it is not really clear how the High Court came to deal with it. It may be that the passage is obiter dicta ...".

Contrary to what appears to have been Young J's understanding, it was necessary for me, in Saade v. Saade (supra), to consider, and I did consider, what was the relevant date at which it must be demonstrated that Mr.
Saade could not be found within the jurisdiction. This was due to the fact that, although, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, Mr. Saade was in Lebanon, he had returned to the jurisdiction prior to the hearing, and, on one day during the hearing, attended court to answer a subpoena ad testificandum which had been served upon him after the hearing had commenced.
In the event, I concluded that the relevant date was the date of the commencement of the proceedings. In order that I might dispel any lingering doubts on the matter, I record that, in the course of my Judgment, I said (inter alia): "I have recorded the relevant provisions of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) as they stood in 1976 and 1977, first, since, to the extent to which Mrs. Saade seeks relief against Mr. Khoury, she must establish that, at the time of the commencement of the first of these proceedings in June 1977, she then had a crystallized cause of action against him (see, for example In re Keystone
Knitting Mills' Trade Mark [(1929) 1 Ch. 72], 103 per Lord
Hanworth M.R.; Wigan v. Edwards [(1973) 47 A.L.J.R. 586], 592 per
Gibbs J. (as he then was), 596 per Mason J (as he then was)); second, since, although the Registrar-General did not become a party to the first of these proceedings until the filing of the Amended Statement of claim on 9th March , the Plaintiff cannot succeed against the Registrar-General unless she had a crystallized cause of action against him at the time of the commencement of the first of these proceedings (see, for example, Sneade v. Wotherton
Barytes and Lead Mining Co. [(1904) 1 K.B. 295], 197 per
Collins M.R.; Eshelby v. Federated European Bank Limited [(1932) 1 K.B.
];
Baldry v. Jackson [(1976) 2 N.S.W.L.R. 415)]; ..." and, later: "The question which then arises is, what is the effect of the views which I have recorded above upon Mrs. Saade's claim against the Registrar-General.

It seems to me that the fact that Mrs. Saade had, and has, a cause of action against Mr. Saade is not enough to deprive Mrs. Saade of any cause of action which she might have had against the Registrar-General. I say this since, at the time of the commencement of the first of these proceedings - at which time, as I have earlier noted, Mrs. Saade needed to have a crystallized cause of action against the Registrar-General - Mr. Saade was - as he continued, until late 1986, to be - in Lebanon (Real Property Act 1900 s.126(5)(b); see also Heron v. Broadbent (supra); Registrar-General v. Behn <case>; [(1981) 148 C.L.R. 562).] The fact that Mr. Saade subsequently returned to
Australia does not, so it seems to me, operate so as to deprive Mrs. Saade of any cause of action against the Registrar-General which she might theretofore have had ..." 
The appeal to the Court of Appeal was upheld upon the basis that I had erred in holding that Mrs. Saade could not recover damages from Mr. Khoury, who had at all relevant times been within the jurisdiction, in consequence of which conclusion it was not open to Mrs. Saade to rely upon the provisions of s.126(5) of the Act.

The High Court, however, appears to have proceeded upon the basis that, as I had dismissed the proceedings against Mr. Khoury, he could not be regarded as "the person ... who acquired title to the land ... through the fraud ..." (s.126(2(c)), or that, even if he could be so regarded, the fact that he had been served and had taken part in the proceedings meant that the provisions of s.126(5)(b) could not form the basis of a claim against the Registrar-General.

The High Court then turned to consider whether the provisions of s.126(2)(b) provided a remedy to Mrs. Saade, and, having done so, for the reasons to which
I will shortly turn, concluded, first, that there had been an "erroneous registration" (s.126(2)(b)), and, second, that Mr. Saade was to be regarded as "the person upon whose application the certificate of title was issued" (s.126(2)(b),(3)) to Mr. Khoury. This being so, it became necessary for the
Court, if Mrs. Saade were to succeed on the appeal, to determine whether, at the relevant date - whatever that date be held to be - Mr. Saade "(could) not be found within the jurisdiction".

The Court dealt with that issue in the following way ((supra) at 68-69): "Could Mr. Saade be found within the jurisdiction? 
Because of this conclusion, the availability to Mrs. Saade of an action against the Registrar-General under sub-s.(5) depends upon whether her husband could be found within the jurisdiction at the relevant time. A decision on that aspect requires a determination of what is the relevant time (or times) and an application of that determination to the facts.

Mr. Saade could not be found within the jurisdiction at the time proceedings were commenced. Counsel for Mrs. Saade submitted that this is the relevant time for determining the operation of s.126(5)(b). We agree. The right to bring action against the Registrar-General only arises `when the person liable for damages .. cannot be found within the jurisdiction'. The right of action against the Registrar-General crystallises at that time. And, at that time,
Mr. Saade could not be found within the jurisdiction. If this approach were not right, there would need to be an inquiry as to the whereabouts of the person concerned at each stage of the proceedings up to and including the time of the hearing. This could cast an impossible burden on a claimant and is inconsistent with the purposes of an Assurance Fund designed to provide a practical scheme of compensation for persons who have suffered loss through the operation of the Torrens system of indefeasibility of title.

It must also be said that the existence of two persons against whom action may be brought under s.126(2) is no answer to a claim made, in this case, against Mr. Saade and therefore the Registrar-General. The reasons sufficiently appears from the judgment of Griffith CJ in Cox v. Bourne ((1897) 8 QLJ 66). As the Chief Justice pointed out (ibid at p.68), the contrary construction would `[set] a trap for an innocent victim of fraud, which I cannot think that the Legislature intended'. And as his Honour observed later in his judgment (ibid at p.69): "I think that when once the conditions set forth in [s.126] exist, with respect to the actual and immediate perpetrator of the fraud, the right of action is complete against the [Registrar-General], whose liability, it seems to me, is put in the place of that of the person defrauded. And even if the plaintiff knew of the existence of other parties to the fraud, it is ordinarily no answer to an action against one person for a wrong to show that some other person is also liable. I do not see any sufficient reason for holding the present case to be an exception.' 
If Mrs. Saade had recovered any damages from Mr. Khoury, her entitlement to claim compensation from the Registrar-General would, of course, be eliminated or to that extent reduced. Otherwise, her right of action against Mr. Saade (and, in the circumstances of this case, the Registrar-General) is unaffected by any rights which she may had had, or may have unsuccessfully sought to enforce, against Mr. Khoury.

It follows then that Mrs. Saade is entitled to be compensated from the
Assurance Fund on the basis that Mr. Saade is a person upon whose application the `erroneous registration' of Mr. Khoury was made and that Mr. Saade is a person who `cannot be found within the jurisdiction.'" 
In the circumstances, it is, in my view, clearly established - and not merely obiter - that a person seeking to invoke the provisions of s.126(5) of the Act must establish that the relevant fact upon which he seeks to rely exists at the time of the commencement of the relevant proceedings or cross-claim, and, that it is irrelevant that that fact may no longer exist at the time of the hearing.

Although it was not, and is not now, disputed that the deceased had been deprived of an estate or interest in the subject land, or that his brother was the person "upon whose application" the erroneous registration was made, it should be noted that, in concluding that the registration of the transfer to
Mr. Khoury constituted an "erroneous registration", the High Court distinguished its earlier decision in Registrar of Titles (W.A.) v.
Franzon ((1975) <case>; [132 CLR 611)], which decision had, meantime, been applied by Needham J in Armour v.
Penrith Projects Pty. Limited ([1979] [1 NSWLR 98).] 
It should also be noted that, in the course of its reasoning to that conclusion, the High Court said ((supra) at 66-67): "The second element of s.126(2)(b) is that action be brought against the person `upon whose application' the erroneous registration was made. In fact the memorandum of transfer was presented for registration by Mr. Khoury.
However, counsel for Mrs. Saade contended that there was an erroneous registration and that, by reason of the presence of sub-s. (3) of s.126, Mr.
Saade must be regarded as the person upon whose application the erroneous registration was made. Sub-section (3), in one form or another, is not unique in Australian Torrens legislation, but it did not appear in the Western
Australian statute considered in Franzon. As will be seen, its presence in s.126 clearly distinguishes the New South Wales legislation, for the purposes of the present case, from that under consideration in Franzon.

The purpose of sub-s.(3) is to identify the person upon whose application the certificate of title was issued to the transferee. It operates in every case in which `the fraud, error, omission or misdescription occurs upon a transfer for value'. The litany `fraud, error, omission or misdescription' appears of course in s.126(2)(c) and it may be thought that sub-s.(3) is correspondingly limited in its operation. But that cannot be so since par.(c) is concerned with action against the person `who acquired title to the land'. It is of no relevance to par. (c) to identify the person upon whose application the transfer was registered. That identification is relevant only in the context of par.(b) of sub-s. (2). This in turn lends support to the argument that `erroneous registration' in par. (b) has a meaning beyond that attributed to the expression in Franzon.

The predecessor of s.126 was found in s.117 of the original Torrens legislation in New South Wales, the Real Property Act 1862 (N.S.W.).
Section 117 contained a proviso which was very similar to s.126(3) but, it must be said, clearer in its intended operation. The proviso read: `Provided always that in every case in which the fraud error or misdescription shall occur upon a transfer made for value the person making the transfer and receiving the value shall be regarded as the person upon whose application the certificate of title was issued to the transferee.' 
Millard, writing in 1894 (An Appendix to Williams' `Law of Real Property' for the Use of Students in New South Wales, pp. 283-284.), treated the proviso as a reference to what is now s.126(2)(b), commenting that an action could be brought: `against the person upon whose application the land was brought under the
Act, or through whom such erroneous registration was made (in the case of a transfer for value, the person transferring and receiving the value), or who acquired title through such fraud, error, or misdescription.' (Emphasis added) 
In s.126(3) the words `person making the transfer' are replaced with `transferor'. That term is not defined in the Act but would ordinarily be taken to have a corresponding meaning (Interpretation Act 1987 s.7) to `transfer' which is defined [(s.3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s3.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)) as the `passing of any estate or interest in land'. Counsel for Mrs. Saade argued that as the Torrens system is a system of title by registration and not registration of title, a person who forges a form of transfer which is subsequently registered does effect a transfer of that interest notwithstanding that the person was not the registered proprietor of the interest transferred. This argument has force, but in any event the opening words of s.3 of the Act provide that the definitions only apply in the absence of inconsistent context and subject matter. The context and subject matter of s.126(3) are directed at the provision of remedies for persons affected by fraud and mistake within the Torrens system. Although the words used in the Act add greater clarity to the provision, it is apparent that, in terms of s.126(3), Mr. Saade is the `transferor receiving the value'. The form of and commentary on s.117 of the 1862 Act lead to the conclusion that s.126(3) is a section which identifies the person to whom s.126(2)(b) relates.

Mr. Saade is therefore to be regarded as the person upon whose application
Mr. Khoury was issued with the certificate of title. In the absence of sub-s.(3) it would ordinarily be the case that it is the person who acquired title who is the person upon whose application registration was made. Clearly, the sub-section fastens on to the transferor as the person to answer that description, in the circumstances to which it refers. And it does so in order to widen the category of persons against whom the statutory cause of action will lie." 
As will be apparent, in reaching its conclusion in this respect, the High
Court relied upon the terms of s.117 of the Real Property Act 1862 ("the 1862
Act") which, as Mason P has noted in his Judgment, which I have had the opportunity to read in draft, was "re-enacted" by s.126 of the Act. Given that the Act, as Mason P has noted, was a consolidating Act, this is hardly surprising, for the presumption - albeit that it is rebuttable - is that a consolidating Act is not intended to change the law.

Approaching the provisions of s.126 of the Act in that way, I would read the word `insolvent' in s.126(5) of the Act as meaning ` adjudged insolvent' rather than as meaning no more than `unable to pay his debts as they fall due from his own moneys'.

In expressing that view I have not overlooked the fact that, in Behn v.
Registrar-General ([1979] [2 NSWLR 496 (Holland] J.); affd Registrar-
General v. Behn [1980] 1 NSWLR 589; affd Registrar-General v.
Behn <case>; [(1981) 148 CLR 562)], the Registrar-General was held liable in an action for damages pursuant to s.126(5) of the Act although the relevant `"fraud" was held to be that of a company - which, although insolvent, not being a natural person, could not be adjudged insolvent, and the property of which could not be made the subject of a sequestration order - and which, although subsequently removed from the register of companies, was still on the register at the time of the commencement of the proceedings. It should, however, be noted that the primary defence relied upon by the Registrar-General was, not that the company was not insolvent in the relevant sense, but ([1979] 2 NSWLR at 514) "that the plaintiff had lost her right to claim damages for fraud under s.126 because, after discovering the fraud, she affirmed the contract for sale by electing to sue (the company) in the Common Law Division of (the)
Court and obtain judgment for the balance of the purchase money owing under the contract, and by thereafter causing a writ for levy of property to be issued in respect of the judgment and a notification thereof to be endorsed on the certificate of title", a defence which, as will be apparent, failed. In the circumstances, I am unable to share the view expressed by Young J (AB 82) that "the point is really decided by ... Registrar-General v. Behn".

Far from that being so, it seems to me that, quite apart from the fact that it is a consolidating Act, the provisions of ss. 131, 132 of the Act - which, in substance, reproduce the terms of s.123 of the 1862 Act - provide support for the view which I have expressed. That this is so is demonstrated by the fact that s.123 of the 1862 Act provided: "123. Whenever any amount has been paid out of the assurance fund on account of any person who may be dead such amount may be recovered from the estate of such person by action against his personal representatives in the name of the
Registrar General and whenever such amount has been paid on account of a person who shall have been adjudged insolvent the amount so paid shall be considered to be a debt due from the estate of such insolvent and a certificate signed by the Colonial Treasurer certifying the fact of such payment out of the assurance fund and delivered to the official assignee shall be sufficient proof of such debt and whenever any amount has been paid out of the assurance fund on account of any person who may have absconded or who cannot be found within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and may have left any real or personal estate within the said Colony it shall be lawful for the said Court or a Judge thereof upon the application of the Registrar
General and upon the production of a certificate signed by the said Treasurer certifying that the amount has been paid in satisfaction of a judgment against the Registrar General as nominal defendant to allow the Registrar General to sign judgment against such person forthwith for the amount so paid out of the assurance fund together with the costs of the application and such judgment shall be final and signed in like manner as a final judgment by confession or default in an adverse suit and execution may issue immediately and if such person shall not have left real or personal estate within the said Colony sufficient to satisfy the amount for which execution may have been issued as aforesaid it shall be lawful for the Registrar General to recover such amount or the unrecovered balance thereof by action against such person at any time thereafter when he may be found within the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court." (my emphasis) while ss. 131, 132 of the Act provide: "131 Moneys paid in respect of a claim on Torrens Assurance Fund may be recovered against estate of deceased or bankrupt person 
Whenever any amount has been paid in respect of a claim on the Torrens
Assurance Fund on account of any person who is dead, such amount may be recovered from the estate of such person by action against the person's personal representatives in the name of the Registrar-General.

Whenever such amount has been paid on account of a person who is insolvent or bankrupt, the amount so paid shall be considered to be a debt due from the estate of such insolvent or bankrupt, and a certificate signed by the Registrar-General certifying the fact of such payment in respect of a claim on the Torrens Assurance Fund and delivered to The Official Receiver in
Bankruptcy shall be sufficient proof of such debt.
 Where person liable is out of New South Wales 
Whenever any amount has been paid in respect of a claim on the Torrens
Assurance Fund on account of any person who has absconded or who cannot be found within the jurisdiction and has left any real or personal estate within
New South Wales, the said Court, upon the application of the Registrar-General and upon the production of a certificate signed by the Registrar-General certifying that the amount has been paid in satisfaction of a judgment against the Registrar-General as nominal defendant, may allow the Registrar-General to sign judgment against such person forthwith for the amount so paid in respect of the claim on the Torrens Assurance Fund together with the costs of the application.

Such judgment shall be final and entered or signed in like manner as a final judgment by confession or default in adverse proceedings, an execution may issue immediately.

If such person has not left real or personal estate within New South
Wales sufficient to satisfy the amount for which execution has been issued as aforesaid, the Registrar-General may recover such amount or the unrecovered balance thereof by action against such person at any time thereafter when the person is within the jurisdiction." 
Quite apart from such matters, however, it seems to me that the need for a person who seeks to rely upon the provisions of s.126(5) of the Act to establish that, at the time of his commencing his proceedings, or filing his cross-action, the person primarily liable for damages under s.126 of the Act, was, relevantly "insolvent, or bankrupt", dictates that the fact of insolvency or bankruptcy is to be established in a simple way - by proof of an adjudication, or the making of a sequestration order, or the filing of a debtor's petition - rather than by an exhaustive examination of the financial affairs of the person primarily liable for the damages, of which affairs one would think that the plaintiff, or cross-claimant, will ordinarily have little, or no, knowledge (see, to a not dissimilar effect, the first passage from the Judgment of the High Court in Saade v. Registrar-General which I have set out above ((supra) at pp. 6-7).

The Orders which I propose are: ., ORDER that the appeal be upheld
ORDER that the Orders made by Young J be set aside.
IN LIEU THEREOF ORDER that the Cross-Claim be dismissed.
ORDER that the Respondents pay the Appellant's costs of the Appeal and of the Cross-Claim but, if qualified, have a certificate under the [Suitors
Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
