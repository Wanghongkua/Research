IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
HOEBEN J  
Wednesday, 5 October, 2005  /2005 - Clayton Robert CROKER versus COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA & Anor  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: By summons filed 20 July 2005 the plaintiff seeks, inter alia, an order setting aside the decision of the Consumer Traders and Tenancy
Tribunal (the Tribunal) made on 9 July 2005. On that date the Tribunal dismissed the plaintiff's application because "the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the application because the application is not a claim to which the [Consumer Claims
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1998172/) applies".  It is not clear why the Tribunal has been joined to the proceedings as a second defendant. In any event the Tribunal filed a submitting appearance and did not otherwise participate in the matter. The plaintiff was self- represented. Ms Pepper of counsel appeared on behalf of the first defendant.  The summons challenging the order of the Tribunal appears to have been brought pursuant to [s67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s67.html) of the [Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/) . Such appeals are limited to matters of law. [Subsection (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctatta2001361/s67.html) provides:  "A reference in this section to a matter of law includes a reference to a matter relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal."  
Since the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a matter in issue, this appeal has been properly brought.  
Factual background  On 12 November 2003 the plaintiff purchased for $50 a set of commemorative cufflinks from the High Court of Australia. Those cufflinks tarnished within a short time. Although a replacement set of cufflinks was provided in August , those replacement cufflinks also tarnished.  On 16 March 2005 the plaintiff filed an application in the Tribunal against the Commonwealth of Australia under [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1998172/s6.html) of the [Consumer Claims Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1998172/) seeking damages of $1,032. The application also relied upon s40W of the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) .  
Issue for decision  The question raised in the summons is whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider claims brought against the Commonwealth of Australia.  
Decision  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s21.html) of the CTTTA provides:  "The Tribunal has such jurisdiction to decide matters and such powers to make orders and otherwise exercise any function in connection with any such decisions, as is conferred on it by this or any other Act."  Section 7 CCA provides:  "7(1) The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine any consumer claim brought before it under this Part, whether or not the matter to which the claim relates arose before or after the commencement of the Part, except as otherwise provided by this section."  [Subsection (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s3.html)
CCA defines a "consumer claim" in such a way as to cover the claim made by the plaintiff.  Section 40W FTA creates a cause of action for damages in respect of goods of unmerchantable quality. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s68.html) FTA relevantly provides:  "(3) If the matter of such loss or damage arises in connection with a matter the subject of proceedings in the Tribunal, the Tribunal may proceed to decide it, and in so doing may award such sum and make such ancillary orders, as it thinks fit."  Because of this statutory framework the Tribunal's jurisdiction is circumscribed by statute. Its jurisdiction in respect of consumer claims derives from both the CCA and FTA. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s6.html) CCA confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal to determine consumer claims for a specified sum of money arising from the supply of good or services to the consumer and [s68(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s68.html)
FTA confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal in respect of actions for damages arising out of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/index.html#p5)
FTA. [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/index.html#p5) includes s40W.  Accordingly the Tribunal had jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim, namely the defective cufflinks. The real question is whether such a consumer claim could be brought against the Commonwealth of
Australia.  The most useful case on this question is Re: The Residential Tenancies
Tribunal of NSW versus Henderson & Anor, Ex Parte the Defence Housing Authority CLR 410. In that case the High Court found that the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal (a predecessor of the current Tribunal) could make orders binding the Defence Housing Authority, (which was a Commonwealth agency), under the [Residential Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) .
It is of significance that [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s4.html) of that Act provided:  "This Act binds the Crown, not only in right of New South Wales, but also, so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, the Crown in all its other capacity."  
The High Court held that this evinced a clear intention to bind the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.  The following statements of principle are useful:  "Also it must be kept in mind that there is still a presumption that the Crown is not bound by the general words of a statute. It is a presumption that extends beyond the Crown in right of the enacting legislature to the Crown in right of the other polities forming the federation." (Dawson, Toohey and
Gaudron JJ, p444).  "If in regulating activities engaged in by the Crown and its subjects alike a
State statute extends as a matter of construction to the Crown in right of the
Commonwealth, then that Crown is bound by the statute in the same way as the subject is bound, subject always to any inconsistency with a valid
Commonwealth law." (447)  What emerges clearly from the Henderson case is that the Commonwealth may be bound by State legislation and orders of State Tribunals enforcing that legislation, but the initial question is one of construction as to whether or not the State legislation is intended to bind the Commonwealth.  Section 74 CCCTA provides:  "This Act binds the Crown."  
There is nothing in that Act or its regulations which further defines "the
Crown".  [Subsection (b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s13.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) provides that a reference to "the Crown" in NSW legislation "is a reference to the Crown in right of New South Wales".  There is no provision in the CCA or its regulations which evinces an intention to bind the Crown in any of its manifestations.  [Subsection (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s3.html) FTA provides:  "This Act binds the Crown in right of the State insofar as the Crown in right of the State carries on a business, whether directly or by an Authority of the
State."  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s21.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) provides that a reference to "the State" is a reference to the State of New
South Wales.  The CTTTA expresses no intention to bind the Commonwealth. By reference to [s13(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s13.html) of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), the reference to the Crown is a reference to the State Crown. Similarly, subs 3(1)
FTA expressly limits its application to "the Crown in right of the State".
Those provisions are to be contrasted with the section under consideration in
Henderson's case (at [11] hereof).  I conclude that as a matter of construction neither the CTTTA, the CCA nor the FTA bind the Commonwealth. Accordingly, although the Tribunal had jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter of the proceedings, ie the cufflinks, it did not have jurisdiction to entertain proceedings where orders were sought against the Commonwealth of Australia.  It follows that the Tribunal was correct in dismissing the application for want of jurisdiction and that the plaintiff's summons should also be dismissed.  
Orders  
The plaintiff's summons is dismissed.  
The plaintiff is to pay the first defendant's costs of the proceedings.
