JUDGE1
KIRBY P This appeal from orders of Carruthers J in the Administrative Law
Division of the Supreme Court presents a simple problem. It is whether the
Commercial Tribunal (the Tribunal), established under the [Commercial Tribunal
Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cta1984192/) (the Tribunal Act), has the power, in law, to authorise the publication of an advertisement notifying members of the public of an inquiry before the Tribunal and inviting persons wishing to participate, or to provide relevant information, to contact the Tribunal's
Registrar.
Household Financial Services Ltd, formerly known as HFC Financial Services
Limited (the appellant), disputes the power of the Tribunal to direct its
Registrar to cause such an advertisement to be published. It says that, upon a true construction of the relevant legislation and the application of the applicable principles of the common law, the Tribunal has no such power. The
Commissioner for Consumer Affairs (the Commissioner) (the second respondent) upholds the power of the Tribunal and the direction which it has given to the
Registrar. The Tribunal itself appeared, without objection, both before
Carruthers J and in this Court, to assist the Court in an understanding of the applicable legislation. In its submissions, it did not seek to go beyond the proper limitations upon a body in its position as expressed in The Queen versus The
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman <case>; [(1980) 144 CLR 13], 17, f. The written submissions received on behalf of the Tribunal involved no relevant expenditure of Court time. In my view, they were of help to the
Court. For the Tribunal it was submitted that the way in which Carruthers J had determined the questions before him was consistent with the Tribunal's understanding of its powers. No submission was made for the Tribunal that his
Honour's conclusion was in error in any respect.
The proceedings before Carruthers J actually involved a reference to the
Supreme Court, pursuant to <case> of the Tribunal Act, of a question arising in proceedings before the Tribunal in respect of a matter of law.
The Deputy
Chairman of the Tribunal referred a number of questions to the Supreme Court.
It is those questions which Carruthers J determined in favour of the power of the Tribunal challenged by the appellant. His Honour concluded that, although no express power to require a public advertisement was conferred upon the
Tribunal by the Tribunal Act or the Rules made under that Act, such power was necessarily within the ambit of the powers expressly conferred to take procedural steps. Alternatively, it was necessarily to be implied from the general nature of the fuctions and purposes of the Tribunal and the other powers expressly conferred on it by the Act and the Rules. Carruthers J therefore directed that all questions submitted to the Court should be answered in the affirmative.
He remitted the matter to the Tribunal. He ordered the appellant to pay the costs both of the Commissioner and of the
Tribunal. Against such orders, the appellant has now appealed to this Court.
A preliminary question arose as to whether leave to appeal was necessary.
No party to the appeal contended that leave was required. However, it is the duty of a court to be assured of its own jurisdiction.
On this point, it is enough to say that the authority of this Court establishes clearly that an appeal, such as the present, lies as of right. See Custom Credit Corporation
Ltd versus Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales and Ors (1993) 32 NSWLR 489 (CA) , 499.
Although the decision of Carruthers J was interlocutory to proceedings in the Tribunal, the requirement for leave in appeals to this
Court from "an interlocutory judgment or order" is limited by [s 101(1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s101.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to a case of such orders "in proceedings in the
Court". That means in the Supreme Court. Thus the appeal from the orders of
Carruthers
J lies as of right.
Although dark hints were raised by counsel for the appellant, at various stages of his oral argument, that objection might be taken to particular terms of the proposed advertisement, this was not the way in which the issue was argued before the Tribunal or the case fought before Carruthers J. There, the contention was advanced that the Tribunal simply lacked the power or jurisdiction to direct such an advertisement, addressed to members of the public, in whatever terms it was proposed. It was upon that footing that the hearing of the appeal was given expedition. So presented, it tendered an issue of general importance not only to the parties but for the performance by the
Tribunal of its lawful functions. In my view, the appellant should be confined to the general question. Any objections to the particular terms of the advertisement can doubtless still be addressed to the Tribunal itself.
Pending the outcome of these proceedings, the hearing in the Tribunal has been delayed. The advertisement has not been lodged or published.
 
The circumstances of the advertisement
It was common ground that Carruthers J has accurately stated the factual background to the contest.
The appellant carries on the business of providing credit. It is the holder of a Credit Provider's
Licence issued under the [Credit (Administration)
Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) (the Administration Act). In 1990, two events occurred affecting the appellant which may have triggered these proceedings. The first was an adverse decision, delivered in Victoria, concerning the appellant. See decision of the
Victorian Credit Licensing Authority in The Matter of an Application for a
Credit Provider's Licence by HFC Financial Services Limited dated 12 September and the grounds stated therein, contained in Part 14 of the decision. The second was an application filed by the appellant in the Tribunal in New South
Wales pursuant to [ss 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s85.html) and [86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s86.html) of the [Credit Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/) (the [Credit Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/)). Put generally, those provisions permit the Tribunal to provide relief against forfeiture which would otherwise follow as a consequence of an established breach by a licensed credit provider of obligations imposed upon it, as such, by the [Credit Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/). Something of the way in which those sections operate is disclosed by the circumstances described in Custom Credit (above), 494.
Whether for one, or both, of these reasons or otherwise, on 31 January , the Registrar of the Tribunal caused a notice to be given to the appellant informing it that the Tribunal: " ...has determined to hold an inquiry into whether or not to take action against (the appellant) under [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s23.html) of the (Administration Act) in relation to the Credit Provider's
Licence No 353 issued to HFC Financial Services Ltd.

The notice recited that it: "... appears to the Chairman in accordance with the Act that there are grounds for believing that,: .s.23(4)(b) The licensee may have failed to comply with the
Act and the [Credit Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/).
[s.23(4)69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s23.html) The business to which the licence relates is being carried on in a dishonest or unfair manner.
[s.23(4)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s23.html) If the licensee were not the holder of a licence, the Tribunal would be required by [section 12(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s12.html) to refuse their application for a licence.
 .s.23(4)6) The licensee is not a fit and proper person to hold a licence." 
This recital is followed in the notice by the specification of "grounds" for the purposes of <case> of the Administration Act.
On 12 February 1991 the Commissioner, pursuant to <case>(10) of the Tribunal
Act, provided a report requested by the Chairman of the Tribunal for its assistance in relation to the inquiry proceedings.
On 25 February 1991 a directions hearing was held in the inquiry proceedings. It addressed the way in which the Tribunal would secure, for the purposes of its inquiry, material upon which the Commissioner's report had been based. Various other procedural steps were taken throughout February and
April 1991. Meanwhile, the appellant sought to elaborate its applications for relief under [ss 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s85.html) and [86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s86.html) of the [Credit Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/). It is unnecessary to describe the steps taken. They brought the proceedings in March 1992 to the Administrative
Law Division of the Supreme Court where Newman J made orders concerning an interim determination of the Tribunal. Considerable ingenuity appears to have been applied to raise a number of legal points defensive of the position of the appellant. This was doubtless its right.
It reflected the seriousness with which it was facing the potential peril to its licence caused by the inquiry initiated by the Tribunal.
The interlocutory proceedings continued in 1992 and 1993. Meanwhile, a great mass of material was provided to the Tribunal in support of, and opposition to, the proceedings for relief under [ss 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s85.html) and [86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s86.html) of the [Credit
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/).
On 9 December 1993 a directions hearing took place which set in train the proceedings now before this Court. The Deputy Chairman of the Tribunal (Mr R B
Davidson) was pressed by counsel assisting the Tribunal in the inquiry proceedings to cause an advertisement to be published on two occasions in three newspapers circulating within the State addressed to the general public.
Terms of the proposed advertisement
The advertisement proposed to the Tribunal was in the following terms: "NOTICE OF INQUIRY 
HOUSEHOLD
FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED (formerly known as HFC Financial Services Ltd) 
The Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales is holding an
Inquiry pursuant lo [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Credit (Administration)
Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) to determine whether or not the Tribunal should take action under [section 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of that Act on the grounds that
HOUSEHOLD FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED (formerly known as HFC
Financial Services Ltd) ("the
Company") may - have failed to comply with the [Credit (Administration) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), have failed to comply with the [Credit Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/), have carried on its business dishonestly or unfairly, not be a fit and proper person to hold a credit provider's licence in New South Wales, or have a reputation such that it is not a fit and proper person to hold a credit provider's licence in New South Wales.

Any person wishing to participate in the Inquiry or provide information relevant to the subject-matter of the Inquiry should write to the address set out below giving notice - of his or her intention to participate or provide information, the reason for seeking to participate, if that is intended, the nature of the information to be provided, if any, and an address and telephone number where he or she may be contacted (which may be that of a solicitor acting for the person).

The address for such letters is: 
Such written notice must be received no later than 5-00pm on
Friday, 31 May 1994.

The Inquiry will sit at the following address: (Commercial Tribunal address).
 
The next sitting of the Inquiry will be held on at am. The purpose of that sitting will be to give directions for the future conduct of the Inquiry. Any applications for leave to appear by persons wishing to participate will be considered at that time.

Any general inquiries concerning the matter should be addressed to - (Address of the Registrar)." 
The appellant objected to the advertisement. It submitted that the Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction or power to cause it to be published.
 
Questions of law referred to the Supreme Court
Pursuant to the appellant's objection, and after having heard argument, the Deputy Chairman of the Tribunal referred to the Supreme Court the following five questions of law which were heard and determined by Carruthers
J: "1. Whether the Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales ('the
Tribunal') has jurisdiction or power to publish a Notice of
Inquiry by an advertisement which states that the Tribunal is holding an inquiry to determine whether or not action should be taken under [section 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Credit (Administration)
Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) ('the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/)').
Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction or power to publish a Notice of Inquiry by an advertisement which describes the subject matter and/or specifies the grounds of an inquiry pursuant to [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/).
Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction or power to publish an advertisement giving notice to any person wishing to provide information relevant to the subject matter and/or specifying the grounds of an inquiry pursuant to [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/):- to communicate with the Tribunal or any person assisting the Tribunal; and/or to furnish information to the
Tribunal or any person assisting the Tribunal; and/or to notify an intention to seek to become a party in the inquiry.
Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction or power to publish an advertisement giving notice to any person wishing to participate in an inquiry under [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/): to communicate with the Tribunal or any person assisting the Tribunal; and/or to furnish information to the
Tribunal or any person assisting the Tribunal; and/or to notify an intention to seek to become a party in the inquiry.
Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction or power for the purpose of giving notice to persons: wishing to participate in an inquiry under [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) to communicate with the Tribunal or any person assisting the Tribunal; and/or wishing to provide information relevant to the subject matter of an inquiry pursuant to [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), to communicate with the Tribunal or any person assisting the
Tribunal; and/or wishing to furnish information to the Tribunal or any person assisting the Tribunal; and/or wishing to seek to become a party to the inquiry; to publish an advertisement which describes the subject matter and/or specifies the grounds of an inquiry pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) or which states that the Tribunal is holding an inquiry to determine whether or not action should be taken under [section 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/)."
As I have said, Carruthers J determined each of the foregoing questions in the affirmative. It is that determination, and the order for costs which followed, that occasions this appeal. No separate argument was put in relation to the ordering of the costs of the Tribunal which had been joined as a party and had made submissions before Carruthers J.
 
The primary Judge's reasons .
After setting out the terms of what he took to be the relevant provisions of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) and the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), and after referring to a suggested analogy to the powers conferred by the [Royal Commissions Act 1923](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/),
Carruthers J upheld the challenged power of the Tribunal in the following short passage of his reasons: "The Tribunal is a specialised body set up by the Legislature for the protection of the public and, in particular, those involved in money-lending transactions. There is great public interest involved in the work of the Tribunal. I would have little difficulty in concluding that it was the intention of the Legislature, when investing it with the power to hold an inquiry to determine whether or not to take action under [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) in relation to a credit provider's licence, that the Tribunal would have the power to publish a notice such as that contemplated in the instant proceedings. This is the sort of notice which is published by a Royal Commission prior to embarking upon its inquiry. It is also the sort of notice published by ad hoc inquiries set up by the Legislature.
It would not be difficult to think of other approximate examples. The Tribunal must, in my view, have inherent power to order its own procedures. An appropriate analogy is the power of a Local Court to devise its own procedures: see Bogeta Pty
Limited versus Wales [(1977) 1 NSWLR 139], at 148-149, per Hutley JA.
Reference may also be made in this regard to the judgment at first instance of Enderby J in Custom
Credit versus The Tribunal [(1990) ASC 56-007.] [Section 37](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cta1984192/s37.html) of the [Commercial Tribunal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cta1984192/) provides that if the manner or form of procedure for taking any step in proceedings before the Tribunal is not prescribed by this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) or by the Rules, the Chairman or Deputy Chairman who presides, or is to preside, in the proceedings may direct what manner or form of procedure is to be followed, and any step taken in accordance with the directions so given shall, for the purposes of the proceedings, be regular and sufficient.
This power, together with such other powers as are necessary by implication, support, in my view, the notice which the
Tribunal wishes to publish The subject matter of the proposed inquiry is a wide-ranging one and of great public interest.
So much is clear from the proposed notice of inquiry which I have set out above. The publication of such a notice is, in my view, a convenient and necessary preliminary procedure for the efficient conduct of the proposed inquiry."
In this Court, the appellant challenged Carruthers J's conclusions. It argued that the applicable legislation was clear. It was made clear both by what it included and omitted and by its structure and apparent purpose.
According to the appellant, an inquiry of the kind upon which the Tribunal was embarked was addressed to issues and concerned parties which excluded the enlargement of the inquiry by invitation, in a public advertisement addressed to members of the public inviting them to come forward and participate.
There was no power to permit this. Where Parliament had intended public advertisements to be lodged, it had said so. It was neither reasonably necessary, still less essential, for the fulfilment of the function of the
Tribunal in the performance of its unquiry to have evidence or submissions from members of the public. Accordingly, the proposed advertisement was misconceived. The Tribunal had no jurisdiction or power to direct that it be lodged. Carruthers J had erred in finding to the contrary.
Behind the submissions of the appellant lie issues of principle and of pragmatic self-protection. The principle concerned was the strict adherence to the legislation in proceedings that were described as "disciplinary" and which certainly involved a potential peril to the appellant's licence as a credit provider. That this peril existed was sufficiently shown in the notice of the inquiry set out above.
The pragmatic reasons for opposition were not explained by evidence.
However, they may be readily inferred. It is one thing for an inquiry to be made and mentioned in the law list for hearing before a Tribunal, unlikely to attract the media spotlight. Potentially, it is quite another for an advertisement to be required to be published in three widely circulating newspapers, naming the appellant and mentioning, in the description of the inquiry, matters which might be interpreted as casting doubt on the appellant' s probity.
Such a widely published advertisement could harm the appellant in the financial marketplace. It could even potentially affect the flow of funds necessary for its viability. At the least, it could damage its reputation and make its raising of funds in the money market more difficult. Furthermore, it could expose the appellant to a protracted inquiry which could require it to respond to numerous public complaints. This would potentially involve a lot of time and effort, much distraction from its primary entrepreneurial purpose and run up heavy legal costs unlikely ever to be recovered. Had Parliament intended to expose the appellant to such a procedure, so it was said, it would have expressly said so.
To resolve these arguments, and others addressed by both sides to the requirements, meaning and purpose of the relevant legislation, it is necessary to have regard to its terms. The ultimate duty of a court in the matter of statutory interpretation such as is now before us, is usually expressed in terms such as those stated by Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ in Re Bolton and
Anor; Ex parte Beane <case>; [(1987) 162 CLR 514] at 518: "The function of the Court is to give effect to the will of
Parliament as expressed in the law." 
This formulation involves a metaphor, imputing, to the combined wishes of the two Houses of Parliament, a single "will" which is then "expressed in the law". The verbal expression of the law is itself frequently, as in this case, ambiguous. This simply demonstrates that the search is not for the subjective opinion (if any) of the Members of Parliament. As Scalia J observed in
Pennsylvania versus Union Gas Company [491 US 1] (1989) at 30f: "It is our task, as I see it, not to enter the minds of the
Members of Congress ... who need have nothing in mind in order for their votes lo be both lawful and effective ... but rather to give fair and reasonable meaning to the text of the United
States Code, adopted by various Congresses at various times." 
What then is the fair and reasonable meaning to be given to the texts of the statutes relevant here to the power of the Tribunal to advertise its inquiry to the public as it proposes? 
Powers of the Tribunal: legislation
The proceedings before the Tribunal are an inquiry pursuant to <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). The inquiry was commenced by the Tribunal of its own motion, as envisaged by [s 23(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), The Commissioner has intervened in the inquiry pursuant to <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). The Commissioner is empowered to intervene where he thinks "that it would be in the public interest to do so". Upon such intervention, the Commissioner "becomes a party to the proceedings and has all the rights, including rights of appeal, of such a party". See Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), <case>. That is how the Commissioner came to be the active respondent to this appeal. The Commissioner did not move the
Tribunal to direct advertisement of its inquiry. Nor did he request the publication of the advertisement. However, the step having been taken, the
Commissioner sought to sustain the power of the Tribunal challenged by the appellant.
By <case> of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), the Tribunal has such jurisdiction as is, and such functions as are, conferred on it by or under an [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). By <case> of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), jurisdiction is conferred on the Tribunal for the purposes of <case> of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). Section 18(3) of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) provides: "18(3) Without derogating from any powers conferred on the
Chairman by this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), the Chairman, while acting as Chairman, and any Deputy Chairman, while presiding at a sitting of the
Tribunal, have the same powers as are conferred by the [District
Court Act, 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), and by law, on a Judge of that Court when acting as such a Judge.

By <case>(10) of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), provision is made in relation to directions as to procedures of the Tribunal: "19(10) The Chairman, or Deputy Chairman who presides, or is to preside, at proceedings before the Tribunal - may give directions relating to procedure that, in the opinion of the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman, will enable costs to be reduced and will help to achieve a prompt hearing of the matters in issue between the parties in the proceedings; and may, in relation to those proceedings, request a report from, or other assistance by, the Commissioner.

Procedure before the Tribunal is governed by <case> of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/): "19(9) In any proceedings before it, other than proceedings prescribed for the purposes of this subsection, the Tribunal -
is not bound by the rules of evidence and may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit; and shall act according to equity, good conscious and the substantial merits Of the case without regard to technicalities or legal forms."
It is important to note that proceedings under <case> of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), described in the heading of the section as "Disciplinary action against licensee fee" has been prescribed for the purposes of s (9) of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). See <case>(15) of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). Thus, the general statutory provisions providing relief to the Tribunal against the rules of evidence and empowering it to act in accordance with equity, good conscience, substantial merits and without regard to technicalities or legal, form do not, as such, apply in the case of such "disciplinary proceedings". The policy behind this exemption is readily understood. Disciplinary proceedings are generally treated with a fair degree of strictness having regard to the serious consequences which may flow in the event that discipline is found to be warranted. See eg Quidwai versus Brown [(1984) 1 NSWLR 100 (CA)], 199f, Bannister versus Walton [(1993) 30
NSWLR 699 (CA)],711ff.
For the appellant, the generalities in the statutory powers of the
Tribunal did not authorise the Tribunal to direct publication of an advertisement addressed to the general public. Not only was such an advertisement unnecessary and irrelevant to the functions of the Tribunal in its inquiry. It was inconsistent with the terms and purposes of the grant of power to hold the inquiry.
It was also inconsistent with other provisions in the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) expressly providing for publication of newspaper advertisements in connection with the activities of the inquiry.
So far as the subject inquiry is concerned, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). Omitting inessential provisions, that section provides: "Disciplinary action against licensee (1) The Commissioner may with the consent of the Minister, and any other person may, at any time lodge with the Tribunal, an objection in writing to the holding of a licence by a specified licensee if the objection complies with subsection .

An objection complies with this subsection if: it specifies the licensee and the grounds of the objection to the holding of a licence by the licensee; and the grounds of objection are such that they could reasonably give rise to a belief on the part of the Chairman sufficient to require the Tribunal to hold an inquiry under subsection (4).
 ...

Where it appears to the Chairman, whether or not pursuant to an objection under subsection (1), that there are grounds for believing that: ...
a licensee may have failed to comply with this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), the [Credit Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/), the [Credit (Finance Brokers) Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cba1984200/), or a regulation under any of them, a condition or restriction to which the licence is subject or an order of the Tribunal applicable to the licensee; ...
...
...
the business to which the licence relates is being carried out in a dishonest or unfair manner; ...
...
if a person were not the holder of a licence, the Tribunal would be required by [section 12(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cba1984200/s12.html) or (4) to refuse an application by the person for a licence; or the licensee is, for any other reason, not a fit and proper person to continue to hold a licence, the Chairman may arrange for the Tribunal to hold an inquiry to determine whether or not to take action under subsection (a) in relation to the licence.
An objection to the holding of a licence may be dismissed by the Tribunal if it is of the opinion whether before, during or after an inquiry.
that the objection is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance; or that none of the grounds referred to in subsection has been, or can be, made out.
Where, pursuant to subsection (4), the Chairman has arranged for the Tribunal to hold an inquiry in relation to a licence the
Registrar shall: send to the licensee a notice specifying the grounds for the belief on the part of the Chairman referred to in subsection and a copy of any objection in writing to the holding of the licence lodged with the Tribunal; and give notice in writing of the day appointed for the inquiry to the licensee and to each person by whom any such objection has been lodged with the Tribunal before the day on which the
Registrar gives the notice.
The Tribunal shall give to the licensee an each other person referred to in subsection (6) (b) an opportunity to appear at the inquiry and be heard; ...
An inquiry under this section shall be deemed to be proceedings prescribed for the purposes of [section 19(9)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cta1984192/s19.html) of the [Commercial Tribunal Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cta1984192/)."
The provision elsewhere in the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) for public advertisement was said, on ordinary principles, to show that where Parliament deemed such advertisements to the public to be useful or proper it expressly provided for them. Thus, the appellant called attention to <case> and ss 33 and 34 of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). Relevantly, <case> is in the following terms: "10(4) As soon as practicable after the Commissioner submits to the Tribunal a report on an application (for a licence), the Registrar shall publish in a newspaper circulating generally throughout New
South Wales a notice giving particulars of the application." 
The procedure for newspaper advertisements, limited to one newspaper but expressly required by statute, was stated in connection with an initial application for a licence which may be made under <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/).
The other references to advertisement in that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) appear in Part 4 of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) dealing with inquiries appointed by the Minister relating, under [s 32(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s32.html), to the provision of credit or the consequences of the provision of credit or both. Thus, [s 33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s33.html) provides: "33. The Tribunal shall, before commencing an inquiry under this Part, give notice by advertisement published on such day or days as it thinks fit in the Gazette and in such newspaper or newspapers as it thinks fit of - the holding of the inquiry; the matter that is to be the subject of the inquiry; the time and place at which the inquiry is to be commenced, and such other matters relating to the inquiry as it thinks fit.
 [Section 34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s34.html) then follows: "34(1) The Tribunal may, at an inquiry under this Part, grant leave to any person to appear at the inquiry if it is of the opinion that the person has a substantial interest in the matter the subject of the inquiry.

A person granted leave under subsection (1) to appear at an inquiry may appear at the inquiry in person or by counsel, solicitor or agent and may give evidence, call witnesses and make submissions at the inquiry."
Both by what the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) said in relation to a disciplinary inquiry, by what it did not say, and by contrast to its provisions in relation to other proceedings before the Tribunal, the appellant urged that no power existed in the Tribunal to direct the subject public advertisement. Doing so not only involved a misconception of the nature of, and parties to, the inquiry initiated under the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). It also exceeded the powers given to the Tribunal. Indeed, it usurped and claimed powers which, by inference (and by contrast with ss 10, [33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s33.html) and [34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s34.html) of the same [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/)) had been withheld from the
Tribunal in the case of disciplinary inquiries.
 
Implied and inherent powers of statutory tribunals
The starting point for the resolution of the controversy presented by this appeal is a reminder of the principles which have been developed for expounding the scope and limitations of the powers of tribunals (and courts) of limited jurisdiction, created by Parliament. There are two relevant principles.
They are: 
That a donee of statutory powers, such as a tribunal (or court) of limited jurisdiction created by Parliament, must find the source of a power asserted (but disputed) within the express terms of the grant of power contained in the applicable legislation or in the implications to be derived from the language of the statute in order to give proper effect to its purpose; and 
Where a tribunal (or court) of limited jurisdiction is established and a power is asserted for which there is no express authorising provision in the applicable legislation, the power asserted may be implied if it is appropriate to the achievement of the functions of the tribunal (or court) and to avoid futility of its process.
This principle has been expressed by reference to the
Latin maxim "ubi aliquid conceditur, conceditur etiam id sine quo res ipso esse non potest." See The Queen versus Forbes and Anor; Ex parte Bevan and Ors CLR 1,7. The appellant urged the rule as one limiting the assertions of power with a potential to affect the rights and duties of others to cases where such assertion was truly necessary (or even essential to the carrying on of the functions of a tribunal (or court) and to avoiding the frustration of the achievements. The Commissioner (and the Tribunal) disputed this narrow view. They argued that it was sufficient that the asserted power was appropriate to the proper exercise of the Tribunal's function, recognising that legislation typically expresses the grant of power in abbreviated terms; that the establishment of a tribunal (or court) ordinarily implies that
Parliament intends the body to operate effectively in the discharge of its jurisdiction; and that it is neither possible nor desirable for Parliament to attempt to spell out, in exact terms, all of the fuctions of such a body. To do so would inevitably overlook some of the circumstances bound to arise in the variety of cases coming before any tribunal or court. It would also have the undesirable consequence of forcing Parliament to express its will in language of excessive detail so as to avoid frustration of the effective operation of the statutory body by an overly narrow or pernickety interpretation by the courts of the grant of power intended to be effective.
As with so many rules proffered by the courts for the construction of legislation made by Parliament, the two foregoing principles present the obverse sides of the arguments which alternatively tug the mind of the decisionmaker towards an ample or a narrow construction. I do not believe that simple statements of principle, any more than Latin maxims, provide the resolution to the kind of problem which is now before the Court. On the other hand, it is helpful, in approaching such a problem, to keep in mind what has been said in the past by judges approaching the solution of analogous controversies. Many such remarks have been offered in the case of courts, including courts which, although of limited jurisdiction, are declared by
Parliament to be "superior courts of record". Such was the case in the instance of the Commonwealth Industrial Court in Ex parte Bevan (above). See also Logwon Pty Limited versus Warringah Shire Council [(1993) 33 NSWLR 13 (CA)], a case involving the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court, by statute a superior court of record. In the case of such courts there is frequently discussion of the suggested "inherent" power of superior courts. For reasons which are explained in Logwon (at 17), it is my view that to ascribe "inherent" powers to statutory courts, even superior courts of record, created by the legislature with limited jurisdiction, is to subscribe to historical error. The only courts which enjoy "inherent powers" are, in my view, those which derive them from the Royal Prerogative by reason of their historical participation in that prerogative, eg by a grant under a Royal Charter. Such is the case of the Supreme Court of New South Wales which has undoubted "inherent" powers enjoyed by its judges.
Others have expressed differing views upon this subject. See eg Sheller JA in Logwon, at 30. I must concede that some of the language of the High Court, (eg in Bevan at 7) supports this differing view. I prefer to speak of the "implied" powers of courts and tribunals established by Parliament. This is because a source must be found for the additional powers. It is not inherent, in the sense of historically derived from the Sovereign's Prerogative. It must thus be implied, as derived from the constituting statute, either in its express terms or by necessary or appropriate implication.
The foregoing debate, however interesting, is not particularly helpful in resolving the present appeal. All of the parties were content to argue their respective positions in terms of the suggested implied powers of the Tribunal.
What then, is the proper approach to finding or rejecting the disputed implication?
In the case of courts, a number of dicta in this Court give guidance.
Thus in Bogeta Pty Limited and Anor versus Wales and Ors [(1977) 1 NSWLR 139 (CA)] at , Hutley JA remarked: "As all courts, including the Supreme Court, in this country are the creation of statutes, the fact that the courts of
Petty Sessions are governed by the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) and the
Licensing Courts by the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) and the [Liquor Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la107/) provides no reason for denying to those courts inherent powers ... The general principle, where a court is properly seized with a matter, and there is no procedure laid down which enables it to deal with the particular problem facing it, that it should devise its own procedure is, in my opinion, applicable to all courts of Petty Sessions in this day and age.
Historically, inferior courts have been allowed to devise their own procedures".

These remarks were applied to the Children's Court in Shales v Lieschke [(1985) NSWLR 65 (CA)], the relevant point was not doubted: "... Subject to any legislation to the contrary, this is the view I would take, at least to the extent of any power or function appropriate to the nature of a body as a 'court' and necessary for the performance of its statutory functions as a court. ... insofar as leave to intervene or otherwise participate is to be considered pursuant to the general powers of the Children's Court to control its proceedings as a court that leave must be afforded within the context of the statutory purpose of the neglect proceedings." 
See also Custom Credit Corporation Limited versus The Commercial Tribunal of New
South Wales (1990) ASC #59-128 (SCNSW).
In the particular case of tribunals, similar principles have been applied.
Thus, in a well known passage in John Fairfax and Sons Ltd versus Police
Tribunal of New South Wales and Anor [(1986) 5 NSWLR 465 (CA)] at 476, McHugh JA wrote of the Police Tribunal: "Since the Tribunal is an inferior court of record created by statute, it can have no powers, jurisdictions or authorities other than those authorised by the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/): Irving versus Askew (1870)
LR 5 QB 208; R versus Hackett: Ex parte Cline <case>; [(1992) 8 VLR (L) 129] The Tribunal has none of the powers inherent in the courts of the common law - the common Pleas, the Kings Bench and the
Exchequer Chamber
Nonetheless, as Lord Maurice of Borth-y-gest pointed out in
Connelly versus Director of Public Prosecutions
AC 1234 at there 'can be no doubt that a court which is endowed with a particular jurisdiction has powers which are necessary to enable it to act effectively within such jurisdiction'. His
Lordship said that he would regard such powers as inherent powers: see also R versus Forbes: Ex parte Bevan <case>; [(1972) 127 CLR 1] at 680, 682, ; Taylor versus Taylor <case>; [(1979) 143 CLR 1] at 5-6. The source of this inherent jurisdiction is the implied authority conferred on the judiciary to uphold, protect and fulfil the judicial function by ensuring that justice is administered, both in a particular case and as a continuing process, according to law and in an effective manner: Jacob, The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court, Current Legal Problems (1970) at 27, 28. Hence the failure of the legislature in setting up the Tribunal to confer a specific power to prohibit the publication of evidence does not necessarily invalidate the order which the Tribunal made in the present case."
The same may be said of the Tribunal in this case. The failure of
Parliament expressly to provide the Tribunal with the power to direct an advertisement of the kind proposed does not necessarily invalidate such a direction when given. It will be valid, although not expressly conferred, if it is not forbidden by, or inconsistent with, the express terms of the constituting statute. This Court will uphold the direction if the giving of it is seen to amount to a fair and reasonable construction both of the text of the legislation and of the implications and purposes to be derived from it.
Specifically, the Court will uphold the asserted jurisdiction of the
Tribunal if it appears, in the particular case, that it is appropriate to the fulfilment of the function of the Tribunal to ensure that justice is administered and the law applied in an effective manner.
It is now necessary to descend from the generalities to the specifics.
There, I confess to finding this case a more difficult one than it appeared to be to Carruthers J.
 
Support for the challenge to jurisdiction
The appellant advanced a number of engaging arguments which support the narrower construction of the powers of the Tribunal for which it contended.
Unlike the other members of the Court, I do not consider that the provision of a power to hold an inquiry of the kind envisaged by the legislation necessarily imported the power to give a notice to the public.
Some inquiries will import that power. But this was a special inquiry directed to a particular purpose. This makes it vital to consider the way the appellant put its case. These were its arguments: 
The present was not a case of objection either by the Commissioner or by any other person under <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). It was a case where it had appeared to the Chairman, otherwise than pursuant to an objection, that there were grounds for the beliefs stated in [s 23(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html), (f), (i) and (j) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). The powers of the Tribunal under [s 23(8):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) "... If, after holding an inquiry in relation to a licence, the Tribunal is satisfied that any ground for a belief on apart of the Chairman referred to in subsection (4) has been made out, the Tribunal may do one or more of the following: (There follow seven stated sanctions)." are directed to the imposition of various possible sanctions after the holding of an inquiry. But the precondition to the exercise of those powers is the satisfaction on the part of the Tribunal: "...that any ground for a belief on the part of the Chairman referred to in subsection (4) has been made out..." 
The focus of attention of the inquiry under [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) is therefore not as such, the establishment of the facts stated in the paragraphs of [s 23(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) but of the belief of the Chairman which triggered the inquiry. It would therefore be directed to the "Chairman's ground for belief".
As that preceded any public inquiry, the opinions, submissions and evidence of members of the public would have no relevance upon the "belief on the part of the Chairman";
It is not as if Parliament had overlooked the need to give notice in the case of a disciplinary inquiry. Specific provision was made for a notice (to the licensee and to any objector) by <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). This was reinforced by the terms of [s 23(7).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) But by such express provision
Parliament, so it was said, must be taken to have excluded the widening of the ambit of inquiry to other persons, such as members of the general public. They could have their say. But they would be required first to lodge an objection as contemplated by [s 23(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) They could not be invited to reinforce a ground of belief of the Chairman formulated before their evidence and submissions were heard;
The express requirement of advertisement as stated in ss 10, 33 and 34 of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) lend weight to the argument that, where a public advertisement was contemplated by Parliament under this legislation, it provided for it in terms; 
The narrower inquiry would be more consistent with the very nature of a disciplinary proceedings. Moreover, it was reinforced by the exclusion of the ampler powers of evidence-gathering and procedure by the combined force of s (15) of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) and <case> of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/); 
This construction of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) also obviated the potentially inconvenient and even intolerably burdensome prospect of a long inquiry into the complaints of numerous disaffected members of the public invited to come forward after the inquiry had been commenced but who had not bothered to lodge an objection with the Tribunal as [s 23(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) reserved to any person; and 
The narrower view would also avoid the potential injustice of publication at large of an inquiry and the inconvenience and commercial damage which such a publication would cause. Such damage would be of great potential significance to a credit provider which must not only provide credit but raise funds in the money market to sustain its liquidity and maintain its operations. The better view: the power to advertise exists
It will be apparent that I consider that there is force in the appellant's arguments. For a number of reasons, however, I prefer the view that the Chairman or Deputy Chairman had the power to direct the advertisement proposed and the Registrar the power to lodge it with the newspapers proposed.
These are my reasons:
The modem approach to the construction of legislation is that described by McHugh JA in Kingston and Anor versus Keprose Pty Limited [(1987) 11 NSWLR 404 ] It is described as a "purposive approach". See Kingston,
Achieving the purpose has always been the object of statutory construction.
What is new is a fresh determination on the part of the judiciary, in the words of Lord Diplock in "The Courts as Legislators" cited by McHugh JA at 424 loc cit, to ensure, if possible, that the clear target of
Parliamentary legislation is hit "not merely to record that it has been missed". The Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), the [Credit Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/) and the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) are component parts of cognate legislation designed to give effect to a major enterprise of consumer credit law reform in Australia.
The history preceding the enactment of the legislation, and its purpose of protecting consumers is described in such cases as Turner v Morlend Finance Corporation (Vic) Pty
Limited (1990) ASC #59-114 (NSWCA); Anderson versus HFC Financial Services Limited and Anor <case>; [(1988) VR 251 (FCSC).] Canham and Ors versus Australia Guarantee
Corporation and Anor (1993) 31 NSWLR 246 (CA). The achievement of the purposes of consumer protection (including the protection of consumers who are typically comparatively small in power and weak in resources) suggest that a narrow view should not be taken of the Tribunal's procedural powers; 
Although it is true that the evidentiary and procedural provisions for disciplinary inquiries before the Tribunal are distinguished, and more narrowly confined, than those applicable to other proceedings (see eg [s 23(15)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html)
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/)) the subject matter of such inquiry remains of legitimate concern to the general public. This is most clearly expressed in the terms of s 23(4)(j) of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) by which the Chairman is empowered to arrange for the Tribunal to hold an inquiry if it appears to him that the licensee is "for any other reason not a fit and proper person to continue to hold a licence". Upon such a question the relevant experience of the public would be highly pertinent to the performance of the Tribunal's duty. Whilst the Commissioner may protect the public interest, the public has its own interest in protecting itself To confine the presentation of material to that supplied in the public interest by the Commissioner or lodged with an objection by a particular person may effectively either: narrow unduly the presentation of evidence and submissions relevant to the issues raised by the grounds for inquiry under <case> of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/); or rely too heavily upon the initiative of objectors coming forward.
Experience suggests (and this case illustrates) that the lodgment of an objection by an individual assumes a knowledge of the right to do so, the wherewithal, enterprise and determination to give effect to such knowledge and the courage or determination to follow it through. Unfortunately, these qualities are not always present in ordinary consumers. Once an inquiry has been launched, it is perfectly possible that members of the public will come forward to assist it to achieve its proper object. This, the proposed advertisement will permit; 
The focus of the inquiry of the Tribunal, as stated in the grounds for arranging the Tribunal to hold an inquiry in <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) is expressed in the succeeding paragraphs in very wide terms. Upon the subject matters of possible inquiry (and upon those singled out in the present case) the public has a relevant interest. Potentially, it has information to provide to ensure that an informed and just conclusion is reached in determining whether the ground is made out or not. In this sense, the disciplinary action authorised by [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) is not purely inter-partes litigation. This is demonstrated by the power of the Chairman (as in the present case) to arrange for the
Tribunal to hold an inquiry although no objection, either by the Commissioner or by any other person, has been received by the
Tribunal. The subject matter of the inquiry, being discipline directed at the protection of the public, it seems appropriate that the public should be notified and afforded the opportunity of presenting evidence and submissions; 
The dangers of an unduly prolonged or expanded inquiry and of unjust procedures are reduced by express provisions of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) and by the requirements of the common law: the licensee must be notified of the grounds that have occasioned the inquiry by the Tribunal and particulars must be provided. See ss 23(5), 23(6) and 23(7) of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/);  (ii) in the exercise of its functions, the Tribunal must obey the dictates of procedural fairness. See Esanda Finance
Corporation
Limited versus Murphy (1989) ASC #58, 345 (SCNSW);  (iii) the Tribunal has reserved to it a power of peremptory dismissal "whether before, during or after an inquiry". See <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). 
These requirements of law would appear to reduce the risk of injustice to the subject of the inquiry. So far as the damage done by the fact of advertisement is concerned, it seems scarcely likely that the fact of such an inquiry would remain locked in the knowledge of persons who chanced upon the Tribunal's hearing room. The Tribunal must ordinarily conduct its hearings in open court.
See Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), [s 19(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s19.html) Having regard to the earlier decision of the
Victorian Credit Licensing Authority, referred to in the particulars supplied with the notice to the appellant, and the protracted proceedings before the
Tribunal, it seems less than convincing to suggest that the leakage of a rumoured inquiry into the appellant, by public advertisement, would come as a shock to the money market or to others regularly concerned with consumer finance. In this regard, I would be inclined to view the present case as fairly typical of such inquiries;
So far as the reference by the appellant to the criterion of the belief of the Chairman (expressed in [s 23(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) and repeated in <case> of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/)) is concerned, I do not read those provisions as requiring that the ground for initiating an inquiry, or the sole focus of the inquiry, is addressed to the subjective beliefs of the Chair-man. It would be inconsistent with the entitlement to an impartial decision to read [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) as requiring, in effect, a concluded belief on the part of the Chairman of the
Tribunal that any of the grounds stated in <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) had been made out. That would be to deprive the licensee of a manifestly impartial Tribunal which approaches the inquiry without pre-determination. It would take much stronger language to persuade me that Parliament had intended such a consequence. I read the references to the beliefs of the Chairman, and the grounds for such beliefs, as no more than a preliminary determination on the part of the Chairman (whether or not pursuant to an objection) that an inquiry should be held. Once it has been determined that the inquiry should be set in train, its focus must be upon those grounds identified in <case> of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) as have enlivened the preliminary belief of the Chairman.
Thus, the reference in [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) to that belief is no more than a legislative indication that other grounds for arranging for the Tribunal to hold an inquiry must be disregarded. The only grounds for the imposition of any of the sanctions mentioned in [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) must be the establishment of the matters (if any) made out in the inquiry upon the nominated preliminary determination of the Chairman.
I take this to be the only way in which ss 23(4) and 23(8) of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) can be reconciled with the obvious intention of
Parliament and procedural fairness. The purpose of Parliament was that the
Tribunal should look to the conduct of the credit provider (the licensee) and not, as such, to the subjective thinking of the Chairman. The mistake of the appellant was to focus upon the phrase "for a belief' rather than upon the words "any ground" in <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). Upon the "grounds" stated in [s 23(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html), the evidence and submissions of the public would be relevant, helpful and even possibly vital to the proper discharge by the
Tribunal of the inquiry set in train. The Tribunal should not be deprived of such assistance if it feels the need for it; 
So far as the express provision elsewhere in the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) of the power of advertisement is concerned, it is a commonplace that care must be taken in the application of the expressio unius rule of statutory construction. Whilst the argument has forensic force, I do not regard it as strong enough to oust the obvious utility to the purpose assigned to the
Tribunal, once an inquiry has been set in train, to invite public submissions of evidence and argument.
Otherwise, the question is posed, who will, in default of an objection by anyone (as in the present case), provide the
Tribunal with the evidence and submissions relevant to the large ambit of the subject matters authorised for inquiry? In the practical operation of an inquiry, with the mandate envisaged by <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/), it is unlikely that only the objector, the licensee and anyone notified pursuant to <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) should have the entitlement to assist the
Tribunal to a proper conclusion. Whilst the statute required the notices provided by [ss 23(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) and (7), the common law would sustain as appropriate, and even perhaps necessary, notice to the public able to afford evidence or submissions relevant to an inquiry lawfully arranged pursuant to the decision of the Chairman under <case> of the Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/); and
With respect to the suggested dangers of vexation resulting from the evidence and submissions that might be received (and the criticism of the particular advertisement Proposed), it must be remembered that <case>(15) of the
Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) effectively requires that all such evidence or submissions be limited to those strictly relevant. Moreover, the nature of the inquiry as one concerned with the discipline of a licensee would, within the statutory scheme, import an element of strictness which the
Tribunal could be expected, and allowed, to observe. The Tribunal is also directed by <case>(10) of the
Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) to ensure the reduction of costs, the prompt hearing and identification of all matters in issue. That duty, although one of imperfect obligation, should put a brake upon any unnecessary or irrelevant expansion of the inquiry, of its length, or of the costs flowing from it. An unduly wide advertisement might, in a proper case, breach the requirements of <case>(10) of the Tribunal [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/).
 
Conclusion and orders
I have therefore concluded that Carruthers J was right to answer each of the questions of law stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court, in the affirmative. The powers exercised were within those implied by Parliament's grant of power to the Tribunal and its officers. This Court, limited as it is to questions of law, is not required to review the merits of the decision of the Tribunal that an advertisement should be published. Doubtless in some cases, having regard to the grounds identified by the preliminary decision of the Chairman, advertisement would not be an appropriate course. In every case the Tribunal is obliged to ask itself whether public advertisement would be appropriate to the discharge by it of the statutory functions initiated by the
Chairman's preliminary decision that an inquiry was warranted.
It may be appropriate to make it clearer in the advertisement finally published that an indication of intention to participate or provide information or of a desire to provide information does not necessarily mean that such participation will be permitted or the information received. That will depend, in each case, upon the limitations properly imposed by the
Tribunal for the fair and expeditious conduct of the inquiry and upon the relevance of the information proffered to the identified subject matters of the inquiry. It can be left to the Tribunal to give further thought to the terms of the advertisement.
The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
JUDGE2
MAHONEY JA Household Financial Services
Ltd ("HFC") holds a licence within
Division 3 of the [Credit (Administration) Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). The Chairman of the
Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales arranged for the Tribunal "to hold an
Inquiry to determine whether or not to take action under" [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/).
[Section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) provides for disciplinary action of the kind set forth in [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) where a licence holder has, inter alia, come within the provisions of [s 23(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html)
The Tribunal was of the opinion that it should give notice to "any person wishing to participate in the Inquiry or provide information relevant to the subject matter of the Inquiry" inviting such person to indicate, inter alia, the reason for seeking to participate in it, and the nature of the information to be provided.
HFC accepts that the Tribunal may hold the inquiry in question. However, it contends that the Tribunal has no power to give such a notice. It is of the view that the giving of notice of this kind in respect of the inquiry will cause it harm. It has therefore taken proceedings to prevent any such notice being sent.
Carruthers J dismissed the HFC's proceedings. It has appealed to this
Court against his Honour's judgment.
The facts are detailed in the judgment of Kirby P and I shall not repeat them. I agree with the President's orders and in general with his reasons for them. However, in deference to the submissions of Mr Coles QC I shall record the main reasons why, in my opinion, HFC's appeal fails.
Mr Coles' arguments were based, in substance, upon three propositions: that the giving of such notices is not within the power granted to the
Tribunal; that it is not incidental to such power; and that the terms of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) indicate that it was the legislative intention that no such notices should be given. These propositions overlap. But it will be convenient to consider the arguments generally by reference to them. 
The essential function of the Tribunal in the present circumstances is "to hold an inquiry". The nature of the inquiry is to be seen from the provisions of [s 23(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) and (8). The Tribunal is "to hold an inquiry to determine whether or not to take action under subsection (8) in relation to the licence": [s 23(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) [Section 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html), as far as is here relevant, provides: "23(8) If, after holding an inquiry in relation to a licence, the Tribunal is satisfied that any ground for a belief on the part of the Chairman referred to in subsection (4) has been made out the Tribunal may do any one or more of the following: reprimand the licensee; ..."
The inquiry therefore is an inquiry to determine, inter alia, whether the
Tribunal is satisfied "that any ground for a belief ..." of the kind referred to in [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) (8) exists.
Accordingly, the Tribunal can do all of the things which are involved in holding an inquiry of that kind. In my opinion, the giving of a notice of the relevant kind is part of the holding of such an inquiry.
The term "inquire" is in the
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary said to include: "1. To search into, seek knowledge concerning, investigate, examine.
To seek knowledge of (a thing) by putting a question; to ask about; to ask (something) of...
To address a question to, question, interrogate ..." 
It is, in my opinion, accordingly of the nature of an inquiry that persons be sought out who have or may have information concerning or which will provide knowledge of the subject matter of the inquiry. What the Tribunal proposed to do in the present case, viz, to call for persons who wished "to participate in the inquiry or provide information to the subject matter of the inquiry" was done for the purpose of obtaining from such persons information which would assist it to determine the relevant question and accordingly was part of the holding of such an inquiry. This, in my opinion, is sufficient to support what the Tribunal proposed to do.
Mr Coles QC, in his argument, considered, inter alia, the meaning of [s (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) and the significance of "ground for a belief' in that provision. Issues may subsequently arise, when the Tribunal comes to report, as to what it can or should include in its report and, no doubt, it will consider for this purpose the meaning of the matters in [s 23(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s23.html) to which Mr Coles QC has referred. But, in my opinion, these matters do not affect the present issue or the validity of the notice proposed to be given by the Tribunal.
What may be done in the course of or for the purpose of holding an inquiry has been considered by the courts in many cues: see generally Attorney
General for Commonwealth of Australia versus Colonial Sugar Refining Co
Ltd [(1914)
AC 237] In cases of this kind, consideration has been given to what the holding of an inquiry involves and distinctions. have been drawn, for example, between inquiring of those willing to provide information and taking steps with a view to forcing persons to provide information. Matters of that kind may become relevant during the Tribunal's inquiry. But, in my opinion, they do not affect the present issue.
In argument a distinction was drawn between matters incidental to an inquiry and matters merely collateral to an inquiry or conducive to the successful carrying out of an inquiry. Such distinctions would be of relevance if, for the purpose of justifying what it proposed to do, the Tribunal was required to rely upon incidental powers of this kind. But in my opinion, what it proposed to do constituted, not an act incidental to the holding of an inquiry of the relevant kind, but part of the holding of it itself.
Mr Coles QC submitted alternatively that the provisions of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) indicate that the legislature intended the inquiry to be held to be of a more restricted nature than would otherwise be held. He submitted, inter alia, that the legislation provided for those persons to whom notice could or should be given in the context of such an inquiry and accordingly provided by implication that notice should not be given to other persons. The provisions relied upon have been referred to in the judgment of Kirby P. I do not think that the provisions on which Mr Coles QC relied support the conclusion for which he contended. Insofar as there are provisions directing notices to be given, those provisions do not in terms provide that, in the course of its inquiring, the Tribunal shall not give other notices. There is nothing in the purpose or effect of the legislation to warrant the inference that such was the intention of the legislature.
In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
JUDGE3
PRIESTLEY JA I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinions of Kirby
P and Mahoney JA. I agree with the result they reach, but would confine my reasons for that result to those described by Mahoney JA as his "main reasons" for the failure of
HFC's appeal.
In reaching my opinion I have tried to understand the meaning of the relevant statutory provisions in their context, an approach not quite the same as that of Scalia J cited by Kirby P, but rather in conformity with that of the High Court in re Bolton, also referred to by Kirby P, and the statutory charter in [s 34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s34.html) of the [Interpretation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) .
In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
