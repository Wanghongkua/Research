JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Admissibility - [Listening Devices Act, 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lda1984181/) - purported "warrant" - tender rejected - T6500) HIS HONOUR: It is sought to tender through Federal Agent Marzio Da Re, presently giving evidence, the document presently part of Exhibit 162, which was admitted conditionally earlier this week, insofar as it purports to be warrant 308 of 1995, issued apparently on 4 December 1995 by Grove J.
 Objection to the tender is founded on two bases; one there is no mention in
Federal Agent Da Re's statement of this warrant, thus it is sought to lead evidence from him outside the terms of his statement. I have ruled that that is not an available course.
 The second basis upon which I propose to reject the tender of that document presently forming part of Exhibit 162, is on its face it cannot be described as a warrant issued by a judge of this court. It is a photocopy of a document with obliterations, and I shall extract from 162 that which is said to be warrant 308 of 1995.
 I think it important to note that this document, together with others, was provided by the Police Integrity Commissioner to the defendant pursuant to a request, and was accompanied by a <case> certificate. I have not been informed that any of this material, in particular this "warrant," has been otherwise produced to this court pursuant to an order of the Court constituted, for example, by a subpoena.
