JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
YOUNG CJ in EQ  
Tuesday 3 February 2004  /03 - APPLICATION OF DAVID PATRICK WATSON  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: I now give my reasons for issuing a warrant to arrest a solicitor which I made yesterday afternoon. Mr David Patrick Watson is the receiver of a solicitor whom I will identify as 'W'. Bryson J made an order under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s105.html) of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) 1987 that 'W' attend before the Registrar to be examined by the receiver pursuant to that section. I have a certificate of default from Senior Deputy Registrar
Wearne that 'W' failed to attend.  Mr Elliott for the receiver moves either under the Supreme Court Rules Pt 42 or under <case> of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) 1995 for an order arresting 'W'.  The material before the Court suggests that a senior solicitor, under the protocols of the Law Society, has been assisting 'W' without fee. That solicitor has indicated that he has heard that 'W' has gone to South Australia to deliver telephone books because he has no income and that is the only way he can get income. Whether 'W' was telling his solicitor the exact truth or not is unknown.  The Court must treat very seriously a default by a solicitor, one of its officers, in complying with an order made under <case>. It is not an order that is made lightly and it is made for the public good.  A solicitor is an officer of this Court and the Court expects its officers to observe to the letter their responsibilities. It is not a satisfactory answer that the person is working somewhere and needs an income, not to obey the order of the Court.  Furthermore, the whole week was set aside for examinations in this matter and a further week commencing 23 February, and a great deal of inconvenience is caused in the Court not being able to use those dates, and other litigants will suffer.  I think that in the future if a solicitor fails to obey an order under s , the ordinary order would be that he or she be imprisoned for 28 days with perhaps the writ to lie in the office for a short period in case there be some proper explanation.  However, I did not do that in this case because, as I understand it, this is the first case of default under <case> and the profession probably needs to be advised as to the Court's stern attitude before such orders are implemented.  What I did was to issue a warrant for arrest in similar form to warrants that are issued for company directors that fail to attend for examination. So
I signed a warrant to the Sheriff to arrest 'W' and bring him before the Court on Monday 23 February 2004, or such earlier date as the Sheriff considers appropriate, detaining 'W' in custody in the meantime.  As I noted yesterday, such a warrant should be typed up in duplicate, one copy to be left with the file and a sealed copy to be delivered to the Sheriff at the Downing Centre or at the office in the old Supreme Court building.  I ordered accordingly and stood the matter over to 23 February 2004.
