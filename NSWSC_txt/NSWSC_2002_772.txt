JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
DUNFORD J  
Monday, 26 AUGUST 2002  /01 - Edward Hanna Akhrass versus Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd & anor  
JUDGMENT  His Honour: This is an appeal by the plaintiff against the decision of
Master Malpass of 24 April 2002 ordering that the proceedings commenced by him be dismissed. The proceedings were commenced by statement of claim filed on 4
July 2001 and claimed damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered by him when struck by a motor vehicle on 22 January 2001 in Summer Hill.  The statement of claim and the institution of the proceedings had a number of defects. The motor vehicle which allegedly struck the plaintiff was owned by the second defendant and insured by the first defendant. The second defendant was a proper party to the proceedings, but the first defendant was not. Moreover, the statement of claim (which was drafted apparently without any professional assistance) is a long, rambling document which does not comply with the requirements for pleadings set out in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p15) of the [Supreme Court
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/).  Furthermore, at the time of the filing of the statement of claim the plaintiff was not entitled to commence the proceedings, because of the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s108.html) of the [Motor Accidents Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) which provides that a claimant is not entitled to commence court proceedings in respect of a claim subject to the Act, unless the Principal Claims Assessor has issued an exemption certificate pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s92.html) or has issued an assessment certificate pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s94.html)  At the time of the commencement of the proceedings, and at the time that
Master Malpass delivered his judgment, neither certificate had been issued.
Since then an exemption certificate has been issued by the Principal Claims
Assessor on 1 May 2002, but that does not alter the situation that at the time the plaintiff commenced these proceedings he was not entitled to do so.  Moreover, the insurance company, the first defendant, had requested further and better particulars of the claim on 8 June 2001 and, as far as I can ascertain, those particulars have not yet been supplied, although certain information has been given. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s85.html) requires the claimant to co-operate with the other party, and whilst there is a failure to comply with the section without reasonable excuse, court proceedings cannot be commenced: [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s85.html),
Hill versus Bolt [(1992) 28 NSWLR 329.]  I am therefore satisfied that Master Malpass was correct in holding that at the time the plaintiff commenced these proceedings he was not entitled to do so, as the proceedings were not maintainable by him.  Subject to supplying the further particulars required by the letter of 8
June 2001, the plaintiff would now be entitled to commence fresh proceedings, but he cannot revive the proceedings which were improperly commenced at a time he was not entitled to do so, and which were dismissed pursuant to the order of Master Malpass.  The plaintiff has indicated that if he cannot have the earlier proceedings in this Court revived in some way he wishes to start fresh proceedings in this
Court. Subject, as I say, to complying with the request for further particulars [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s85.html), the fresh proceedings may be commenced in this Court or in the District Court, but if commenced in this Court, they are likely to be remitted to the District
Court because that court has unlimited jurisdiction in claims in respect of motor accidents: [District Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), [ss (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s44.html), The plaintiff also, in his documentation, indicates that as an alternative to the proceedings being heard in this Court he wishes them heard in the High
Court because he wishes to also appeal against a decision in some earlier proceedings. Such appeal would require special leave from the High Court but in any event would be quite separate from these proceedings.  I therefore order that the appeal from Master Malpass be dismissed with costs and I confirm the orders of Master Malpass.
