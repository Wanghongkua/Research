JUDGMENT
On 22 August 2015 a Magistrate of the Local Court, sitting in the Court's General Division, delivered judgment in interlocutory proceedings connected with an action for damages for breach of contract. The interlocutory order determined an application by the first defendant in these proceedings, Michael Gollop, to amend a statement of claim pursuant to [s.65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s65.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) ("the Act") to substitute a company, SafeAs Australian Pty Limited ("SafeAs", the second defendant) as plaintiff, in lieu of Mr. Gollop, as originally pleaded.
The learned Magistrate granted the application to amend the statement of claim, as provided for by [s.64(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s64.html) of the Act.
The plaintiff in these proceedings, the defendant below, Disability Services Australia Limited ("DSA"), seeks leave to appeal against that interlocutory order. Such appeals are governed by [Part 50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p50) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), and are brought pursuant to [s.40](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s40.html) of the [Local Court Act 2007](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/). It is useful to set out the relevant parts of that section, and those of [s.39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s39.html) of the Act.
 [s.39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s39.html)
Appeals as of Right 
A party to proceedings before the Court sitting in its General Division who is dissatisfied with a judgment or order of the Court may appeal to the
Supreme Court, but only on a question of law.

Appeals requiring leave 
A party to proceedings before the Court sitting in its General Division who is dissatisfied with a judgment or order of the Court on a ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact may appeal to the Supreme Court, but only by leave of the Supreme Court.

A party to proceedings before the Court sitting in its General Division who is dissatisfied with any of the following judgments or orders of the Court may appeal to the Supreme Court, but only by leave of the Supreme Court: an interlocutory judgment or order [...].
DSA asserts errors made by the learned Magistrate in the exercise of his discretion in permitting the amendment to be made. Although there is some dispute between the parties as to whether the appeal involves questions of mixed fact and law; or, of mixed fact and law, and fact only, there is no issue that the plaintiff's appeal requires the Court's leave as it is an appeal against interlocutory orders.

The Proceedings Below
This account of the Local Court proceedings is taken from the material filed for and relied upon the plaintiff, material that is not in dispute.
In the proceedings below Michael Gollop commenced an action for damages against DSA, asserting breach of contract. In brief, the action related to a contract (in partly written and partly oral form) entered in 2007 whereby Mr. Gollop, through his solely owned company SafeAs, engaged DSA to carry out work on a device which was intended to be mounted on the dashboard of a motor vehicle, and which operated to sound an alert or warning when the vehicle entered a school speed zone. The work consisted of the removal and replacement of stickers mounted on the units, at a cost of thirty-four cents per unit. Some 20,326 individual units were delivered to DSA on 22 July 2007 for the work to be carried out. This constituted the whole of the stock of the device.
The claim asserted that, on an inspection of the work conducted on 30 October 2007, the present defendant discovered that the work was defective, rendering the units unsaleable. Mr. Gollop complained to DSA of the defective work on 31 October 2007, but asserts that remedial work was not undertaken. Correspondence via the parties' respective lawyers followed, but the units have not been repaired and are now said to be worthless. The retail purchase price of one unit in 2007 was $20.00.
The loss to Mr. Gollop was said to be the whole of the $65,000 invested by him in the manufacture and marketing of the devices, and his claim was for that sum together with costs and interest (amounting to $96,948.60 as at the date of filing).
Mr. Gollop's statement of claim was filed in the Local Court on 30 October 2013 and was brought in his own name as plaintiff. At the time of filing, SafeAs was no longer operational, having been deregistered by the Australian Securities Investments Commission on 3 June 2012.
On 19 February 2014 DSA filed its defence in the Local Court. It denied having entered into any agreement with Mr. Gollop. Much of the defence was simply to deny the particulars asserted by Mr. Gollop, the particulars having been pleaded by Mr. Gollop as relevant to him rather than to SafeAs, DSA simply denied them. It did acknowledge the existence of an agreement between DSA and SafeAs for work on the safety devices, but disputed that the work undertaken was defective, or that the units were rendered valueless.
The defence also asserted that Mr. Gollop's claim was statute barred by operation of [s.14(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/), but that aspect of the defence is of no present relevance.
The matter was listed for hearing at the Sutherland Local Court on Friday, 27 June 2014. On Tuesday, 24 June 2014 Mr. Gollop's solicitor, by reference to the defence filed by DSA to Mr. Gollop's claim, raised the issue of the identity of the plaintiff, and signalled an intention to seek to amend the claim so as to substitute SafeAs for Mr. Gollop as plaintiff. At that time, SafeAs remained deregistered.
A Notice of Motion seeking the amendment to the statement of claim was served upon DSA at 7.13pm on 26 June 2014, that is, the night before the hearing. The Affidavit in Support was not served until the following morning. The amendment was sought to be made pursuant to [s.65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) of the Act.
In his affidavit filed in support of the motion, Mr. Gollop deposed that, when filing the statement of claim, he had regarded himself as the plaintiff since he understood a claim could not be filed by a deregistered company. Additionally, he said that the name SafeAs was a marketing tool for a product which he had conceived of, held the patent for, and had fully developed and funded, himself. It had been Mr. Gollop who conducted all material negotiations with DSA and all asserted financial loss associated with the product had been borne by him.
SafeAs was re-registered only minutes before the hearing commenced before the Local Court on 27 June 2014.
The motion to substitute the name of the plaintiff, relying as it did on asserted mistake, was opposed by DSA.
The Magistrate heard submissions from the parties on the proper construction and use of [s.65(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) of the Act on 27 June 2014, and thereafter fixed a timetable for further written submissions the parties wished to make. Judgment was delivered on 22 August 2014.

The Decision of the Local Court
Since much was made by the plaintiff in submissions before this Court of apparent infelicities of expression and misattribution of quoted references by the learned Magistrate, it should be noted at the outset that the judgment delivered by his Honour on 22 August 2014 was essentially an ex tempore one. Whilst the matter had been adjourned with a view to judgment being handed down at some later date, to accommodate additional written submissions to be filed by the parties, the learned Magistrate delivered judgment without the benefit of a written decision, referring only to his own notes, and against the background of a busy Local Court list and a doubtless heavy workload.
In such circumstances his Honour's remarks may well lack the ordered structure and polished syntax of a decision handed down with the benefit of time in which to hone the language used. That must be borne firmly in mind.
It is not the function of an appellate court to determine the question of legal error by grammatical or syntactical analysis of the text of the lower court judgment. The judgment and reasons of the Magistrate are to be considered fairly and as a whole, and understood as a whole, without engaging in unhelpful scrutiny of the form of expression, as opposed to the meaning intended and conveyed.
Setting aside any inelegancy of expression, the learned Magistrate concluded that Mr. Gollop had made a "mistake" as to the plaintiff pleaded in the originating process, and that the mistake was of a sort contemplated by [s.65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) of the Act. His Honour considered whether the mistake was such as to be misleading, or cause some doubt as to the identity of the person nominated as a party, and concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, there could be no confusion or misunderstanding, and "there is little doubt who was dealing with whom".[1] The learned Magistrate found that DSA had at all times understood the nature of the claim against it, its factual basis, and the proper identity to bring the action, and there was no material prejudice to it in allowing the amendment to be made.
His Honour had regard to the requirement for justice to be done between the parties [(ss.56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s56.html) and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) of the Act) and concluded that, to refuse to allow the amendment to be made would be to deny Mr. Gollop and SafeAs the opportunity to have the case decided on its merits, thus operating punitively. His Honour was cognisant of the fact that, if denied leave to amend the originating process, Mr. Gollop (and SafeAs) would be shut out from a hearing of his claim, as a consequence of the operation of the statutory limitation period.
In making an order for costs against SafeAs, the learned Magistrate concluded that such prejudice as may have been occasioned to DSA by delay was able to be compensated for by an order for costs.
His Honour granted the motion and ordered costs in favour of DSA.

The Appeal
If granted leave, DSA advances three grounds of appeal against that decision. They are: "1. The Magistrate erred in granting leave to the first defendant under [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s65.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) to substitute his name for that of the second defendant in the Statement of Claim
The Magistrate erred in finding that any mistake made in the Statement of
Claim nominating the first defendant was a mistake for the purposes of [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s65.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/),
In the alternative, if there was a mistake for the purposes of [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s65.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), the
Magistrate erred in exercising his discretion to grant leave to the first defendant to amend his Statement of Claim to allow the first defendant's name to be substituted for that of the second defendant."
DSA asks this Court to make orders upholding the appeal, setting aside the orders made in the Local Court on 22 August 2014, and ordering instead that Mr. Gollop's Motion of 26 June 2014 be dismissed. Costs are sought.
A not wholly irrelevant preliminary matter is that the Summons Seeking Leave to Appeal as filed by DSA nominates Michael Gollop as first defendant, and SafeAs as second defendant. The present defendant raises a preliminary issue as to what it contends to be an error in the nomination of Mr. Gollop as defendant to the Summons since, no stay having been sought or granted of the order of the Local Court of 22 August 2014, the only available defendant is SafeAs.
[Rule 50.7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s50.7.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) provides that an appeal to this Court does not operate as a stay, and so the criticism is a valid one. The Rules provide for the removal of any person as a party to an appeal: r.50.5(3).
It is not a little ironic that the present plaintiff appears to have made an error of precisely the same nature as that which Mr. Gollop made in filing the originating process. This is, perhaps, indicative of the correctness of the general findings underlying the learned Magistrate's conclusions in the lower court, that the parties regarded Mr. Gollop and his company SafeAs as factually, if not legally, the same entity, and treated them as interchangeable.
It is the plaintiff's argument that the decision of the Local Court is one in which errors of law were made that are so fundamental they must be corrected, notwithstanding the relatively low monetary sum involved: Bristow versus Adams <case> at <case> per Beazley JA, as she then was. It is submitted that his Honour's understanding of the meaning of "mistake" intended by s.65(2)(b) was incorrect and, in that the interpretation of the word involves a question of whether it has its ordinary or a technical meaning, a question of law is involved.
The plaintiff contends that, whilst there was a mistake by Mr. Gollop as to the name in which to bring the action against DSA, that was a mistake as to the entity in which the right of action was vested, rather than one as to merely name. Such a mistake is not amenable to remedy pursuant to s.65(2)(b). It submits that leave to appeal should be granted.
The plaintiff additionally asserts that, because the Local Court orders had the practical effect of permitting an action to proceed which otherwise must have ended as statute barred, the decision is sufficiently decisive as to require the grant of leave.
As to the question of leave, the defendant emphasises the requirement for leave, doubly arising in its submission since it contends that the appeal is one which, at best, raises mixed questions of fact and law, thus requiring leave to appeal, with the further requirement for leave flowing from the nature of the proposed appeal, one brought against interlocutory orders.
Militating firmly against a grant of leave in the defendant's submission are the absence of any substantial reasons warranting a grant of leave, there being no question of principle or public importance arising, and the costs of the appeal being unjustifiable having regard to the amount involved in the originating claim.
On the substantive claim by DSA, the defendant contends that the decision of the Local Court in finding that the error as to plaintiff was a mistake encompassed by s.65(2)(b) of the Act was one which was open to it, as was the exercise of the Court's discretion in Mr. Gollop' favour to permit the amendment. It submits that there is no basis for this Court to intervene.

Consideration
Whether a single grant of leave is required for DSA to pursue its appeal, or whether such leave is doubly required, there is no question that the leave of this Court is necessary for any appeal to be brought. As an intended appeal against an interlocutory order of the Local Court sitting in its General Division, [s.40(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s40.html) of the [Local Court Act 2007](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) makes that plain.
DSA requires the leave of the Court to proceed with its appeal on two fronts: firstly, the statutory restriction imposed by [s.40(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s40.html) relevant to interlocutory appeals; and, secondly, the statutory restriction imposed by [s.40(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s40.html) upon grounds advancing questions of mixed fact and law (which the plaintiff accepts applies to at least some of its grounds). The twofold statutory restrictions must weigh heavily against a grant of leave.
The statutory requirement for leave is one which enforces a constraint upon the rights of the parties to appeal against decisions of courts at first instance. It is a constraint intended to limit both the costs and the time taken to adjudicate disputed matters, and to achieve finality.
Particularly when the appeal is one against a decision of the Local Court, the issue of cost takes on considerable significance. The Local Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, with a monetary jurisdictional limit in its General Division of $100,000. Without restricting the right of the parties in such matters to appeal against decisions with which they are dissatisfied, the potential legal costs and the cost to the public purse in making available the resources of the courts could rapidly reach disproportionate levels. One can readily foresee a situation where the legal costs of court action, even excluding the costs to the community, could be substantially greater than the quantum of the dispute between the parties. With an original claim for $65,000 (with interest and costs) such would quickly be the case in the present matter.
In Coulter versus R [[1988] HCA 3] Deane and Gaudron JJ noted that statutory restriction on the right of appeal, "... represents a constraint upon the overall cost of litigation by protecting parties, particularly respondents, from the costs of a full hearing of appeals [...] (at 359)."
Where a party requires leave, with that background of statutory constraint, it has been repeatedly stated that something more than a contention that the judge at first instance was arguably in error is required: Carolan versus AMF Bowling Pty Ltd [[1995] NSWCA 69.] noted at [46] that, "... ordinarily it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal only concerning matters that involve issues of principle, questions of general public importance or an injustice which is reasonably clear, in the sense of going beyond what [is] merely arguable (Young and Meagher JJA agreeing)."
Of course, these considerations do not detract from the applicability of [s.56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s56.html) of the Act, which refers not just to cost and timeliness but to the achievement of justice; nor from [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s58.html), which requires a court to act in accordance with the dictates of justice, and having regard to the degree of injustice that would be occasioned to a party as a consequence of an order of the court: Be Financial Pty Ltd as Trustee for Be Financial Operations Trust versus Das <case>
The question is whether asserted error in the decision of the learned Magistrate as to the construction and applicability of [s.65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s65.html) (2)(b) of the Act and the exercise of his discretion in favour of Mr. Gollop is one of sufficient significance that leave to appeal should be granted.
[Section 65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s65.html) of the Act is a remedial provision of broad application intended to permit amendment where necessary to correct mistakes in the identification of a party in the suit, in circumstances where, owing to the operation of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/), fresh action brought with the correct parties nominated would be barred. That section needs to be considered in conjunction with [s.64.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s64.html) "[s. 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s64.html) 
At any stage of proceedings, the court may order: that any document in the proceedings be amended, or that leave be granted to a party to amend any document in the proceedings.

Subject to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html), all necessary amendments are to be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceedings, correcting any defect or error in the proceedings and avoiding multiplicity of proceedings.

An order under this section may be made even if the amendment would have the effect of adding or substituting a cause of action that has arisen after the commencement of the proceedings but, in that case, the date of commencement of the proceedings, in relation to that cause of action, is, subject to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html), taken to be the date on which the amendment is made.

If there has been a mistake in the name of a party, this section applies to the person intended to be made a party as if he or she were a party.

This section does not apply to the amendment of a judgment, order or certificate.
 [s. 65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) 
This section applies to any proceedings commenced before the expiration of any relevant limitation period for the commencement of the proceedings.

At any time after the expiration of the relevant limitation period, the plaintiff in any such proceedings may, with the leave of the court under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s64.html) (b), amend the originating process so as: to enable the plaintiff to maintain the proceedings in a capacity in which he or she has, since the proceedings were commenced, become entitled to bring and maintain the proceedings, or to correct a mistake in the name of a party to the proceedings, whether or not the effect of the amendment is to substitute a new party, being a mistake that, in the court's opinion, is neither misleading nor such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be made a party, or to add or substitute a new cause of action, together with a claim for relief on the new cause of action, being a new cause of action that, in the court's opinion, arises from the same (or substantially the same) facts as those giving rise to an existing cause of action and claim for relief set out in the originating process.

Unless the court otherwise orders, an amendment made under this section is taken to have had effect as from the date on which the proceedings were commenced.

This section does not limit the powers of the court under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s64.html) 
This section has effect despite anything to the contrary in the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

In this section, "originating process", in relation to any proceedings, includes any pleading subsequently filed in the proceedings."
The issue of whether or not the relevant limitation period had expired as at 27 June 2014 so as to enliven the operation of [s.65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) was conceded by the plaintiff for the purposes of proceedings before this Court, with the same concession having been made in the Court below.
The meaning and operation of [s.65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) have been considered in a number of decisions, including Bridge Shipping Pty Limited versus Grand Shipping SA <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 231] In that case, Charrington had been wrongly named as the defendant to proceedings in the mistaken belief that it was the plaintiff's landlord. Donaldson LJ said, at 821, "...it is, in my judgment, important to bear in mind that there is a real distinction between suing A in the mistaken belief that A is the party who is responsible for the matter complained of and seeking to sue B, but mistakenly describing or naming him as A and thereby ending up suing A instead of B. The rule is designed to correct the latter and not the former category of mistake.
Which category is involved in any particular case depends upon the intentions of the person making the mistake and they have to be determined on the evidence in the light of all the surrounding circumstances."
That decision was followed in Lloyd Steel Co versus (Aust) Pty Limited and Anor versus Jade Shipping SA and Anor [(1985) 1 NSWLR 212], where an amendment to the name of a party to the proceedings allowed at first instance was confirmed on appeal, the decision of the trial judge on that point, there being described as a question of fact.
In my view, and applying Bridge Shipping and East West Airlines, the question of whether a mistake of the type contemplated by [s.65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) has been made is one of fact, which must be determined on the evidence in the particular case. It is acknowledged that the line drawn between the correction of a misnomer or misdescription and the substitution of a different party is not always an easy one to draw.[2] Here, his Honour had to assess the competing claims and arguments of the parties, and draw that line.
Mr. Gollop contended, on the one hand, that he had nominated himself as plaintiff because he and his company were synonymous for all practical purposes, and the company was not at the time of filing a legal entity in any event. He submitted that this was a mistake within the meaning of [s.65(2)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s65.html) DSA, on the other hand, asserted that this was no mere misnomer, but was an error as to the entity in which the right of action was vested rather than one of mistake as to the name of the person entitled to sue. It submitted to his Honour that the mistake should be viewed as an error falling within the same category as that in Siproll, where a company liquidator erroneously commenced proceedings in the company's name rather than that of the liquidator.
Whilst Siproll is informative, his Honour appears to have concluded that it was not determinative of the case before him. He proceeded on the basis that the facts in Siproll could be distinguished from the facts of the case before him because in Siproll the entitlement of a company in liquidation to bring action in circumstances where a liquidator had been appointed was regulated by the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). That approach is neither novel nor unique: Mitry, [48] - [50].
The decision at first instance rested on a conclusion of fact that Mr. Gollop's mistake was more than a mistake of law alone, and thus the operation of [s.65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s65.html) was not precluded. As was observed in Mitry (at [48]) the fact that a mistake of that nature was made does not mean that there was not also a mistake in the name of the plaintiff. [Section 65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s65.html) "does not require that the 'mistake in the name of a party' be the sole mistake that has been made".
It was clear in the present matter that his Honour concluded on the evidence before him that Mr. Gollop had made a mistake in naming the entity or individual with a cause of action against DSA by reference to his own name. The Local Court concluded that his mistake was one of nomenclature, rather than one as to the description of the party who was entitled to bring the claim. In the same sense as in Mitry, the Court concluded that Mr. Gollop purported to bring the action in exercising the rights of the company, which was defunct; his failure was in not bringing the action in the name of the company.
It was, in my view, open to his Honour to reach that conclusion on the evidence before him. Whilst the contrary position was capable of being advanced, that simply highlights the difficulty of drawing the line in some cases between misidentification, and mistake of law as to the appropriate party. That DSA had an arguable case on the application of [s.65(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s65.html) is not of itself sufficient to warrant a grant of leave.
As was required of him, the Magistrate at first instance also considered the question of whether the mistake was misleading, or such as to cause reasonable doubt as to the person intended to be made a party.
It was not seriously contended in these proceedings that there was any real possibility that DSA could have been misled by Mr. Gollop's mistake. Indeed, it was DSA which immediately noted the mistake in the nomination of the plaintiff, and sought to take advantage of it by simply denying that it had ever entered into an agreement with Mr. Gollop. Despite the wrongness of the name of the plaintiff, the description of the entity properly having that role was always clear, and his Honour so concluded. That conclusion was also open to him.
Grounds 1 and 2 could not be made out.
Ground 3 of the plaintiff's proposed appeal raised an alternative proposition that, even if there had been a mistake amenable to correction pursuant to [ss.64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s64.html) and [65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s65.html) of the Act, the Magistrate erred in granting leave to amend the originating process. It is argued that his Honour's discretion in that regard, properly exercised, should have resulted in leave being refused.
The argument advanced by DSA in support of that contention is that, Mr. Gollop having been so dilatory in seeking to correct the error, substantial prejudice was occasioned to DSA, and leave to amend should not have been granted. The prejudice occasioned to DSA was identified as the fact that, because leave was granted to Mr. Gollop to amend the originating process, it had to answer the claim in the Local Court, an outcome which would have been quite the opposite if leave had been refused.
Counsel for the plaintiff relied upon Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd versus Australian National University <case>; [239 CLR 175] as authority for the proposition that an order for costs, and even indemnity costs, could not be regarded as a sufficient remedy for any prejudice that may have flowed to DSA from the tardiness of Mr. Gollop in seeking to correct the name of the plaintiff in the originating process. Whilst Counsel expressed the principle enunciated in Aon Risk in terms that allowed for no shade to its meaning, as one which meant that costs could never be seen as a sufficient answer to amendment and consequential delay, I do not read Aon Risk in such a starkly dichotomous way. As stated in Aon Risk at [98] and [99]: "[98] Of course, a just resolution of proceedings remains the paramount purpose of r 21; but what is a "just resolution" is to be understood in light of the purposes and objectives stated. Speed and efficiency, in the sense of minimum delay and expense, are seen as essential to a just resolution of proceedings. This should not detract from a proper opportunity being given to the parties to plead their case, but it suggests that limits may be placed upon re-pleading, when delay and cost are taken into account. The Rule's reference to the need to minimise costs implies that an order for costs may not always provide sufficient compensation and therefore achieve a just resolution. It cannot therefore be said that a just resolution requires that a party be permitted to raise any arguable case at any point in the proceedings, on payment of costs.
 [99] In the past it has more readily been assumed that an order for the costs occasioned by the amendment would overcome injustice to the amending party's opponent. In Cropper versus Smith Bowen LJ described an order for costs as a panacea that heals all. Such a view may largely explain the decision of this court in Shannon versus Lee Chun, which upheld a decision allowing the plaintiff to raise a new case at the second trial, but which imposed a condition as to costs. The modern view is that even an order for indemnity costs may not always undo the prejudice a party suffers by late amendment. In the present case it is difficult to see that such an order could be sufficient compensation, given that Aon would be required to again defend litigation which was, effectively, to be commenced afresh."
The point being made in Aon Risk as I understand it was, that in an age when the pressures on the courts are many and heavy, the resolution of the dispute between the parties is no longer to be the only consideration in achieving justice. The need to avoid disruption to a court's lists and the consequent waste of public resources and prejudice to other litigants waiting to gain access to the court must also be taken into account. An order for costs to one party or another is clearly incapable of addressing and remedying the broader considerations of delay in the courts as a whole.
As Aon Risk made clear, there is no right to amendment, simply subject to the payment of costs. A wider range of factors than was previously the case must now be considered when determining whether to grant leave to a party to amend pleadings, including delay and wasted costs and the effects of those features on not just the parties, but also upon the court and other litigants.
(It is notable that Aon Risk involved an application for an adjournment by the ANU to make substantial amendments to its pleading, resulting in the waste of four weeks of court time set aside for the trial, and the loss of the very substantial costs incurred by Aon Risk in its preparation for the trial. There is no comparison to the potential loss and delay in the present matter.)
What the High Court in Aon Risk did not say, as the plaintiff appeared to contend at one point in address to this Court, is that the dictates of justice between the parties are to be ignored wherever the conduct of one party leads to delay and increased costs. Even in such circumstances, justice between the parties has not been rendered wholly irrelevant, but remains an important consideration.
Whilst the form of expression used by the learned Magistrate when considering these aspects of the matter, and the decision in Aon Risk, may have muddied the meaning somewhat, it is clear that his Honour took into account and weighed all of the relevant considerations, including that of delay and prejudice to DSA and of costs to the administration of justice more generally. He was also required to, and did, consider, the provisions of ss.56 and 58 of the Act, and what was necessary to determine and litigate the real issues between the parties, and achieve a just outcome.
I have concluded that it was open to the learned Magistrate to exercise his discretion to grant leave in favour of Mr. Gollop. The exercise of a discretion is reviewable only where some error has been made in the exercise of the discretion. As stated in House versus R [1936] HCA; 55 CLR 499 at [504]: "If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred."
I am unable to conclude that a substantial wrong has occurred.
As the learned Magistrate noted, there having been a mistake made by Mr. Gollop as to the plaintiff nominated, and there being no possibility that the mistake was one which was misleading or such as to cause doubt as to the intended litigant, to refuse him leave to make the amendment would shut him out from the jurisdiction of the court altogether, and deny him the opportunity to have his claim heard and determined on its merits.
Whilst action to correct the mistake was slow in being taken by Mr. Gollop, there was an adequate explanation provided in the evidentiary material before the Local Court for both the delay in bringing the claim, and the delay in seeking to correct it. The evidence, which DSA did not seek to test in the Local Court or to challenge before this Court, explained the delay by reference to Mr. Gollop's extremely difficult personal circumstances, his impecunity and - at least inferentially - the legal advice he had received prior to filing his original claim. The delay had not been due to any deliberate manipulation of the court's process, or to an attempt to secure some unfair advantage over DSA.
From DSA's perspective, his Honour concluded that, whilst there had been prejudice to DSA in the delay, on the particular circumstances of the case, an order for costs in its favour was a sufficient compensation. The defence filed by DSA had, other than the narrow technical defence of denying that a contract with Mr. Gollop existed, denied the allegation of defective work. The latter is, presumably, a sufficient answer to the claim against it without more. It is plain from the material filed in the defence in the Local Court that DSA was in a position to adduce evidence and argue its case as a denial that its work was substandard, or that it had rendered the safety devices upon which it had worked unsaleable. The change to the name of the plaintiff allowed by the Local Court could have made no difference at all to the defence, other than by making its technical defence unavailable to it.
It was still open to DSA to conduct its defence to the claim and have that defence considered by the court. In that sense, there could be no prejudice to DSA in granting leave to amend, other than costs thrown away.
His Honour concluded that an order in DSA's favour for the costs of preparing the matter for hearing, and of the day of hearing, was sufficient redress. There is no challenge from the plaintiff to the costs order.

Conclusion
Whilst there is an arguable case for error on the part of the learned Magistrate, I do not regard it as sufficiently strong as to justify a grant of leave. Accordingly leave to appeal should be refused.
