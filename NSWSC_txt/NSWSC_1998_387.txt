September 1998)

ORS` `2411/98` `2 September 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from a judgment of Master Macready, given on 23 June 1998, ordering that a cross-claim be dismissed with costs. At the same time the learned Master ordered that the proceedings be transferred to the District Court. Unfortunately there was no stay of that order and the whole file has gone down to the District Court so that the exhibits which were before the learned Master are not in court for this appeal. 
Nonetheless, with the assistance of counsel I have been able to deal with this administrative oversight and it has been assumed on all sides that notwithstanding the order that the proceedings be transferred to the District
Court it was still appropriate for this Court to deal with the appeal against the dismissal of the cross-claim.

The proceedings and the cross-claim involve a dispute over the use by the plaintiffs of premises in Akuna Street Keiraville, within the Wollongong City
Council area, as a pre-school.

Essentially, the cross-claimants say that they have the benefit of a restrictive covenant contained in transfer G493793, which restricts the use of the plaintiffs' premises to that of a dwelling house. The cross-claim, which was filed on 11 June 1998, complains that the plaintiffs' use of the premises as a pre-school is contrary to the will of the cross-claimants, contrary to the covenant, and that the proposed contravening use will cause economic loss and damage to the cross-claimants, as well as damage to the community.

The reason why the Master struck out that cross-claim was that he favoured the submissions for the plaintiffs that the combined operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s28.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) (the EP & A Act), cl 40 of the Wollongong Local Environment Plan (LEP)(which came into force on 28 December 1990) and the development approval given by the
Wollongong City Council to the plaintiffs nullified any obligations imposed by the covenant. To complete the picture, the plaintiffs applied to the council for development consent on 24 November 1997. The council gave approval on 14
April 1998, the approval to operate from 8 May 1998. The law operates so that the plaintiffs can substantially commence development according to the approval they have got, any time up to 8 May 2003. They have not as yet substantially commenced the user or development.

The Court of Appeal in Coshott versus Ludwig (1997) 8 BPR 15,519, affirming a decision of Bryson J reported as Ludwig versus Coshott [(1994) 83 LGERA ], held that the effect of the relevant Local Environment Plan in that case, and s 28 of the E P & A Act "nullified, or rendered ineffective, the restrictive covenant" contained in the relevant memorandum of transfer. The
Court of Appeal simply upheld the reasons of Bryson J for that decision.

The learned Master held that in the instant case the evidence established that the plaintiffs had obtained council approval and cl 40 of the LEP applied to the development. Clause 40 provides that the operation of any restrictive covenant which restricts development shall not apply to the extent necessary to enable the development to occur. He held that that was sufficient to show that the cross-claim could not succeed.

Mr Cameron, who appeared for the appellants, but did not appear below, said that the learned Master did not deal fully with the issues which are raised by the cross-claim.

Mr Cameron said that the learned Master did not direct his mind to the fact that the cross-claimants had property within the meaning of the definition of the Conveyancing Act or [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/), and that their consent to any development was necessary under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/s77.html) and [78](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/s78.html) of the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/) for the reasons set out by Cripps J, as his Honour then was, in Jeblon Pty Ltd versus North
Sydney Municipal Council [(1982) 48 LGRA 113] at 120.
That may or may not be correct, but with great respect, it can have nothing to do with the outcome of this appeal.

First, this is so because the Master found as a fact on the evidence that the approval had been granted. Secondly, challenges to the validity of development consents are usually not a matter for this Court, or if they are the matter was not raised in the cross-claim, nor would it appear that it was argued before the learned Master.

Mr Cameron then says that the learned Master did not pay attention to the fact that covenants have operation in at least three ways. First, they have an affect on development. Secondly, they are a form of property, and thirdly, breach of covenant gives rise to a claim for damages at least in equity. He says that the learned Master, in merely saying on page 8 of his reasons that as cl 40 of the LEP now permits the development "accordingly there is no room for a claim for damages" just slides over the difficulties without meeting them.

The answer to these submissions is that a series of decisions of this Court and the Land and Environment Court, culminating in Coshott versus Ludwig supra, demonstrate that although courts take seriously into account the principle that Parliament does not intend to interfere with proprietary rights of private citizens unless it expressly says so, the operation of <case> of the
E P & A Act and instruments thereunder does have that effect.

Secondly, a restrictive covenant is something that is enforced in equity under the doctrine of Tulk versus Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774; [41 ER 1143.] The principle is that if a person takes a piece of land knowing that that piece of land's use is restricted because of an agreement made by his or her predecessor in title, then it may well be unconscionable for that person to use that piece of land contrary to that restriction.

There is great academic argument as to whether Tulk versus Moxhay is just a refinement and restriction of the wider equity laid down in De Mattos v
Gibson [(1858) 4 De G & J 276], or whether it is a separate principle. Whichever it is, it is an equitable right which does not give rise to any common law claim for damages.

An application can be made for an injunction to prevent breach of that covenant. The court hearing that claim may consider that an injunction is not appropriate and may in lieu grant damages under Lord Cairns' Act, which is now [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s68.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). However, the jurisdiction to grant Lord Cairns' Act damages is limited to a case where at the time when the proceedings were commenced it was possible for the court to give equitable relief: The Millstream Pty Ltd versus Schultz [[1980] 1 NSWLR ]
at 552.

In the instant case, as at 11 June 1998 the covenant had, for a reason I will come to shortly, already been nullified by the combined operation of <case> of the E P & A Act and cl 40 of the LEP. As at that date there was no power to grant an injunction and, accordingly, no power to give damages under Lord
Cairns' Act.

It may be that there are some other claims for damages that the cross- claimants may have. Some time in argument was spent speculating about these.
The court, however, especially on an appeal, must deal with the claim that was made before the Master and that was a claim, amongst other things, for equitable damages for the loss caused by the proposed contravening use. That claim was fairly and squarely nullified by the effect of the legislation.

Before the Master it was claimed that damages might arise some other way, such as from the dictum of Cowdroy AJ in the Land and Environment Court in Doe v
Cogente Pty Ltd [(1997) 94 LGERA 305], 317-8 (a decision now affirmed by the Court the Appeal as Cogente Pty Ltd versus Doe [(1998) NSW Conv R 55-845).]
Alternatively, it is claimed that there are damages because of a dictum I made in Doyle versus Phillips (1997) BPR 15,523 at 15,528. I think, with great respect, both those dicta are taken out of context if they are thought to support a claim in the instant case for damages against the owners who have obtained development approval which conflicts with a restrictive covenant.

Mr Cameron is quite right in his submissions that the owner of the benefit of a restrictive covenant has a right of property and that ordinarily one cannot be deprived of one's property without some compensation, or some action for damages. An example is Long Eaton Recreation Grounds Company Ltd versus Midland
Roadway Co [[1902] 2 KB 574.] 
The argument is, however, weaker with respect to restrictive covenants because under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s89.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) for some years this Court has been extinguishing covenants and, indeed, even easements without compensation when they are in conflict with current efficient development of the land and are not providing any appreciable benefit to the covenantee. Section 28 of the E P & A Act goes further, but it could well be seen by the government that this is merely an extension of what was already occurring under [s 89](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s89.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).

The other aspect of the argument was that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s28.html) and local environmental plans do not of themselves extinguish the covenant or nullify it, but it is only where there is a development which is carried out by the person who obtains a development approval pursuant to those provisions that brings about the nullification.

Mr Cameron says that there could be five moments when what he calls the nullifying effect occurs: (a) when the E P & A Act commenced on 1
September 1980; (b) when the council made the LEP; (c) when the applicant applies to the council for approval under that plan; (d) the date on which the approval operates; or (e) when the building work is substantially commenced.
Mr Cameron says that (e) is the correct construction. Mr Francey, who appeared for the respondents, I think adopted (b).

I do not consider that this is a question that can be answered in the same way in every case. As I pointed out in Doyle versus Phillips supra it is necessary to look at each individual instrument and each individual consent. There may be cases where, for instance, a local environment plan colours a piece of land yellow and includes what appears to a passer-by to be a dwelling house in a zoning marked "special uses church" where any covenant that restricted the use of that building to a dwelling house would automatically be negatived because the plan now only allows its use for church or associated purposes.

On the other hand, one could have a piece of land that was coloured on the plan and zoned in such a way that no development could take place without the consent of council, but that a whole range of developments could take place with the consent of council, some of which developments were in accordance with the restrictive covenant, some of which were not. In such a case it would seem to me that it would only be when the development consent operates that one would have the conflict which would nullify the restrictive covenant, so that the "nullifying effect" would occur at the grant of the development approval.

It is sufficient to dispose of the present appeal by saying that the nullifying effect does not only take place when there is substantial commencement pursuant to the development consent, but takes place, at the latest, at the times when that consent operates. In the present case operation was a month before the cross-claim was filed and, accordingly, it was no longer open when the cross-claim was filed to sue in respect of the covenant.

The result is that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
