JUDGMENT 
INTRODUCTION
An application made to the Supreme Court of NSW, in exercise of its protective jurisdiction, for the appointment of a protected estate manager following recovery of an award of common law damages made by the District Court of NSW for personal injuries suffered by the person (the defendant in the present, Supreme Court proceedings) said to be in need of protection provides an occasion upon which to record a statement about law and practice: An award of common law compensation predicated upon an assumption, or finding, that the person entitled to compensation is "incapable of managing his or her affairs" (necessitating an appointment of a tutor under [rule 7.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s7.14.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) NSW and, in the ordinary course, an order under [section 77](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s77.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) NSW for the payment of a judgment sum into court pending an invocation of the Supreme Court's protective jurisdiction) does not automatically, and need not in every case, result in the Supreme Court making an order for the appointment of a protected estate manager as a prerequisite to an order for the payment of the common law compensation moneys out of court to, or for the benefit of, the person entitled.
Upon an exercise of its protective jurisdiction the Supreme Court must make an independent assessment of whether the person entitled to the compensation is, or is not, capable of managing his or her own affairs.
The mere fact that he or she has been treated as incapable of self-management in the common law proceedings, or is unaccustomed to management of a capital sum of the size awarded to him or her as compensation, is not enough, of itself, to subject his or her estate to a protected estate management regime. Each case must be examined, on its own facts, for the purpose, and in accordance with the principles, governing an exercise of protective jurisdiction.
In the absence of a clear case for the appointment of a protected estate manager, an applicant for protected estate orders must, by evidence, demonstrate that the person said to be incapable of managing his or her affairs is, in fact, so incapable, and that the appointment of a manager is required for the benefit, and to serve the interests, of the individual concerned.
Absent satisfaction that the person is indeed incapable of managing his or her affairs, and that there is a real need for and utility in the appointment of a protected estate manager, the Court may decline to make a protective order, instead simply ordering that moneys paid into court be paid out to him or her personally.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMON LAW COMPENSATION PROCEEDINGS AND THE PROTECTIVE JURISDICTION
In administration of the Court's protective jurisdiction a constant, practical concern, of general importance, is interaction between that jurisdiction and the jurisdiction exercised by the Court, or (as in this case) the District Court of NSW, in the conduct of a common law action for personal injury compensation. This judgment is published with that general concern, and recent experience across a range of cases, in mind.
There is need of general observations about the relationship between common law compensation proceedings and the Court's protective jurisdiction.
A due administration of the protective jurisdiction requires, inter alia, vigilance against the possibility that those involved in the conduct of common law compensation proceedings may be tempted, by a premature but strategically timed application for protected estate management orders, to influence the course of the common law proceedings in circumstances in which (as established by Willett versus Futcher <case>; <case>- <case>.
The office of a tutor, appointed in and for the purpose of compensation proceedings, is generally best calculated to manage those proceedings, and to do so in a manner that operates fairly to the party, or parties, against whom an award of compensation is sought.
The Court has a supervisory jurisdiction over the appointment, and conduct, of tutors (Re P [[2006] NSWSC 1082]
An "exceptional circumstance" warranting an exercise of protective jurisdiction may occur in a case in which an award of "interim damages" is made under [section 82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s82.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), necessitating orders moulded to the facts of the particular case, designed to enable an integrated management of compensation moneys (by a protected estate manager) and the ongoing common law proceedings (by a tutor): Re K, an incapable person in receipt of interim damages awards  <case>
As these reasons for judgment are at pains to record, a determination of personal injury compensation proceedings (particularly if effected by an agreement for compromise) upon an assumption, or finding, that the claimant for compensation is incapable of managing his or her affairs does not, of itself, determine whether any (and, if so, what) protected estate management orders should be made upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction.
There is, in the abstract, no universal, necessary or directly proportionate connection between: (a) a loss of physical or mental capacity compensable in a common law action for personal injury compensation against another party; and (b) a finding of an incapacity for management of property, or person, warranting an appointment of a protected estate manager, or a guardian, upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction affecting a person entitled to compensation at common law.
In common law proceedings for an award of damages for personal injury, the claimant (with or without a tutor appointed to have carriage of the proceedings on behalf of the claimant) asserts an adversarial claim of right, with a focus on a loss which may, or may not, have an immediate manifestation in an incapacity for self-management.
A person against whom an award of damages is sought, or made, may have a commercial interest (but is unlikely, as a respondent to the common law claim, to have a legal interest) in, or a right to be heard on, the question whether the claimant may be found to be an incapacitated person upon exercise of protective jurisdiction.
Although personal injury compensation proceedings may be conducted, decided or settled upon an assumption, or finding, that the person claiming damages is incapable of managing his or her affairs and, in due course, is likely to be made the subject of protected estate management orders, an exercise of the Court's protective jurisdiction is not driven by the same dynamics as those that may operate in the common law proceedings.
In pursuit of compensation in common law proceedings, experience in exercise of the Court's protective jurisdiction suggests that, from time to time, a claimant for damages (not intended, here, to be conflated with the defendant in the current proceedings personally) may succumb to a temptation to magnify indicators of incapacity (in order to inflate the level of damages recovered) only to find that success in the common law jurisdiction may be attended by inconvenient constraints imposed according to imperatives of the protective jurisdiction.
Those who claim personal injury compensation, emboldened by a prospect of an award of damages enlarged, inter alia, by protected estate management costs in anticipation of a declaration of incapacity for self-management and the appointment of a manager, should be careful what they wish for.
Subjection to a regime for protected estate management, however necessary or benign, may quickly come to be seen by a protected person and his or her family as burdensome. Protected estate management orders, once made, may not readily be revoked. On balance, experience of protected estate management costs may outstrip any anticipatory award of compensation made to cover them. The costs of protected estate management are not confined to any anticipatory allowance for them made in compensation proceedings, however much the Court (and the NSW Trustee, with an administrative appeal to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal) may endeavour to ensure that they do not exceed the fair and reasonable: Ability One Financial Management Pty Ltd and Anor versus JB by his Tutor AB <case> at <case>; Re Managed Estates Remuneration Orders <case>
It is possible, although not routine experience, that, notwithstanding a determination of common law personal injury proceedings on the footing that a claimant awarded damages is, or may in the future be, incapable of managing his or her affairs, upon a proper exercise of protective jurisdiction the Court may decline to make protected estate management orders. CJ versus AKJ  <case> provides a recent, benign illustration of that phenomenon, as well as (in combination with P versus NSW Trustee and Guardian <case> a reappraisal of the meaning, and operation, of the concept of incapacity for self-management.

THE NATURE OF THE PROTECTIVE JURISDICTION
The Court's protective jurisdiction is governed by the purpose it serves; namely, the (protective) care of those who are not able to take care of themselves: Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services versus JWB and SMB (Marion's Case) <case>; <case>- <case> and [50].
The focus for attention, upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction, is upon protection of a particular person, not the benefit, detriment or convenience of any other person: CJ versus AKJ <case> at <case>(c).
There is a strong public interest element that operates, in such proceedings, to displace adversarial imperatives of the kind commonly encountered in common law proceedings.

THE MEANING OF INCAPACITY FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT IN PROTECTIVE PROCEEDINGS
The expression "incapable of managing his or her affairs" (found throughout legislation governing the historical, protective function of the Crown, now identified with the State) is to be accorded its ordinary meaning, able to be understood by the broad community (lay and professional) it serves, informed by the purposive character of the protective jurisdiction and principles governing an exercise of the jurisdiction: CJ versus AKJ <case> at <case>; P versus NSW Trustee and Guardian [2015) NSWSC 579 at [304]-[305].
In the context of a determination to be made under section 41 of the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2005 NSW (as in the present proceedings), those principles include the general principles set out in section 39 of the Act.
Chief amongst those statutory, general principles, and consistent with the purposive character of the protective jurisdiction historically derived from that exercised by the Lord Chancellor in England, is "the welfare principle" embodied in section 39(a): "the welfare and interests [of a protected person] should be given paramount consideration."
Following the judgment of White J in Re R <case> at <case>- <case>, and my own judgments in CJ versus AKJ <case> and P versus NSW Trustee and Guardian <case>, it may be taken that the "affairs" the subject of an inquiry about capacity for self-management, in the context of section 41 of the NSW Trustee and Guardian Act, are the affairs of the person whose need for protection is under scrutiny, not some hypothetical construct.
That inquiry, as to whether a person is or is not capable of managing his or her affairs, requires a strong emphasis on risk management: P versus NSW Trustee and Guardian <case> at <case>, [309] and [319].
That emphasis is reflected in the need for the Court, when making a decision under section 41, to focus not merely on the day of decision, but also upon the reasonably foreseeable future: McD versus McD <case>(a). An order for the appointment, removal or replacement of a protected estate manager is not be made merely because a party, or some other person, seeks it, consents to it or acquiesces in it.
The public interest element in the making of such a decision, coupled with the possibility, if not the fact, that a person in need of protection lacks the mental capacity requisite to informed decision-making, reinforces the independence of judgement required.
That said, upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction under [section 41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/), it is incumbent upon the Court to take into account, if not actively to consult, the views of the person said to be in need of protection and those personally close to him or her.
Recognition that: (1) the concept of incapacity for self-management bears the ordinary meaning of language used to describe it, informed by the purpose and principles of the protective jurisdiction, rather than the "objective test" formulated by Powell J in PY versus RJS <case>- <case>) must be accommodated to standards prevailing in the community of the particular person said to be in need of protection, as well as his or her particular need.
* (b) secondly, the utility of any formulation of a "test" of incapacity for the purpose of an exercise of protective jurisdiction depends on whether (and, if so, to what extent) it is, in the particular case, revealing of reasoning justifying a finding that a person is or is not (as the case may be) capable of managing his or her affairs, having regard to the protective purpose of the jurisdiction being exercised and established principles including, especially, the welfare principle: CJ versus AKJ <case> at <case>.
* (c) thirdly, in conformity with the general law (expounded in Gibbons versus Wright <case>; [(1954) 91 CLR 423] at 434-438), the level of capacity required of a person for a due exercise of protective jurisdiction is relative to the particular business to be transacted by that person, and the purpose of the law (in the present context, the protective jurisdiction) served by an enquiry into the person's capacity.
* (d) fourthly, although a decision about whether a particular person is, or is not, capable of managing his or her affairs may be powerfully informed by an expression of a medical opinion, based upon articulated observations of fact and accompanied by an exposition of technical medical terms, a determination about capacity for self-management made upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction is not, in essence, the province of medical expertise but of independent judgement by the Court applying established criteria to particular facts.
Experience of the protective jurisdiction makes a judge wary of medical opinions, unaccompanied by an articulation of primary facts based on empirical observation, but forensically convenient to the application of the moment. It is for that reason, for example, that medical opinions expressed in support of an application for revocation of management orders (under [section 86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s86.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/)) are routinely measured against earlier opinions expressed in support of an application for [section 41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) orders. The Court may take comfort from an opinion, but it must look primarily to facts, especially in close-run cases in which opinions may fairly differ. If in doubt, there is no substitute for a direct, personal engagement with the person whose capacity for self-management is under consideration, and those closely associated with him or her in daily living.

THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS : AN APPLICATION FOR PROTECTED ESTATE MANAGEMENT ORDERS CONSEQUENT UPON AN AWARD OF PERSONAL INJURY COMPENSATION
The present proceedings involve an application for protected estate management orders under [section 41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/), and an order under [section 77](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s77.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) for the payment out of court of moneys paid into court, following the successful outcome of a common law claim for personal injury compensation made in the District Court of NSW by the plaintiff acting as tutor for his 30 year old son, the defendant in the present proceedings.
On or about 24 March 2015 the District Court, in the common law proceedings, approved a settlement which provided for the claimant (the present defendant) to obtain a judgment for $2,250,000 inclusive of funds management expenses, plus costs, subject to adjustments. On 20 May 2015 the sum of $1,934,847.38 was paid into court, on his account, pursuant to that judgment.
The plaintiff's application to this Court for protected estate management orders is made with the overt support of his wife (the mother of the defendant) and the express consent of the defendant.
I declined to deal with the application in chambers, as routine protective business is conducted, because of doubts on my part as to: (a) whether the defendant can properly be characterised as a person incapable of managing his affairs; and (b) whether, if he can be so characterised, protected estate management orders are likely, truly, to benefit him and to be in his interests.
Whatever is done, or not done, upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction must generally be measured against what is in the interests, and for the benefit, of the person in need of protection: Holt versus Protective Commissioner <case>.
When, in chambers, I read the evidence (including the medical evidence) filed in support of the plaintiff's application for protected estate management orders I was not satisfied, on that material alone, that the defendant is (within the meaning of [section 41(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/)) "a person... incapable of managing his... affairs". At least some of the doctors consulted during the course of the District Court proceedings shared such a doubt.
It was the need of the Court to exercise an independent judgement about the defendant's capacity that caused me to invite the plaintiff, his wife and the defendant to appear before me on a formal hearing of the plaintiff's section 41 application.
On that occasion, with the support of his wife and in the presence of their son, the plaintiff outlined, in his own words, the factual foundations for his considered opinion that the defendant is (and is likely to be for the foreseeable future) incapable of managing his affairs, including (particularly) a cash fund of the order of $2 million.
In essence, the plaintiff says that, having suffered the injuries from which he has received compensation, the defendant has exhibited impulsive, reckless behaviour that renders him liable to exploitation and likely to dissipate any substantial amount of money within his immediate control.
I accept the plaintiff's heartfelt explanation of the case, plainly stated with the support of his wife and their son, with the benefit of advice from senior counsel.
The defendant's parents demonstrated a considered, rational and responsible assessment of his capabilities, prognosis and needs.
Despite limitations on his functionality described by his parents, the defendant presented himself to the Court as a reasonable, rational young person. In that mode, he acquiesced in his parents' assessment of his capacity for self-management, acknowledging that he has displayed a pattern of erratic behaviour since his injury inconsistent with reliance upon him to manage a large sum of money in his own best interests.
Armed with medical evidence and the family's elaboration of foundational facts, I am satisfied that the defendant is presently incapable of managing his affairs and that it is expedient to appoint a protected estate manager to manage them on his behalf.
Having been given an opportunity to consider whether the parents could usefully be appointed joint managers of their son's protected estate, all three members of the family (but particularly the plaintiff and the defendant) spoke in favour of the appointment of an independent, institutional protected estate manager.
Nevertheless, with the benefit of observations by each member of the family, and submissions made on their behalf by senior counsel, I conclude that, in making protected estate management orders, the Court should allow for: * (a) a review mechanism to be embedded in the orders, to require that active consideration be given, in not more than about three years' time, to whether the orders should be discharged or varied; and * (b) the defendant's manager to keep under active consideration whether, by an instrument under [section 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s71.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/), it should (with the approval of the NSW Trustee) authorise the defendant to deal with part of his estate under its supervision.
Undue formality should not attend the proposed process of review. Its object is principally to focus attention on an immediate, and continuing, need to shepherd the defendant towards management of his own affairs in due course.
I suspect that, when the family's traumatic experience of the common law proceedings recedes in memory, and the defendant's personal and financial arrangements settle down into a stable, established pattern, a more robust view may be taken of his capacity for self-management.
In making orders affecting the defendant, I record that, as presently advised, I incline to the view that, with the continued nurturing care provided by his parents, he may be likely, in the not too distant future, to be able to manage his own affairs. If and when that occurs, the management orders made today can, and should, be revoked without unnecessary delay.
