BELLE-McSWEENEY versus NEEDHAM & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I am dealing with an application by the plaintiff to transfer these proceedings to the Family Court of Australia. 
OUTLINE OF FACTS 
The basic facts are set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts, which was made an exhibit in these proceedings, and which is as follows: . The plaintiff and first defendant were married on 17 December 1988 and obtained a decree nisi of dissolution of marriage in the Family Court of Australia, Brisbane Registry, on 5 October 1994.
 . Proceedings were commenced by the plaintiff for property settlement (pursuant to [section 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s79.html) of the [Family Law Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) (Cth)) in the Family Court of Australia, Sydney Registry (Proceedings No.SY 8744/95) on 3 October 1995.
 . The proceedings were fixed for final hearing.
 . On 11 October 1996, the second defendant sought and was granted leave to intervene in the Family Court proceedings and on the same day His Honour Justice Ellis transferred the proceedings to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
 . The proceedings as between the first and second defendants concerned, inter alia: the Will of the late Ailsa Ivor Needham dated 5 July 1983; the beneficial ownership of a property known as 54 Fairfax Road, Bellevue Hill; an order for provision pursuant to the [Family Provision Act 1982](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) in favour of the second defendant out of the Estate of late Ailsa Ivor Needham.
 . The section 79 [Family Law Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) claim could not be determined as between the plaintiff and the first defendant until the proceedings as between the first and second defendants were determined (that is, until the "property" of the parties was first identified).
 . The proceedings as between the first and second defendants has been determined finally and the only issue remaining in the proceedings is the [section 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s79.html) [Family Law Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) claim for property adjustment as between the plaintiff and first defendant.

It is clear that the resolution of the application by the plaintiff wife for a property settlement under the Family Law required determination of what assets were owned by the first defendant/husband. The second defendant, a sister of the first defendant, had commenced proceedings in the Equity Division in 1989, claiming that certain assets in the name of the first defendant were held on trust, and also claiming an order against him concerning those assets under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/).

When the second defendant sought to intervene in the Family Court proceedings, the plaintiff/wife opposed the order for transfer to the Supreme Court.

After the transfer to the Supreme Court, it appears that Windeyer, J.
dismissed an application that these proceedings be heard together with the proceedings, and stood these proceedings over generally. The 1989 proceedings have been finalised, and nothing else of significance has happened in these proceedings in this Court.

The second defendant consents to the transfer back to the Family Court, on the basis that no order for costs is sought against her.

In relation to Agreed Fact No.7, it seems to me that it may not be entirely correct, in that the second defendant is still a party to the proceedings. In order that it be entirely correct that the only remaining issue is between the plaintiff and the first defendant, in my opinion it will be necessary to remove the second defendant as a party to the proceedings; and that may possibly involve a question of costs.

RELEVANT LEGISLATION 
The question before me involves some consideration of [ss.5(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html), [7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s7.html), [9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) and [13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s13.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/). Those provisions are as follows: (1) Where - a proceeding (in this subsection referred to as the "relevant proceeding") is pending in the Supreme Court; and it appears to the Supreme Court that - the relevant proceeding arises out of, or is related to, another proceeding pending in the Federal Court or the Family Court and it is more appropriate that the relevant proceeding be determined by the Federal Court or the Family Court; having regard to - whether, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, apart from this Act and any law of the Commonwealth or another State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction and apart from any accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court or the Family Court, the relevant proceeding or a substantial part of the relevant proceeding would have been incapable of being instituted in the Supreme Court and capable of being instituted in the Federal Court or the Family Court; the extent to which, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the matters for determination in the relevant proceeding are matters arising under or involving questions as to the application, interpretation or validity of a law of the Commonwealth and not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court apart from this Act and any law of the Commonwealth or another State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction; and the interests of justice, it is more appropriate that the relevant proceedings be determined by the Federal court or the Family Court, as the case may be; or it is otherwise in the interests of justice that the relevant proceeding be determined by the Federal Court or the Family Court, the Supreme Court shall transfer the relevant proceeding to the Federal Court or the Family Court, as the case may be.
 (1) An appeal shall not be instituted from a decision of a single judge of the Federal Court or the Family Court to the Full Court of the Supreme Court.

An appeal shall not be instituted from the Federal Court or the Family Court to the other of those courts.

Where it appears that the only matters for determination in a proceeding by way of an appeal from a decision of a single judge of the Supreme Court are matters other than matters arising under an Act specified in the Schedule to the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) of the Commonwealth, that proceeding shall be instituted only in, and shall be determined only by, the Full Court of the Supreme Court.

Subject to subsections (6) and (7), where it appears that a matter for determination in a proceeding to which subsection (5) applies) us a matter arising under an Act specified in the Schedule referred to in subsection (3), that proceeding shall be instituted only in, and shall be determined only by - the Full Court of the Federal Court or of the Family Court, as the case requires; or with special leave of the High Court, the High Court.

A proceeding by way of an appeal from a decision of a judge of a State Family Court, being a proceeding involving the determination of - a matter arising under an Act specified in the Schedule referred to in subsection (3); and another matter, may be dealt with as if no matter for determination in the proceeding were a matter arising under an Act specified in that Schedule.

Where - the Full Court of the Supreme Court commences to hear a proceeding by way of an appeal; and before the Court determines the proceeding, it appears to the Court that the proceeding is a proceeding to which subsection (4) applies, the Court shall, unless the interest of justice require that the Court proceed to determine the proceeding, transfer the proceeding to the Full Court of the Federal Court or of the Family Court, as the case requires.

Where the Full Court of the Supreme Court - determines a proceeding to which subsection (4) applies as mentioned in subsection (6); or through inadvertence, determines a proceeding to which subsection (4) applies, nothing in this section invalidates the decision of that Court.
 The Supreme Court - may exercise jurisdiction (whether original or appellate) conferred on that court by a provision of this Act or of a law of the Commonwealth or a State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction; and may hear and determine a proceeding transferred to that court under such a provision.
 . An appeal does not lie form a decision of a court - in relation to the transfer or removal of a proceeding under this Act; or as to which rules of evidence and procedure are to be applied pursuant to [section 11(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s11.html) 
SUBMISSIONS 
Counsel for each party has provided a written outline of submissions, which I will leave with the papers.

Mr. Freeman for the plaintiff submitted that, notwithstanding the prohibition of appeal in [s.13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s13.html), there was nothing in the Act which prevented a proceeding which was previously transferred to a court from being transferred back to the court from which it was transferred. An application pursuant to [s.5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html) is interlocutory, and further interlocutory applications can be made where there has been a material change of circumstances. In the present case, the requirements of [s.5(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html) and s.[5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html)(1)(b)(iii) are met. The only remaining matter in issue is the application for property settlement, a matter in which the Family Court has special expertise: see
Lambert v. Dean [(1989) 13 Fam.LR 285] at 287.
Mr. Freeman also referred me to Jackson v. John Fairfax & Sons [(1988) FLR 145], Blake v. Norris [(1990) 20 NSWLR 300], and
Bankinvest AG v. A. Seabrook [(1988) 14 NSWLR 711] at 730D.

Mr. Aitken submitted that, these proceedings having been transferred to this
Court, [s.9(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) required this Court to hear and determine it. There was no longer a proceeding pending in the Supreme Court, within [s.5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html), except as a matter which [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) required the Court to hear and dispose of. The whole thrust of the Act was to ensure that one Court hear and determine everything. This was confirmed by the provision concerning appeals: [s.7(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s7.html) showed that it was intended that the Supreme Court deal with Family Court matters, as it provided that appeals from Supreme Court decisions on such matters should go to the Full Family Court.

Mr. Aitken also submitted that, once a matter was wholly transferred to the
Supreme Court, the jurisdiction the Supreme Court exercised was State jurisdiction: see Re Wilcox [(1996) 137 ALR 47] at 67.
Accordingly, it became a "State matter" within the Act. Mr. Aitken submitted that, if this Court now attempted to transfer the proceedings back to the
Family Court, the ability of the Family Court to deal with it would depend upon the validity of provisions purporting to invest State jurisdiction in a
Federal court. Such an attempt was invalid: the decision of the statutory majority in Gould v. Brown (1998) 26 ACSR 317 was wrong.

Finally, Mr. Atiken submitted that there was no reason of justice why the proceedings should be re-transferred to the Family Court.

DECISION 
In my opinion, this Court does have jurisdiction to re-transfer this matter to the Family Court. I accept that applications for transfer of proceedings are interlocutory applications, and that a proceeding transferred from one court to another may be transferred back to the original court. However, in my opinion, the ordinary rule of practice in relation to interlocutory applications would apply, so that such a re-transfer would generally be available only if there were a material change of circumstances since the original application, or the discovery of new material which could not reasonably have been put before the Court on the original application for transfer: cf Brimaud v. Honeysett Instant Printing, McLelland, J., 19/9/88,
Ritchie's Supreme Court Procedure, Vol.II, p.8593. In my opinion, it would be a material change of circumstance if all the issues involving the second defendant had now been resolved, so that the only outstanding issue was the contest between the plaintiff/wife and the first defendant/husband.
Furthermore, in my opinion, in that circumstance, the special expertise of the
Family Court to deal with that kind of dispute would justify the exercise of discretion in favour of transferring the matter back to the Family Court.

I do not accept Mr. Aitken's submission that [s.9(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) requires this Court to hear and determine the whole matter. The section states that this Court "may" hear and determine it, and in my opinion, the word "may" in that section does not mean "shall".

Furthermore, I do not think this matter raises the problem considered in
Gould v. Brown. If the proceedings are transferred back to the Family Court, the Family Court will have its ordinary jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, and will not require any jurisdiction supported by the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/).

As noted earlier, I am not entirely satisfied that the only outstanding issue is the dispute between the plaintiff/wife and the first defendant/husband.
Before transferring the matter back to the Family Court, I think there needs to be an order removing the second defendant from the proceedings, and unless there is some objection to my making that order, I would propose to make it.
If any party has any application to make concerning costs in relation to any such order, I will give them an opportunity to make such application. Subject to that, I propose to make the order sought by the plaintiff to transfer the proceedings back to the Family Court.
