JUDGMENT: 
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
NEWMAN AJ 
MONDAY 26 FEBRUARY 2001 /00 - CICERO HERRING versus ALWYN WRIGHT 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: Before the Court as the substantive proceedings is a document, "Amend Summons", which claims orders pursuant to <case> of [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/index.html#p15a) of the [Crimes Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) and pursuant to <case> of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act, .
 As part of the complex documents which constitute the matter, filed under the heading "Amend Summons" of this Court is a document headed "Request to
State a Case" in which reference is made to the failure, no doubt of the
Magistrate, in not allowing a judicial or procedural fairness hearing to the plaintiff in these proceedings.
 A number of documents have been handed up to me during the course of today's hearing, including a number from the plaintiff, which make it plain that the plaintiff, in fact, is seeking to appeal to this Court on the basis that, in
July, August and October 2000, the plaintiff was denied natural justice and procedural fairness by Magistrate O'Shane in proceedings brought by him against the defendant in the Local Court.
 The respondent to the appeal, the defendant in this matter, has sought to strike out the proceedings on the basis that they are incompetent and, in a relevant sense, frivolous.
 Let me say at once, that the matter received some ventilation before Greg
James J on 11 December 2000. On that occasion, his Honour, having identified the nature of the proceedings and the manner in which the plaintiff, Mr Cicero
Herring, wished to put them, granted an adjournment to the him to put before this Court such evidence as might possibly show some adequate basis for the proceedings he seeks to bring.
 Let me also say that, in the almost three months which have passed, the plaintiff before this Court has not done that.
 The proceedings now before the Court, because of the date of the hearing, are governed by <case> of the [Justices Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) (as amended).
 The plaintiff sought to rely upon <case> of the [Interpretation Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) to revivify the mode of appeal formerly used in bringing appeals from magistrates before this Court, namely a stated case. Even in the form in which the plaintiff attempted to bring the case before this Court, it would have been an invalid exercise in the past because this Court does not state a case, the case is stated by the Magistrate to this Court.
 Be that as it may, <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) is plain in its terms. It is in no way affected by <case> of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/). Because of the date of the hearing before the learned Magistrate, <case> is the statutory provision which governs the conduct of appeals before this Court from Magistrates.
 In my view, the failure of the plaintiff/appellant to obtain evidence of the type suggested to him by Greg James J on 11 December 2000, and his persistence in maintaining a procedural situation which was hopeless, is indicative to me that to grant, as he now seeks, a further adjournment, would be futile.
 Accordingly, I refuse the plaintiff's application for an adjournment of these proceedings. I find that the notice of motion brought by the defendant should succeed and, accordingly, I dismiss the proceedings as failing to demonstrate any reasonable cause of action. I dismiss these proceedings with costs.
 I have considered the question of indemnity costs as the matter was raised in submissions put forward on behalf of the defendant. However, I am of the view that, as the plaintiff is unrepresented, justice demands that, in the circumstances, the ordinary costs order is the one that should be made and I so order.
