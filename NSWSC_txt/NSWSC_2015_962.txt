Environment Court.

JUDGMENT
These proceedings between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants raise for consideration the validity of various acts of the local council in relation to the premises the subject of the claim and notices have been issued by the council in respect of the use of the premises. The Defendants were all officers of the Council.
By Notice of Motion filed on 1 July 2015 the Plaintiff sought to join the local council itself as the Fourth Defendant in the proceedings. An order was also sought that pending the determination of the validity of a particular notice referred to in the Plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim the Respondents (by which is meant, the Defendants) be restrained from acting further on the notice or issuing any of the other orders proposed in the Amended Statement of Claim.
The Motion was listed for hearing before me on Wednesday 22 July. The parties have settled the Motion and by Consent Orders they propose that amendments should be made to the Plaintiffs' Summons and Statement of Claim. The Consent Orders also provide for an order to be made under [s149B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s149b.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) that the proceedings be transferred to and heard in the Land and Environment Court. Such an order is not made by consent but is made if the Court is satisfied of the matters in that section.
I am satisfied from reading the Statement of Claim in the matter that the issues to be determined by the parties are more appropriately dealt with by the Land and Environment Court. They involve the sort of issues that that Court deals with on a daily basis.
One of the claims made in the Statement of Claim is that there be damages against the Defendants for misfeasance in public office. Ordinarily the Land and Environment Court would not have jurisdiction to deal with that matter, however [s149E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s149e.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) gives to the transferee court all of the jurisdiction of the transferor court.
It is appropriate therefore to make the order for transfer contained in the documents signed by the legal representatives of the parties. I will make the other orders by consent.
The listing on 22 July 2015 is vacated.
