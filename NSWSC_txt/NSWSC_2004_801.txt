WHITE J  
Wednesday, 18 August 2004  /04 DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION versus LENCAL EXCAVATIONS PTY LTD (in Liquidation)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: The background to these proceedings is set out in my reasons of 10 August 2004 for declining to make the orders sought pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) on that day and for standing over the proceedings to today. I will not repeat that background.  There were essentially four matters of concern which I then had. The first was that the interlocutory process had not been served upon the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission. The second was that I was concerned that notice be given to the three creditors who are described as "lessor creditors". The third was that I was not satisfied with what was then the corroboration by an external accountant or liquidator of the evidence given by
Mr Johnston as to the financial position of the company. The fourth matter of concern was that the injection of funds which the applicant and his wife proposed to make to the company would be by debt finance, rather than by subscription for capital, albeit that they agreed to provide undertakings to postpone their claims to those of other creditors.  The proposal has now been amended. The evidence filed today addresses each of the concerns which I had. Each of the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission, Westpac Banking Corporation, Orix Australia Corporation and CBFC
Limited has indicated that it does not oppose the application. I have already indicated the position of the petitioning creditor and of the liquidator.  There is additional evidence filed by the liquidator, Mr Nicols, and by Mr
Holliday, to verify the financial information which has been provided. In addition, the applicant and Carole Ann Johnson have offered an undertaking to the Court to pay any creditor of the defendant company, other than a creditor whose liability arises under a lease commercial hire purchase agreement or commercial equipment loan agreement, whose debt has not been disclosed in a list of creditors.  They also have given an undertaking to the Court to cause 290,000 ordinary shares in the defendant company to be issued to them and, in consideration of that issue, the debt owed to them by the defendant company will be reduced by $290,000. The effect of that will be that the assets of the company will exceed its liabilities.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to terminate the winding-up of the defendant upon the various undertakings which I will note.  I note the undertakings to the Court by each of Leonard Barry Johnston and
Carole Anne Johnston that:  
They will pay to any creditor of the defendant, other than any creditor whose liability arises under a lease commercial hire purchase agreement or commercial equipment loan agreement, whose debt at 17 June 2004 has not been disclosed in the defendant's list of creditors, the amount of the debt or any other amount properly due, or found to be due, to that creditor;  they will cause to have 290,000 ordinary shares in the defendant issued to them for consideration that the debt owed to them by the defendant will be reduced by $290,000.  I also note the undertaking to the Court of Jeffrey Denham Chard, solicitor, forthwith to pay cheques held by him, payable to the Australian Taxation
Office in the amount of $104,046.24 and to Mr Brian Holliday in the amount of $9,986.50, to the respective payees.  Upon those undertakings, I order that, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), the winding-up of Lencal Excavations Pty Limited (in liquidation) (ACN 078580257) be terminated forthwith.  I make no order as to costs.  These orders may be entered forthwith.  I return the exhibits.
