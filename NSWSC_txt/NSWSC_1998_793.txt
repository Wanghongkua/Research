KEVIN FOSTER & ANOR versus MARK FRASSETTO & ANOR 
CA 40922/97 March 1998 
Meagher JA, Sheller JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: In this matter we are of the view that the summons should be dismissed with costs. 
This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of Mr Justice
Rolfe. The Court can see no error in his Honour's reasoning. The only point agitated is an asserted question of law, but in fact what the arbitrator found was a pure question of fact, and in those circumstances we do not think we should intervene.

Summons dismissed with costs.
