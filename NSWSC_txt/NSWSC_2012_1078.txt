JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
By application made under [s 477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), Mr Robert Boyce Moodie in his capacity as liquidator ("Liquidator") of Rivercorp Pty Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) (in liq) ("Rivercorp") and Rivercorp seeks orders approving retrospectively the Liquidator's entry into costs agreements and associated retainers with two firms of solicitors in relation to claims against third parties seeking recovery of payments made by Rivercorp under [s 588FA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588fa.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Alternatively, the Liquidator and Rivercorp seek a declaration under [s 1322(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that the costs agreements and associated retainers are not invalid by reason of the Liquidator's not having obtained prior approval to enter into such retainers under [s 477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).
The application is supported by affidavits of the Liquidator dated 27 June 2012 and 11 July 2012. The Liquidator retained the first firm of solicitors to advise and conduct the relevant proceedings in May 2010. He retained the second firm in August 2011 in respect of several claims in which the first firm was unable to accept instructions by reason of conflicts. Both firms accepted instructions on the basis that payment was contingent on the recovery of funds. The Liquidator's evidence is that he was without funds in the liquidation and could not have retained those firms other than on that basis. His evidence is that he was not then aware of a requirement for approval of the costs agreements and retainers under [s 477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).
The Liquidator gives evidence of having previously retained the two firms in similar work and of his confidence that they have the necessary skill and expertise. The evidence before me indicates that the Liquidator, with the assistance of those firms, has in fact achieved recoveries well in excess of the costs incurred to date. The Liquidator also gives evidence that he is familiar with the rates usually charged by its solicitors for this type of work and the retainer agreements in evidence show rates which are reasonable on their face. The Liquidator also gives evidence that he is satisfied that the amounts invoiced by the respective firms were reasonably charged. There is no reason to doubt his assessment of these matters.
The application is brought under [s 477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) which provides that, except with the Court's approval or the approval of a committee of inspection or a resolution of creditors, a liquidator must not enter into an agreement on a company's behalf if the term of that agreement may end, or obligations of a party to the agreement may be discharged by performance, more than three months after entry into the agreement. The obligations of the liquidator and the solicitors under the retainer agreements may be discharged more than three months after entry into those agreements by reason of the time likely to be required to complete the remaining proceedings.
In granting approval for the entry into such an agreement, the Court is not concerned with matters of commercial judgment but is concerned to be satisfied that the entry into the agreement is a proper exercise of power and not ill advised or improper on the part of the liquidator: Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd versus Vince <case>; [(2000) 35 ACSR 167] that a further order under [s 1322](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is not necessary where an order approving an agreement is made under [s 477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) with retrospective effect.
There is, on the facts which I have summarised above, no reason to think that the entry into the costs agreements and retainers with the respective firms of solicitors is not a proper exercise of the Liquidator's powers. The rates involved and other terms are not unusual and a provision in one of the costs agreements for an uplift of fees is authorised by [s 324](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/s324.html) of the [Legal Profession Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/) . The Court's role, as I have noted above, is not to second guess the Liquidator's judgment as to the experience and qualification of the solicitors retained and there would be no reason to doubt that judgment on the evidence before me. There is nothing to suggest that the Liquidator's entry into these agreements is not a proper exercise of his powers or is ill-advised or is in any way inappropriate.
Accordingly, I will make the orders sought under [s 477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) approving the entry into the relevant agreements with retrospective effect and there is no need for further orders to be made under [s 1322](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).
The liquidator also sought confidentiality orders in respect of documents which were tendered in the proceedings. I was satisfied that a confidentiality order should be made in respect of those documents, for the reasons put by counsel in submissions. The Court's power to make such an order in an appropriate case is well established: Onefone Australia Pty Ltd versus One.Tel Ltd <case>; (2010) 78 ACSR at [5]. I made such an order during the hearing of the matter before me.
The liquidator seeks an order that the costs of the application be costs in the liquidation. I am satisfied that this is a proper case for such an order. 
Accordingly, I make the following orders: 
An order pursuant to [s (2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) approving retrospectively the entry by the liquidator of the second plaintiff of: 
The costs agreement with Polczynski Lawyers dated 7 May 2010, retaining
Polczynski Lawyers to act or to continue to act as the solicitors for the
First Plaintiff and the Second Plaintiff in relation to claims for recovery of payments made by the Second Plaintiff pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588.html) FA of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); and 
The costs agreement with Streeter Lawyers dated 15 June 2012, as clarified by the letter dated 11 July 2012 from Streeter Lawyers to the First Plaintiff, retaining Streeter Lawyers to act or continue to act as the solicitors for the
First Plaintiff and the Second Plaintiff in relation to claims for recovery of payments made by the Second Plaintiff pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588.html) FA of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).
The liquidator's costs of and incidental to this application be costs in the liquidation.
