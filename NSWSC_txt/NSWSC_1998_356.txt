THE NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION versus EDWIN DAVIES /91 June 1998 
Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: By a Further Amended Summons filed in court with my leave on the 10th of June 1998 the Plaintiff seeks the following orders:- 
An order pursuant to [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown all the interests in property of
Edwin Davies that are subject to the restraining order in force under [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
An order pursuant to [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) that
Edwin Davies pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived from illegal activities of Edwin Davies that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order.
Such further or other orders as the Court thinks fit.
Costs.

In relation to that Summons, after hearing from the Defendant who was unrepresented, I decided to continue with the application in paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 but to stand over generally the order sought in paragraph 2.

There was also before me a Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the Defendant seeking the following relief:-
That the whole of the property, being real estate known as 36 Hewlett
Street, Waverley being the whole of the land in Certificate of Title Volume Folio 22 be excluded from the Order of this Honourable Court made on 19
December 1991 and entered on 20 December 1991, be excluded from the provisions of the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990.

It was agreed that I should hear both of these matters together and it is convenient in this Judgment to deal first of all with the application made by the Defendant.

The background to this matter is that on the 19th of December 1991 this Court made an order pursuant to [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) restraining all of the interests in property of Edwin Davies and, in particular, his interest in 36 Hewlett Street, Waverley, registered in the name of Edwin Richards and Annette Richards as joint tenants. It is necessary to state that on the 13th of June 1989 the Defendant in this case changed his name from Davies to Richards and since that date has said he prefers to be known by the name of Richards. However, for the purpose of this Judgment I will continue to refer to him in his name of Davies.

The Defendant's application is made under [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), the relevant provisions of which are as follows:- "(1) If an assets forfeiture order: has been applied for but not made - a person whose interest in property might be subject to the order if made, or has been made - a person whose interest in property was forfeited by the order, may apply to the Supreme Court for an order (in this section called an exclusion order) excluding the interest from the operation of the assets forfeiture order or any relevant restraining order.

The Supreme Court must not make the exclusion order applied for unless it is proved that it is more probable than not that the interest in property to which the application relates is not illegally acquired property." 
The issue therefore in respect of the Defendant's motion is whether he has proved that it is more probable than not that his interest in 36 Hewlett
Street, Waverley is not illegally acquired property. The meaning of "illegally acquired property" is set out in s. 9 of the Act and reference also has to be made to s. 4 in connection with the meaning of "illegal activity".

The Defendant relied upon an affidavit sworn by him on the 15th of February in support of his application and he was cross-examined by Mr Temby QC, counsel for the Plaintiff, upon that Affidavit.

In his Affidavit the Defendant says that he and his wife bought 36 Hewlett
Street on the 15th of November 1989 for $245,000. He says the purchase was financed as follows:- 
Mortgage to Westpac ... ... $ 87,000.00 
Proceeds from sale of Thomas Street property $102,183.84 
Children's money ... ... ... $ 53,815.51 
Say: $237,000.00 
He went on to say in paragraph 6 of his Affidavit:- "In addition, there was a 5 percent deposit of about $12,000.00. The deposit was from our own funds." 
The Defendant further said that in 1979 he and his wife had purchased Unit 1, St Thomas Street, Clovelly for $52,000.00 and they sold it in 1989 for $152,000.00. In paragraph 11 of his Affidavit he said this:- "I say that no illegal funds were used to purchase either the Thomas Street property or the Waverley 
Street property." 
The evidence in this case focused on that assertion. The basic thrust of the case for the Plaintiff was that on the basis of the information contained in the Defendant's tax returns for various years and other documents showing his commitments, the shortfall was such that the difference must have been met by the Defendant from income or money coming within the definition of illegal activity. Other factors in the case were also relied upon to which it will be necessary to make some reference.

The position as disclosed by various taxation returns is as follows:- 
Year ending June 1983 - taxable income $12,437.00 (Exhibit 10) 
Year ending June 1984 - no tax payable (Exhibit 11) 
Year ending June 1985 - no tax payable (Exhibit 11) 
Year ending June 1986 - taxable income $ 8,918.00 (Exhibit 12) 
Year ending June 1987 - taxable income $ 6,926.00 
Year ending June 1988 - taxable income $13,195.00 
Year ending June 1989 - taxable income $15,912.00 (Exhibit 14) 
Year ending June 1990 - taxable income $24,828.00 (Exhibit 9) 
The Defendant accepted in evidence that the tax threshold for the years ending
June 1984 and June 1985 was $4,595.00. He also said in evidence that he had paid tax in respect of the various years although he could not recollect the precise amount.

On the 3rd of September 1987 the Defendant applied for a personal loan to the
National Australia Bank and the documents relating to that application became
Exhibit 23. On the page headed "Loan Information" the Defendant accepted that he was the source of the information recorded under the heading on the left hand side of the page for "monthly budget", particularly in relation to the outgoings. The figures there total $2,239.00 per month. The Defendant said in evidence that the figure of $850.00 a month for general living and entertainment was exaggerated. I do not see why he would have any reason to exaggerate that figure as it was in his interest to minimise, if anything, his outgoings to increase his chances of getting a loan and I did not believe his evidence that the figure of $850.00 was an exaggerated figure. That amounts to an annual figure for outgoings of $26,868.00. The Defendant was also referred to the figure in the monthly budget showing a net monthly profit of $3,750.00.
He did not say anything to indicate he was not responsible for either providing that figure to the Bank or causing it to be provided. That figure gives an annual taxable income of $45,000.00. Such a figure is completely at variance with the tax return for the year ending June 1987, showing a taxable income of $6,926.00 and the tax return for the year ending June 1988, showing a taxable income of $13,195.00, both of which the Defendant told me were correct.

There was other material before me showing that the sums due in respect in particular of the two mortgages and in respect of the Bankcard loan were being paid regularly. Further, at no time did the Defendant seek to say that he was not paying the debts identified and put to him. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the monthly outgoing figure of $2,239.00 is reliable and, adopting the most favourable construction on the figures in favour of the Defendant and disregarding any tax which he says he paid, there is a shortfall in relation to 1987 of at least $13,000.00. By a shortfall I am referring to the difference between his annual outgoings as previously described and his taxable income as shown on the tax returns. I am further satisfied on the evidence before me that with appropriate adjustments over the years in respect of which tax returns are before me, namely the years ending June 1983 to June , that there was a difference between expenditure and declared income of a similar annual amount.

While acknowledging that there was a demonstrable difference, the Defendant was not prepared to acknowledge the extent of it. However, on the evidence before me, I am satisfied it was to the extent I have indicated. When asked to account for how he met such difference the Defendant said he either borrowed money from his wife's stepmother or he used a loan of some $7,000.00 from his sister. In his evidence the Defendant had accepted that during 1980 he had reduced his overall indebtedness to his wife's stepmother. The amount of $7,000.00 would do no more than bridge part of the gap for one of the years under consideration.

I am satisfied in the light of the above and of having seen the Defendant give his evidence before me that he was not being truthful in relation to the moneys available to him and, accordingly, during those years he had moneys available from some undisclosed and undeclared source.

The case of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) v. Jeffery
A Crim R 310 and, on appeal, at 1995 79A Crim R 514 is clear authority in my judgment that property acquired by the use of funds made available to a person by reason of taxation offences such as understating income will have been indirectly derived from an unlawful activity.

Accordingly, I find that in connection with paying the mortgage on the Thomas
Street property it is probable that the Defendant used funds which should have been declared in his taxation returns but were not. It is not necessary for me in the light of that finding to go on to consider whether such funds were acquired by him as the result of distinct criminal activity although I do say that I am not satisfied that they were not so acquired. In expressing that view I take account of the Defendant's antecedents and the material relating to offences of fraud in respect of which he was sentenced in 1991. I also take into account the Defendant's concession before me that he had asked his employer to exaggerate the period for which he had been employed when providing support for the Defendant's applications to banks for loans. The
Defendant denied having engaged in any dishonest activity other than matters of which he had been convicted. I did not believe him.

It follows from the above that the Defendant has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon him to prove to me that it is more probable than not that his interest in 36 Hewlett Street, Waverley is not illegally acquired property. I am not able to say on the balance of probabilities that it was not illegally acquired.

I therefore dismiss the Defendant's Notice of Motion seeking an exclusion order under [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).

I now turn to consider the relief sought by the Plaintiff in paragraph 1 of its further Amended Summons.

I am satisfied by reason of the Affidavit of Mark W. Seagrave sworn on the th of June 1998 and filed with leave before me that a restraining order is in force in relation to the Defendant's interests in:- Hewlett Street, Waverley, registered in the name of Edwin Richards and
Annette Richards as joint tenants; $4,600 in cash seized from Edwin Davies by Police at 5 Hodgson Street,
Glenbrook on 1 October 1991; 
Accordingly, I make the following orders:-
The Defendant's Notice of Motion is dismissed.
The Defendant's interest in real estate known as 36 Hewlett Street,
Waverley being the land in Certificate of Title Volume 6511 Folio 22 be forfeited to and vested in the Crown.
The Defendant's interest in $4,600.00 in cash seized from the Defendant by
Police at 5 Hodgson Street, Glenbrook on 1 October 1991 be forfeited to and vested in the Crown.
The Defendant pay to the Plaintiff the Plaintiff's costs of these proceedings.
