Judgment  Objections were taken by the defendants to paragraphs in the statements of W
Mackay, J C Gillick and S Mustonen.  The transcript of argument and written submissions from both parties makes plain that most of the issues were covered in the judgment <case> given by the Court on 27 June 2001 relating to the evidence of Mr Ling.  I see no to revisit that judgment. The issue concerns the proper application of the principles set out in that judgment.  I publish the Court rulings in relation to each of the objections.

I certify that paragraphs 1 - 4  are a true copy of the reasons  for judgment herein of the 
Hon. Justice Einstein  given on 25 October 2001
