REGINA versus JON LESLIE BAARTMAN (NO. 3) /93 October 1998 
Dunford J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Criminal Division 
JUDGMENT: On admissibility of the last paragraph on p 1 of the letter from Mr R Finlayson. See p 128 of the transcript.) 
HIS HONOUR: Yesterday Mr Di Suvero, counsel for the accused, at pp 101 and 102 of the transcript cross-examined the witness, Nicholas Bicanic, as to what information he had asked his solicitor, Mr Ray Finlayson, to pass to the police and drew his attention to the letter that Mr Finlayson had written to the police, MFI 5, and in particular he drew the witness' attention to the first two paragraphs on p 2, including the passage, "and instead arranged for the Crofts brothers to do it (the shooting)". 
He then asked the witness whether having read that passage in the letter he wished to change his evidence and whether he agreed he told the solicitor to tell the police that the person concerned arranged for the Crofts brothers to do the shooting. The witness replied he did not wish to change his evidence.

These questions and answers were capable of, and in my opinion listening to it at the time, did justify an inference that when the witness first approached the police through his solicitor he made no reference to the accused being involved in the shooting and therefore was inconsistent with the evidence he had given in-chief about the conversations he had overheard and the guns he had seen at the relevant unit in Waterloo in the very early hours of Tuesday February and at about seven to 7.30 p.m. on that date.

The Crown, therefore, in re-examination wishes to attempt to re-establish the witness' credit on this issue by getting into evidence the contents of the last paragraph on p 1 of the same letter where the witness directly implicated the accused by name.

In my view, the Crown is entitled to correct the misapprehension that would be otherwise available as to the information initially given to the police, to correct the impression that on this issue at least the witness had changed his version, and to rebut any suggestion that the implication of the accused was a matter of recent invention.

Other objections have been taken to the effect it is hearsay, but in my view it is not. The witness was being cross-examined on what he told his solicitor to tell the police and the evidence, in my view, is admissible as re- establishing credit pursuant to [s108](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).
