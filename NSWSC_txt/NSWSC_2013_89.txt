EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
This is an application by the Chief Commissioner of State Revenue for directions for the filing of expert evidence under the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), [Part 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p31), r 31.19, and for an order for disclosure before he puts on his evidence.

Expert evidence 
The Chief Commissioner wishes to adduce evidence from Mr Hoffman and Mr Bryant. He proposes that the experts give evidence to update the evidence that they gave in the previous proceedings before the Court, Leda Manorstead Pty Ltd versus Chief Commissioner of State Revenue  <case>; [(2010) 79 NSWLR 724], opposition was withdrawn. But as the solicitors for Leda Manorstead said in their written submissions in reply, the approval of the Court is still required. It is appropriate, therefore, that the Court should deal with the issues initially raised by Leda Manorstead in deciding whether to allow the proposed expert evidence. 
First, it was submitted that the articulation by the Chief Commissioner of the need for the evidence is so general one cannot know what expert evidence is required. The matters the expert evidence is to address are identified as being reasonably required in order to assist the Court by providing evidence about what the land is used for and the scale and intensity of the uses, as well as the characteristics of the Leda Manorstead's cattle operation and how that operation is conducted. 
A number of considerations that I observed in the previous proceedings are, it is submitted, required for determination in these proceedings as well. For example, the profitability of the cattle grazing, the percentage of the land committed to grazing, the percentage of the land agriculturally suitable for grazing and the percentage not usable or needing rehabilitation, the percentage of land committed to other uses, the level of expenditure of competing uses, the level of commitment, both financial and in terms of labour, by Leda Manorstead to the cattle operation compared with the level of commitment to other uses of the land, and the value of the herd as against the value of other expenditure relating to other uses. 
It is submitted that Mr Hoffman will be able to assist the Court by providing a report on whether the operation is conducted in a way similar to or different from other commercial cattle operations, what percentage of land is grazing land, whether the cattle operation is profitable and if not why not, and what remedial steps could be undertaken to improve profits, the number of cattle able to graze on the land in the present state of the soil, whether pasture improvement is required and if so over what portion of the land, whether Leda Manorstead has taken steps to improve pasture, the fertility of the soil and the likelihood of productive pasture in the future, and what is the indicia of a commercial cattle grazing enterprise with the purpose of making a profit. 
It is submitted that Mr Bryant would look at dominant use in terms of income and expenditure for cattle trading contrasted with income and expenditure for development, whether the cattle operation is making a profit as well as how the land is treated in accounts. In this regard it is submitted that Leda Manorstead has indicated that the land is treated as trading stock but it has not provided financial accounts to that effect. It is submitted that this is something that the Court will need in terms of evaluating the use of the land. 
Section 10AA(1) and [s 10AA(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s10aa.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act 1956](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/) (Management Act) are in the following terms: "10AA Exemption for land used for primary production 
Land that is rural land is exempt from taxation if it is land used for primary production.

Land that is not rural land is exempt from taxation if it is land used for primary production and that use of the land: has a significant and substantial commercial purpose or character, and is engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous or repetitive basis (whether or not a profit is actually made)."
The concepts of commerciality and profitability in [s 10AA(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s10aa.html) and <case>(b) of the Management Act are so broad that it is difficult to identify with great specificity the relevant evidence. The itemisation to which I have referred is, in my view, sufficient. Prima facie, there is no reason for the Court to depart from the leave granted in the earlier proceedings and the terms of that leave. 
Leda Manorstead had submitted that the evidence proposed to be adduced is directed to objective current and likely future profitability of cattle grazing under <case>(b) of the Management Act and, it is submitted, that it raised subjective issues.
Leda Manorstead had argued that the reasoning in Ashleigh Developments Pty Ltd versus Chief Commissioner of State Revenue <case> at <case> - <case> at <case> - [52].
I have taken the view that <case>(a) of the Management Act is objective and that <case>(b) is subjective. I said that in Maraya at [77] "Section 10AA(2)(a) is concerned with objective qualities of the use of the land. The words "significant" and "substantial" in <case>(a) are to be construed in their context and by interpreting the phrase "significant and substantial commercial purpose or character" as a whole rather than by adding up linguistic elements of each of the words (Collector of Customs versus Agfa-
Gevaert Ltd <case>; [(1996) 186 CLR 389] at 396-397 quoting R versus Brown [[1996] 1 AC 543] at 561)." 
At [101] I said: "But I add a few words with respect to <case>(b) of the Management Act. It introduces a subjective element into the land use. The primary production use must be engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous or repetitive basis, whether or not a profit is actually made."
But I have also said that the expression of opinion by the taxpayer that the use is for the purpose of profit need not be accepted. At [103] I said: "The court is not bound, however, to accept Mr Giusti's assertion that Maraya engaged in its use of the land for primary production for the purpose of profit."
Since that issue can be explored before the Court, expert evidence on the topic is relevant and in my view admissible.

Disclosure before evidence 
The defendant also seeks an order for disclosure before he puts on his evidence. In Leda Manorstead Pty Ltd versus Chief Commissioner of State Revenue  <case>, I dismissed an earlier application for disclosure before evidence. In that case I brought together all the cases that had dealt with Practice Note SC Eq 11 at cl 4 which provides: "The Court will not make an order for disclosure of documents (disclosure) until the parties to the proceedings have served their evidence, unless there are exceptional circumstances necessitating disclosure."
Since that decision of mine, reference has been made to it in Re Mempoll Pty Ltd, Anakin Pty Ltd and Gold Kings (Australia) Pty Ltd  <case>
And further consideration has been given to the requirement of exceptional circumstances in Ghalloub versus Ghalloub  <case>, Suncorp Metway versus Rider Levett Bucknall  <case>, Re Octaviar Limited and Re Octaviar Administration Pty Ltd <case> I said: "I do not dissent from any of these observations but caution against setting the bar too high. As was said in Kelly (Edward), to be exceptional the circumstance need not be unique or unprecedented or very rare. What is needed is an appraisal of all the circumstances and the context in which the expression must be satisfied. Are there circumstances necessitating disclosure before evidence in the sense that the party's case cannot be put without the disclosure? Are those circumstances exceptional?"
Care must be taken not to deprive a party of access to documents essential to the presentation of its case at an early stage if the interests of justice require it. [Section 56(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) provides: "The overriding purpose of this Act and of rules of court, in their application to a civil dispute or civil proceedings, is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the dispute or proceedings."
The quick and cheap resolution of the real issues should not be allowed to outweigh the just resolution of which the section speaks.
In that case I dismissed an application for disclosure before Leda Manorstead had put on its evidence mainly on the grounds that it was premature, although there were other aspects. 
The evidence put on by Leda Manorstead in this case is limited to the cattle grazing use of the land. It does not deal with other uses. Leda Manorstead does not propose to adduce expert evidence. The need for disclosure at this stage is explained.
It is submitted that the Court will require all relevant documents to factor in its evaluation of the uses of the land. Leda Manorstead has all of those relevant documents wholly within its possession and has not put all of the relevant material into evidence. The experts will require all relevant documents in order to assist them in their task of providing expert reports. 
The principles to be adopted in determining this matter are set out in Yacoub versus Pilkington (Australia) Ltd <case> The statutory requirement for exceptional circumstances in that case concerned the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), [Pt 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p31) r 31.28 that provides that leave should not be granted for an expert report or hospital report, not filed and served in accordance with the rules, to be adduced into evidence in the proceedings unless the Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant the granting of leave. At [66] - [67] Campbell JA, with whom Tobias JA and Handley AJA agreed, said: "Another question of construction concerned 'exceptional circumstances' in r .18(4). In San versus Rumble (No 2) <case> at <case> - [69], I gave consideration to the expression 'exceptional circumstances' in a different statutory context to the present. Without repeating that discussion in full, I shall state such of the conclusions as seem to me applicable in the construction of r 31.18(4).

Exceptional circumstances are out of the ordinary course or unusual, or special, or uncommon. They need not be unique, or unprecedented, or very rare, but they cannot be circumstances that are regularly, or routinely or normally encountered: R versus Kelly (Edward) <case>; [[2000] 1 QB ] (at ).

Exceptional circumstances can exist not only by reference to quantitative matters concerning relative frequency of occurrence, but also by reference to qualitative factors: R versus Buckland <case>; [[2000] WLR 1262]; [[2000] 1 All ER 907] (at ; 912-913).

Exceptional circumstances can include a single exceptional matter, a combination of exceptional factors, or a combination of ordinary factors which, although individually of no particular significance, when taken together are seen as exceptional: Ho versus Professional Services Review Committee
No 295 <case> (at [26]).

In deciding whether circumstances are exceptional within the meaning of a particular statutory provision, one must keep in mind the rationale of that particular statutory provision: R versus Buckland (at 1268; 912-913).

Beyond these general guidelines, whether exceptional circumstances exist depends upon a careful consideration of the facts of the individual case: Awa v Independent News Auckland [[1996] 2 NZLR 184] (at 186).

In the context of r 31.18(4) UCP Rules, any decision about whether there are exceptional circumstances would need to bear in mind the explicit statement of objectives of a court in the management of litigation contained in ss 56-59 [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/)."
The circumstances that are said to be exceptional are that: 
The documents are wholly within the control of Leda Manorstead and its affiliated entities.

Leda Manorstead has not adduced the documents in its evidence that has now closed. The documents sought will assist the Court in weighing up competing uses of the land.

In the previous proceedings the documents that ultimately assisted the
Court were provided by way of notice to produce and subpoena because Leda
Manorstead had not put them in evidence.

The documents sought in this application to a large extent update the documents and information provided in the previous proceedings for the land tax years there in question.

The Chief Commissioner intends briefing experts to opine on Leda
Manorstead's cattle farm operations on the land and to provide financial accounting expert evidence. Without disclosure prior to the filing of evidence there is a real risk that the experts will not have all the necessary documents before them when they provide their reports. As a result the experts will more than likely need to provide supplementary affidavits and/or reports, which will have the consequence of adding expense and delay.

Further, if disclosure is not granted, the Chief Commissioner will need to issue subpoenas to third parties without knowing precisely which parties hold documents relevant to the issues in dispute for the relevant tax year currently before the Court for determination. The Chief Commissioner is only able to speculate as to who the relevant third parties are, based on the previous proceedings where information may no longer be relevant to the 2010 and 2011 land tax years. In this regard an order for disclosure now will minimise expense, delay and inconvenience to the Chief Commissioner, but also to third parties who might otherwise be unnecessarily troubled to search for documents.

The Chief Commissioner is not able to utilise his compulsory powers to access documents or information under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/s72.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/) as the
Court is now seized of the proceedings: Watson versus Federal Commissioner of
Taxation <case>, [(1999) 96 FCR 48], and my decision in James versus Chief Commissioner of State
Revenue (No 2)  <case>, [(2011) 81 NSWLR 267.] 
Taken together, even if one factor alone is insufficient, the factors set out establish that there are exceptional circumstances warranting the making of an order for disclosure at this stage of the proceedings.

Leda Manorstead does not oppose this course; 
In the previous application for disclosure, I anticipated that Leda
Manorstead would put in its evidence some of the material sought by the Chief
Commissioner. That has not happened and so it is now appropriate that the
Chief Commissioner refresh his application.
In my view exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated by the Chief Commissioner. Of particular significance are the factors that the documents are wholly within the control of Leda Manorstead, the Chief Commissioner can no longer use his powers under the [Taxation Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/), [s 72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/s72.html) to compulsorily obtain access to documents, and Leda Manorstead does not oppose the application.
The orders in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Notices of Motion are made. The parties are to post in the Online Court agreed directions to give effect to the orders and if agreement cannot be reached, their proposed directions, including directions as to categories of documents, by Friday 15 February 2013. Unless either party wants to be heard orally, I will determine the matter on the papers. 
It seems to me that even if there had not been opposition at an early stage to the application for leave to adduce expert evidence, there would still have been the necessity for the Court to make the sort of analysis that I have made, and for that reason the order is that the costs of the motions are costs in the cause. 
The matter is stood back into the Online Court.
