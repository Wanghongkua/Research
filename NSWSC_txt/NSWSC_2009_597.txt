JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
PROGRESSIVE LIST 
HARRISON J June 2009 of 2004 Deputy Commissioner of Taxation versus Lesley Frances Robertson 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff claims $211,708.91 from the defendant as penalties imposed under [Part
VI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/index.html#p6)
Div 9 of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) ("the
ITAA") in relation to the non-payment by First Direct Private Security Pty Ltd ("the company") of PAYG deductions from the salary and wages of its employees.
The plaintiff relies upon the fact that the defendant was a director of the company at the relevant time. The defendant denies that she was a director or says that if she was she has a defence to the claim for various reasons. The defendant's cross-claim against her former husband was abandoned and withdrawn.
 
Background According to the ASIC records the defendant was a director of the company for the period from 18 March 1999 to 17 February 2003. Under Div 12 in
Schedule 1 to the [[Taxation Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) ("the
TAA") the company was required to make PAYG deductions from salary and wages paid to its employees. Under Div 16 in Schedule 1 to the TAA, the company as a medium remitter was required to remit the amounts deducted to the Commission of Taxation on a monthly basis, usually by the end of the 21st day of the next month. Between 1 July 2002 and 31 October 2002 the company made PAYG deductions totalling $144,057 from its employees' salary and wages but did not pay the deductions to the Commissioner by the due date.
 [Part
VI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/index.html#p6)
Div 9 of the ITAA imposes a duty on the directors of a company to ensure that the company either meets its obligation under Div 16 to remit each deduction made under Div 12 by the due date or takes other specified remedial action: s
AOB. Non-compliance with the duty results in each director of the company being automatically "liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the company's liability": <case>. By operation of <case> the directors remain under an obligation to bring about compliance with <case> if that section is not complied with on or before the due date.
 The Commissioner is not entitled to recover the penalty without giving written notice to the director setting out the "details of the unpaid amount of the liability" and the options available: <case>. The penalty is then automatically remitted if the company meets its obligations or takes the other remedial action within 14 days after the notice is given: <case>. The giving of a penalty notice is the last chance for a director to bring about compliance with <case> and negate the liability for the penalty that arose on the due date: see Kolistasis versus DCT <case>; <case>.
 The TAA makes the amount of any penalty imposed by [Part
VI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/index.html#p6)
Div 9 of the ITAA a debt due to the Commonwealth payable to the Commissioner and provides that the amount may be recovered at the suit of the Deputy
Commissioner in "a court of competent jurisdiction": s -[5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s5.html)(2) of Schedule 1. The Commissioner alleges that he gave the defendant notice under <case> dated 28 February 2003 before commencing the proceedings covering PAYG deductions made but not remitted by the company for the period from 1 July 2002 to 31 October 2002 in the amount of $144,057. The defendant did not comply with the notice. The Deputy Commissioner then commenced the present proceedings.
 
Issues Only the following three issues remain for determination by me: 
Whether the plaintiff gave the defendant a notice pursuant to <case> of the ITAA before commencing these proceedings ("the first issue").

Whether the defendant was a director of the company at the relevant time so that she became liable for a penalty under <case> of the ITAA ("the second issue").

If the defendant was a director of the company at the relevant time, whether she is able to rely upon the statutory defence under <case> of the ITAA ("the third issue").
 In respect of the first issue the defendant says that the requisite notice was posted to the wrong address and was therefore never received by her. In respect of the second issue the defendant says that she resigned as a director of the company in or about August or September 2001 so that she was not a director of the company at the relevant time. In respect of the third issue the defendant says that if she had not resigned as a director in or about
August or September 2001 she believed that she had done so and did not participate in management of the company from that time for that reason.
 
The legislative provisions There is no dispute between the parties concerning the relevant provisions that apply to and govern the present case. The following sections of the ITAA should be noted: "Section 222AOB 
The persons who are directors of the company from time to time on or after the first deduction day must cause the company to do at least one of the following on or before the due date: comply with its obligations in relation to deductions (if any) and amounts withheld (if any) whose due date is the same as the due date; make an agreement with the Commissioner under section 222ALA in relation to the company's liability under a remittance provision in respect of such deductions (if any) and amounts withheld (if any); appoint an administrator of the company under [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s436a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) ; begin to be wound up within the meaning of that Act.
 ...
 ...
 
If this section is not complied with on or before the due date, the persons who are directors of the company from time to time after the due date continue to be under the obligation imposed by subsection (1) until this section is complied with.
 
Section 222AOC 
If section 222AOB is not complied with on or before the due date, each person who was a director of the company at any time during the period beginning on the first deduction day and ending on the due date is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the company's liability under a remittance provision in respect of deductions or amounts withheld: that the company has deducted for the purposes of Division 1AAA, 3B or of this Act, or withheld for the purposes of Division 12 in Schedule 1 to the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (as the case requires); and whose due date is the same as the due date.
 ...
 
Section 222AOE 
The Commissioner is not entitled to recover from a person a penalty payable under this Subdivision until the end of 14 days after the Commissioner gives to the person a notice that: sets out details of the unpaid amount of the liability referred to in subsection 222AOC(1), (1A) or (2) (whichever relates to the penalty); and states that the person is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to that unpaid amount, but that the penalty will be remitted if, at the end of 14 days after the notice is given: the liability has been discharged; or an agreement relating to the liability is in force under section
ALA; or the company is under administration within the meaning of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) ; or the company is being wound up.
 
Section 222AOF 
If it appears from ASIC documents that a person is, or has been within the last 7 days, a director of the company, the Commissioner may give the person a notice under section 222AOE by leaving it at, or sending it by post to, an address that appears from such documents to be, or to have been within the last 7 days, the person's place of residence or business.

Section 222AOJ 
This section has effect for the purposes of: proceedings to recover from a person a penalty payable under this
Subdivision; or ...
 
It is a defence if it is proved that, because of illness or for some other good reason, the person did not take part in the management of the company at any time when: the person was a director; and the directors were under the obligation to comply with subsection
AOB(1) or 222AOBAA(1)." 
The first issue The defendant's contention that she did not receive any director penalty notices did not emerge until a few days prior to the commencement of the hearing. The defendant relied upon a further amended defence dated 7 October , filed in court on the first day of the hearing. Paragraph 4 of that document was as follows: "4. The defendant says that the plaintiff has failed to serve on her a notice required to be served under <case> [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/)." The defendant's first submission was that the plaintiff was not entitled to rely on <case> if the defendant had ceased to be a director. For reasons that are explained in my disposition of the second issue, the defendant was a director at all relevant times and this aspect of the submission fails.
However, that is not the end of the matter.
 Param Srikantham gave evidence in the form of an affidavit sworn 4 January
There was no cross-examination of the deponent: see Banovec versus Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation  <case>
The affidavit included the following paragraphs: "2. On 4 December 2002 I prepared a director penalty notice addressed to the defendant respectively [sic], pursuant to section 222AOE of the [ITAA] for
PAYG Withholding which remained unpaid by the Company. I also prepared, to accompany the notices, a covering letter ("the letter").
 . I made a copy of the letter and the notice, and placed the original letter and notice addressed to the defendant into an envelope addressed to her at * Banksia Street Botany NSW 2019. This address appeared to be the place of residence of the defendant according to a company extract dated 4 December ("the extract") obtained from the Australian Securities Investment
Commission ("ASIC").
 *
 . I then sealed the said envelope, affixed a postage stamp and posted the said envelope in an Australia Post box...on 4 December 2002. I placed a copy of the letter and the notice on the files maintained by the plaintiff in relation to the defendant.
 . On 28 February 2003 I prepared a director penalty notice addressed to the defendant respectively [sic], pursuant to section 222AOE of the [ITAA] for
PAYG Withholding which remained unpaid by the Company. I also prepared, to accompany the notices, a covering letter ("the letter").
 . I made a copy of the letter and the notice, and placed the original letter and notice addressed to the defendant into an envelope addressed to her at * Banksia Street Botany NSW 2019. This address appeared to be the place of residence of both the first and second defendants according to a company extract dated 27 February 2003...obtained from [ASIC].
 *
 . I then sealed the said envelope, affixed a postage stamp and posted the said envelope...on 28 February 2003. I placed a copy of the letter and the notice on the files maintained by the plaintiff in relation to the defendant.
 . To the best of my knowledge and belief, the said envelopes have not been returned to the office of the plaintiff." The terms of the letters and the notices of director's liability to pay a penalty dated 4 December 2002 and 28 February 2003 are not in contest.
 The defendant asserted that she had never received any documents. This emerged from her affidavit sworn 7 October 2008, which is relevantly as follows: "2 From about 1973 until early 2000 I lived in a rented property at *
Banksia Street, Botany Bay, in the State of New South Wales.
 In mid 2000 my then husband and I purchased a property at Bundeena
Road, Glenning Valley, NSW. We moved to that Bundeena Road address in mid 2000 and I have lived there ever since....
 I never received any Directors Penalty Notices issued in accordance with section 222AOE of the [ITAA]. In particular I refer to the [director penalty notice and the letter dated 28 February 2003]. Prior to the commencement of this proceeding, I have never seen either of those documents and had never received them." During cross-examination the defendant gave this evidence: "Q. (Affidavit of 7 October shown to witness.) You hadn't raised this issue before, had you Mrs Robertson, until last Friday? 
A. Sorry what was the issue again? 
Q. You hadn't raised the fact that you hadn't received the director penalty notices until last Friday? 
A. I don't know whether it's in that first affidavit, but all the time I've said that I've never received anything from the Taxation Department.
 *
 
Q. The fact that penalty notices had been served on you was subsequently drawn to your attention, was it not Mrs Robertson? 
A. What do you mean the penalty notices? 
Q. The notices I've just shown to you? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Have you received any correspondence from the Commissioner about that notice? 
A. No, as I say, the only thing I got was in 2004. That's the first I knew about it.
 
Q. What was that Mrs Robertson? 
A. To say that - I never saw the letter, but it was given to my ex husband saying there was large amounts of money owing to the ATO and I didn't know the full extent of it until I returned.
 
Q. I'll show you a document. You'll see what I've handed to you is a letter addressed to you? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. At Bundeena Road, Glenning Valley? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Dated 22 January 2004? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. It's a notice of intended legal action? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And you'll see there reference is made to the director penalty notice that issued to you on 28 February 2003? 
A. I've never received this letter. As I say, this is the first time I've seen it, I've never received it.
 
Q. It's addressed to you? 
A. I know it's addressed to me. My husband used to empty the mailbox, I didn't. I've honestly never seen this letter.
 
Q. You lived at Bundeena-- 
A. I did live there yes, and I still live there.
 
Q. You lived at Bundeena Road, Glenning Valley as at 23 January 2004, didn't you? 
A. I did, yes.
 
Q. This was an important letter, was it not? 
A. Well it seems like it's a very important letter, yes.
 
Q. It's drawn your attention to the penalty notice issued to you on 28
February 2003? 
A. Yes.
 *
 
Q. (Documents shown to witness.) If I could draw your attention to the other letter you have there Mrs Robertson, dated 4 March 2004, do you have that? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. You'll see that's addressed to you again at Bundeena Road Glenning
Valley? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. You'll see there again it's a notice of intended legal action/garnishee? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. You will you'll also see reference is made to two penalty notices but in particular, the penalty notice the subject of these proceedings, 28 February ?
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did you get this letter, Mrs Robertson? 
A. No.
 
Q. Do you have any recollection about this letter? 
A. No, none whatsoever." The two letters that were shown to the defendant during that passage of the evidence became exhibit M. The letter dated 23 January 2004 commences with the words "[r]eference is made to the Director Penalty Notice that issued to you on the 28th of February 2003". The letter dated 4 March 2004 commences with the words "[r]eference is made to the Director Penalty Notices that issued to you on the 4th December 2002 and the 28th of February 2003". Cross-examination about these letters was only directed to the defendant's credit. It was not suggested that service of any director penalty notice had been relevantly effected by either of the letters in exhibit M.
 Mr Griffin swore an affidavit on 9 October 2008, just two days after the defence was amended to raise non-delivery of the director penalty notices for the first time. Paragraph 15 of that affidavit said this: "15 While I was living with Leslie [sic], only I had a key to the letterbox. I collected and withheld from her any mail that looked like it contained legal documents." Mr Griffin was cross-examined about this evidence. He reaffirmed that when he was living with the defendant only he had a key to the letterbox. It was suggested to him that that evidence was a fabrication. He denied this. I asked him the following questions as well: "Q. So should I understand from paragraph 15 that whenever you lived with your former wife-- 
A. I'd have the keys. Maryann would give me back the keys to the cars and everything, and the key was on one of the cars, yes.
 
Q. Should I understand from paragraph 15 of your affidavit that when you were living with your former wife-- 
A. Yes.
 
Q. --she had no access to mail that arrived at the address where she was living? 
A. That's correct.
 
Q. And for how long did that situation exist? 
A. Well, until I moved out the place, I think when I moved out in 2001 or something like that, I think it was, and then - it was just a thing that a key was always on my key-ring, we never bothered at the time initially to get two keys, it was just - even now I believe she still now only has that one key.
I'm not sure, but I think that's about right." The evidence that Mr Griffin withheld legal documents from the defendant is not supportive of the defendant's case because the plaintiff needs only to establish delivery. That evidence is not inconsistent with delivery. However, the evidence is in my opinion a fabrication and Mr Griffin's denial of this should be rejected. The timing and content of the evidence suggests that it was lately contrived in aid of the amendment to the defence but it does not do so. Mr Griffin's credit is discussed in more detail later in these reasons.
 There is other evidence to suggest that the defendant may have commenced to live at Bundeena Road, Glenning Valley from as early as mid-2000 as she asserts. For example, a letter to her at that address dated 9 July 2000 from a finance company and a rate notice to her at that address dated 11 June 2002 are annexed to her 7 October 2008 affidavit. The documents completed by her that are in exhibit L also suggest that she was living at that address between
November 2001 and October 2002. Finally, in her taxation returns for the years ending 30 June 2001 and 30 June 2002 lodged on 10 September 2002 and 11
September 2002 respectively, which are annexed to the affidavit of Kalliani
Sreedharan sworn 3 October 2008, the defendant's address is Bundeena Road,
Glenning Valley.
 By way of contrast, there is evidence that the defendant did not immediately relinquish her lease at her previous address. For example, documents produced by the Department of Housing, which were tendered as exhibit T, include copies of letters to the defendant dated 10 January 2002 and 10 April 2002 addressed to her at * Banksia Street, Botany. A letter signed by the defendant and endorsed with a "received" stamp at the Department of Housing dated 18 March 2002 refers to the defendant returning the keys for * Banksia Street, Botany. However, another document in the same exhibit lists the defendant's "current postal address" on 19 August 2002 as 
Bundeena Road, Glenning Valley.
 The plaintiff's argument was as follows. Section 222AOE of the ITAA requires that notice be given to a director of a company who has become liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner under <case>. The giving of a director penalty notice is a prerequisite to the Commissioner recovering the amount payable from the director. One method of service is provided by <case> of the ITAA. However, that section is not the only way in which service of a notice may be effected: DCT versus Keck <case>; [63 ATR 310];
DCT versus Meredith <case>; <case>.
Section 222AOF(1) does not exclude or limit reliance upon <case> of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) ("the
AIA"). That is said to be the point of the note to <case> drawing attention to [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html); see DCT versus Meredith (supra) at [17]. Accordingly, where the Commissioner sent a notice by prepaid post to the address of the place of residence of the director, the notice would be deemed to have been given in accordance with [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the AIA where the address chosen met the description "last known" to the
Commissioner.
 [Sections
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the AIA are as follows: "[Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) 
For the purposes of any Act that requires or permits a document to be served on a person, whether the expression "serve", "give" or "send" or any other expression is used, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the document may be served: on a natural person: by delivering it to the person personally; or by leaving it at, or by sending it by pre-paid post to, the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to the person serving the document; or on a body corporate--by leaving it at, or sending it by pre-paid post to, the head office, a registered office or a principal office of the body corporate.
 
Nothing in subsection (1): affects the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth, or any law of a State or Territory, that authorizes the service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection; or affects the power of a court to authorize service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) 
Where an Act authorizes or requires any document to be served by post, whether the expression "serve" or the expression "give" or "send" or any other expression is used, then unless the contrary intention appears the service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing prepaying and posting the document as a letter, and unless the contrary is proved to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.
 
This section does not affect the operation of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)."  Section 28A applies "for the purposes of any Act that requires or permits a document to be served on a person, whether the expression 'serve', 'give' or 'send' or any other expression is used." The ITAA uses the word "gives" in s
AOE with respect to the director penalty notice for which it provides.
Section 28A therefore permitted a director penalty notice to be served "by sending it by pre-paid post to, the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to the person serving the document." The person serving the document is the Commissioner, who acts through his officers: see O'Reilly versus State Bank of Victoria <case>; [(1983) 153 CLR 1.] With respect to the director penalty notice dated 28 February 2003 the facts relevant to <case> are that it was sent by prepaid post to * Banksia
Street, Botany on 28 February 2003. The Commissioner knew that to be the defendant's address through a contemporaneous MASCOT extract search referred to in par [8] of Param Srikanthan's affidavit dated 4 January 2006 set out above. The Commissioner had previously used this address to send an earlier notice on 4 December 2002 and that letter had not been returned. The inference to be drawn from that fact, according to the plaintiff's submission, is that the notice "had found the defendant at that address." At the time that the
Commissioner sent the notice the most recent income tax return lodged by the defendant on 11 September 2002 for the year ending 30 June 2002 showed a residential address of Bundeena Road, Glenning Valley. However, after lodgement of that return the defendant signed exhibit E which disclosed her address as * Banksia Street, Botany. (This was what the plaintiff described as a reaffirmation of the address originally notified to ASIC in exhibit 1, a document lodged on 24 March 1999). That was the address that appeared in the contemporaneous MASCOT search extract and so was "the address of the place of residence [of the defendant] ... last known to the person serving the document." The plaintiff submitted that it was a proper inference as at 28
February 2003, when the second penalty notice was sent, that * Banksia
Street, Botany was the address of the defendant's residence last known to the
Commissioner. The address on the ASIC website was the most recent address of which the Commissioner had knowledge. It was sufficient for the Commissioner to have searched the database as the source of the address without referring to the return or notice from which the address had been extracted: see DCT v Nercessian <case>; [(2006) 67 NSWLR 215.] Finally, evidence from the defendant of non-receipt of the notice would not displace the presumptions in ss 28A and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s29.html).
Proof of non-receipt is not proof of non-delivery: see Fancourt & Anor v Mercantile Credits Ltd <case>; <case>; [(1998) 43 NSWLR 271] at 277. In any event, the defendant adduced no evidence of non-delivery, as opposed to non-receipt.
 The defendant contended that the address to which the notice was addressed was not her then current address. The defendant submits further that it was also not her address that was last known to the plaintiff. This was because of what was disclosed in the defendant's 2002 income tax return lodged on 11
September 2002, which showed her address as Bundeena Road, Glenning Valley.
 The defendant reasoned as follows. When considering what is an address that is last known to the plaintiff, some work must be required of the word "known". It cannot be an address at which service can be effected under a different legislative provision regardless of whether or not it is the address of the defendant in fact. It must be known by the plaintiff that the person actually resides at that address at that particular time. A prior search of the ASIC database is insufficient because it will not reveal that the defendant actually resides at the address obtained in that fashion, being only a deeming provision. If it were otherwise there would have been no point in enacting <case>. Secondly, because the search is a search of what amounts to no more than a summary of the documents that are referred to in the search, it will only show the position as at the date of lodgement of those documents.
The defendant submitted that in the present case the date of lodgement of the source document referred to in the ASIC search was prior to 11 September 2002, which was the date of lodgement of the defendant's income tax return for the income tax year.
 The first submission appears to misconstrue the effect of at least s
AOF. The operative part of the section is contained in the words "an address that appears from such documents to be, or to have been within the last 7 days, the person's place of residence". The ASIC search gives the appearance that the defendant's address was * Banksia Street, Botany as at the date of the search. Interestingly, the same ASIC search extract shows that the defendant ceased to be a director on 17 February 2003 or some ten days before the date of the search. The plaintiff was therefore not entitled to rely on <case> because it did not appear "from ASIC documents that [the defendant] is, or has been within the last 7 days, a director of the company."
The plaintiff did not rely upon <case> for this reason.
 The source document that founded the address in the ASIC search was lodged on 24 March 1999: see exhibit 1. Events had overtaken the information that it contained by the time the search was conducted on 27 February 2003. However, there was no disconformity between that source document and the details in the search extract. A search of the source document would have revealed the same address as the search of the extract. Indeed, a search of exhibits D and E, for example, would have produced the same result. In any event, as appears from Nercessian (supra), when the Commissioner sends a director penalty notice to a director at the address appearing in the ASIC database, that satisfies the requirements of <case> notwithstanding that the Commissioner had not searched the return or notice from which the address was extracted.
Santow JA at par [29] makes this clear: "[29] Moreover, when the interaction between the facultative provisions of either version of s222AOF are read with the provisions of (relevantly) [s205B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s205b.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) there is simply no warrant in the words of s222AOF to require the Commissioner to actually search beyond the MASCOT database. This must be so, even were such a search practicable. To require a search beyond the standard procedure of searching the relevant database (MASCOT or earlier ASCOT) would entail at the very least considerable inconvenience to the point of impracticability. What is the point of having a national ASIC database, accessible by remote search, if one must go to the original filed document?" The defendant's complaint cannot therefore be that the plaintiff should not be entitled to choose as the address last known to the plaintiff an address that is in fact based upon what is or may be stale information. The defendant's argument is rather more focused upon what is meant by the critical words in <case>(a)(ii), which are "by leaving it at, or by sending it by pre-paid post to, the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to the person serving the document". The competition is therefore between the address known to the plaintiff and contained in the defendant's income tax return lodged with the plaintiff on 11 September 2002 and the (out of date) information contained in the ASIC search conducted by the plaintiff within a single day of posting the director penalty notice on 28
February 2003 to the address so acquired. Rhetorically, why should the plaintiff be entitled to rely on the information assembled by a third party in preference to information provided directly to the plaintiff by the intended recipient of the notice? Implicitly, this argument emphasises that the words "last known to the person serving the document" must be read as "last known for a fact" or some cognate formulation, as opposed to "assumed" or "accepted" following a search of ASIC records, as in the present case.  The defendant relied upon a decision of Tamberlin J in Drake v
Stanton <case>, which involved an interpretation of reg 16.01(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy
Regulations, which provided that unless a contrary intention appears, where a document is required to be served on a person, the document may be left in an envelope marked with the person's name at the last known address of the person. The issue in the case turned on the words "the last known address of the person". At par [8] his Honour said this: "[8] In my view, on the language of reg 16.01(1)(c), the reference to 'last known address of the person' is to that address which has been made known by the applicant as at the time closest to the date in question." According to the defendant, that decision supports the proposition that "made known by the applicant" means made known by the defendant in a document produced by her or on her behalf. That would make the 11 September 2002 income tax return the relevant document in this case rather than the ASIC extract, which was not "made known by" the defendant.
 However, that argument disregards the fact that the state of the ASIC record is made known by the defendant to the extent that she did not take steps to correct it when she changed her address. The uncorrected state of the
ASIC record meant that until corrected the defendant continued to make known her old address to the plaintiff which, when searched, became her address last known to the plaintiff. The defendant was no less able passively to make her address known, by choosing to do nothing or by neglecting to do anything, as she was able actively to do so. The defendant was in a category different to the hypothetical director contemplated by Patten AJ in DCT versus Flanagan  <case>; <case> when, with respect to <case>, his Honour said the following: "[37] I cannot conceive that parliament would have intended that reliance could be placed upon an ASIC extract in relation to the residential address of a person who may have ceased to be a director months, or even years previously, and had neither the obligation nor the means to update the record." The ASIC record revealed that the defendant had ceased to be a director some ten days previously. No submissions were made about whether or not she had either the obligation or the means to update the record.
 
Conclusion on the first issue In my opinion the plaintiff gave the defendant a notice pursuant to s
AOE of the ITAA before commencing these proceedings.
 
The second issue The defendant relied upon evidence from herself and her former husband
Dwayne Griffin, previously known as Norman Robertson. The defendant said that she resigned as a director of the company in about August or September 2001.
She said that she had originally become a director of the company in early because her then husband was suffering from cardiac problems for which he was due to undergo surgery. At about this time he said to her, "Lesley, Scott [McClymont, who she knew to be their accountant] and I have decided to put your name down as a director of the company". He said, "[t]he company needs a second director whilst I am sick to sign cheques, you won't have to be involved in the day to day running as there is a manager." The defendant said that she understood her appointment as a director to be temporary and that others would look after the running of the business. She was told by her husband, "you may have to sign some cheques when I am not available to do so but if and when I get better you will no longer be required on the record." It is not in issue that the defendant was appointed as a director of the company in 1999.
 The defendant said that she did not feel comfortable with this arrangement but agreed to it anyway because she had been assured that there would be no problem with it and that it was only a formality. Paragraphs 11 to 13 inclusive of her affidavit sworn 3 March 2008 are in the following terms: "11 In or about August 2001 Norman said to me words to the effect of 'You don't need to be a director of the Company anymore'. He then handed me a document which I signed so that I could be removed as a director of the
Company. After signing the document I handed it back to Norman and he said to me words to the effect of 'I'll take this to Scott to look after'.
 When, in or about August 2001, I handed back to Norman the signed document for my removal as a director, I believed that I was no longer a director of the Company. I understood that I had resigned as a director of the
Company. I believed there was nothing further I needed to do to resign as a director of the Company.
 I did not keep a copy of the document I had signed. I expected Norman and Scott to look after the formalities." The defendant's former husband swore a number of affidavits. Some of these were read in the defendant's case, and Mr Griffin was cross-examined on these as well as others that he had sworn. Paragraphs 37 to 39 of his affidavit sworn 2 May 2005 are in the following terms: "37 By about August 2001 Lesley was due to go overseas to stay with her mother. Before this was to occur Scott had supplied a document to be lodged to remove her as a Director. I gave the document to Leslie [sic] at home. She signed it and I returned it to Scott.
 I was under the assumption that the document was lodged but in fact I later found out this had not occurred. After that point both [sic] Lesley would have had no reason to believe she was a Director.
 I also attended the bank with Lesley at about that time and arranged for her to sign some documents to take her off the record for the purpose of signing cheques." Paragraphs 7 and 8 of his affidavit sworn 31 July 2008 are as follows: "7 About two years later in about August 2001 as my health had improved I did not consider it necessary for Lesley to continue to be a director of the
Company.
 I discussed with Lesley about her resigning as director and said to her words to the effect of 'I'm in much better health than I used to be and I am managing the Company on my own so there is no need for you to be a director'.
After this I met with Scott and said to him words to the effect of 'I don't think Lesley needs to be a director anymore, let's take her off'. Scott then gave me some forms for Lesley to sign to resign as director. I recall that
Scott marked the forms with an "X" in pencil indicating where Lesley was to sign. I took the forms from Scott and went home. I do not now recall the exact conversation that I had with Lesley but I recall we were standing in the kitchen and I said to her words to the effect of 'Here are some papers if you sign this you can come off as a director of the company'. Lesley took the forms from me and I saw that she signed the forms. Lesley then handed the documents back to me and I said to her words to the effect of 'I'll take these to Scott'." [Italicised words objected to and rejected].
 In his affidavit sworn 9 October 2008 Mr Griffin said the following: "6 In my earlier affidavit I gave evidence of documents signed by Leslie [sic] in or around August 2001. On further reflection I realize these were in fact signed in September 2001.
 The 2 documents that I gave to Leslie [sic] to sign were given to me by
Scott McLymont [sic]. I was personally present when he printed one of the forms from his computer. I saw Scott personally compose the other document that was in the form of a letter. Scott marked in pencil where Leslie [sic] was to sign.
 Before giving the documents to Leslie [sic] to sign, I read the document that was in the form of a letter. I noticed that it was addressed to the company and said word [sic] to the effect: 'I hereby tender my resignation as a director of the above company as of this day'." In a later affidavit Mr Griffin said that he handed the forms to Mr
McClymont the following afternoon.
 There was no dispute that the defendant had become a director of the company. The issue was whether or not, and if so when, she ceased to be a director. This was because the defendant's resignation was not documented or recorded in what might be described as the usual way. There was, however, considerable documentary material touching this issue.
 A number of documents apparently signed by the defendant in the period during which she asserted that she was no longer a director of the company were tendered. Exhibit D is the 2001 Annual Return of the company. It appears to bear her signature as "Director" and is dated 3 October 2001. The defendant initially agreed that the signature was hers but later gave the following evidence: "Q. You see your signature under that? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Would you please confirm that this is the annual return of the company for 2002? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. You have signed it in the capacity as director? 
A. I signed it, yes.
 
Q. The date you signed was 16 December 2002? 
A. Yes, I can see that date there.
 
Q. That is more than 12 months after you say you resigned as a director? 
A. I can't explain that.
 
Q. You have been untruthful? 
A. I am sorry. I do not tell lies. I'm under oath here.
 
Q. How do you explain a document then that you have signed on 16 December
You have agreed it is your signature? 
A. It does look like my signature, yes.
 
Q. You have agreed it was your signature? 
A. It does look like my signature, yes.
 
Q. You can recognise your own signature? 
A. Can I bring any question? 
Q. I'm asking the questions. You can recognise your own signature, can't you? 
A. Well, it looks like it, yes.
 
Q. You have also completed a declaration? 
A. If that's a declaration, yes.
 
Q. I will read it to you "I declare that the information given on this annual return of 3 pages and any annexures is complete and correct at the date of signing it"? 
A. Well, if that's what it says, yes. " Exhibit E is the 2002 Annual Return of the company. It also apparently bears the defendant's signature in her capacity as a director of the company.
It is dated 16 December 2002. In cross-examination the defendant confirmed twice that the signature was hers and on a further three occasions said that "it does look like my signature" or "it looks like it, yes".
 Exhibit G is a Notification of Change of Office Hours or Address of the company. It is dated 11 January 2002 and purports to have been signed by the defendant. In response to the suggestion put to her during cross-examination that it was her signature on the document the defendant said "[i]t looks like it, but...". She then went on to agree that she had signed in her capacity as director but later said that the signature "doesn't even look like mine".
 The defendant later suggested that none of the signatures on exhibits D, E and G were hers. This emerged when I asked the defendant the following questions about her signature of these documents: "Q. Do you say positively that you can deny that the documents that are in front of you, which are photocopies nonetheless, do not contain your signature? 
A. They're not my signature. G is definitely not. When I first looked at them, I looked and I thought, I looked at them quick and I was told that I did sign them but, when I look at them again, they're not my signature. They're very like my signature but they're not.
 
Q. G is definitely not.
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Does that mean there is or there isn't doubt about the others? 
A. I did, when I first saw that one, I did say that is definitely not my signature. On the other two, I'm not sure what I said but I think I said, that if you say that's my signature, that's my signature. G, I definitely knew then it was not my signature. But when I look at them now like before, they're not my signature.
 
Q. You are now referring to the other two? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Which are exhibits D and E? 
A. Yes." The plaintiff called Mr Stephen Dubedat, an expert document examiner, who prepared a report, dated 25 November 2008. He concluded that the signatures on exhibits D and E were "probably genuine" and that it was "unlikely" that anyone other than the defendant, with whose genuine specimen signature he made a comparison, wrote the signatures in dispute. As to the signature on exhibit
G, Mr Dubedat concluded that it was "probably not a genuine signature" and that it was highly unlikely that the defendant had written it. Mr Griffin gave evidence that he arranged for all three signatures to be executed by others.
 Exhibit L is a series of documents produced in answer to a subpoena directed to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. On 17 September the defendant left Australia by plane for the United Kingdom. She returned to Australia by plane on 31 October 2002. On each occasion she completed a passenger card in which she described her "usual occupation" as "Director". A declaration was completed in each case that the information on the cards was true and correct. The defendant said that she had done this because it was the first occasion on which she had travelled business class and that she had not wanted to put down her usual occupation as "home duties".
She said the following: "Q. This card was completed over a year, 12 months after you say you ceased to be a director? 
A. Can I explain why I put "director"? 
Q. Yes please? 
A. This was the first time I've ever been business class, I went business class. And it's a silly thing, but I just didn't want to put "home duties" like I always do. I saw all these business people going on and I thought I'll put "director", being as I put that going out, I also had to put it coming back. It was a silly, stupid thing to do, but it was just that I wanted to feel important, that was all." This is to be compared with what the defendant said in an affidavit sworn on 28 April 2005 at par 24 when she said, "I never thought it was such a big thing to be a Director and I still have no idea what one is supposed to do as a Director." It should also to be compared with similar declarations made by the defendant when leaving and returning to Australia on an overseas trip in
The declarations completed by the defendant when departing on 6 October and when returning on 11 November 2001 in each case described her usual occupation as "home duties". The departure on this occasion was some three days after the defendant apparently signed exhibit D.
 Exhibit C is the financial statement for the company for the financial year ended 30 June 2002. It is dated 25 March 2003. On page 21 of that document the defendant is listed as one of the directors in office since the start of the financial year to the date of the report. As previously discussed, the defendant's former husband gave evidence that he had personally attended on the company's accountant Mr Scott McClymont who had prepared a letter of resignation for the defendant to sign, and which she had signed, following which it was returned to Mr McClymont. That letter was never produced in evidence. If such a letter had been executed and put into effect by Mr
McClymont it should have been reflected in the relevant entry listing the directors of the company in exhibit C for the financial year ended 30 June
It did not do so. Mr McClymont was not called as a witness. The plaintiff not unexpectedly and with some force asserted that the inference was that Mr McClymont would not have assisted the defendant's case. The reliability of Mr Griffin is discussed elsewhere in these reasons.
 Exhibit J is a letter dated 22 April 2003 written by Robert Peattie and
Associates who according to the terms of the letter were solicitors instructed by Mr Griffin and the defendant. The opening paragraph of the letter was in these terms: "We have received instructions to act on behalf of Norman Robertson and his wife Lesley in respect to statements made concerning First Direct Private
Security Pty Limited. We understand from our client that an accusation has been made that the Company was allowed to trade while insolvent." The letter was addressed to Knights Insolvency Administration in response to an accusation that the company had been allowed to trade whilst insolvent.
That allegation is to be found in exhibit K, a Circular to Creditors dated 9
April 2003, prepared by Knights Insolvency Administration in the following relevant terms: "Based on our investigations to date we consider that the directors may have continued to trade the Company whilst insolvent from at least December ". [Emphasis added] The italicised word is obviously a reference to the directors of the company. The company records reveal that there were never more than two directors of the company and that they were the defendant and Mr Griffin.
 The plaintiff contends that if the defendant had resigned as a director of the company in August 2001 it is surprising that this would not have been referred to in the letter from Mr Peattie. Alternatively, there would have been no need to defend her position in response to an allegation of insolvent trading in December 2001 if she had in fact resigned in August or September that year.
 Exhibit S is a Notification to Change of Office Holders dated 20 February relating to the company and lodged with ASIC. It bears the signature of
Norman Robertson in his capacity as a director above the handwritten date 17
February 2003. The body of the document records the defendant as having ceased to hold office as a director on that date. Mr Griffin agreed that he signed this document. It is in apparent conflict with what he and the defendant said about the defendant's resignation in 2001 when Mr Griffin said that he took the defendant's letter of resignation to Mr McClymont, as well as the content of exhibit C. Exhibit S stands alone and unexplained.
 The defendant was also cross-examined about her evidence in the light of what was contained in some of her income tax returns. These returns were annexed to an affidavit of Kalliani Sreedharan sworn 3 October 2008 upon which the plaintiff relied. The defendant's 2000 tax return showed income of $50,000 as either salary or wages in the occupation of a company director. The defendant's 2001 tax return showed income of $31,200 as either salary or wages in the occupation of a company director together with $18,800 as director's fees. The defendant's 2002 tax return showed income of $52,000 as either salary or wages in the occupation of a company director. This is notwithstanding the defendant's contention that she ceased to be a director sometime in August or September 2001.
 Some of the cross-examination of the defendant on that topic was as follows: "Q. You will see there that according to the records of the Commissioner your return for 2000 was lodged on 7 August 2001? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And do you say that was before or after you resigned as a director? 
A. That would be, if that was done in August 2001, that would be before.
 
Q. You are able to pinpoint the time of your resignation to some time after-- 
A. Yes.
 
Q. --7 August? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Was it late in August or? 
A. Um, late in August/beginning of September.
 
Q. Why are you now able to say the beginning of September? You haven't said that before Mrs Robertson.
 
A. Because on, um, in August - in September two, ah, 2001 I had a surprise visit from my mother from the UK, who I was going to go over to visit her because she's been pretty ill, but she came over. And I also know that that was the time when the Twin Towers went down so that was very, you know, that stayed in my mind. And also my mother asking me why am I signing these documents.
 *
 
Q. So your evidence in your affidavit was that it was about August 2001 that you resigned? 
A. Yeah, about, yeah, or beginning of September, yeah.
 
Q. Well, you didn't say September in your affidavit, did you? 
A. Well, at the time it was like the end of, sort of, August.
 
Q. Well, would you have a look at paragraph 6-- 
A. Oh right.
 
Q. --the affidavit and you will see there that according to the records of the Commissioner you lodged a return for 2001 on 10 September 2002, and was your tax agent Scott McClymont? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And he prepared these, he prepared your returns for 2000 and 2001? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Would you please look at paragraph 9, you will see there that shortly the next day a return was lodged for you on 11 September 2002? 
A. Yes, I see that.
 
Q. Do you see that? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did you speak with Mr McClymont when you completed these returns? 
A. No, I never, um, spoke to him. Um, my ex husband Norman Robertson, he always dealt with everything like that.
 
Q. You would have had to sign your return, wouldn't you Mrs Robertson? 
A. Well, perhaps I did go and sign it, but, um, I don't remember anything about, um, they just naturally put it in I think. I don't know.
 
Q. When a return is lodged electronically, you attend your accountant's office, do you not, to sign the paper copy? 
A. I can't recall doing it, but no, I can't recall doing it.
 
Q. Would you please turn to page 9 of the affidavit, you will see there that your return for 2000 states that you received income from First Direct, do you see that at the top, First Direct Private Security of 50,000? *
 
Q. 1991. This is your return for the 2002 year? 
A. Yes, it's got 2002, yes.
 
Q. You will see in that year, you earnt a similar amount to the previous years? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. 52,000? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Is that correct? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Again, the same payer number on the left, ABN? 
A. ABN number, yes.
 
Q. You see there that the only salary wage occupation you describe there is company director? 
A. Yes, I see that, yes.
 
Q. You have not indicated any other occupation, have you? 
A. No. I wouldn't put that down. I don't know if it's an oversight of the accountant but I wouldn't have done that.
 
Q. You would have read the paper copy of the return? 
A. Well, I can't recall, no.
 
Q. When you signed the paper copy of a return, you make a declaration? 
A. Well, you have told me, yes but I can't recall ever signing those things.
 *
 
Q. And I also put to you that you had remained as a director up until-- 
A. I have not.
 
HIS HONOUR: Just a minute. Just a minute. It is important that the question finish before you answer.
 
QUINN 
Q. That you didn't resign in August or early September 2001, you remained as a director up until February or March 2003, that's the position isn't it
Mrs Robertson? 
A. No, it is not. I resigned in 2001 in September when my mother was here.
" Exhibit R was a Report by a Director or Officer of the company. It is dated March 2003 and is signed by Norman Robertson and Scott McClymont. Paragraph asks the question, "What remuneration have you and other directors received from the company during the three (3) years prior to Administration by way of salary (b) allowances/directors' fees". The answer to that question records the precise sums for the defendant as are returned by her for tax purposes for the three years 2000 to 2002 inclusive set out above. The defendant said in re-examination that she did not receive this money. That evidence was as follows: "Q. You were also asked earlier in your evidence about money that was shown on your tax returns as having been received as director's remuneration? 
A. Hmmm.
 
Q. Can you tell me anything in relation to that money? 
A. I just don't remember that. It's just - when I was a director, I didn't receive any money as such in my hand.
 
Q. What about when you were an employee? 
A. When I was an employee, I did because I used to sign a pay book.
 
Q. Do you remember when you started being paid as an employee? 
A. That would be after the Christmas 2001, early 2002, yeah. " The plaintiff invited me to find that that evidence was false having regard to the fact that the defendant returned the monies as income for tax purposes as indicated.
 The defendant was also confronted with a series of cheques that appeared to have been signed by her. These are assembled in exhibit U. There was some dispute about what cheques she had signed and when. This is discussed later.
However, as a preliminary matter of general import it is clear that the defendant did sign cheques for the company from time to time. Sometimes they were in blank when she did so.
 In her affidavit sworn 28 April 2005 the defendant said the following: "30. Between 2000 and 2001 I used to either drop into the office at
Maryanne's request to sign cheques or Maryanne would come to the house. This would happen a few times a week.
 . The office was only about 4 minutes away and I used to go up there to feed the dogs and clean the kennels anyway so sometimes if I was up there I would pop my head in to see if Maryanne wanted me to sign something.
 . I do not have a good recollection of what I signed or who the cheques were made out to but generally it appeared they were for electricity bills, repairs done or something.
 . Sometimes Maryanne would give me blank cheques to sign. She would just say stuff like 'that's to pay a mechanic who's coming in today', or, 'that's for a wage that hadn't gone out'. I never queried any of that because Maryanne was a friend and I trusted her. Most of the time she wouldn't say anything and I didn't ask.
 *
 . I did not sign anything after 2001. I had no further involvement and signed no more cheques. ..." The defendant also gave evidence that she signed two large books of the company's blank cheques before she went overseas. This occurred only after the production of the cheques by the bank in answer to the plaintiff's subpoena.
These are the cheques that became exhibit U. That evidence was as follows: "Q. Mrs Robertson, the St George Bank has apparently provided some documents under subpoena which have been tendered by the plaintiff today that appear to have your signature on them. Those documents are in the main numbered between 90 and 100 cheques and they are dated principally between
July 2001 and December 2001. In light of your earlier evidence you have given, do you have an explanation as why there may be cheques that have been produced by St George Bank that appear to have your signature on them that are dated in that period after you say that you resigned in about August or
September 2001? 
A. Well, the only explanation I could come up with is that I did know that
Norman gave me a big cheque book to sign. This was probably about 6 or 8 weeks before I left for the UK and he got me to sign all these cheques. I can't remember the amount of them but it was one of those big double cheque books and he just said to me, "Just sign them and that way I don't have to keep bothering you." That's the only explanation I could come up with because I wouldn't have signed them after I resigned.
 
Q. So do you remember whether this signing took place before or after your resignation? 
A. It would have been before. " Without exception the cheques that make up exhibit U are drawn to cash.
They are all either signed or apparently signed by the defendant. They range in date from 19 July 2001 to 18 December 2001. Despite the fact that the cheques are all cash cheques there are often several cheques that have the same date. The signatures on these cheques were not subjected to expert examination by Mr Dubedat or anyone else. Some of the cheques have notes on the reverse that appear to have been recorded by an officer or employee of the paying bank. For example, cheque number 104477 dated 3 September 2001 drawn payable to cash in the sum of $1,490 has the following notation: "Lesley Robertson OK to pay. Phoned at home 3/9/01. Norman K Robertson D/L
CF Exp. 19/4/05" Another example of this is cheque number 104497 dated 12 September 2001 drawn payable to cash in the sum of $1111.82. The reverse side of the cheque contains the following notation: "Dup ok no. Allison J Robertson NSW D/L 11821562 Exp 07 11 02 Ph. Spoke to
Lesley F Robertson ok'd Allison to cash chq" 
That cheque was also apparently counter-signed on the reverse side by "A
Robertson".
 The plaintiff points to the tension between the defendant's evidence about her signature of approximately 100 blank cheques in exhibit U and her expressed reasons for doing so, and the visit to the bank at Tuggerah to be removed as a signatory from the company's account. For example, the defendant had deposed in par [15] of her affidavit of 3 March 2008 to the following matters: "15. Towards the end of my Mother's visit to Australia I remember that she was not very well and so I decided to travel back with her to England. At about this time, because I was going to England, I said to Norman words to the effect of, 'I better do something about the bank as I won't be here to sign cheques.' I remember that it was a few days after signing the documents to resign as a director of the Company that Norman and I went to the St George
Bank in Tuggerah. I remember we were served by a female staff member and I signed a document which I understood meant that I was no longer a signatory for the Company and that Norman could sign the cheques. I have not signed any cheques for the Company since this time." When cross-examined the defendant gave the following evidence: "Q. You have given very precise details at paragraph 15 about going to the bank at Tuggerah? 
A. Tuggerah, yes.
 
Q. And you have said nothing about this hundred or so cheques you've signed? 
A. No, I didn't - why would I say anything about that? I was asked when I signed at the bank to come off there. Why would I mention cheques? 
Q. But the reason you give for going to the bank is that you needed to do something about the bank because you would not be here to sign cheques? 
A. That's right.
 
Q. But you had signed a hundred or 120 cheques, had you not? 
A. Yeah, probably in about July or something. " However, there is a certain contrast between that evidence and the defendant's earlier statements about attending the bank. The plaintiff submitted that the detail that emerged more lately was a manifestation of the defendant's appreciation that the visit to the bank was potentially significant on the question of her alleged resignation as a director. The following cross-examination is instructive: "Q. Could I show you an affidavit that you swore on 3 February 2006? Would you please look at paragraph 36 of that affidavit? See there that you say in the last sentence, "I think we even had to go to the bank to sign something as well"? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. "But I can't remember for sure"? 
A. Yes, I think that was the St George Bank at Tuggerah, yes.
 
Q. But at that point in time you couldn't remember whether you'd been to the bank or not. That's what you say there, isn't it? 
A. This time, this was all going on, my marriage had broken up after 30-odd years, I was very confused, and saying that I owed all this money.
 
Q. It was a simple issue wasn't it Mrs Robertson, you say there that you think you had gone to the bank but you can't remember for sure? 
A. Yes, but I did. I did go to the bank. I went to the St George Bank at
Tuggerah.
 
Q. That's what you say in your affidavit of 3 March 2008. Do you have a copy of that with you? 
A. Yes.
 
HIS HONOUR 
Q. I think what's being put to you, you weren't sure in 2005, but you are sure now? 
A. Yes, as I explained to the gentleman, I was very confused then. My life was falling apart." The defendant also proffered in her oral evidence the further explanation that she had even telephoned the bank to obtain copies of the documentation that she said she signed in order that she be removed as a signatory to the company's account. She said she was told that the documentation could not be located. The defendant did not refer to having made these inquiries in any affidavit. Exhibit Q consisted of a number of documents subpoenaed from the bank, including the authority to operate the company's cheque account, which only listed Norman Robertson as having that authority. That is obviously problematic, however, as the defendant had clearly signed cheques that were honoured by the bank and the bank's officers even telephoned her for authorisation from time to time when cash cheques were presented that raised issues that the bank wanted answered.
 Mr Griffin was also cross-examined. It is unnecessary to refer to all of his evidence in detail. He was taken to some other paragraphs of the affidavit that he swore on 9 October 2008 in the following terms: "9 Annexed hereto and marked with the letter A is a copy of the first page of a document titled Annual Return of a Company for the year ended 2001.
 I was personally present when that document was signed. The signature 'L
Robertson' was signed by Marianne Upcroft at my request.
 I asked Marianne to sign the document because I understood this document was a loose end that needed tidying up from when Leslie was still a director.
I had already obtained from Leslie documents that I understood had removed her from being a director of [the company]. I did not want to bother her with the document and so asked Marianne Upcroft to sign the document as Leslie.
 Annexed hereto and marked with the letter B is a copy of the first page of a document titled Change of Office Hours or Address dated 11.01.02. I was personally present when that document was signed. The signature 'L Robertson' was signed by Marianne Upcroft at my request.
 Both annexures A and B were signed by Marianne Upcroft in Scott's office. He absented himself while the signing took place.
 Annexed hereto and marked with the letter C is a copy of the first page of a document titled Annual Return of a Company for the year 2002. I was personally present when that document was signed. The signature 'L Robertson' was signed by Jenny Sutton at my request. Jenny Sutton was the girlfriend of one of the employees. I remember this was signed in the beer garden of the
Chittaway Bay Hotel." It will be apparent that annexures A and B referred to by Mr Griffin are respectively the first pages of exhibits D and E in these proceedings.
Annexure B referred to by Mr Griffin corresponds to exhibit G in these proceedings.
 I asked Mr Griffin some questions about the circumstances of the defendant's alleged resignation as a director as follows: "Q. Whose decision was it that your former wife should resign as a director of the company in August or September 2001? 
A. It was mine.
 
Q. What prompted that decision? 
A. Well I thought that I was sort of getting back to taws better than what it was, and I must believe I don't like not being in charge of my own thing, what I'm doing, and I felt it was time that I came back on and just carried on.
 
Q. On the occasions that you've given evidence in your affidavit about having other people, Ms Sutton or Ms Upcroft sign documents instead of your former wife, why did you have them do it rather than simply signing your former wife's name yourself? 
A. Well I wouldn't be able to do anything that looks like it. My writing is more of a squiggle and I can't write in a straight line because I had an operation on the nerves in my right arm and I lost a fair bit of control, where I had to learn to rewrite, and basically I had to rewrite in block letters. Now I can't control the writing, it either goes up or goes down, and where I try to do a letter, I might be able to do two or three and then it sort of squiggles out. So my own signature is basically a squiggle." A little later I also asked the following questions of Mr Griffin: "HIS HONOUR 
Q. Pardon my interrupting. Could you just have a look at paragraph 11 of your affidavit of 9 October? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. You see that there's a reference there apparently to the document annexed and marked A that you had Ms Upcroft sign in place of your former wife? 
A. Correct.
 
Q. At that time you were living with your wife. Is that right? 
A. That would be about right, about then, yeah.
 
Q. You've given us the explanation for why you had Ms Upcroft sign the document, that you didn't want to bother your former wife-- 
A. That's right.
 
Q. --pardon me, it might be helpful if I finish. You've given us the reason for having Ms Upcroft sign the document, that you didn't want to bother your former wife with it. What did you mean by that? 
A. Well as far as she was concerned, she was finished. Once she signed the document and then she put a letter in of resignation, she was under the impression that she had resigned. And she wasn't in the best of health at the time, she was being treated by doctors, which again can be substantiated, and
I didn't want to come back to her and say, "Hey look, there's still a document out here." We told her, "You're off, it's finished, you're not in the company any more." 
Q. It wouldn't have been a question of not wanting to bother her, but it would have been a question that it would have been inappropriate for her to sign it, wouldn't it? 
A. No, I just didn't want to bother her. I don't how you mean inappropriate for her to sign it.
 
Q. On your account she was no longer a director at that time. Is that right? 
A. That's correct.
 
Q. So asking her to sign it would have been a meaningless exercise? 
A. As it was put to me by Scott it should have been signed before she left, because the paperwork hadn't gone in or hadn't been received or whatever, taking her off as a director." Mr Griffin was further cross-examined about this topic: "Q. (Witness shown exhibit E.) Do you see the declaration there Mr Griffin and where the signature "Lesley Robertson" appears? 
A. Mm.
 
Q. Do you see under there, "This declaration must be completed, signed and dated by a current director"? 
A. I see that, yes.
 
Q. There was no need to bother Mrs Robertson about it was there, she was no longer-- 
A. What do you mean to bother her about it? 
Q. She was no longer a current director according to your evidence? 
A. No, well my evidence is she submitted or we submitted the document and the resignation letter. When this come through Scott told me it hadn't come off the ASIC records, it still showed her to be a director. I did not want to go back to her after telling her and Scott telling her that she was off, and say, "Here's a document here still because the paperwork hasn't gone in or hasn't gone through." 
HIS HONOUR 
Q. I think what's being put to you, is that the document that you had somebody else sign as your former wife, could have been signed by any director of the company at the time provided they were then a current director? 
A. I was told Lesley had to sign it because - no, I was told Lesley had to sign it. You'd have to ask Scott that question." Mr Griffin was also taken to exhibit R and was asked the following questions: "Q. Do you see your signature there, Mr Griffin? 
A. I do.
 
Q. At least, when you were Norman Robertson? 
A. That's correct.
 
Q. That's signed on 26 March 2003? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. This was a document prepared by you after the company was placed in administration? 
A. I haven't read the document. I've read page 1 and whatever it is, the last page.
 
Q. Would you like to read the document? 
A. I see it all here, yes.
 
Q. Paragraph 13, you've nominated the directors who have resigned in the last 2 years. You've put yourself down? 
A. Yeah because I did come off.
 
Q. Also Mrs Robertson, who was a director at that time? 
A. She come off what, in between 2001 and 2003.
 
Q. The question at 13 is, "Name and addresses of directors and secretary who have resigned in the last 2 years?"? 
A. Yeah, she'd be one.
 
Q. Turn the page. See there you've nominated the remuneration that you and
Mrs Robertson received in 2002? 
A. I see that.
 
Q. You both received the same amount or a similar amount of remuneration by way of salary? 
A. That's two sets of books. You referred to-- 
Q. That's not what I'm referring to. What I'm drawing your attention to is that you and Mrs Robertson both received $52,000 in 2002 according to this document? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Mrs Robertson was still paid the same amount as you in that period, ?
 
A. She didn't get any money.
 
Q. She didn't get any money? 
A. No, that was the two sets of books." In his affidavit sworn 2 May 2005 Mr Griffin gave the following curious evidence: "47. I spoke to Scott in about February 2003 and he mentioned something about Lesley still being a Director. I expressed surprise and reminded him about the document Lesley had signed. He said, 'I haven't got it, you never gave it to me'.
 . I was a bit angry at this and said, 'Bull I gave it to you before she went overseas". Scott said, "we'll [sic] I don't remember that but maybe you did and I lost it'.
 . A new document was then prepared by Scott but I can't remember if
Lesley signed it. In any event Lesley was ultimately removed as a Director early in 2003." The apparent conflict between exhibit S on the one hand and the evidence of
Mr Griffin concerning the resignation of the defendant and exhibit C on the other hand was also covered in some detail with Mr Griffin in cross- examination. That appears as follows: "Q. I show you another document, Mr Griffin. See the document I've handed to you is a 'Change to office holders'. See the front? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Is that your signature on the second page at the foot? 
A. It is.
 
Q. You've signed that on 17 February 03, down the bottom? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. On that document, you certify at the foot that the information in the form is true and correct, do you not? 
A. I did.
 
Q. Would you look at the top of the document? 
A. I see that.
 
Q. You've got the name 'Robertson, Lesley', is that your-- 
A. That's correct.
 
Q. In the date that Mrs Robertson ceased to hold office, you put there 17
February 2003? 
A. 2003 simply because Scott hadn't got the paperwork done. So when it came to 2003 we finally - I went and made him get the paperwork and get her off, yes, and that's an open document but she put her thing in in 2000, 2001.
That's there yes. She officially got taken off. I'm not trying to hide that, but the point was the paperwork she submitted in the period that she resigned in the August or whatever, didn't get submitted by Mr McClymont, and that's been my claim all along.
 
Q. Do you see what it says at the top, 'Ceasing to hold office', Doug, 17
February 2003? 
A. I said that.
 
Q. Where did you get this document from? 
A. Scott McClymont.
 
Q. Is that right? Would you have a look at the handwritten number at the top left-hand corner on the front? 
A. 18279.
 
Q. That's your handwriting? 
A. No.
 
Q. Also you see 'out-of-date form'? 
A. I wouldn't know if it's an out-of-date form.
 
Q. Do you see the reference to Corporations Law? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. That's an Act which was repealed at that date? 
A. But how do I know? It's got Corporations Law with numbers and figures. I don't know that's an out-of-date form.
 
Q. Did you pull this out of a drawer? 
A. No, I didn't pull it out of me back pocket either, no. We can both smile." Mr Griffin's credit was a significant issue in the proceedings. He swore affidavits in which he expressly referred to having forged the defendant's signatures on documents by asking others to sign her name. This is referred to earlier. He also admitted to keeping two sets of books for the company. That evidence was as follows: "Q. Paragraph 45 you refer to 2 sets of books. What's the first set of books? 
A. The business.
 
Q. The business? 
A. Hmmm.
 
Q. What the second set of books? 
A. If Lesley was to ask.
 
Q. You kept a second set of books to deceive Mrs Roberson? 
A. Correct.
 
Q. Is that the position? 
A. Correct.
 
Q. What about the taxation department, which books did you show them? 
A. I don't know what the taxation got. I didn't show them anything. I have no dealing with the taxation department. I haven't seen any one from the taxation department." In his 2 May 2005 affidavit Mr Griffin said this: "50. It is with regret that I must admit that during 1999 and 2001 I forged Lesley's signature on a number of documents. This was mainly for convenience and occurred when Lesley was not around or overseas for short periods visiting her mother in 1999 and 2000. I recall I purchased some cars and a BP fuel card using Lesley [sic] signature." 
Consideration 
The defendant's evidence The only evidence that the defendant resigned as a director of the company in approximately September 2001 is the oral and affidavit evidence given by her and Mr Griffin, to the effect that she signed documents prepared by Mr
McClymont and presented to her by Mr Griffin. The documents have never been sighted and Mr McClymont was not called to give evidence.
 In contrast to this evidence, most of the documents that have been tendered support the plaintiff's contention that the defendant did not resign until
February 2003. I find that the defendant signed exhibits D and E. I accept Mr
Dubedat's evidence that the signatures on these documents are those of the defendant. I consider that the defendant's evidence that the signatures on those documents looked like her signature should be preferred to her latter day change of mind about it. I reject the evidence of Mr Griffin that he procured another person to sign these documents for the defendant (see below).
I note that there is no evidence that the defendant signed exhibit G and that there is evidence that she did not. The question of when the defendant ceased to be a director of the company is not informed in any reliable way by exhibit
G.
 The Department of Immigration documents signed by the defendant are ambiguous. The 2001 documents in exhibit L support the defendant's case that she was by then not a director. The 2002 documents are to the opposite effect.
The defendant's explanation that she described her usual occupation as a director because she was flying business class and wanted to feel important is on one view quite believable. However, the defendant was not without business acumen and experience and the attempts by her and Mr Griffin to portray the defendant as his malleable and innocent tool do not strike me as genuine.
However, these documents contradict each other and no inference one way or the other can fairly or confidently be drawn from them in favour of either party.
 Exhibit C is very strong evidence that the defendant was still a director for the financial year ended 30 June 2002. It says that she was. It is dated March 2003, which is around the same time that Mr Griffin was apparently protesting to Mr McClymont that he should have effected the defendant's resignation as a director some years before. It is prepared by Mr McClymont of
Mainstream Taxation & Accountancy Services "[o]n the basis of the information provided by the directors of [the company]". Mr McClymont did not incorporate the information said to have been given to him by Mr
Griffin in the alleged conversation between them in February 2003. I find that that conversation never took place. Exhibit C supports the proposition that the defendant remained as a director at the end of the 2002 financial year and that she had not resigned in September 2001 as she contended.
 I do not rely on exhibit J as supporting the plaintiff's contentions. The document is not the defendant's document. She never adopted it or what it asserted. It speaks in terms of "client" in the singular, notwithstanding the assertion that instructions to write it came from both Mr Griffin and the defendant. Exhibit K is also derivative of material that is not identified. If it relies on documents that are in evidence in these proceedings then the inferences that arise from those documents should be permitted to speak for themselves.
 Exhibit S is a powerful piece of evidence. It is approximately contemporaneous with exhibit C. It was lodged with ASIC. It is presumably the document to which Mr Griffin referred at par [49] of his 2 May 2005 affidavit when he said, "[i]n any event Lesley was ultimately removed as a director early in 2003". The document wholly contradicts the combined version from the defendant and Mr Griffin about what they say occurred in September 2001.
 The defendant's income tax returns are also inconsistent with her case.
They describe her as a company director and her income is disclosed as having been received in that capacity. There is no evidence or suggestion that the defendant was a director of any other company. The same information that is contained in the taxation returns is mirrored in exhibit R. I reject the defendant's evidence that she was paid as an employee "after Christmas 2001, early 2002".
 The evidence of cheques apparently signed in blank by the defendant is not wholly satisfactory. It is associated with the evidence about the defendant going to the bank to have her removed as a signatory to the company's cheque account. I have considerable difficulty accepting much of the evidence about these matters but only in a way that deprives me of any proper understanding of what actually occurred or what significance should be given to it.
Principal among my concerns is the fact that the signatures on very many of the cheques that make up exhibit U do not appear to my inexpert and untrained eye to have been signed by the defendant at all. No expert report was obtained on this question, and the cheques were introduced into evidence at the last minute. I consider that the evidence about the cheques and the visit to the bank produces no inferences of any strength that assist in the resolution of the present issue and I do not rely upon it for any purpose.
 I disbelieve the defendant about having been presented with or having signed documents giving effect to her resignation as a director of the company in or about September 2001. I do not do so on the basis that I was able to discern from her performance in the witness box that she was telling lies about these matters. I take account of the warnings and exhortations contained in cases such as Fox versus Percy <case>; <case> as follows: "[31] Further, in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. Considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events. This does not eliminate the established principles about witness credibility; but it tends to reduce the occasions where those principles are seen as critical." I do so upon the basis that there are unexplained and inexplicable contrasts and contradictions of the defendant's contention that she resigned as a director that are contained in the documents to which I have referred. By way of comparison, the documents on which the defendant places reliance, such as the Department of Immigration records, point in two directions. In my opinion the defendant's evidence cannot stand, or at least cannot do so comfortably, with the inferences and direct facts that arise from exhibits C,
D, E, R and S, and the defendant's income tax returns. Moreover, the unfortunate result of the evidence given by Mr Griffin is that it detracts from the defendant's evidence rather than supports it.
 
Mr Griffin's evidence In contrast to any assistance that is available to me solely from the defendant's demeanour, I have no doubt that Mr Griffin's evidence has been intentionally concocted by him in order to assist her in these proceedings. I have no confidence at all that anything said by him on a relevant and uncorroborated event can be believed. He struck me as willing to say anything at any time in response to questions that forced him to confront difficulties in the case for his former wife as he saw it. I have come to that view wholly accepting the force and binding effect of the wisdom patent in the passage from Fox versus Percy (supra) quoted above. The most obvious manifestation of this is what appears to me to little more than a charade concerning the acquisition of the defendant's signature on a document, or perhaps two documents, in order to "remove" her as a director of the company. However, it is possible in my opinion to reach a similar conclusion about Mr Griffin's evidence on relevant matters without resort to the frailties of inferences and findings based solely upon demeanour. There are a number of examples of how this is so.
 First, Mr Griffin was by his own admission happy to forge the defendant's signature on documents when it suited him. He showed little if any regard for the formalities of corporate administration. The significance of this is not that he was fraudulent or that his conduct was somehow reprehensible. It is that the apparent lengths he says he went to in order to have the defendant execute her resignation as a director show an uncharacteristic and incredible attention to detail not evident elsewhere. The clear and transparent reason for this would appear to be Mr Griffin's concern that the validity of the resignation, that both he and the defendant assert was effected, should not be impugned or invalidated by a defect in its execution.
 Secondly, this approach is in obvious and relevant contrast to the one he took when arranging the execution of documents by others in the defendant's name. These documents were all documents that the defendant sought to rely upon to counter any contention that might be proffered by the plaintiff that they constituted an admission or recognition by the defendant that she was a director at the time they were signed. Exhibits D, E and G are in this category. I have found that exhibit G was not signed by the defendant but that exhibits D and E were. The underlying and illegitimate theme of Mr Griffin's evidence about these documents was that he arranged for them to be signed by others without the defendant's knowledge so that they could arguably not amount to evidence that she performed duties or functions as a director of the company after the time when she asserted that she had resigned.
 Thirdly, much of Mr Griffin's evidence was on its face completely artificial and fabricated. The evidence about confronting Mr McClymont when told by him that he had never received the signed resignation is quite simply just silly. It was an obvious but clumsy attempt to make Mr McClymont appear to be both the reason why, and inferentially at fault because, that document was never lodged with ASIC or somehow otherwise put into effect. This follows from the awkward combination of Mr McClymont's alleged denial that he ever received the document and his later "concession" that he might have received it but probably lost it. Mr Griffin's assertion that the defendant subsequently signed another document to effect her resignation is equally incredible, particularly as the document has never been produced or otherwise verified.
 Fourthly, and with particular relevance to Mr Griffin's evidence, Mr
McClymont was never called to give evidence and there was not even a worthwhile attempt to explain his absence. He had been the accountant for the defendant and Mr Griffin or the company for some time. Mr Griffin said in par [28] of his 2 May 2005 affidavit that he and the defendant had known Mr
McClymont "for approximately ten years" by 2001. He was closely involved in much of the company's affairs until at least March 2003 and could not be thought to be other than in the defendant's camp. I draw the inference that any evidence that could have been given by Mr McClymont would not have assisted the defendant's case in general or Mr Griffin's evidence in particular.
 Fifthly, Mr Griffin admitted that he signed exhibit S on or about 17
February 2003. It was arguably not prepared with the assistance of Mr
McClymont, as the form was out of date at the time, although Mr Griffin says
Mr McClymont prepared it. It would certainly be somewhat curious if Mr
McClymont had not been involved given what Mr Griffin describes Mr McClymont's role otherwise to have been with respect to the company at about that time and the dissatisfaction that Mr Griffin was expressing about Mr McClymont's performance concerning the resignation document that Mr Griffin said he gave him. Preparation of the document by Mr Griffin alone would certainly be inconsistent with the intended inference that Mr Griffin expected Mr McClymont to fix his mistake. In my opinion exhibit S was prepared without Mr
McClymont's involvement. It recites that the defendant ceased to be a director of the company on 17 February 2003. It says nothing about the defendant having ceased to be a director in September 2001. That is material that alone casts all the rest of Mr Griffin's evidence on this topic into serious doubt.
It is incompatible with any version of events from him that the defendant did not remain as a director of the company until 17 February 2003.
 It is not clear what Mr Griffin says is the relationship between exhibit S and his evidence that a new document was prepared by Mr McClymont about which he allegedly said "I can't remember if Lesley signed it". That document is not in evidence but there would in any event have been no need for any other document to be prepared by Mr McClymont once Mr Griffin had lodged exhibit S.
It is also not clear what Mr Griffin meant to convey in par [49] of his 2 May affidavit when he said, "[i]n any event Lesley was ultimately removed as a director early in 2003". That statement is ironically in accordance with exhibit S and is in terms in complete conflict with his evidence that the defendant had resigned in 2001. If exhibit S had been prepared to correct Mr
McClymont's alleged failings in the past to lodge the appropriate documents from September 2001, it is remarkable, and unbelievable, that it did not record the September 2001 date as the date upon which the defendant ceased to hold office with the company.
 Sixthly, exhibit R is also relevant. The document records in Mr Griffin's own handwriting the income received by the defendant as a director of the company until as late as 2002. That is inconsistent with the defendant having ceased to be a director in 2001. Even if the sums for directors' fees are calculated for the income tax year ending June 2002, it is difficult to accept that the whole of the sum of $52,000 allotted to the defendant was only for the period prior to September 2001. This is particularly so because the same amount is allotted to Mr Griffin for that income tax year. Furthermore, Mr
Griffin's "explanation" that the defendant did not actually receive the money, and that it was in effect no more than an illegitimate entry in one of two sets of company books, can be discounted as false by reference to the fact that the defendant herself returned it as income for the relevant tax year.
 Finally, and perhaps most fundamentally, if it were Mr Griffin's understanding that the defendant had resigned as a director of the company in
September 2001, there would have been no need to "forge" her signature on anything. His discovery that the defendant was still a director was on Mr
Griffin's evidence not made by him until 2003 when he had the conversation with Mr McClymont who allegedly told him that he never got the resignation document or might have lost it. According to Mr Griffin, this made him "a bit angry" at the time. This is presumably because he did not know it before then.
If that is to be believed there can be no acceptable explanation of why Mr
Griffin felt the need to use the defendant's signature on exhibit D on 3
October 2001 or on exhibit E on 16 December 2002 as he logically then remained unaware of what he would later discover to be Mr McClymont's alleged omission.
It also flies in the face of the apparent importance or significance implicitly attributed by Mr Griffin to the formalities of the defendant's resignation as a director that led him to require her to sign the documents that he then allegedly returned to Mr McClymont "the following day". I completely reject Mr Griffin's attempts to explain these inconsistencies and contradictions, in particular those appearing in his evidence extracted at pars [72] and [73] above. I accept that exhibit G does not conform to this analysis.
 
Conclusion on the second issue In my opinion the defendant remained a director of the company from 18
March 1999 until at least 17 February 2003.
 
The third issue The defendant relies upon the defence provided by <case> to the extent that she says that she did not take part in the management of the company "for some other good reason". The reason that the defendant proffers as a good reason is that she believed she had resigned as a director on August 2001: see par 5 of the further amended defence. Although a rejection of the defendant's case that she resigned as a director may intersect with her contention that she continued to have a reasonable belief that she had done so, it would not in every case entirely or necessarily foreclose upon the existence of such a belief. However, it does so in this case.
 The defendant correctly contended that this defence does not arise for consideration unless she has failed on the first two issues. She submitted that her belief that she had resigned for the purposes of this argument is to be derived from the same evidence that supported her arguments on these other issues. The defendant submitted that her belief that she had resigned is demonstrated by her listing home duties as her occupation on the earlier immigration document in exhibit L within only months of when she said she resigned. The defendant submitted that a "belief that one has resigned must surely be a good reason for not participating in the management of the company for the purposes of <case>." I am not satisfied that the defendant held such a belief or that she could have done so on reasonable grounds.
 In Power versus DCT (Qld District Court, 12 December 1995, unreported), referred to in DCT versus Clark <case>; <case>,
Morley J made the following comments at pages 3-4 in relation to a defence under this section: "The elements of this defence are that Power, first, must specify some phenomenon, second, prove its existence, third, prove that he did not take part in Power Administration's management, fourth, that he did not do so when, in this case, the directors ought to have caused Power Administration's remittals to have been made, fifth, that his not having taken part was caused by the phenomenon, and, sixth, that that phenomenon was illness or some other good reason within the meaning of that expression in subs 222AOJ (2).
 
Illness has not been suggested to have existed. To be good the alleged reason must be that which would be concluded to have been so by the notional reasonable person's mind acting under appropriate directions about the nature of Power's director's duties and functions in and about the management of the company; so, to constitute a some other good reason the phenomenon particularised and proved to have been in existence must have the quality of justifying a director's not having participated in his or her company's management or of precluding or disabling her or him from so participating.
That just stated is, in my judgment, the manifest legislative intent of the applicable legislation, but particularly of ss 222AOI and 222AOJ." The reason advanced must objectively be a good reason. For example, a total failure to participate for whatever reason should not be regarded as a "good reason": DCT versus Clark (supra). In determining what may be a good reason for not participating in the management of a company, regard must be had to the high standards of care and skill now required of directors. The plaintiff submitted that a director who by a course of conduct is inattentive to the affairs of the company is unlikely to have the benefit of this defence.
For example, it would not be sufficient if the director held a genuine view that he or she had good reason for not participating unless it were a "good reason" when viewed objectively.
 The plaintiff submitted further that if a director were careless or indifferent as to whether or not he or she had resigned it would be insufficient to constitute a "good reason" having regard to the standard of care now required of directors. A director is not entitled to hide behind ignorance of the company's affairs that is of his or her own making, including a failure to make reasonable inquiries: DCT versus Clark (supra). The reason must be good in the sense of being not only "adequate" but also "valid" and "sound".
 The defendant's 3 March 2008 affidavit contained the following: "5 Norman told me it was, 'not a big deal' and 'it was only for a little while'. He said to me words to the effect, 'signing on as a Director would not require any involvement in the day to day running of the Company as Maryanne [the manager] is there to run the Company anyway'.
 I did not feel comfortable with this arrangement but I agreed to do it anyway because I was assured that there would be no problem with this arrangement and it was just a formality." The defendant claimed to have had very little involvement in the day-to- day running of the company. She entrusted that responsibility to others. Her evidence was that her appointment was only to cover the period of her husband's illness. The plaintiff submitted in these circumstances that she also entrusted the responsibility for giving effect to her resignation as a director to others and that her conduct was part of a continuum of behaviour in which she entirely abdicated her responsibilities as a director.
 
The standard of care and skill expected of a director In DCT versus Clark (supra), the Chief Justice had this to say in relation to a similar provision: "[116] The focus of attention must be on what constitutes a "good reason" for a director not to participate in management for the purposes of corporations law. This requires consideration of the duties of directors, particularly in, but not limited to, situations of insolvent trading. In my opinion, the process of interpretation should commence with a recognition that, for the reasons outlined above, it is a basal structural feature of corporations legislation in Australia that directors are expected to participate in the management of the corporation.
 *
 [121] For the reasons I have given above, every director is expected to participate in the management of the company. The test is well expressed in terms of a duty to put himself or herself into a position to guide and monitor the management of the company. Section 588H, and therefore s588FGB, operate on the assumption that that will occur. That is why the defence is only available with respect to non-participation at a specific point of time.
 *
 [137] In my opinion, as at the times that the Corporate Law Reform Act and the Tax Priorities Act were passed, the facts and matters relied upon by the Respondent would not have been regarded as "a good reason" for failing to participate in the management of the company. Total abdication of the duties of a director in reliance on the conduct of a spouse, is not consistent with the duties imposed upon directors by the statute and by case law as each had developed until then.
 *
 [164] The recognition of complete abdication of responsibilities as a director as a "good reason", for purposes of the statutory defences, carries with it the risk of reinforcing gender stereotypes and undermining the confidence with which potential creditors will deal with small companies in which women participate with their husbands. Maintaining a firm position on the duties of directors will encourage the use of single director corporate structures for small business. In my opinion, it is desirable to promote coherence between appearance and reality in corporate practice.
 *
 [167] In my opinion, there is no justification for a doctrine which would hold sleeping directors to be 'de facto non-directors', who should be relieved of their liabilities. Although, as a practical matter, the conduct of such directors may never meet the requisite standard of participation in management, such conduct should not be excused as a "good reason" in law." Hodgson JA also said this at pars [174] - [175]: "[174] Whether a director knows it or not, he or she has a duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence in the discharge of his or her duties, with the standard of reasonableness being largely an objective one. A director's non-participation in the management of the company will usually involve a breach of that duty, whether the director is aware of this or not; although if the non-participation is because of illness or for some other good reason, then there will not be a breach of duty if the illness or other good reason is such as to make the non-participation reasonable, on the same standard of reasonableness.
 [175] In my opinion, a director's non-participation in the management of a company at a particular time will be "because of illness or for some other good reason" within [s.588FGB(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588fgb.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) only if the illness or other good reason is of this character, that is, such as to make the non-participation reasonable (on the appropriate standard) and thus not a breach of the director's duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence." See also DCT versus Green, Fenwick and Reardon (District Court of NSW, 17
June 2005, unreported) per Gibson DCJ at pars [67] and [88] and DCT v
Bartolotta; DCT versus Romeo (District Court of NSW, 8 May 2006, unreported) per
Robison DCJ at pages 48 and 52.
 As a general proposition I do not consider that a director's mistaken belief or understanding that he or she had resigned as a director could qualify as "some other good reason" for the purposes of <case>.
Fundamentally resignation is an act of and by the director concerned. It is an act that by definition can only be performed by a director and in the director's capacity as such. It attracts the same degree of care and attention as all or any other acts performed by a company director during the currency of the directorship. The successful resignation of a director will have immediate consequences for the company and for the director concerned from the time that the resignation becomes effective.
 The resignation of a director is governed by the constitution of the company, which usually allows for notice in writing to the company. The company's constitution was not in evidence before me and no reference was made to it during submissions. [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s203a.html) of the [[Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) [2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides that a director may resign by giving written notice to the company.
The section applies as a replaceable rule - see [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s135.html)
Even if the company's constitution stipulates notice in writing, a director may resign verbally if the company accepts the resignation: Knight v
Bulic [(1994) 13 ACSR 553]; Re
Aero Marine Consulting Pty Ltd <case>
Again, subject to the company's constitution, a director may resign at any time.
 The plaintiff submitted that the defendant could not in the present case rely upon an ineffective resignation and that whatever the formal requirements for resignation may have been, the defendant could not assign ultimate responsibility for their performance or compliance with them to others. That proposition does not appear to me to be attended with significant controversy.
However, in the particular circumstances of this case, it does not fall to be considered. This is because I do not accept that the defendant resigned as a director of the company prior to 17 February 2003. Her participation in a resignation, her knowledge of the formalities or otherwise required of her or of others in order to effect her resignation, and the extent of her reliance, if any, upon Mr Griffin and/or Mr McClymont in order to perfect it are not therefore matters that assume significance.
 The defendant remained as a director and executed documents that were relevant to her personal affairs in a way that was inconsistent with a belief on her part that she had resigned. As I have indicated, the defendant was paid and returned as income the fees that she received from the company for the services she provided as a director. The defendant's evidence reveals that during the period that even she accepts she was a director, she did perform duties in her capacity as such. These included the signing of cheques and other documents. The defendant may have expressed reluctance to be a director and may neither have fully appreciated nor understood the extent of her role in the affairs of the company or the consequences of failing properly to attend to them, but she became a director nevertheless. The defendant remained a director of the company not because she failed to ensure an effective resignation despite a belief to the contrary but because she did not resign at all. Even if the defendant considered herself to be a sleeping director from a time when Mr Griffin's health permitted him to resume a more active role in the company's affairs, she was still a director.
 In the light of the clear statements of principle in cases such as DCT v Clark (supra), the defendant cannot have had and did not have "some other good reason" for not taking part in the management of the company during the time that she was a director up to and including 17 February 2003.
 
Conclusion on the third issue The defendant is not entitled to rely upon a defence under <case> of the ITAA.
 
Orders It follows that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the amount claimed. There should be a verdict for the plaintiff for that amount, subject to any variation of it since the date of the hearing. The question of costs also remains to be considered.
 In the circumstances I will direct the parties to bring in short minutes of order that give effect to my reasons, including the question of costs if that issue is capable of agreement between them. If it is not, or if there are other matters that require further orders or elucidation that cannot be agreed, the matter should be listed before me by arrangement with my Associate at some time convenient to the parties and the Court.
