JUDGE1
MAHONEY JA The applicant Kim Michelle Drayton was employed by the respondent company on 30 July 1986 as a motor vehicle detailer. Her work involved the cleaning of cars, motors, upholstery and other portions of motor vehicles prior to their presentation for sale. It involved the use of acids, heavy detergents and tyre paints. From this work she developed dermatitis.
She claimed weekly compensation upon the basis of partial incapacity and a lump sum payment pursuant to [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/).
On 28 March 1994 Johns J awarded her weekly payments of compensation but rejected her claim for an award under [s 66.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) The applicant has appealed to this
Court against his Honour's refusal to make the [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) award. There is no appeal against the award of weekly compensation payments.
In order to understand what his Honour did and the submissions made on this appeal, it is necessary to refer in some detail to the facts and to his
Honour's findings.
The applicant gave detailed evidence as to the development of the dermatitis and her condition at the date of trial. His Honour accepted her evidence "insofar as I find it consistent with the expressions of the opinions of the dermatologists in that the applicant suffers from a contact dermatitis as a consequence of contact with substances in her employment with the respondent". What his Honour there said is to an extent ambiguous. However, I understand what his Honour there said to constitute a finding that the applicant was a credible and honest witness. The contrary was not suggested during the oral argument of the appeal.
It is not in contest before this Court that the dermatitis resulted from her work. The condition developed over a period. In 1986, her fingertips became raw and itchy. In October 1986, on the advice of Dr Boyd, she used cream to protect her and subsequently ointments. By June 1987 her condition had deteriorated and she saw Dr Pallas. In or about December 1987 stronger chemicals were used and, she said, her hands became worse. In April 1988 she saw Dr McGeoch whose care she was under until mid-1990. She ceased working for about two and a half weeks and, within two days of resuming employment, the dermatitis reappeared, on her fingertips and down the insides of each finger.
On 23 May 1988 she saw a specialist Dr Bartlett and he prescribed further treatment. Her employment with the respondent was terminated on 29 August .
The termination of the employment did not end the dermatitis. Between May and December 1988 her hands were "red raw, chafed, bleeding, dry, painful".
She could not shower herself or use her hands for washing up or washing.
Symptoms of the dermatitis continued up to the date of the trial, 28 March .
The existence and extent of the symptoms varied from time to time. She had a hobby working on motor cycles and motor vehicles and "for a long time I could not even touch a car". "Even handling money was a problem" during the period. She took work as a postal delivery officer but could not grip the handlebars of a push-bike because "the condition was coming back again". She had problems during the whole of 1989, her hands being always dry, cracking and tender and liable to split open and tear "if I just caught them on a door or something". During that year she was not able to work as a motor mechanic "to the full extent": if she did that work she had to "put up with the pain, so I avoided it as much as possible".
She was restricted in playing in a soccer team because, if she fell to the ground, her hands would dry and became cracked and chafed.
Subsequently, in August 1990, she obtained employment with a company involved in making and fitting domestic blinds. Her condition improved but she still got "problems occasionally if I come in contact with anything that I haven't realised that I come in contact with somewhere along the line, then it flares up". She has blistering on the fingers and the webbing of the hands and they become itchy "and then I wake up in the middle of the night bleeding".
She has had to change her ordinary habits: she uses plastic knives and forks rather than metal cutlery. At the time of the hearing, her condition was such that she has "flare ups occasionally when you are exposed to dry, windy conditions". She now cannot wear gold jewellery or silver and confines herself to "stainless steel stuff".
His Honour had evidence in written form from a number of medical practitioners. In some respects at least his Honour expressed a preference for the views of Dr Kossard. However, in his judgment he referred to the views of other doctors, eg, Dr Evans.
The effect of the evidence given by the practitioners was not completely clear and his Honour's findings in relation to matters in dispute upon the appeal have been the subject of contest.
However, in my opinion, the findings upon which the appeal should proceed, as on a rehearing, are generally as follows. As the result of the employment, the plaintiff now has a permanent condition of dermatitis.
She is not at all times subject to the symptoms of that condition: as his Honour held, "there is no doubt that at times the applicant is free of symptoms". However, symptoms appear from time to time. They appear when she is in relevant contact with nickel and chrome.
She is, in the ordinary course of life, brought in contact with nickel: as Dr Kossard said, "it is almost impossible to avoid contact with nickel and nickel is quite commonly taken in with food substances".
Her symptoms do not appear only when she is in contact with nickel and chrome: they appear from time to time when there is "no evident exposure" to those materials. Her sensitivities have, in effect, extended beyond the substances which initially gave rise to the dermtitis. In the evidence there was and perhaps could be no clear specification of the other substances or other circumstances by reference to which the condition "flared up" but it is, in my opinion, to be accepted that the effect of the evidence is that there have been "flare ups" in the absence of nickel and chrome.
The inference I would draw from the evidence as a whole is that symptoms will appear whenever nickel and chrome are present. It is not clear when, in the absence of these substances, the symptoms will always appear but from time to time they do.
As I have said, the symptoms are not always present. When they are present, the intensity of them and their effect upon the applicant varies.
Sometimes they are, I think, seriously disabling; on other occasions, they appear to be less so and she can, with restrictions, carry on her ordinary activities.
I have detailed these findings as the findings on which the Court should proceed as on a rehearing.
It may, in my opinion, not be possible to point to a specific passage in a medical report to support literally in terms each of those findings. The medical practitioners have not spelled out in detail the general principles involved and proceeded from them step by step to their conclusions in respect of the applicant's case: it was not necessary that they do so. They have, I think, assumed a background of knowledge in those to whom their reports have been addressed. It is tempting to think that they assumed that it would be known that in some or many cases a dermatitis condition may develop from an initial sensitivity to one substance or class of substances through a sensitivity to an increasing number of substances to a general condition in which symptoms are present frequently. However,
I put that aside.
What is said in the reports is not completely consistent but from the reports which the judge accepted and which this Court should accept, inferences can be drawn to the effect of what I have said.
I come now to consider whether, upon the basis of these findings, an order can and should be made under [s 66.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html)
The learned judge refused such an order. His Honour said: "It seems to me, given the fluctuating nature of this condition, a particular loss or a specific loss cannot be quantified.
Because the symptoms are intermittent, the restrictions are transient, and it could not be said that the reduced risk can be properly characterised as a loss of the efficient use of her hands." 
His Honour then said: "It has also been suggested that as the applicant suffers an incapacity for a particular employment as described in [s 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s47.html) there must necessarily result a loss of use of the applicant's hands."
It is agreed that [s 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s47.html) may, for present purposes, be put aside.
His Honour then said: "What is referred to is permanent physical loss and not the individual's loss of earning power. For those reasons it seems to me that the particular condition from which the applicant undoubtedly suffers does not, as a consequence, result in a loss of use of her hands within the meaning of the Act. For those reasons I decline to award lump sum entitlements pursuant to [s 66."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html)
His Honour's reasons raise for consideration an important aspect of the operation of [s 66.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) Counsel have informed the Court that there is no decision which deals with the matter.
As far as is here relevant, the significant provisions of the Act are as follows. The basic entitlement to compensation of the kind now claimed is established by [s 66(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) That sub-section provides: "66 (1). A worker who has suffered the loss of a thing mentioned in the Table to this Division as the result of an injury is entitled to receive from the worker's employer by way of compensation for the loss in addition to any other compensation under this Act the amount equal to the percentage of $... set out opposite to that loss in that
Table." [Section 65(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s65.html) extends the meaning of "loss". It provides: "65 (1). In this Division: "loss", in relation to a thing, means: the loss of that thing; or the permanent loss of the use, or of the efficient use, of that thing."
The Table referred to appears following [s 73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s73.html) of the Act. It specifies the "permanent injuries" to which [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) applies. It tabulates, in columns, the "nature of injury" in question and the "percentage of maximum amount payable", ie, the percentage of the total amount specified in [s 66(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) from time to time which is payable for the "loss" in question. The Table specifies losses of various kinds: it includes, inter alia, losses of speech, sensory loss, hearing loss, loss of vision, arm injury, hand injuries and the like. The loss here in question is specified, under the heading "hand injuries" as "loss of right hand" and "loss of left hand".
Two things may be said about the scheme of this part of the Act. First it will be seen from the definition of "loss" in [s 65(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s65.html) that compensation is payable in respect of two distinct things: the actual or physical loss of the capacity or body part referred to in the Table; and the loss of the "use" or "the efficient use" of "that thing". Second, the scheme is not limited to a total loss of a thing or the use of it. The legislative scheme is extended by the terms of <case>. That section provides for compensation for the proportionate loss of the thing or the use of the thing in question. It provides: "68 (1). If a loss suffered by a worker consists of the loss of a proportion (but not all) of a thing mentioned in the
Table to this Division a percentage of the compensation payable for the total loss of the thing equal to the percentage lost by the worker is payable as compensation under [s 66."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html)
The applicant's argument before this Court has proceeded upon the basis that compensation is sought under par (b) of the definition of "loss" in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s65.html), that is sought for "the permanent loss of the use, or of the efficient use, of the applicant's two hands". As I understand the argument, it has not been suggested that there has been a total loss of the use of either hand or a total loss of the efficient use of either hand; the suggestion has been that there has been "the loss of a proportion" of the use or the efficient use of each hand. The Table provides respectively for the loss of the right hand to be compensable by a maximum of seventy per cent of the [s 66(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) amount and for the loss of the left hand of sixty-five per cent of it. (It is not necessary to refer to par (b) of the notes at the bottom of the Table).
As I have indicated, the learned judge refused the [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) application because the loss "cannot be quantified"; because "the symptoms are intermittent, the restrictions are transient" and, his Honour concluded, that meant that "the reduced risk" cannot be "properly characterised as a loss of the efficient use of her hands". Counsel for the worker, Mr Leslie QC, put the matter somewhat differently. His submission was essentially to the effect that from time to time the symptoms of the dermatitis were not present, that accordingly there was during those times no loss of the use or the efficient of the hands, and accordingly that if and insofar as there was a "loss" within the legislation, it was not a "permanent" loss of the use or the efficient use of the hands. The submission pointed to the fact that for some periods the use of the hands was not restricted by. sips or symptoms of the dermatitis and, it was submitted, this meant that the loss of the use of the hands which resulted from the signs and symptoms of the dermatitis was not "permanent".
These views of the operation of the provisions require a closer examination of how the provisions operate and in particular of the way in which the definition of "loss" operates upon [s 66(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) Where what is claimed is compensation, not for the physical loss of a hand, but for the loss of the use or efficient use of a hand, [s 66(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html), extended by the relevant part of the definition of "loss", effectively provides: "66 (1) A worker who has suffered (the permanent loss of the use or of the efficient use) of a (right hand) as the result of an injury is entitled to receive from the worker's employer by way of compensation for the loss ....".
It is, in my opinion, clear in the present case that the applicant did not suffer the loss of the use or the efficient use of either hand in the sense that she suffered a total loss of the use of it. She continued to be able to use her hands during the periods when the signs and symptoms of the dermatitis were not present and she could use them in respect of matters which were not apt to produce a "flare up" of those signs and symptoms. Accordingly if the applicant was to succeed, the argument accepted, I think, that her condition must be shown to fall within the provisions as to "proportionate loss of use" in <case>.
Read literally, the terms of <case> provide for the proportionate loss only of "a thing mentioned in the Table ..."; the provision does not, read literally, operate where what is involved is not the physical loss of a proportion of a hand but the loss of a proportion of the use or efficient use of the hand. However, it was in my opinion the intention of the legislature that <case> should apply to cases of the latter kind. The sub-section refers to "the loss of a proportion (but not all) of a thing ... " and not of the use or efficient use of a thing. But it was intended to apply both to the loss of the thing and the loss of the use of it. There is no reason in function or policy why <case> should have been intended to be limited to the loss of a
thing but not to the secondary "loss" referred to in [s 65(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s65.html) The Act is part of a beneficial scheme of legislation intended to provide benefits for injured workers and there is no apparent reason why those benefits should be limited to loss of use or efficient use where what is lost is the total and not "a proportion" of the use to which the hand could be put.
One of the purposes of <case> was in my opinion to avoid, to an extent, the cases of "double litigation" which arose out of the form of the 1926 Act.
Under that Act, an injured worker would ordinarily claim compensation before the Workers Compensation Commission and, in a separate proceeding, damages in the Supreme or the District Court. One of the objectives sought to be achieved by the 1987 Act was to enable an injured worker to recover, in the one proceeding, both compensation and the equivalent of common law damages. Double litigation would be to that extent avoided. A construction of <case> which allowed that to be done only where there was a total loss of use or efficient use of, eg, a hand and not where the loss was partial, in the sense of loss of the efficient use in contact with, eg, nickel, water or the like, would be one which would tend to defeat the purpose or one of the purposes of the legislation.
I have spelled out what in my opinion is the operation of these provisions in order to make clear the extent to which they operate in the case of the loss of use or effective use of a thing and the way in which they operate. In this regard, the applicant's case falls within the operation of the provisions.
But there remains the question whether the loss of use or efficient use which she has established constitutes "the permanent loss" of that use or efficient use.
More accurately, it remains to determine whether the proportion of loss or efficient use which she has established constitutes a "permanent loss" within the definition of "loss" in <case>.
In my opinion it does. The loss of use which she suffers is permanent in the sense that it is a condition causing loss of use which is operative at all relevant times. I do not by this intend to equate "condition" to the term used by the statute, namely, "loss". But, in the present case, the loss of use arises because of the existence - and existence at all relevant times - of the condition that she has. That condition is such that, when in contact with the relevant substances and often otherwise, she cannot use her hands for the relevant purposes. Because of the frequency with which the condition produces the result upon her, she cannot use her hands for the relevant (economic) purposes in contemplation of the legislation.
Therefore her loss of the use or efficient use of the hands is permanent.
In my opinion the worker should succeed upon the relevant aspect of the appeal. The Court should direct that the proceeding be stood over for fourteen days from the date on which this judgment is delivered. During that time the parties should file in the Registry short minutes of the order to be made to give effect to the conclusions to which I have referred. If the parties are agreed upon the orders to be made, such orders may be made either by the Court or by chamber order. If it is not possible for the parties to agree upon the orders to be made, the proceeding should be returned to the Compensation Court to make such orders as are appropriate to give effect to the conclusions to which I have referred.
The worker should have an order for the costs of the appeal. The employer should, if entitled, have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act.
