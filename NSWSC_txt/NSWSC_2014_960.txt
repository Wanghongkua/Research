JUDGMENT 
The Claims
HIS HONOUR: These reasons relate to proceedings in which a family provision order pursuant to the [Succession Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)") is sought by two Plaintiffs, Mark Andrew Jones and Martin Conrad Jones, out of the estate of their mother, Yvonne Jones ("the deceased"). A family provision order is an order made by the court in relation to the estate, or notional estate, of a deceased person, to provide from that estate and/or notional estate, for the maintenance, education, or advancement in life, of an eligible person. (In fact, in this case, there is no property that may be designated as notional estate.) The [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) applies in respect of the estate of a person who died on, or after, 1 March 2009. The [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) replaces the [Family Provision Act 1982](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) ("the former [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)"), which was repealed, effective from 1 March 2009.
The proceedings were commenced by one Summons filed on 25 July 2013, within the time prescribed by the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) (within 12 months of the deceased's death).
The Defendant named in the proceedings is Antony Donald Jones, who is also a son of the deceased. He was appointed, in the last Will of the deceased, as the executor. However, no grant of administration in respect of the deceased's Will has been made.
The Plaintiffs did not seek to amend the Summons, to seek an additional order under [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s91.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) (an order for a grant of administration in respect of the estate of the deceased to the applicant(s) for the purposes only of permitting the application concerned to be dealt with), although the matter was raised at the commencement of the hearing. However, the Defendant indicated that, if the court were satisfied that such an order should be made, he did not oppose the making of an order that enabled the Plaintiff's application to be dealt with. I shall return to this aspect later in these reasons.
The following form of orders was necessary, in any event, and was made, since it was clear that a deceased person's estate had an interest in the proceedings, but was not represented: "Order, pursuant to [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) ('UCPR'), [rule .10(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s7.10.html), that the Defendant be appointed to represent the deceased's estate and notional estate for the purposes of these proceedings.

Any order subsequently entered or made in the proceedings binds the deceased person's estate to the same extent as the estate would have been bound had a personal representative of the deceased person been the Defendant in the proceedings."
Without intending to convey undue familiarity, with no disrespect intended, for convenience, and for clarity, I shall refer, hereafter, to the parties and family members, after introduction, by his, or her, given name or by the role he plays in the proceedings.
The hearing proceeded with the reading of the affidavit evidence filed. There were only a few objections to parts of the affidavits that needed to be ruled upon. The cross-examination of each of the Plaintiffs and of the Defendant then occurred. Two other deponents, whose affidavits were read, were asked some questions on eligibility and were cross-examined, but extremely briefly. Finally, counsel made oral submissions in support of the written submissions, which are retained in the court file. The estimated duration of the hearing was one day, and the proceedings were concluded within that time.

Formal Matters
I shall commence by outlining the following facts that are uncontroversial.
The deceased died on 26 July 2012. She was then aged 63 years having been born in 1949. 
The deceased was married to the father of the parties, Gwynfor Jones, on a date not disclosed in the evidence. There were four children of the marriage, namely Mark, Martin, Karina Patricia Jones, and Antony.
The deceased and her husband separated and, subsequently, in about 1980, a divorce order was made. No evidence was given concerning whether the deceased and her husband had a property settlement at, or about, the time of the dissolution of their marriage.
The deceased left a Will that she made on 19 July 2012 ("the Will"). The Will provided for a pecuniary legacy of $20,000 to each of Mark, Martin, and Karina. The residue of the estate was divided equally between Antony and two of the grandchildren of the deceased, namely Nakia Misty Sarah Camelia Jones and Ashley Dean Jones, each of whom is a child (now adult) of Karina. 
Antony gave evidence that he had been unable to finalise the administration of the estate because he was not in a position "to pay the solicitor's bill". He added, in answers to questions from the Bench, that he had found it "very hard" to deal with the deceased's death and the administration of the deceased's estate. He acknowledged that he appreciated that, now, "this must be done". He said, and I accept, that, although it will be hard for him to do so, he realises Probate must be obtained and the estate property sold, debts, funeral and testamentary expenses paid, and the net proceeds of sale distributed.
Apparently, Antony's current solicitors may agree to act for him in obtaining Probate, even though the costs and disbursements thereof may only be payable once Probate is granted and the estate property is sold. Undoubtedly, it would be of benefit to the parties and the other beneficiaries if this were to occur.
I have dealt with the requirement for a grant of administration to be made in order to deal with an application for a family provision order in Wheat versus Wisbey <case>, at [29] - [60]. I shall not repeat what I said in that case. 
The parties submitted, and I accept, that, in the circumstances of this case, it is necessary for an order for administration to be made. The court should be satisfied that it is proper for the following orders to be made: "Pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s91.html) [Succession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) , that administration in respect of the estate and notional estate of the deceased, Yvonne Jones, be granted to each of the Plaintiffs, for the purposes only of permitting his application for a family provision order to be dealt with.

Orders that compliance with the Court Rules in relation to the preceding order be dispensed with."
I propose to make each of these orders.
(I should mention that <case> permits an order for administration to be made "in respect of the estate of the deceased person ... to the applicant for the purposes only of permitting the application concerned to be dealt with". I consider that the application referred to is the application for a family provision order, rather than the application for the grant. It would be more practical and expedient if the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provided for the grant to be made "to any suitable person". This would enable, in a case such as this, involving a grant made for the purposes only of permitting the application concerned to be dealt with, for the grant to be made to the Defendant. In a case where there was only notional estate, the court could make the grant to the holder of the property that the Plaintiff seeks to be designated as notional estate since that person is, usually, a party to the proceedings. In my view, the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) should be amended accordingly.)
Although there is no Inventory of Property disclosed to the court under [s 81A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/s81a.html) of the [Probate and Administration Act 1898](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/) , in an affidavit sworn 22 October 2013, Antony stated that the property owned solely by the deceased at the date of her death, had an estimated (or known) gross value of $283,000. The deceased's actual estate was said to consist of real estate at Ulladulla ($280,000) ("the Ulladulla property"), a motor vehicle ($800), household contents and personal effects ($2,500) and money in bank ($51). (I have omitted, and shall continue to omit, any reference to cents, which explains what may appear to be minor mathematical errors.)
In the same affidavit, Antony stated that there are estate liabilities of $16,931, being council rates ($6,711), water accounts ($4,435), electricity accounts ($347), a telephone account ($170), and what are described as "testamentary expenses", being funeral and cremation costs, paid by Gwynfor ($5,266), which costs are to be repaid to him. These liabilities have not yet been paid, as there have been no available funds in the deceased's estate. They must be paid out of the proceeds of sale of the Ulladulla property.
The parties agreed, also, that there are likely to be costs of obtaining Probate and associated administration expenses ($4,682).
The Ulladulla property is described in the evidence as a single level brick veneer home with a land size of 648 square metres. It is said to be "in poor condition". It has three bedrooms, an open plan lounge and dining room, with a small kitchen. There is also a bathroom with a bath and shower, a separate toilet, internal laundry, carport and fenced yard. It needs maintenance, such as painting and new carpets. The cook top and oven need replacing, as does the vanity in the bathroom.
At the commencement of the hearing, the parties agreed that the estimated current gross value of the Ulladulla property is $267,000. They also agreed that, when the Ulladulla property was sold, there would be costs and expenses of sale, including agent's commission, advertising and associated expenses, and legal costs (in total, $7,500), which are testamentary, or administration, expenses. 
The parties also agreed that the estimated current value of the motor vehicle, which is presently unregistered, is $600.
It was also agreed, by the parties, that the legacy of $20,000 to Karina should not bear the burden of the provision, if any, made for either Plaintiff.
In the event that provision is made for one, or both, of the Plaintiffs, I raised with the parties the possibility that the Ulladulla property could sell for more, or for less, than the agreed estimated gross value, with the result that some, or other, of the beneficiaries, might be detrimentally affected by its actual sale price if a family provision order by way of lump sum were made. I suggested that it would be prudent, in the event that either Plaintiff was, or both Plaintiffs were, successful, to provide him with a percentage of the net proceeds of sale (which phrase could be defined). Such additional orders as are considered necessary to adjust the interests of any person affected by the family provision order and to be just and equitable to all persons affected by the order (the residuary beneficiaries) may then be made. Consequently, all of the beneficiaries would benefit if the Ulladulla property were sold for a greater price than had been estimated, or all would be detrimentally affected if it sold for less. 
After obtaining instructions, each of the parties stated, through their, or his, counsel, respectively, that any lump sum to be paid, whether absolutely or otherwise, should be calculated by reference to a percentage of the actual net proceeds of sale. An order should be made in lieu of the provision made for each in the Will of the deceased and adjustment orders could also be made. I am prepared to follow this course.
In calculating the value of the actual estate, finally available for distribution, the costs of the present proceedings should also be considered, since the Plaintiffs, if successful, normally, will be entitled to an order that their costs and disbursements, calculated on the ordinary basis, be paid, whilst the Defendant, as the person representing the estate in the proceedings, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings, normally, will be entitled to an order that his costs, calculated on the indemnity basis, be paid out of the estate of the deceased.
The Plaintiffs' solicitor, Mr J Isabella, in an affidavit sworn on 23 May 2014, estimated their costs and disbursements of the proceedings, including counsel's fees, calculated on the ordinary basis, to be about $46,500 (inclusive of GST and upon the basis of a one day hearing).
I shall refer, later in these reasons, to Practice Note SC Eq 7 and the general rules on costs in an estate with a value of less than $500,000. (The Defendant had made submissions to the effect that the costs and disbursements of the Plaintiffs, in the event that one or both are successful, should be capped.)
During the submissions, counsel for the Plaintiffs informed me that her instructing solicitor had agreed to cap the Plaintiffs' costs and disbursements at $40,000 and that they would not be charged any additional amount. In all the circumstances, and bearing in mind the size of the estate, that was an appropriate, yet generous, gesture made by their legal representatives.
The Defendant's counsel then informed me that it was agreed that, in the event the Plaintiffs succeeded, those costs, capped at the amount of $40,000, should be paid out of the deceased's estate.
The Defendant's solicitor, Ms R A Ferguson, in an affidavit sworn on 16 June 2014, estimated his costs and disbursements, including counsel's fees, calculated on the indemnity basis, to be about $19,527 (inclusive of GST and upon the basis of a one day hearing). It was agreed that, whatever the result of the case, those costs and disbursements should be paid out of the deceased's estate.
It can be seen that, if the sale proceeds are $267,000, and the car has a value of $600, the gross estate has an estimated value of $267,600. There must be deducted the costs and expenses of sale ($7,500); the costs and expenses of obtaining Probate ($4,682); the debts, funeral and testamentary expenses ($16,931); the legacy to Karina ($20,000) and the total costs and disbursements of the parties ($59,527). This leaves an estimated amount of about $158,960 available, from which any order in favour of each Plaintiff may be made. The parties agreed that it was this amount that could be used as a guide in determining each Plaintiff's claim for a family provision order. 
The parties agreed that the only eligible persons who have commenced proceedings under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) are Mark and Martin. Of course, each of Antony and Karina, as a child of the deceased, is also an eligible person, but neither has commenced proceedings. However, as each is a beneficiary named in the Will, the court will not disregard his and her interests. (Since Karina will receive the pecuniary legacy to which she is entitled under the Will, it is unnecessary to consider her position in any detail.)
Nakia, a grandchild of the deceased, lived with the deceased from when she was in year 5 until she completed her Higher School Certificate, a period of 10 years. When the question whether she was an eligible person was raised, counsel for the Defendant sought leave ask Nakia some questions about her "dependency" upon the deceased. Having heard that evidence, I am satisfied that she was partly dependent upon the deceased and, therefore, is an eligible person.
Ashley, a grandchild of the deceased, lived with the deceased from when he was 9 until he was 18 years of age, and then again for two years subsequently. He says nothing else about that period in which he was living with the deceased. When the question whether he was an eligible person was raised, counsel for the Defendant sought leave ask Ashley some questions about his dependency upon the deceased. Having heard that evidence, I am satisfied that he, too, was partly dependent upon the deceased and, therefore, is an eligible person.
Even if I were wrong in reaching that conclusion, as each is a beneficiary named in the Will, the court will not disregard her, and his, interests. Each has sworn an affidavit that has been read in the proceedings. Neither was cross-examined on its contents.
Later in these reasons, I shall refer to the claim of each of the residuary beneficiaries as a competing claimant.
Gwynfor, as a former spouse of the deceased is also an eligible person. There was no evidence that he had been served with a notice of the Plaintiffs' application, and of the court's power to disregard any interest that he may have, in the manner and form prescribed by the regulations or rules of court. However, Antony gave oral evidence that Gwynfor was aware of the Plaintiffs' application and that he had told Antony that he did not intend to make any application for provision out of the estate of the deceased. I accept this evidence.
In any event, bearing in mind the date of the dissolution of the marriage, I am satisfied that service of any such notice is unnecessary in the circumstances of the case. I propose to disregard his interest as a person by, or in respect of whom, an application for a family provision order may be made but who has not made an application.

The Statutory Scheme - The [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)
Next, I shall discuss the statutory scheme that is relevant to the facts of the present case. Although I have set out most of what I state hereunder in other cases, in view of the importance of this case to the parties, I shall repeat the principles. It is equally important that they are able to follow the reasoning and for each to be satisfied that I have considered the evidence and the submissions in the application.
The former [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) was repealed by [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sapa2008406/s5.html) of the [Succession Amendment (Family Provision) Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sapa2008406/) . A new Chapter 3 was added to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), which dealt with the topic of family provision from deceased estates. The long title of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) describes that new Chapter as one to ensure that adequate provision is made for the members of the family of a deceased person, and certain other persons, from the estate of the deceased person. Importantly, this should not be taken to mean that the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) confers, upon those persons, a statutory entitlement to receive a certain portion of a deceased person's estate. Nor does it impose any limitation on the deceased's power of disposition by his, or her, Will. It is only if the statutory conditions are satisfied, that the court is empowered, under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), to alter the deceased's disposition of his, or her, estate, to produce a result that is consistent with the purpose of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). Even then, the court's power to do so is discretionary.
[Section 58(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s58.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provides that an application for a family provision order must be made not later than 12 months after the date of the death of the deceased person, unless the court otherwise orders on sufficient cause being shown. There is no dispute that these proceedings were commenced within time.
The key provision is [s 59](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). The court must be satisfied, first, that each applicant is an eligible person within the meaning of [s 57(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s57.html) (s [59](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html)(1)(a)). In New South Wales, it is a multi-category based eligibility system, rather than one with a general category of eligibility (as it is, for example, in Victoria). There are six categories of persons by, or on whose behalf, an application may be made.
Relevantly, in this case, Mark and Martin each relies upon the category of eligibility referred to in [s 57(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s57.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), namely that he is a child of the deceased. The language of the relevant section is expressive of the person's status, as well as his relationship to the deceased. There is no age limit placed on a child making an application. There is no dispute that each is an eligible person and, therefore, has the standing to bring the present proceedings.
Relevantly to this case, it is only if eligibility is found, that the court must determine whether adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the applicant has not been made by the Will of the deceased, or by the operation of the intestacy rules in relation to the estate of the deceased, or both [(s 59(1)(c)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) It is this mandatory legislative imperative that drives the ultimate result and it is only if the court is satisfied of the inadequacy of provision, that consideration is given to whether to make a family provision order [(s 59(2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) Only then may "the Court ... make such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased person as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made". 
Allsop P, in Andrew versus Andrew  <case>; [(2012) 81 NSWLR 656], commented, at [6]: "... the expression of the task in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) is subtly different from the previous legislation. A prohibition against making an order unless satisfied of circumstances of an evaluative character, is different in emphasis from a permission to make an order if satisfied of circumstances of an evaluative character... The exercise of power to make the order is conditioned on the Court being satisfied of certain things in [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html)
The order that may be made is described in [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html)
The two elements are described in [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) as 'whether to make [an] ... order and the nature of any ... order.' [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) provides a detailed body of considerations for the task in [s ."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html)
Basten JA, at [26], put the differences this way: "As appears from the language of the relevant provisions set out at [66]-[67] below, the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) differs from the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) in three significant respects. First, although both conferred similar powers on the Court, the conditions of their exercise differ. The [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) required that the Court 'shall not make an order ... unless it is satisfied that' the provision made by the testator is 'inadequate': [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s9.html)
The [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provides that the Court 'may ... make a family provision order ... if the Court is satisfied that' the testator has not made 'adequate provision' for the applicant: [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html)
The changes in language may have been intended to remove double negatives, but there is a resultant change in emphasis. The apparent effect is to widen the discretion vested in the court. That which could satisfy a court that the provision made is 'not adequate', for the purposes of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), might not have been sufficient to remove the prohibition under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/), which operated in the absence of affirmative satisfaction that the provision was 'inadequate'. There may well be no bright line boundary between adequacy and inadequacy."
Barrett JA, at [82] - [86], said: "The court's task under the new legislation is in substance the same as that under the old. Three differences relevant to the kind of case under discussion may, however, be noted (I leave to one side as irrelevant to such cases the extension of the <case> criteria to the question of 'eligible person' status); and two postulated differences may be rejected.

First, the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provisions direct attention, upon the initial inquiry into adequacy, to provision made by the deceased's will and the intestacy laws. The former legislation referred merely to provision 'out of the estate' but it was clear that the operation of the intestacy laws was to be taken into account in deciding what provision was available 'out of the estate': see, for example, Smilek versus Public Trustee <case> 
Second, the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provisions confine attention, upon that initial inquiry, to provision made by the will and the intestacy laws. There is no reference to provision made during the deceased's lifetime. In this respect, there is a departure from the [Family
Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) approach under which provision made in favour of the eligible person 'either during the person's lifetime or out of the person's estate' was to be examined upon the initial inquiry into adequacy.

Attention may, however, still be given to provision made in favour of the applicant during the deceased's lifetime. That is now one of the factors to which regard may be had under <case>(b) when the court is deciding whether to make a family provision order and the nature of the order: see <case>(i).
Under the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), therefore, provision made by the deceased while living thus has a continuing relevance with altered emphasis. Such provision is no longer something to be taken into account in deciding whether adequate provision has been made; but it may be taken into account in deciding whether an order should be made and the nature of the order.

The third difference to be noted is the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)'s more comprehensive catalogue of matters that may be taken into account in formulating an order for provision. [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s9.html) of the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) empowered the court to 'take into consideration' matters there stated in 'determining what provision (if any) ought to be made in favour of an eligible person out of the estate or notional estate of a deceased person'. [Section (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) allows the court to 'have regard to' the matters set out in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) 'for the purpose of determining ... whether to make a family provision order and the nature of any such order'. The [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) lists a greater number of such matters than did the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/)."
Other than by reference to the provision made in the Will of the deceased, or, if relevant, by the operation of the intestacy rules in relation to the estate of the deceased, or both, [s 59(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) leaves undefined the norm by which the court must determine whether the provision, if any, is inadequate for the applicant's proper maintenance, education and advancement in life. The question would appear to be answered by an evaluation that takes the court to the provision actually made in the deceased's Will, or on intestacy, or both, on the one hand, and to the requirement for maintenance, education and advancement in life of the applicant on the other. No criteria are prescribed in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) as to the circumstances that do, or do not, constitute inadequate provision for the proper maintenance, education and advancement in life of the applicant.
In Grey versus Harrison [[1997] 2 VR 359], at 366-367, Callaway JA observed: "There is no single provision of which it may be said that that is the provision that a wise and just testator would have made. There is instead a range of appropriate provisions, in much the same way as there is a range of awards for pain and suffering or a range of available sentences. Minds may legitimately differ as to the provision that should be made. Furthermore, it is not at all clear that reasons for an appropriate provision need be fully articulated. To borrow again from the analogy of sentencing, what is required is an instinctive synthesis that takes into account all the relevant factors and gives them due weight."
It was said in the Court of Appeal (by Basten JA), in Foley versus Ellis <case>, at [3], that the state of satisfaction "depends upon a multi-faceted evaluative judgment". In Kay versus Archbold <case>, at [126], White J said that the assessment of what provision is proper involved "an intuitive assessment". Stevenson J has described it as "an evaluative determination of a discretionary nature, not susceptible of complete exposition" and one which is "inexact, non-scientific, not narrow or purely mathematical, and fact and circumstance specific": Szypica versus O'Beirne <case>, at [40].
Under [s 59(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), the time at which the court gives its consideration to the question of inadequacy of provision is the time when the court is considering the application.
"Provision" is not defined by the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), but it was noted in Diver versus Neal  <case>; (2009) 2 ASTLR 89, at [34], that the term "covers the many forms of support and assistance which one individual can give to another. That support and assistance will vary over the course of the person's lifetime".
Neither is the word "maintenance", nor the phrase "advancement in life", defined in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/).
The term "maintenance" usually refers to a provision for the supply of the necessaries of life. However, in Vigolo versus Bostin <case>; [(2005) 221 CLR 191], Callinan and Heydon JJ, at 228-229, said, of the words "maintenance", "support" and "advancement": "'Maintenance' may imply a continuity of a pre-existing state of affairs, or provision over and above a mere sufficiency of means upon which to live.
'Support' similarly may imply provision beyond bare need. The use of the two terms serves to amplify the powers conferred upon the court. And, furthermore, provision to secure or promote 'advancement' would ordinarily be provision beyond the necessities of life. It is not difficult to conceive of a case in which it appears that sufficient provision for support and maintenance has been made, but that in the circumstances, say, of a promise or an expectation reasonably held, further provision would be proper to enable a potential beneficiary to improve his or her prospects in life, or to undertake further education."
In Alexander versus Jansson <case>, Brereton J (with whom Basten JA and Handley AJA agreed), at [18], stated: "'Proper maintenance' is not limited to the bare sustenance of a claimant [cf
Gorton versus Parkes (sic) [[1989] 17 NSWLR 1]], but requires consideration of the totality of the claimant's position in life including age, status, relationship with the deceased, financial circumstances, the environs to which he or she is accustomed, and mobility."
In J D Heydon and M J Leeming, Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia (7th ed, 2006, LexisNexis Butterworths), at 542, the learned authors comment upon the difference between the concepts of maintenance and advancement: "The essential difference between 'maintenance' and 'advancement' is that 'maintenance' denotes a periodical payment or a payment which could validly be made periodically, whereas 'advancement' denotes a definite unique outlay for a specific purpose. Recipients of maintenance must, practically speaking, be infants, but adults may be recipients of an advancement.

An advancement can never be made of a sum of money which the person to whom it is made can immediately pocket, but it must be made with a view to the establishment of that person in a business or profession, or otherwise in some definite way for that person's benefit, the whole essence of an advancement being the immediate payment of a tolerably large sum for an immediate benefit to one beneficiary."
In In the Estate of Puckridge, Deceased [(1978) 20 SASR 72], at 77, King CJ said: "The words 'advancement in life' have a wide meaning and application and there is nothing to confine the operation of the provision to an earlier period of life in the members of the family: Blore versus Lang <case>; [(1960) 104 CLR 124], per Dixon CJ at 128."
Master Macready (as his Honour then was) in Stiles versus Joseph (Supreme Court , Macready M, 16 December 1996, unrep) said, at 14-16: "Apart from the High Court's statement that the words 'advancement in life' have a wide meaning and application ... there is little (if any) case law on the meaning of 'advancement' in the context of family provision applications.
Zelling J in In The Estate of Wardle [(1979) 22 SASR 139] at 144, had the same problem. However, commonly in decisions in which the Applicant's 'advancement in life' has been in issue, the Court has looked only at the material or financial situation of the Applicant, and there is nothing to suggest that provision for the Applicant's 'advancement in life' means anything more than material or financial advancement. For example, in Kleinig v Neal (No 2) [[1981] 2 NSWLR 532], Holland
J, discusses the financial assistance which an applicant may need for his or her maintenance and advancement in life in the following terms:- If the court is to make a judgment as to what a wise and just testator ought to have done in all the circumstances of the case, it could not be right to ignore that the particular testator was a wealthy man in considering what he ought to have done for his widow or children in making provision for their maintenance, education or advancement in life. There are different levels of need for such things. In the case of maintenance and advancement in life they can range from bare subsistence up to anything short of sheer luxury. A desire to improve one's standard of living or a desire to fulfil one's ambition for a career or to make the fullest use of one's skills and abilities in a trade or business, if hindered or frustrated by the lack of financial means required for the fulfilment of such desire or ambition, presents a need for such assistance and it would seem to me that it is open to a court to say, in the case of a wealthy spouse or parent who could have but has failed to provide such financial assistance, that ... [the deceased] has failed to make adequate provision for the proper maintenance and advancement in life of the spouse or children who had such need. (at 541) 
In Pilkington versus Inland Revenue Commissioners [[1964] AC 612], Viscount
Radcliffe defined 'advancement', in the context of a trustee's powers, as 'any use of ... money which will improve the material situation of the beneficiary' (at 635), and this definition was cited with approval by Pennycuick J in Re
Clore's Settlement Trust; Sainer versus Clore [[1966] 2 All ER 272] at ...

In Certoma, The Law of Succession In New South Wales (2nd Ed) at 208, it is said: 'Although 'maintenance' does not mean mere subsistence, in the context of the
New South Wales [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), it probably does not extend to substantial capital investments such as the purchase of a business, an income-producing property or a home for the
Applicant because these forms of provision are more likely to be within the power of the Court under 'advancement in life'. Maintenance is rather concerned with the discharge of the recurrent costs of daily living and not generally with substantial capital benefit.' 
The Queensland Law Reform Commission, in its Working Paper on Uniform
Succession Laws: Family Provision (Working Paper 47, 1995) ... notes ... that: 'Whereas support, maintenance and education are words traditionally associated with the expenditure of income, advancement has been associated with the expenditure of capital, such as setting a person up in business or upon marriage.'"
In Mayfield versus Lloyd-Williams <case>, White J, at [114], noted: "In the context of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) the expression 'advancement in life' is not confined to an advancement of an applicant in his or her younger years. It is phrase of wide import. (McCosker v McCosker <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 566] at 575) The phrase 'advancement in life' has expanded the concept used in the Victorian legislation which was considered in Re
Buckland permitting provision to be made for the 'maintenance and support' of an eligible applicant. However Adam J emphasised that in a large estate a more extravagant allowance for contingencies could be made than would be permissible in a small estate and still fall within the conception of maintenance and support."
In Bartlett versus Coomber <case>, at [50], Mason P said: "The concept of advancement in life goes beyond the need for education and maintenance. In a proper case it will extend to a capital payment designed to set a person up in business or upon marriage (McCosker versus McCosker <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 566] at 575; Stiles versus Joseph, (NSW Supreme Court, Macready M, 16
December 1996); Mayfield versus Lloyd-Williams [[2004] NSWSC )."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2004/419.html "View Case" )
In McCosker versus McCosker <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 566], Dixon CJ and Williams J stated, at 575: "The presence of the words 'advancement in life' in the ...
[Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) in addition to the words 'maintenance and education' is not unimportant. ...
'Advancement' is a word of wide import."
The word "adequate" connotes something different from the word "proper". "Adequate" is concerned with the quantum, described by Rosalind Atherton, 'The Concept of Moral Duty in the Law of Family Provision - a Gloss or Critical Understanding?' [(1999) 5 Australian Journal of Legal History 5], at 476: "The use of the word 'proper' in this connection is of considerable importance. It connotes something different from the word 'adequate'. A small sum may be sufficient for the 'adequate' maintenance of a child, for instance, but, having regard to the child's station in life and the fortune of his father, it may be wholly insufficient for his 'proper' maintenance. So, too, a sum may be quite insufficient for the 'adequate' maintenance of a child and yet may be sufficient for his maintenance on a scale that is 'proper' in all the circumstances."
Their Lordships went on to state (at 478): "The amount to be provided is not to be measured solely by the need of maintenance. It would be so if the Court were concerned merely with adequacy.
But the Court has to consider what is proper maintenance, and therefore the property left by the testator has to be taken into consideration."
Dixon CJ and Williams J, in McCosker versus McCosker, at 571-572, after citing Bosch versus Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd, went on to say, of the word "proper", that: "It means 'proper' in all the circumstances of the case, so that the question whether a widow or child of a testator has been left without adequate provision for his or her proper maintenance, education or advancement if life must be considered in the light of the competing claims upon the bounty of the testator and their relative urgency, the standard of living his family enjoyed in his lifetime, in the case of a child his or her need of education or of assistance in some chosen occupation and the testator's ability to meet such claims having regard to the size of his fortune. If the court considers that there has been a breach by a testator of his duty as a wise and just husband or father to make adequate provision for the proper maintenance education or advancement in life of the applicant, having regard to all these circumstances, the court has jurisdiction to remedy the breach and for that purpose to modify the testator's testamentary dispositions to the necessary extent."
In Goodman versus Windeyer <case>; [(1980) 144 CLR 490], Gibbs J said, at 502: "[T]he words 'adequate' and 'proper' are always relative. There are no fixed standards, and the court is left to form opinions upon the basis of its own general knowledge and experience of current social conditions and standards."
In Vigolo versus Bostin, at 228, Callinan and Heydon JJ said: "[T]he use of the word 'proper' ... implies something beyond mere dollars and cents. Its use, it seems to us, invites consideration of all the relevant surrounding circumstances and would entitle a court to have regard to a promise of a kind which was made here...The use of the word 'proper' means that attention may be given, in deciding whether adequate provision has been made, to such matters as what use to be called the 'station in life' of the parties and the expectations to which that has given rise, in other words, reciprocal claims and duties based upon how the parties lived and might reasonably expect to have lived in the future."
Santow J pointed out in Gardiner versus Gardiner (Supreme Court , Santow J, 28 May 1998, unrep), that "adequate" and "proper" are independent concepts. He said, at 12: "'Adequate' relates to the needs of the applicant. It is determined by reference to events occurring up to the death of the deceased, but also encompassing what the deceased might reasonably have foreseen before death.
'Proper' depends upon all the circumstances of the case. These include the applicant's station in life, the wealth of the deceased, the means and proper claims of all applicants, the relative urgency of the various claims on the deceased's bounty, the applicant's conduct in relation to the deceased, the applicant's contribution to building up the deceased's estate, the existence of dependents upon the applicant, the effects of inflation, the applicant's age and sex, and whether the applicant is able-bodied ..."
In Palaganio versus Mankarios  <case>, at [72], White J observed that the question of what provision for a person's maintenance, education or advancement in life is "proper" and the question of whether the provision made by the deceased was "adequate" for that person's maintenance, education or advancement in life involve value judgments on which minds can legitimately differ, and there are no definite criteria by which the question can be answered.
His Honour added, in Slack versus Rogan; Palffy versus Rogan  <case>, at [123]: "The question of what level of maintenance or advancement in life is 'proper' depends on all of the circumstances of the case 'including the applicant's financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased, and the relationship between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty' (Singer versus Berghouse <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 201] at 210)."
Until recently, it was unanimously thought that there are two stages of the determination. The first stage, provided for by [s 59(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html), has been described as "the jurisdictional question": Singer versus Berghouse <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 201] JA, with whom Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreed).
In Collins versus McGain, Tobias JA said: "42. Further, there can be no question that, at least as part of the first stage of the process, the question of whether the eligible person has a relevant need of maintenance etc is a proper enquiry. This is so as the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for an eligible person in all the circumstances clearly calls for a consideration of his or her needs. However, the question of needs must not be too narrowly focussed. It must, in my view, take into account, depending upon the particular circumstances of the case, present and future needs including the need to guard against unforeseen contingencies.
 ...
As I have observed, the issue of need is not confined to whether or not an eligible person has, at the date of hearing, a then need for financial assistance with respect to his maintenance etc. It is a broader concept. This is so because the question of needs must be addressed in the context of the statutory requirement of what is 'proper maintenance etc' of the eligible person. It is because of that context that, in the present case, the 'proper maintenance etc' of the appellant required consideration of a need to guard against the contingency to which I have referred."
In Devereaux-Warnes versus Hall (No 3), at [81] - [84], Buss JA said, in respect of the first stage of the process: "The term 'need' has been used to refer to the claimant's inability to satisfy his or her financial requirements from his or her own resources. See Singer per Gaudron J at 227.
 'Need' has also been used in the context of a value judgment or conclusion, namely, that the claimant is 'in need' of maintenance, etc, because inadequate provision has been made for his or her proper maintenance, etc. See Gorton v
Parks [(1989) 17 NSWLR 1] per Bryson J at 10-11.

The determination of whether the disposition of the deceased's estate was not such as to make adequate provision for the proper maintenance, etc, of the claimant will always, as a practical matter, involve an evaluation of the provision, if any, made for the claimant on the one hand, and the claimant's 'needs that cannot be met from his or her own resources on the other. See
Hunter per Kirby P at 575.

Although the existence or absence of 'needs' which the claimant cannot meet from his or her own resources will always be highly relevant and, often, decisive, the statutory formulation, and therefore the issue in every case, is whether the disposition of the deceased's estate was not such as to make adequate provision for his or her proper maintenance, etc. See Singer per
Gaudron J at 227. Compare Gorton per Bryson J at 6-11; Collicoat versus McMillan [[1999] 3 VR 803] per Ormiston J at 816 [38], 820 [47]." "Need", of course, is a relative concept: de Angelis versus de Angelis <case>, per Dodds-Streeton J, at [45]. White J has recently written in Sam Wardy versus Gordon Salier; William Wardy versus Gordon Salier; Hassiba Wardy versus Estate of late Edmond Wadih Wardy, developer and Ch 3 of the [Succession Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) <case>, at [147], that "the need a claimant must demonstrate is a need for 'proper' maintenance, education and advancement in life", but that does not mean that "adequate provision for proper maintenance and advancement in life implies no more than provision for the necessities of life, irrespective of the size of the estate and the effect, if any, of an order for provision on others".
As Callinan and Heydon JJ emphasised in Vigolo versus Bostin, the question of the adequacy of the provision made by the deceased "is not to be decided in a vacuum" or "by looking simply to the question whether the applicant has enough on which to survive or live comfortably". The inquiry is not confined only to the material circumstances of the applicant. The whole of the context must be examined.
In the event that the court is satisfied that the power to make an order is enlivened (i.e. in this case it is satisfied that the applicants are eligible persons, and that adequate provision for their proper maintenance, education or advancement in life has not been made), then, the court determines whether it should make an order, and if so, the nature of any such order, having regard to the facts known to the court at the time the order is made.
The second stage of the process arises under [s 59(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) and [s 60(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, in Singer versus Berghouse, at 211, affirmed that the decision made at the second stage involves an exercise of discretion in the accepted sense. The fact that the court has a discretion means that it may refuse to make an order even though the jurisdictional question has been answered in the applicant's favour.
However, Basten JA, in Andrew versus Andrew, said of the two stage process referred to: "29 The combination of changes requires that the court address the nature of the exercise being undertaken. Three potential consequences may be identified.
First, there is a simplification of the structure of the process. There is no longer a two-stage process required. A degree of artificiality has thus been removed. The court should now ask what, taking all relevant factors into account, would have been adequate provision for the applicant. There is no first stage of determining whether the actual provision was 'inadequate', followed by a discretionary exercise of determining what would be adequate and what should in fact be done.
 ...
 As noted above, the language of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) is not consistent with the two-stage inquiry which was a common feature of earlier legislation: cf Singer versus Berghouse at 208-209. In Keep versus Bourke  <case> the Court appears to have assumed that the two-stage process continued to operate under the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/): at [24]-[29]. However, the issue not having been directly addressed, there is no constraint on this Court now adopting a different approach. Nor does earlier
High Court authority construing an earlier statutory scheme govern the approach to be adopted to materially different legislative provisions."
In Andrew versus Andrew, Allsop P, at [6], said: "Whether the process engaged in by the Court in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) can still be described as 'two-staged' in the sense discussed in Singer v
Berghouse  <case>; [181 CLR 201] at -211 may be an analytical question of little consequence. The task involves an evaluative assessment and a choice as to consequence therefrom, appeal from which is governed by the principles concerning discretionary judgments:
Singer versus Berghouse at 211 and DAO versus R  <case>; <case>."
Barrett JA disagreed with Basten JA, in Andrew versus Andrew, saying: "65 This is the second occasion on which this Court has been called upon to deal with a claim under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). In the earlier case, Keep versus Bourke  <case>, the Court proceeded on the basis that approaches taken under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s7.html) of the now superseded [Family Provision Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) remained relevant and applicable. That matter was explored in greater detail in the course of argument in the present case. For reasons I am about to state, I am of the opinion that the earlier approaches should continue to be followed in cases such as the present case and Keep versus Bourke, that is, cases in which the applicant is a child of the deceased and no previous order for provision out of the estate has been made in favour of that applicant.
 ...
 First, it is necessary, having regard to <case>(c), for the court to be satisfied that, at the time when it is considering the application, 'adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the person in whose favour the order is to be made has not been made by the will of the deceased person, or by the operation of the intestacy rules in relation to the estate of the deceased person'. Whereas the former [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s9.html) provided that an order was not to be made unless the court was 'satisfied' in the specified way, the present legislation permits the court to make an order if 'satisfied' in the specified way and, by necessary implication, precludes the making of an order if the court is not so 'satisfied'.
 Second (and if the court is 'satisfied' in the specified way), the 'family provision order' that the court is empowered to make is, under <case>, 'such order for provision out of the estate of the deceased person as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made'; and the court may, pursuant to <case>(b), have regard to the matters specified in <case> in deciding whether to make an order and the nature of the order.
 Under <case> and <case>, therefore, the task of the court, in a case of the kind under discussion, is: to determine the extent of the provision made for the maintenance, education and advancement in life of the applicant by the deceased's will or the intestacy laws; to form an opinion of the adequacy of that provision; if the opinion is one of inadequacy, to make an evaluative judgment as to what provision, if any, ought to be made out of the estate of the deceased person for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the court at the time the order is made; and in making that evaluative judgment, to take into account, as discretionary factors, the matters in <case>.
 ...
 As stated in Keep versus Bourke (above), the structure and effect of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provisions warrant continuing adherence to the two-stage approach indicated by the decisions of the High Court in Singer versus Berghouse and Vigolo versus Bostin."
I have dealt with the question that has been raised in other cases whether the two-stage approach identified in Singer versus Berghouse continues to apply to the provisions of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) in other cases, the most recent of which is Aubrey versus Kain <case> I remain of the view that the two-stage approach should continue to apply. I shall not repeat what I said in that case, which is not affected by the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Phillips versus James <case>, or its decision of Verzar versus Verzar <case> (Since I delivered my reasons in Aubrey versus Kain, Robb J has also considered the topic in Janette Susan Gardiner versus Raymond James Gardiner as Administrator of the Estate of the Late Dulcie Eva Gardiner  <case> I respectfully adopt his Honour's reasoning, set out at [117] - [120], and [124], as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning of Barrett JA in Andrew versus Andrew. I also refer to what has been written by Bergin CJ in Eq in In the Estate of the late Anthony Marras <case> at <case>.)
Ultimately, as Allsop P said in Andrew versus Andrew, at [6], "it may be an analytical question of little consequence" since the questions remain the same, namely, whether the court can make an order for provision (whether it is satisfied that adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life of the person in whose favour the order is to be made has not been made), and if so, whether it should (whether to make an order and, if so, the terms of that order).
[Section 60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), at least in part, is new. It provides: "(1) The court may have regard to the matters set out in subsection (2) for the purpose of determining: whether the person in whose favour the order is sought to be made (the 'applicant') is an eligible person, and whether to make a family provision order and the nature of any such order.

The following matters may be considered by the court: any family or other relationship between the applicant and the deceased person, including the nature and duration of the relationship, the nature and extent of any obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased person to the applicant, to any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or to any beneficiary of the deceased person's estate, the nature and extent of the deceased person's estate (including any property that is, or could be, designated as notional estate of the deceased person) and of any liabilities or charges to which the estate is subject, as in existence when the application is being considered, the financial resources (including earning capacity) and financial needs, both present and future, of the applicant, of any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or of any beneficiary of the deceased person's estate, if the applicant is cohabiting with another person-the financial circumstances of the other person, any physical, intellectual or mental disability of the applicant, any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or any beneficiary of the deceased person's estate that is in existence when the application is being considered or that may reasonably be anticipated, the age of the applicant when the application is being considered, any contribution (whether financial or otherwise) by the applicant to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of the estate of the deceased person or to the welfare of the deceased person or the deceased person's family, whether made before or after the deceased person's death, for which adequate consideration (not including any pension or other benefit) was not received, by the applicant, any provision made for the applicant by the deceased person, either during the deceased person's lifetime or made from the deceased person's estate, any evidence of the testamentary intentions of the deceased person, including evidence of statements made by the deceased person, whether the applicant was being maintained, either wholly or partly, by the deceased person before the deceased person's death and, if the court considers it relevant, the extent to which and the basis on which the deceased person did so, whether any other person is liable to support the applicant, the character and conduct of the applicant before and after the date of the death of the deceased person, the conduct of any other person before and after the date of the death of the deceased person, any relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander customary law, any other matter the court considers relevant, including matters in existence at the time of the deceased person's death or at the time the application is being considered."
It can be seen that [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) enumerates 15 specific matters, described by Basten JA in Andrew versus Andrew, at [37] as "a multifactorial list", and by Lindsay J in Verzar versus Verzar  <case>, at [123], as "a valuable prompt" to which the court may have regard, together with "any other matter the court considers relevant", for the purposes of determining eligibility, whether to make a family provision order and the nature of any such order.
It was said by White J in Slack versus Rogan; Palffy versus Rogan, at [121], that [s 60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) "lists a wide range of matters" that the court "may have regard to", but these do not provide any tangible assistance in answering the question in any particular case whether the provision made in a will was less than adequate for an eligible applicant's "proper" maintenance, education or advancement in life.
In West versus Mann  <case>, Kunc J at [12], wrote: "Section 60(2) provides a helpful checklist but it is no more than that. The
Court is not obliged to take those matters into account. The extent to which it does (if at all) will depend upon the facts of each particular case.
 [Section (2)(p)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) confirms the breadth of matters the Court can take into account. Once enlivened, the Discretion is expressly fettered only by the requirement in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) that if an order is made, it must be such order 'as the Court thinks ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person, having regard to the facts known to the Court at the time the order is made'".
Beazley P, in Phillips versus James, at [51], described [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) as involving: "... a statutory iteration of matters that had always been considered relevant in the determination of claims for provision by persons claiming an entitlement under a testator's will. However, as Basten JA observed in Andrew v Andrew, the factors identified in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) provide a more focussed direction to the Court as to relevant matters to which regard may be had. His Honour was of the view that the statutory list invites consideration of a broader range of factors than was previously the case.
Whether or not that is so, the important matter is that the Court is required to have regard to the circumstances, including those specified in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html), that it considers relevant in determining whether to make an order for family provision and the nature of any such order."
The section does not prioritise the catalogue of matters that may be taken into account. No matter is more, or less, important than any other. The weight of such of the matters specified in the section, which may be taken into account, will depend upon the facts of the particular case. There is no mandatory command to take into account any of the matters enumerated. None of the matters listed is, necessarily, of decisive significance and none differentiate, in their application, between classes of eligible person. Similarly, there is no distinction based on gender. 
It does not say how the matters listed are to be used to determine the matters identified in [s 60(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) Considering each of the relevant matters does not prescribe a particular result, and whilst there is likely to be a substantial overlap in the matters that the court may take into account when determining the answers to what is posed in [s 60(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html), those matters are not identical. For example, when considering eligibility under [s 60(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html), many of the matters in [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) will be largely, if not wholly, irrelevant.
[Section 60(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) refers to "earning capacity", which means no more than the capacity to find employment to earn or derive income.
A reference to some of the matters in [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) not only permits, but requires, a comparison to be made between the respective positions of the applicant and any other eligible person, as well as of any beneficiary, whilst others do not. Importantly, also, many of the matters in sub-section (2), of themselves, are incapable of providing an answer to the questions posed in [s 60(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html)
Leaving aside the question of eligibility, the matters referred to in [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) may be considered on "the discretionary question", namely whether to make an order and the nature of that order. Importantly, under [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html), attention is drawn to matters that may have existed at the deceased's death, or subsequently.
This does not mean, however, that some of the matters referred to in [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) will not be relevant to the jurisdictional question to be determined at the first stage. I am not alone in reaching this conclusion which is supported by the following comments made in Singer versus Berghouse, at 209-210: "... The determination of the first stage in the two-stage process calls for an assessment of whether the provision (if any) made was inadequate for what, in all the circumstances, was the proper level of maintenance etc appropriate for the applicant having regard, amongst other things, to the applicant's financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the totality of the relationship between the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon his or her bounty.

The determination of the second stage, should it arise, involves similar considerations. Indeed, in the first stage of the process, the court may need to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what is adequate provision, in which event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the order which should be made in favour of the applicant."
And by the comments of Callinan and Heydon JJ in Vigolo versus Bostin, at 230-231: "We do not therefore think that the questions which the court has to answer in assessing a claim under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) necessarily always divide neatly into two. Adequacy of the provision that has been made is not to be decided in a vacuum, or by looking simply to the question whether the applicant has enough upon which to survive or live comfortably. Adequacy or otherwise will depend upon all of the relevant circumstances, which include any promise which the testator made to the applicant, the circumstances in which it was made, and, as here, changes in the arrangements between the parties after it was made. These matters however will never be conclusive. The age, capacities, means, and competing claims, of all of the potential beneficiaries must be taken into account and weighed with all of the other relevant factors."
As was also pointed out by Barrett JA, in Andrew versus Andrew, at [88] - [89]: "... leaving aside its relevance to the 'eligible person' inquiry, the [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) catalogue is directed to the question of what, if any, order for provision should be made and is not, in terms, applied to the initial question of the adequacy of the provision made by the will or the intestacy laws.

It can be said at once that the [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) directive corresponds with that in the former [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s9.html) to the extent that it relates to the decision regarding provision to be made.
There is no express legislative intention, under either piece of legislation, that the enumerated factors are to be taken into account in deciding the initial question of adequacy of provision. There is accordingly no reason to think that those factors are to be afforded any special relevance in approaching the adequacy question. But they will, at that point, be given, independently of [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html), such weight as they deserve in their own right as indicators of the 'adequacy' question. As the primary judge recognised at [57], this is consistent with what was said by the High Court in Singer versus Berghouse in relation to the former [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)."
As Beazley P confirmed in Phillips versus James, at [49] and [53], "there may not be a strict or bright line division between each stage of the process". [Section 65(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s65.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) requires the family provision order to specify: the person or persons for whom provision is to be made, and the amount and nature of the provision, and the manner in which the provision is to be provided and the part or parts of the estate out of which it is to be provided, and any conditions, restrictions or limitations imposed by the court.
The order for provision may require the provision to be made in a variety of ways, including a lump sum, periodic sum, or "in any other manner the court thinks fit" [(s 65(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s65.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)). If the provision is made by payment of an amount of money, the order may specify whether interest is payable on the whole, or any part, of the amount payable for the period, and, if so, the period during which interest is payable and the rate of interest [(s 65(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s65.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)). 
Any family provision order under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) takes effect, unless the court otherwise orders, as if the provision was made in a codicil to the Will of the deceased, or in the case of intestacy, as in a Will of the deceased [(s 72(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s72.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)). (Intestacy is irrelevant in these proceedings.)
Thus, the practical effect of an order is to alter the provisions of a deceased person's will, or the distribution of an estate according to the intestacy provisions of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/).
[Section 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s66.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) sets out the consequential and ancillary orders that may be made.
[Section 99(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s99.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) provides that the court may order the costs of proceedings in relation to the estate, or notional estate, of the deceased (including costs in connection with mediation) to be paid out of the estate in such manner as the court thinks fit.
Practice Note SC Eq 7, which applies to claims for a family provision order, currently provides, in Clause 24, that "[o]rders may be made capping the costs that may be recovered by a party in circumstances including, but not limited to, cases in which the value of the estate is less than $500,000". (Of course, this is only one basis upon which costs may be capped. See, for example, [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) . Also, see Baychek versus Baychek <case> Also see, Dion Giuseppi Sergi by next friend Aileen Solowiej versus Sergi <case>, per E M Heenan J at [50] - [52].

Other Applicable Legal Principles - Substantive Application
Accepting that no two cases will be exactly alike, there are some general principles that may be stated. Whilst most of these principles were stated in the context of the former [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), they are equally apt in a claim brought pursuant to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). 
Bryson J noted in Gorton versus Parks [(1989) 17 NSWLR 1], at 19.
In Stott versus Cook [(1960) 33 ALJR 447], Taylor J, although dissenting in his determination of the case, observed, at 453-4, that the court did not have a mandate to rework a Will according to its own notions of fairness. His Honour added: "There is, in my opinion, no reason for thinking that justice is better served by the application of abstract principles of fairness than by acceptance of the judgment of a competent testator whose knowledge of the virtues and failings of the members of his family equips him for the responsibility of disposing of his estate in far better measure than can be afforded to a Court by a few pages of affidavits sworn after his death and which only too frequently provide but an incomplete and shallow reflection of family relations and characteristics. All this is, of course, subject to the proviso that an order may be made if it appears that the testator has failed to discharge a duty to make provision for the maintenance, education or advancement of his widow or children. But it must appear, firstly, that such a duty existed and, secondly, that it has not been discharged."
Also, in Vigolo versus Bostin, Gleeson CJ pointed out that the legislation did not confer new rights of succession and did not create legal rights of inheritance. Rather, his Honour stated, at [10], that it "preserved freedom of testamentary disposition, but subjected that freedom to a new qualification". Thus, testamentary freedom is not absolute.
White J referred to these principles in Slack versus Rogan; Palffy versus Rogan, at [127]: "In my view, respect should be given to a capable testator's judgment as to who should benefit from the estate if it can be seen that the testator has duly considered the claims on the estate. That is not to deny that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) interferes with the freedom of testamentary disposition. Plainly it does, and courts have a duty to interfere with the will if the provision made for an eligible applicant is less than adequate for his or her proper maintenance and advancement in life. But it must be acknowledged that the evidence that can be presented after the testator's death is necessarily inadequate. Typically, as in this case, there can be no or only limited contradiction of the applicant's evidence as to his or her relationship and dealings with the deceased. The deceased will have been in a better position to determine what provision for a claimant's maintenance and advancement in life is proper than will be a court called on to determine that question months or years after the deceased's death when the person best able to give evidence on that question is no longer alive. Accordingly, if the deceased was capable of giving due consideration to that question and did so, considerable weight should be given to the testator's testamentary wishes in recognition of the better position in which the deceased was placed (Stott versus Cook [(1960) 33 ALJR 447] per Taylor
J at 453-454 cited in Nowak versus Beska <case> at <case>).
This is subject to the qualification that the court's determination under [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) and (2) is to be made having regard to the circumstances at the time the court is considering the application, rather than at the time of the deceased's death or will."
Gleeson CJ observed in Vigolo versus Bostin, at 199, that the justification for interference with freedom of testation is to be found in the failure of a deceased to meet the obligations, which the community would expect in terms of maintenance, for those persons within the class of eligible persons. The process requires the court to "connect the general but value-laden language of the statute to the community standards".
Yet, in considering the question, the nature and content of what is adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education and advancement in life of an applicant, is not fixed or static. Rather, it is a flexible concept, the measure of which should be adapted to conform with what is considered to be right and proper according to contemporary accepted community standards: Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith versus Scales, at 19; Walker versus Walker (Supreme Court , Young J, 17 May 1996, unrep); Stern versus Sekers; Sekers versus Sekers <case>
As Allsop P said in Andrew versus Andrew, at [16]: "If I may respectfully paraphrase Sheller JA [in Permanent Trustee Co Limited v Fraser [(1995) 36 NSWLR 24] at
F-47B], the Court in assessing the matter at [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) and the order that should be made under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) and (2), should be guided and assisted by considering what provision, in accordance with prevailing community standards of what is right and appropriate, ought to be made. This, Sheller JA said ... involved speaking for the feeling and judgment of fair and reasonable members of the community. It is to be emphasised that [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) and [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) refer to the time when the Court is considering [an application for a family provision order] and the facts then known to the Court. The evaluative assessment is to be undertaken assuming full knowledge and appreciation of all the circumstances of the case. This ... makes the notion of compliance by the testator with a moral duty (on what he or she knew) apt to distract from the statutory task of the Court."
How those community expectations or standards are determined cannot be explained other than by reference to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/): Andrew versus Andrew, at [36].
In all cases under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), what is adequate and proper provision is necessarily fact specific.
The [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) is not a "Destitute Persons [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/)", and it is not necessary, therefore, that the applicant should be destitute to succeed in obtaining an order: In re Allardice; Allardice versus Allardice [(1910) 29 NZLR 959], per White J, at [45].
All of the financial needs of an applicant have to be taken into account and considered by reference to the other factors referred to in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) and in Singer versus Berghouse. What is proper provision is not arrived at by adding up all of the identified financial needs: Hyland versus Burbidge <case>, at [56]. Nor does it follow that if the court decides it is inappropriate to make a specific provision in respect of one identified head of claim that any identified financial need, even a contingent need, in relation to that claim becomes irrelevant to the final assessment: Mayfield versus Lloyd-Williams, at [89].
The size of the estate is a significant consideration in determining an application for provision. In a small estate, as this one is, it is important to remember what Salmond J said in In re Allen (Deceased); Allen versus Manchester [[1922] NZLR 218], at 221: "Applications under the Family Protection [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) for further provision of maintenance are divisible into two classes. The first and by far the most numerous class consists of those cases in which, owing to the smallness of the estate and to the nature of the testamentary dispositions, the applicant is competing with other persons who have also a moral claim upon the testator. Any provision made by the Court in favour of the applicant must in this class of case be made at the expense of some other person or persons to whom the testator owed a moral duty of support. The estate is insufficient to meet in full the entirety of the moral claims upon it, in the sense that if the testator possessed more he would have been bound to do more for the welfare of his dependants. In such a case all that the Court can do is to see that the available means of the testator are justly divided between the persons who have moral claims upon him in due proportion to the relative urgency of those claims."
Whilst fully contested applications in small estates should be discouraged, because the costs tend to become wholly disproportionate to the end result, there is nothing in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) that excludes the possibility that orders for further provision be made from a small estate: Morris versus Smoel <case>, at [68]. The court must still consider all the relevant circumstances before a decision is made: Re Coventry (Deceased) [[1979] 3 All ER 815], at 820.
In relation to each claim, being a claim by an adult child, the following principles are useful to remember: 
The relationship between parent and child changes when the child leaves home. However, a child does not cease to be a natural recipient of parental ties, affection or support, as the bonds of childhood are relaxed.

It is impossible to describe in terms of universal application, the moral obligation, or community expectation, of a parent in respect of an adult child. It can be said that, ordinarily, the community expects parents to raise, and educate, their children to the very best of their ability while they remain children; probably to assist them with a tertiary education, where that is feasible; where funds allow, to provide them with a start in life, such as a deposit on a home, although it might well take a different form. The community does not expect a parent, in ordinary circumstances, to provide an unencumbered house, or to set his, or her, child up in a position where she or he can acquire a house unencumbered, although in a particular case, where assets permit and the relationship between the parties is such as to justify it, there might be such an obligation: McGrath versus Eves  <case>; Taylor versus Farrugia  <case> 
Generally, also, the community does not expect a parent to look after his, or her, child for the rest of the child's life and into retirement, especially when there is someone else, such as a spouse, who has a primary obligation to do so. Plainly, if an adult child remains a dependent of a parent, the community usually expects the parent to make provision to fulfil that ongoing dependency after death. But where a child, even an adult child, falls on hard times, and where there are assets available, then the community may expect a parent to provide a buffer against contingencies; and where a child has been unable to accumulate superannuation or make other provision for their retirement, something to assist in retirement where otherwise, they would be left destitute: Taylor versus Farrugia, at [58].

If the applicant has an obligation to support others, such as a parent's obligation to support a dependent child, that will be a relevant factor in determining what is an appropriate provision for the maintenance of the applicant: Re Buckland Deceased <case>; [[1966] VR 404], at 411; Hughes versus National Trustees Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Ltd  <case>; [(1979) 143 CLR 134], at 148; Goodman versus Windeyer, at 498, 505. But the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) does not permit orders to be made to provide for the support of third persons that the applicant, however reasonably, wishes to support, where there is no obligation of the deceased to support such persons: Re Buckland Deceased, at 411;
Kleinig versus Neal (No 2) [[1981] 2 NSWLR 532], at 537;
Mayfield versus Lloyd-Williams, at [86].

There is no need for an applicant adult child to show some special need or some special claim: McCosker versus McCosker; Kleinig versus Neal (No 2), at 545;
Bondelmonte versus Blanckensee [[1989] WAR 305]; and Hawkins v
Prestage [(1989) 1 WAR 37], at 45 (Nicholson J).

The adult child's lack of reserves to meet demands, particularly of ill health, which become more likely with advancing years, is a relevant consideration: Macgregor versus Macgregor  <case> (28 August 2003), at [179] - [182]; Crossman versus Riedel  <case>, at [49]. Likewise, the need for financial security and a fund to protect against the ordinary vicissitudes of life, is relevant: Marks versus Marks  <case>, at [43]. In addition, if the applicant is unable to earn, or has a limited means of earning, an income, this could give rise to an increased call on the estate of the deceased: Christie versus Manera  <case>; Butcher versus Craig, at [17].

The applicant has the onus of satisfying the court, on the balance of probabilities, of the justification for the claim: Hughes versus National
Trustees, Executors and Agency Co of Australasia Ltd, at 149.

There is no obligation upon the deceased to have treated all of his, or her, children equally in making provision in the Will. The [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) does not permit a principle of equality between children that does not differentiate between children according to gender, character, conduct or circumstances. To the contrary, it specifically provides that conduct, circumstances, and financial resources, including earning capacity, may play a part in the court's determination of the applicant's case.
In Foley versus Ellis, Sackville AJA, at [88] noted that Singer versus Berghouse "... strongly suggests that the court cannot consider the propriety and adequacy (or inadequacy) of any testamentary provision for an applicant in isolation from the resources and needs of other claimants on the deceased's bounty. These claimants include other beneficiaries entitled to a share of the deceased's estate, whether or not they themselves have made a claim under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/)".
Because a significant part of the estate has been left to two grandchildren, even though each is not an applicant for provision but a chosen object of testamentary bounty, the following general principles, applicable to a claim by a grandchild, are, in my view, relevant and should be remembered: 
As a general rule, a grandparent does not have an obligation or responsibility to make provision for a grandchild; that obligation rests on the parent of the grandchild. Nor is a grandchild, normally, regarded as a natural object of the deceased's testamentary recognition.

Where a grandchild has lost his, or her, parents at an early age, or when he, or she, has been taken in by the grandparent in circumstances where the grandparent becomes a surrogate parent, these factors would, prima facie, give rise to a claim by a grandchild to be provided for out of the estate of the deceased grandparent. The fact that the grandchild resided with one, or more, of his, or her, grandparents is a significant factor. Even then, it should be demonstrated that the deceased had come to assume, for some significant time in the grandchild's life, a position more akin to that of a parent than a grandparent, with direct responsibility for the grandchild's support and welfare, or else that the deceased has undertaken a continuing and substantial responsibility to support the applicant grandchild financially or emotionally.

The mere fact of a family relationship between grandparent and grandchild does not, of itself, establish any obligation to provide for the grandchild upon the death of the grandparent. A moral obligation may be created, in a particular case, by reason, for example, of the care and affection provided by a grandchild to his, or her, grandparent.

It is relevant to consider what inheritance, or financial support, a grandchild might fairly expect from his, or her, parents. Yet, the obligation of a parent to provide for his, or her child does not, necessarily, negate, in an appropriate case, the moral obligation of a grandparent to make provision for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of a grandchild out of her, or his, estate.
I make clear that I do not intend what I have described as "principles" to be elevated into rules of law or "judge made rules of purportedly general application": White versus Barron, per Stephen J, at 40. Nor do I wish to suggest that the jurisdiction should be unduly confined, or the discretion at the second stage to be constrained, by statements of principle found in dicta in other decisions. I identify them merely as providing useful assistance in considering the statutory provisions, the terms of which must remain firmly in mind.
In addition, in each case, a close consideration of the facts is necessary in order to determine whether the bases for a family provision order have been established. Every case is different and must be decided on its own facts. As Lindsay J said in Verzar versus Verzar [2012], at [131]: "Whatever guidance one might draw from analogous cases all analogies, and any guidelines drawn from a pattern of similar cases, must yield to the text of the legislation, the duty of the Court to apply that text to the particular circumstances, and the totality of material circumstances, of each case.
Preconceptions and predispositions, comforting though they may be, can be the source of inadequate consideration of the jurisdiction to be exercised:
Bladwell versus Davis <case> at <case> and [18]-[19]." 
Further Additional Facts
I set out the additional facts I am satisfied are either not in dispute, or that, in my view, have been established by the evidence. I do so by reference to [s 60(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s60.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). Where necessary, I shall express the conclusions to which I have come. I have taken this course, not "to dwell on particular matters as if they were, in themselves, determinant of the broad judgments required to be made under [s 59"](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s59.html) (Verzar versus Verzar [2012], at [124]), but in order to complete the recitation of facts that will assist me to determine the questions that must be answered.
 any family or other relationship between the applicant and the deceased person, including the nature and duration of the relationship
The following comment has been made by Campbell JA in regard to the court's consideration of the totality of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased in Hampson versus Hampson  <case>, at [80]: "The requirement to have regard to the totality of the relationship can in many cases be satisfied by considering the overall quality of the relationship assessed in an overall and fairly broad-brush way, not minutely. Consideration of the detail of the relationship is ordinarily not called for except where there is an unusual factor that bears on the quality of the relationship, such as hostility, estrangement, conduct on the part of the applicant that is hurtful to the deceased or of which the deceased seriously disapproves, or conduct on the part of the applicant that is significantly beneficial to the deceased and significantly detrimental to the applicant, such as when a daughter gives up her prospects of a career to care for an aging parent.
Neither entitlement to an award, nor its quantum, accrues good deed by good deed. Indeed, it is a worrying feature of many [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) cases that the evidence goes into minutiae that are bitterly fought over, often at a cost that the parties cannot afford, and are ultimately of little or no help to the judge."
As stated, each of Mark and Martin is a child of the deceased. Each is now an adult. Mark states that he had a "good loving relationship" with the deceased and Martin states that he had "a wonderful loving relationship" with her.
Mark states that he lived with the deceased until he was about 14 years of age; that he was placed in "an orphanage" until he was about 17 years of age; that he then "lived on the street"; and, then, that he moved to a property which was situated across the road from the deceased for a few years. Even when he was not living with, or living close to, the deceased, he states that he would visit her regularly and, on average, no less than once a fortnight.
He states that there was a period, some years ago, when he did not like, or get on with, the deceased's then partner. Whilst, at the partner's behest, Mark was not allowed to go to the home where the deceased and her partner then lived, she would meet Mark and his de facto partner, Genevieve, elsewhere.
Antony denied that the relationship of Mark and the deceased was a close and loving one. Mark was cross-examined, using a transcript of a conversation recorded by Antony, in which Mark had made disparaging comments about the deceased's parenting. Mark did not dispute that he had done so, or that what he said about the deceased, he genuinely believed. But then he gave this evidence: "Me and my mother, we got on really good... As a mother, when we were kids, she was hopeless, absolutely hopeless. But, as we got older, you know, we got on. We accepted what went on, and we just got on with it. I was down there [visiting her at her home] all the time... She wasn't a bad person. She was no good as a mother, as a kid, but as she got older she got better. She learned her ways. No one could disagree with me with that."
I am satisfied that this evidence accurately reflects the nature of their relationship as each mellowed during adulthood and as the deceased aged. Whilst it is unfortunate that he had made the comments that he did to the deceased, to Antony and, as he accepted, "to others", to his credit, he did not distance himself from the deceased and continued, with his family, to maintain contact with her. That he was a beneficiary in the deceased's Will is a relevant fact in this regard.
Martin states that he left home at the age of 14 years but that he remained close to the deceased. He adds that, even though he lived a long distance away, during his adult life, he would visit the deceased frequently.
In his second affidavit, he identified the frequency of visits as "fortnightly, and sometimes it was monthly and sometimes it might be only [once every] two or three months but it was certainly more than 6 times each year".
He says, and he was not challenged, that he would telephone the deceased once a week. He added: "We didn't have a falling out nor were we estranged at the time of her death." the nature and extent of any obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased person to the applicant, to any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or to any beneficiary of the deceased person's estate
There is no definition of the words "obligations" or "responsibilities" to which the sub-section refers in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). Importantly, the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) does not expressly refer to, or identify, any "moral duty". Yet, one might conclude that what is to be considered is the nature and extent of any legal, or moral, obligations or responsibilities. 
This factor requires a balancing of potentially competing obligations as between each applicant and each beneficiary.
Leaving aside any obligation, or responsibility, arising as a result of their relationship as parent and child, the deceased did not have any legal obligation to either Mark or Martin, as an adult, imposed upon her by statute or common law. 
Yet, an obligation or responsibility, to make adequate provision for the proper maintenance, education or advancement in life, is recognised in the case of a child. In Flathaug versus Weaver [[2003] NZFLR 730], at 737, the origin of the obligation which underpins the Act's recognition of the duty owed by a parent to a child was put in this way: "The relationship of parent and child has primacy in our society. The moral obligation which attaches to it is embedded in our value system and underpinned by the law. The Family Protection [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) recognises that a parent's obligation to provide for both the emotional and material needs of his or her children is an ongoing one. Though founded on natural or assumed parenthood, it is, however, an obligation which is largely defined by the relationship which exists between parent and child during their joint lives."
The fact that each applicant was financially independent of the deceased, for many years, before the deceased's death, is a relevant consideration in determining the extent of any obligation or responsibility owed. The size of her estate is also relevant to the extent of the obligation or responsibility.
It is also important to note, in this case, that it is not the purpose of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) to punish, or redress, past bad, or unfeeling, parental behaviour, where that behaviour does not still impinge on each applicant's present financial situation. In other words, a claim under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) does not encompass compensation, or reparations, to each applicant for the deceased, as his parent, having failed in the legal, or moral, duty to be a good and responsible parent of the child: Re Bull  <case>; Cameron versus Cameron <case>, at [41].
It is clear that the deceased had no legal obligation to Nakia and Ashley as grandchildren. In this case, however, she did assume obligations and responsibilities towards each during their formative years. I have referred to the obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased to a grandchild earlier in these reasons. As stated, each is one of the remainder beneficiaries named in the Will.
 the nature and extent of the deceased person's estate (including any property that is, or could be, designated as notional estate of the deceased person) and of any liabilities or charges to which the estate is subject, as in existence when the application is being considered
I have dealt with the nature and extent of the deceased's estate. The value of the gross estate is small. It is tiny after the pecuniary legacy to Karina and the costs of the proceedings are deducted.
 the financial resources (including earning capacity) and financial needs, both present and future, of the applicant, of any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or of any beneficiary of the deceased person's estate
Mark resides with Genevieve, and their three children, Jason (26 years), Brodie (6 years) and Tilley (8 months). 
In August 2013, Mark was unemployed, other than on a part-time basis, and received a gross monthly income, in the form of unemployment benefits, of approximately $870. Subsequently, Mark was employed for a period of 9 months with the Shoalhaven City Council, but he has since been made redundant from that position, as a result of grant funds for the Council project on which he was working, having been expended.
Mark has recently registered with a labour hire company in an attempt to obtain further employment. However, he gave evidence that he had not secured work during April or May 2014. He sometimes obtains labouring or truck driving work for a day or half a day at a time. He also says that he continues to seek work, although he says that he receives a similar amount of income whether he is working or whether he receives unemployment benefits.
I am satisfied that Mark has an earning capacity. (I maintain this view notwithstanding evidence going to a work injury that he had previously sustained, about which more will be said later.)
Mark and Genevieve's joint fortnightly expenditure was disclosed, in an affidavit sworn 23 August 2013, to total $3,884 comprising: 
Mortgage repayments $1,000  
Car loan repayments $ 412  
Insurance - car/ house and contents $ 156  
Credit Card repayments $ 540  
Council rates $ 100  
Water rates $ 100  
Electricity $ 150  
Telephone and Internet charges $ 126  
Food $ 500  
Petrol $ 200  
General living expenses $ 300  
School expenses $ 300 
He gave no evidence, in his affidavit, of how the expenditure, which is significantly more than their disclosed income, is met. However, when he was cross-examined, he said that he "robbed Peter to pay Paul" and that, when necessary, he and Genevieve would not pay one expense in order to enable them to pay another.
In re-examination, he identified, on a bank statement that had been tendered (Ex. P3), relating to Genevieve's home loan, that there was a debit showing the payment of an electricity account. It was put that this corroborated his evidence about their financial difficulties. I accept this evidence. 
Mark gave evidence that he currently owns no assets, save for furniture jointly owned with Genevieve and a tow truck. No value was attributed to that furniture. The truck was said to be worth $6,000 in August 2013. As at 22 May 2014, it is said to be "unregistered with bald tyres". 
Later, I shall refer to an amount that Mark received following a work accident as well as amounts he has received, by way of compensation, in respect of the injuries he suffered. 
The home in which Mark resides is said to have a value of approximately $220,000. However, in his affidavit, Mark asserted that Genevieve owed $221,000 to Westpac Bank, secured on that home. At the hearing, Ex. P3 revealed that the amount outstanding, as at 1 April 2014, was $213,960 and that, as at 23 April 2014, an additional $302 had not been paid, as required. 
Mark does not otherwise disclose any liabilities.
Counsel for the Defendant conceded that such investigations as had been carried out, did not reveal any financial information that would cause the court to doubt that what Mark had said about his financial and material circumstances was, generally, accurate. 
Martin lives with his de facto partner, Sonia, and their three children, Mia (aged 2) Samuel (aged 1), and a newborn third child. (Martin has two other children, from previous relationships, aged 24 years and 8 years, respectively. However, they do not reside with him.) The home is co-owned by Sonia and her two siblings. 
Subject to what is outlined below, Martin says that his finances are "kept separate and apart" from Sonia's. (This is probably not entirely accurate since he also said that he gives the whole of the amount he receives by way of unemployment benefits to Sonia and that "she uses that to bring up the children and pay the rent and other household expenses".)
Martin is currently unemployed, although he is registered with a job network provider in Bowral. Also, Martin has recently re-obtained his driver's licence and is "hopeful" that this may improve his prospects for future employment. 
He currently receives Newstart unemployment benefits in the order of $394 per fortnight.
I am satisfied that Martin has an earning capacity. 
Martin says that he does not have any assets and that he has "no significant savings". His bank statement, at February 2014, showed a balance of just over $1.
There is little doubt that the joint income of Martin and Sonia is used entirely in day-to-day living expenses. Martin estimated the monthly household expenditure to be $2,790. Whilst he was cross-examined about these expenses, I am satisfied that his financial and material circumstances are dire.
Martin has liabilities in the order of $14,590 comprising an AGL energy bill ($840), a Centrelink debt ($5,050), an amount outstanding in relation to a motor vehicle accident ($1,700), court fines and damages ($6,000) and unpaid child support payments ($1,000). 
Counsel for the Defendant conceded that such investigations as had been carried out, did not reveal any financial information that would cause the court to doubt that what Martin had said about his financial and material circumstances was, generally, accurate. 
Nakia, who is aged 22 years, is in the second year of a Bachelor of Arts degree at Wollongong University. She has savings ($30), household contents ($500) and an unregistered car ($500). She has a Centrelink debt of $500. She currently receives a Centrelink Austudy allowance of $125 per week. She is about to start working casually at a call centre for a Wollongong real estate agent. I am satisfied that she has an earning capacity.
She gives evidence that her expenditure exceeds her income.
Ashley, who is aged 25 years, works on a permanent part-time basis as a sales clerk. He has a de facto partner who is a stay-at-home mother to their two children, aged 2 and almost 4 years of age. He has savings ($1,000), household contents ($2,000) and a car ($2,000). He has a credit card debt of just over $1,000. His net weekly wage is approximately $500. I am satisfied that he has an earning capacity.
Antony lives with his wife, Sharron, his daughter, from a previous relationship, Katie (aged 15), and his stepson, Daniel (aged 21). 
Antony disclosed assets totalling $10,939, comprising: 
Money in bank $ 266  
Flight Centre Account $1,900  Commodore $2,000  
Household contents and personal effects $2,000  Toyota Camry (belonging to Sharron) $1,800  
Superannuation $2,973 
He has a liability of $11,110 owing on a Commonwealth Bank Mastercard. 
Antony is employed on a casual basis as a kitchen hand at a golf club, working 10 to 15 hours per week. Antony says that he receives approximately $180 per week, supplemented by $520 Newstart Allowance. 
During cross-examination, Antony gave evidence that he previously worked building, servicing and repairing, computers. He did this through his own business, first, from premises in Ulladulla and, then, in a mobile capacity, visiting clients at their homes and businesses. Antony ceased operating the computer business in 2011. It was put to him, during cross-examination, that, by virtue of his experience with computers (seven to eight years), he has the capacity to obtain work of this type and earn a higher income than he currently does. Antony says that he had "lost the motivation" to work in this area after the death of the deceased but accepted that he "could become motivated again" and that he is "actually looking for more work". 
It was also put to Antony, during cross-examination, that, if he wished, he could do more work at the golf club. However, he said that the work available was "seasonal" and that the amount of shifts he works depends on whether or not it is holiday season.
Antony said, in answer to a question from the Bench about his future employment prospects, that he is currently looking for work, giving resumes to possible employers and applying with job networks. He says "[i]t is very hard to find work down in Ulladulla ... It is very selective." He says that his current job at the golf club "is the only job [he] could find at the time". 
Counsel for the Plaintiffs also put to Antony that his non-disclosure of tax returns for 2011 and 2012 was a result of his attempting to withhold information about supplementary income derived from continued work with computers on a cash-in-hand basis. This was denied by Antony. 
I accept that Antony has a continuing earning capacity. 
Antony disclosed the expenditure of his household to be between $900 and $1,000 per week. if the applicant is cohabiting with another person-the financial circumstances of the other person
Until October 2013, Mark's de facto partner, Genevieve, worked on a full-time basis with the Department of Fisheries, earning a net income of $2,006 per month. In October 2013, she began her maternity leave. Her six month period of leave expired on 10 April 2014. Mark gave evidence that Genevieve was to receive "half pay" during that period. 
Since April 2014, Genevieve has not returned to work. She intends to do so in October 2014. She currently receives Centrelink Parental Leave Allowance in the sum of $4,488 per month.
Jason works full-time as a sub-contracted labourer at Albatross Naval Base, Jervis Bay. No evidence was provided regarding his income. Mark says that Jason "does not pay any board or contribute to the household and maintenance expenses for the house or the family". He said, in answer to a question from the bench, that Genevieve holds the view that Jason should not contribute to household expenditure.
Martin's de facto partner, Sonia, previously worked part-time and earned $181 net per week. As stated, she gave birth to their third child shortly before the hearing. Sonia also receives approximately $510 per fortnight in Centrelink benefits. Martin gave evidence that the birth of their third child has resulted in an increase in the government benefits to which Sonia is entitled. 
Martin says that he is "not aware of Sonia's assets" but gave evidence of assets in the order of $24,575, comprising household and personal effects ($20,000), shares ($1,575) and a motor vehicle ($3,000).
Martin says that to the best of his knowledge, Sonia's debts total approximately $1,912. 
Antony's wife, Sharron, has liabilities of $62,830. During cross-examination, Antony accepted that Sharron's debts, primarily related to past business ventures, and were incurred personally by her. However, he contended that he assumed some joint responsibility for those debts, saying: "but now we are married". 
Sharron works on a casual basis as a cleaner, earning $80 per week. This is supplemented by a Newstart Allowance of $520. 
Antony's stepson, Daniel, contributes $50 per week in the form of board. No evidence was provided, otherwise, about his financial circumstances. any physical, intellectual or mental disability of the applicant, any other person in respect of whom an application has been made for a family provision order or any beneficiary of the deceased person's estate that is in existence when the application is being considered or that may reasonably be anticipated
Mark suffered injuries to his left hand in a work accident in March 2004. A Certificate, dated 8 August 2013, issued pursuant to [s 328(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wimawca1998540/s328.html) of the [Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wimawca1998540/) , states that he has lost 9 per cent use of his left upper extremity.
He received compensation of $225,000, inclusive of costs, in April 2011, but, after the refund of workers compensation and other payments ($69,502) and legal costs ($50,000), he said he received about $31,000. (It may be that he actually received slightly more.)
In August 2013, the Medical Appeal Panel awarded Mark $11,250 in compensation in respect of injuries sustained to his left hand in a work accident in 2002. He subsequently received $10,125 (after deduction). He says that this payment was used to carry out general maintenance and repairs on Genevieve's home ($6,000 to $7,000) and that the balance was given to his son, to assist him in going to Queensland to find work.
Mark does not suffer intellectual or mental disability. He states that, other than the injury to his hand, he is otherwise in good health (although his blood pressure is "a little elevated"). He is not taking any medication.
Martin says that he is "in reasonable health". the age of the applicant when the application is being considered 
Mark was born in October 1967 and is currently aged 47 years of age.
Martin was born in January 1969 and is currently aged 45 years.
 any contribution (whether financial or otherwise) by the applicant to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of the estate of the deceased person or to the welfare of the deceased person or the deceased person's family, whether made before or after the deceased person's death, for which adequate consideration (not including any pension or other benefit) was not received, by the applicant
Mark says that, on occasions, when he was financially able to do so, he would assist the deceased financially. He gives, by way of example, the payment of her car registration and insurance, on three or four occasions, the last of which was shortly before her death. He also says that he did work on her car that kept it running.
He says that he often mowed her lawns and did other gardening for her. Sometimes, he did handyman jobs around the Ulladulla property or, if he was unable to do these jobs, he arranged for others to do them. Otherwise, he states "I would care for the deceased in the same way any son would care for his mother. I would provide her with loving care and support".
He says that his de facto partner would sometimes go with him to visit the deceased and, if the deceased had no money, it was Genevieve who would pay for groceries.
Martin says that, on the occasions that he visited the deceased, he would mow the lawns, sweep the path, prune the trees and clean a fishpond.
Each of Mark and Martin refer to his relationship with the deceased as contributing to her welfare.
 any provision made for the applicant by the deceased person, either during the deceased person's lifetime or made from the deceased person's estate
Each of the Plaintiffs is to receive a legacy of $20,000 under the terms of the Will. It is not suggested that any provision was made for each during the deceased's lifetime. any evidence of the testamentary intentions of the deceased person, including evidence of statements made by the deceased person
There is no evidence of any testamentary intentions of the deceased other than those disclosed by the Will. However, I note that the deceased attended on a solicitor to have the Will drawn. No doubt, she attempted to leave her limited property as she thought best in all the circumstances.
Nakia gives evidence of a conversation, shortly before the deceased's death, in which the deceased, somewhat prophetically, said: "I've left you a share in my house but you'll have to stand up for yourself.
The others will want to fight you for it." whether the applicant was being maintained, either wholly or partly, by the deceased person before the deceased person's death and, if the court considers it relevant, the extent to which and the basis on which the deceased person did so
The deceased did not maintain either Mark, or Martin, wholly or partly, at the time of her death. However, it is clear, that at other times, when they were children, she did maintain each of them.
 whether any other person is liable to support the applicant
Apart from the Commonwealth government's responsibility to continue to provide each of Mark and Martin with a pension, there is no other person with a liability to support either. the character and conduct of the applicant before and after the date of the death of the deceased person
An evaluation of "character and conduct" may be necessary, not for the sake of criticism, but to enable consideration of what is "adequate and proper" in all the circumstances. Importantly, the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) does not limit the consideration of "conduct" to conduct towards the deceased.
I have referred to Antony's criticism of Mark earlier.
In addition, he disputes the extent of the deceased's relationship with each of the Plaintiffs. However, overall, I am satisfied that each did what he could to assist the deceased. the conduct of any other person before and after the date of the death of the deceased person
Antony lived, mostly, with the deceased until he was 25 years of age. He returned to live with her just after Christmas 2007. He lived there for about 6 months, after which he continued living in the Ulladulla area. They would spend a lot of time together. He would assist her in any way that he could. When he remarried, in July 2012, the marriage took place within the hospital grounds where the deceased was a patient so that the deceased could be a part of the ceremony.
I am satisfied that Antony had a close relationship with the deceased and that he was a loving and dutiful son to her. He is, with Nakia and Ashley, the chosen object of the deceased's bounty.
There is no suggestion that the relationship of the deceased and each of Nakia and Ashley was not a close one. Each, after all, is also a chosen object of her testamentary bounty. any relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander customary law
This is not relevant.
 any other matter the court considers relevant, including matters in existence at the time of the deceased person's death or at the time the application is being considered
There is no other matter that I consider relevant.

Determination
Being an "eligible person" is a necessary precondition to the court being empowered to make an order for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person. In this case, as already stated, there is no dispute that each of Mark and Martin, as a child of the deceased, is an eligible person within the meaning of [s 57(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s57.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/).
There is also no dispute that each commenced the proceedings within the time prescribed by the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/).
Having established eligibility and that the proceedings were commenced within time, relevantly, the first question for determination is whether, at the time the court is considering the application, adequate provision for the proper maintenance or advancement in life, of Mark, and of Martin, has not been made by the Will of the deceased. Whether such provision has been made for each requires an assessment of his individual financial position, the size and nature of the deceased's estate, the relationships between each and the deceased and other persons who have legitimate claims upon her bounty and the circumstances and needs of those other persons: see Tobin versus Ezekiel, at [70]; McCosker versus McCosker, at 571-572; Singer versus Berghouse, at 210; Vigolo versus Bostin, at [16], [75] and [112]; and Verzar versus Verzar [2014], at [39].
Having considered the matters I am required to consider, I am satisfied that the deceased did not make adequate provision for the proper maintenance and advancement in life of each of the Plaintiffs by her Will. Whilst the net estate is very small, the financial and material circumstances of each are not very good. In addition, each has children to support and, whilst each is in a relationship, the circumstances of his de facto partner is not such that I would regard it as resulting in a significant change to those circumstances.
It is clear that each of Mark and Martin has some immediate "needs". As stated above, "need" in the context of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) is not determined by reference only to minimum standards of subsistence. Nor is it limited to whether the applicant has, at the date of hearing, an immediate need for financial assistance with respect to his maintenance. It is a broader concept, which requires consideration of matters necessary to guard against unforeseen contingencies. The term is also used in the in the sense of what was necessary for the applicant's "proper maintenance, education and advancement in life": Akkerman versus Ewins <case>, per Tobias JA, with whom Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreed.
Neither appears currently able to survive with an income that is derived, principally, from a pension. In each case, without some provision, it is highly unlikely that either will be able to improve his station in life. Each has a need for capital that is immediate.
In coming to this conclusion, I also have taken into account the legitimate claims upon the bounty of the deceased and the obligation and responsibility that the deceased had to provide for Antony, Nakia and Ashley. In the case of Nakia and Ashley, each is young and starting out in her, and his, economic journey of life. In the case of Antony, he seems to be better able to provide for himself than either of Mark or Martin.
Therefore, I reject the Defendant's primary submission that adequate and proper provision has been made for each of Mark and Martin by the Will of the deceased.
The more difficult question then arises, namely what provision "ought to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life" of each of Mark and Martin, having regard to the facts known to the court. This involves "an instinctive synthesis that takes into account all the relevant factors and gives them due weight": Grey versus Harrison. It is not a scientific, or arithmetic, exercise. As agreed, any provision that is made should be made in lieu of his entitlement under the Will and should be borne out of the proceeds of sale of the Ulladulla property.
In the event that the court reached the conclusion that further provision ought be made, each counsel made submissions about the extent of the provision that ought to be made. Interestingly, they were not very far apart. 
Counsel for the Plaintiffs submitted that each Plaintiff should receive a lump sum that equates with 25 per cent of the net estate. Counsel for the Defendant submitted that each Plaintiff should receive no more than 20 per cent of the net estate.
Doing the best I can, I am of the view, that each Plaintiff should receive a lump sum that equates to 21 per cent of the net estate. Such a lump sum will provide something as a buffer for exigencies of life. 
That leaves 58 per cent of the net estate. Although each party submitted that the share of the estate left to Antony should not bear the burden of any provision made for each Plaintiff, I do not consider that such a result would be to be just and equitable to Nakia and Ashley. In this regard, the deceased considered each of them in the same way as she considered Antony, by leaving each one third of the residuary estate.
However, in considering this question, I must also consider all of the other facts in the case, including the financial and material circumstances of each and the age and stage of life of each at the date of hearing.
Again, doing the best I can, I am of the view that Antony should receive 28 per cent of the net estate and that each of Nakia and Ashley should receive 15 per cent.
Then, using the estimate of $158,960 as a guide, each Plaintiff, in lieu of the provision made for him in the Will, would receive about $31,792; Antony will receive about $44,508; and each of Nakia and Ashley will receive about $23,844. (I have done this calculation simply by way of demonstration.)
Accordingly, the court: 
Orders, pursuant to [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , [rule .10(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s7.10.html), that the Defendant be appointed to represent the deceased's estate and notional estate for the purposes of these proceedings.

Any order subsequently entered or made in the proceedings binds the deceased person's estate to the same extent as the estate would have been bound had a personal representative of the deceased person been the Defendant in the proceedings.

Orders, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s91.html) [Succession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) , that administration in respect of the estate and notional estate of the deceased, Yvonne Jones, be granted to each of the Plaintiffs, for the purposes only of permitting his application for a family provision order to be dealt with.

Orders that compliance with the Court Rules in relation to Order (iii) above be and is hereby dispensed with.

Orders, pursuant to [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s66.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), that the Defendant sell the deceased's property at Ulladulla and the deceased's car.

Orders that the first Plaintiff, in lieu of the provision made for him in the will of the deceased, is to receive, out of the estate, a legacy that equals 21 per cent of the net estate of the deceased.

Orders that the second Plaintiff, in lieu of the provision made for him in the will of the deceased, is to receive, out of the estate, a legacy that equals 21 per cent of the net estate of the deceased.

Orders that the burden of the provision made for each of the Plaintiffs be borne by the residuary beneficiaries and that, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/s66.html) of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/): the Defendant, in lieu of the provision made for him in the Will of the deceased, receive a legacy which equals 28 per cent of the net estate of the deceased; and that each of Nakia Jones and Ashley Jones receive, in lieu of the provision made for her, and him, in the in the Will of the deceased, a legacy which equals 15 per cent of the net estate of the deceased.

Orders that the Plaintiffs' costs, assessed and agreed at $40,000, be paid out of the estate of the deceased.

Orders that the Defendant's costs, assessed and agreed at $19,527, be paid out of the estate of the deceased.

Notes that the net estate of the deceased is to be calculated by deducting, from the gross proceeds of sale of the Ulladulla property and from the sale proceeds, if any, of the car owned by the deceased at the date of her death, the costs and expenses of obtaining Probate of the deceased's Will (estimated to be $4,682), the debts, funeral and testamentary expenses (estimated to be $16,931), the costs and expenses of sale of the Ulladulla property (estimated to be $7,500), the legacy payable to the deceased's daughter, Karina ($20,000), the costs of the Plaintiffs ($40,000) and the costs of the Defendant (estimated to be $19,527) and any other expenses that are agreed by the parties and by Nakia Jones and Ashley Jones. (In each case, the actual, rather than the estimated, amount should be deducted.) 
Grants liberty to any party to apply, in these proceedings, for consequential and ancillary orders for the purpose of, or with respect to, giving effect to and implementing the orders made herein.

Directs that the Exhibits be dealt with in accordance with the [Uniform
Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) [(rule .16A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s31.16a.html) and [rule .10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s33.10.html), and Practice Note No SC Gen 18 (Para 26).
