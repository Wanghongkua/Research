JUDGE1
SPENDER AJ:  These proceedings are brought by the Botany Council to challenge a final report by the Deputy Ombudsman ("the Ombudsman") dated 16 September into a complaint by Mr Brant Perry regarding determinations by the Botany
Council on a freedom of information application made by Mr Perry. In that report the Ombudsman made various findings and recommendations. The plaintiff
Council claims:
A declaration that the Ombudsman does not have jurisdiction to conduct an investigation into the Council's refusal to amend a letter from it to Mr Foley and to Mr Perry of 24
September , and a Mayoral Minute of 4 November 1992.
A declaration that the findings and recommendations on pages 17 to 25 of the defendant's report under [section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/oa114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/oa114/) into the complaint made by Mr Brant Perry pursuant to the [Freedom of Information Act, 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/) against the plaintiff are not within the jurisdiction of the defendant.
 
BACKGROUND AND FACTS
The dispute which gives rise to these proceedings relates to the management and organisation of an event known as the Botany Big Splash Touch
Football Competition ("the Touch Football Competition"). There is no dispute as to the relevant facts and I take them from the affidavit of Margaret
Therese
Rodgers of 20 October 1994.
On 21 September 1992 a meeting was held of a committee of the plaintiff to consider matters relating to the management and organisation of the Touch
Football Competition. Mr Foley and Mr Perry were present, and the Mayor and aldermen.
At that meeting the committee resolved that the Mayor be requested to refer a report of the Council's General Manager concerning an accounting review of the organisation of the Touch Football Competition to a meeting of the whole Council on 22 September 1992.
That was done. At a special meeting of the Council on 22 September there was a discussion of issues said to have arisen in relation to the management and organisation of the Touch Football
Competition. This took place in the absence of the public and the press.
The
Minutes record the following which are described as recommendations: "1. Had Council known the proponents of the competition would derive income or profit from the competition then
Council would not have sponsored, granted or allowed the competition to proceed on that basis. Further, Council, at all times, expected the running of the competition to be voluntary and as a non-profit organisation operated as a worthwhile, local community project for the benefit of the people of the Municipality of Botany.
With the exception of the referees' payments, all amounts paid which constitute staff hire, wages, or income for personal exertion, be refunded and paid to the Council.
 . Council does not accept that the Canteen operated as a break-even proposition, nor does it accept that there is no information available to show details of income, expenses, profit, stock acquisition and the like.
In respect of the 1992/1993 Touch Football Competition or any other such future competition, Council insists that it be run as a worthwhile, local community project, operating for the benefit of the Municipality of Botany and will not allow such operation for personal gain or profit by the competition organisers or promoters.
 . Council approve of the running of a Touch Football
Competition at Booralee Park by the applicants or other organisation conditionally upon the basis that it be carried out as a volunteer, community project, and that none of the proponents or organisers derive any income for personal exertion or profit from either Canteen operations or the running of the competition generally.
Further, any such operators undertake, as soon as practicable, to become a non-profit, incorporated association in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Code that Council be indemnified and that the operators meet all necessary licensing and certification requirements in relation to the conduct of the Competition.
Following incorporation, Council representatives be included as members of any Committee or Board of Directors established by that organisation in compliance with incorporation requirements.
The current proponents be permitted to conduct a /1993 Competition in accordance with previously recommended conditions following refund of monies as referred to in recommendations 2 and 3 or entry into a Deed of Agreement to do so.
The income for personal exertion or profit paid to the various recipients be brought to the attention of the
Federal Taxation Commissioner."
These recommendations were approved and adopted on 23 September .
On 24 September 1992 the Director of Parks Gardens and Recreation of the
Council wrote letters to Mr Foley and to Mr
Perry in identical terms. His letter set out the eight recommendations which I have quoted, said that the
Council at its meeting of 23 September resolved to approve and adopt the recommendations and sought the advice of Mr Foley and Mr Perry, particularly in regard to items 2, 3, 5 and 7, within seven days.
On 4 November an article appeared in the local newspaper. It is not necessary to go into the detail of that article. Its nature appears from the opening words: "Promoters of the Big Splash Touch Football
Competition,
Paul Foley and Brant Perry, of Mascot, emphatically reject allegations made by Botany Council concerning any impropriety in the manner in which they have conducted the competition for the past two years.

A central issue in the row was the charge that Botany
Council did not know that 'officials' were to be paid." (Original emphasis).
This drew an immediate response on that day from the Mayor who brought forward a Mayoral Minute pursuant to Ordinance 1, clause 18 of the Local
Government Ordinances then in force. The Minute is a lengthy and somewhat rambling document, and highly critical of Mr Foley and
Mr Perry. The Minute was received by the Council and the recommendations in it approved and adopted at a meeting of 25 November 1992.
The minute thus became a resolution of the
Council.
On 30 November 1992 Mr Foley wrote on behalf of himself, and I infer Mr
Perry (no dispute was raised on this point) to the Freedom of Information
Coordinator of the Council and sought copies of certain items under the [Freedom of Information Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/) (the "FOI Act") including the Mayoral Minute of 31 October 1990. Mr Foley's letter went on: "We understand we have a legally enforceable right under the
NSW Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 1989 to request amendments to documents about out personal affairs that are incorrect, out of date or misleading.

Therefore, we would understand "amendments" to mean "retractions" in this particular instance of incorrect and misleading statements contained in the following documents:
Correspondence dated 24 September 1992 to both
Competition organisers from Council in relation to the fact that: "Council would not have sponsored, granted or allowed the competition to proceed if had known the proponents would derive income or profit from the Competition." "The Council at all times expected the running of the competition to be voluntary and a non-profit organisation." 
Retraction of these statements makes all other statements in this correspondence void. Therefore, the organisers expect a letter from Council retracting these statements.
Contents of additional mayoral minute of October's
Council meeting held of 4 November 1992 are to be retracted by the issue of a further mayoral minute at the next special meeting of Council. Items to be retracted are as follows: "as the organisers have now publicly identified themselves, it is recommended that all material now be made public". This has so far not occurred and we demand this be retracted or all material be released which is the crux of this entire request"; "discovery that these people and their family and friends were pocketing public funds were only discovered in an audit by the Finance Manager early in the year"; "the Council at all times expected these people were operating on a voluntary basis in the interests of the community, not in the interests of pocketing themself';" "these people think that they have a right to be paid $20 an hour for a proposal they put to Council." "these people decided amongst themselves that they were going to pay themselves $20 an hour for organising the Touch
Football Competition"; "this was an outright profit making venture designed to personally benefit these people"; 
Additionally, certain statements made by the Mayor in mayoral minute of 4 November 1992 subsequently reported in the Messenger newspaper on 11 November 1992 are to be retracted in their entirety in a press release in an upcoming publication of the Messenger newspaper.
Paragraph two of the statement regarding the withdrawal of Council's support for 1992/1993
Competition contained in
Council's latest "Horizons" publication to all residences within Botany Municipality is to be retracted by the issue of the special horizons publication in December 1992.

Please find enclosed out cheque for $30 representing
Application fee required to be submitted under the NSW
Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 1989.

We clearly understand that you must acknowledge receipt of out application and that our application must be handled within 21 calendar days. We are fully aware of out rights to reviews and appeals under the NSW Freedom of Information
Act, 1989, if we are dissatisfied with the determination of out application or any part there of." (Original emphasis).
On 4 January 1993 Mr Foley wrote (again I infer on Mr Perry's behalf as well) pointing out that no decision on their application had been forthcoming, that they regarded the application as having been refused and requested an "internal review" to be conducted. By letter of 15 January 1993, the Deputy
Mayor provided Mr Foley with a determination of the internal review application. Access to certain documents were given; the amendment to the
Council documents which had been requested by Mr Foley was rejected.
Mr Foley then went to the Ombudsman. This led to the final report of 16
September 1994 which is the subject of these proceedings. This report is expressed to be a report under [section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/oa114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/oa114/) in relation to the Council's determination of Mr Perry's freedom of information applications.
The detail of the report is not, for the most part, relevant, as the question before the Court is the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, not the accuracy of the report. But I shall touch on some features of the report to illuminate the issues before me.
Complaint was made to the Ombudsman by Mr Perry about the Council's refusal to provide him and Mr Foley and to amend certain documents held by the
Council: paragraph .1. The deemed refusal of the Council to provide Mr Foley and Mr Perry on their request as a consequence of the operation of section (2), 43(2) of the FOI Act was noted: paragraph 3.3; so was the internal review and the determination on that: paragraphs 3.4, 3.5.
The applicable legal requirements were dealt with in section 4, which section referred to the coming into effect of the FOI Act, the availability of external reviews by complaint to the Ombudsman or appeal to the District Court, that where a complaint is made to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman decides that the complaint should be investigated, it is investigated under the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/oa114/).
The report then dealt with the right to apply for amendments of an agency's records under the FOI Act and then, in Part 5, dealt with the investigation undertaken by the Ombudsman. In paragraph 5.1 it is recorded that on 31 March a notice was sent to the
Mayor of the commencement of an investigation "as a result both of Mr Perry's and Mr Foley's complaint and of the
Ombudsman's own motion", and that the Council was informed of the subject matter of the investigation, namely: "1. Council's alleged failure to make a response to Mr
Foley's and Mr Perry's FOI application of 30 November 1992.
 . The making of the determination of 15 January 1993 and any conduct in relation thereto, to deny Mr Foley and Mr
Perry access to documents the subject of their FOI application and to refuse to amend certain documents as requested in his application.
 . The giving of any advice or information relating to the determination."
The report continued by discussing investigations made, and recording "relevant matters" (pages 6 to 12). Views are then expressed (pages 13 to 25) first in respect to access to documents, which is not of importance, and then in respect of amendment of records, which is directly in issue. The latter subject was dealt with at pages to 24; at page 25 findings and recommendations were set out. Pages 17 to 25 are the subject of the second claim for relief in these proceedings.
I now set out the findings and recommendations: "FINDINGS .1 Council's failure to provide a written determination in response to Mr Foley's FOI application of 31 November 1992 was unreasonable in terms of [section 26(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). 8.2 Council's determination of 15
January 1993 that the tape recording of the Special Meeting of 22 September 1992 was an exempt document pursuant to clause 12 of Schedule 1 of the [Freedom of Information Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/), was a valid determination in accordance with the provisions of that Act.
 .3 Council's determination of 15 January to refuse to amend Mr Maree's letter of 24 September 1992 to Mr Foley and
Mr Perry and the Mayoral Minute of 4 November was unreasonable in terms of [section 26(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman
Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/).

RECOMMENDATIONS .1 That Council resolve at its next ordinary meeting to implement the following recommendations: .1.1 That within one month of that meeting any copies of the letters signed by Mr John Maree, the Director of Parks, 
Gardens and Recreation, dated 24 September 1992 addressed to
Mr Foley and Mr Perry be amended in accordance with Appendix of this Report. 9.1.2 That within one month of that meeting the Mayoral minute of Councillor Ron Hoenig dated 4
November be amended in accordance with Appendix 4 of this Report."
The recommended amendments were in identical terms (save for one minor matter) and read: "Addendum. Pursuant to a recommendation made by the Deputy
Ombudsman in its Report published under [Section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) arising out of an external review of an application to amend Council records made under the Freedom of Application Act by
Mr Brant Perry, and Mr Paul Foley,
Council resolved at its meeting held on that this document be amended by adding the following statement: 
Council acknowledges that submissions regarding the Botany
Big Splash Touch Football Competition were received firstly from Mr Brant Perry on 19 March and 21 August 1990 and, secondly, from Mr P Foley on 27 February and 23 April 1991 and 6 April 1992. Such submissions included information that administrators, officials referees and staff of the Botany 
Big Touch Football Competition would receive payment for their activities, thereby deriving income from their involvement with the Competition. Council acknowledges that it was disclosed to Council that Mr Foley was to be the director of the Competition and that Mr Perry was to be the director of referees. Council acknowledges that it would or should reasonably have been aware when it sponsored the
Botany Big Splash Touch Football Competition that the
Competition's administrators, officials, referees and staff would derive payment or income from the Competition. On this basis, certain of the recommendations passed by Council at its Special Meeting of 22 September 1992 are misleading, incorrect and incomplete." 
What I have just quoted is the recommended amendment to the
Mayoral Minute. The last sentence of the amendment recommended to the letter of 24 September referred to recommendations passed by Council at a special meeting of 22
September 1992 in place of the Mayoral Minute.
 
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS
THE [OMBUDSMAN ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) [Section 5(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s5.html) defines "public authority" as meaning, amongst other things, any local government authority or any member or employee of a local government authority. [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/index.html#p3) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) is headed "Investigations and
Conciliations". Relevantly it provides: "12. (1) Subject to this section, any person (including a
public authority) may complain to the Ombudsman about the conduct of a public authority..." "13. (1) Where it appears to the Ombudsman that any conduct of a public authority about which a complaint may be made under [section 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s12.html) may be conduct referred to in [section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html), the Ombudsman may, whether or not any person has complained to him about the conduct, make the conduct the subject of an investigation under this Act. (2) Subsection (1) has effect notwithstanding anything in any Act passed before the passing of this Act."
By Section 16 a notice of investigation must be given: "16. (1) Upon the Ombudsman deciding to make the conduct...
of a public authority the subject of an investigation under this Act, he shall give notice of his decision: where there is a complainant, to him; to the head of the public authority and, if practicable, to the public authority; and as prescribed.

A notice under this section must be in writing, must describe the conduct .... the subject of the investigation and must, so far as practicable, identify the public authority." 
Succeeding sections deal with privacy, the public authority to give information when required, the holding of inquiries, the entry of premises and other matters.
I now come to section 26, which is in Part 4, the part of the Act which deals with reports. It states: "26. (1) Where, in an investigation under this Act, the
Ombudsman finds that the conduct the subject of the investigation, or any part of the conduct, is of any one or more of the following kinds: contrary to law; unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory; in accordance with any law or established practice but the law or practice is, or may be, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory; based wholly or partly on improper motives, irrelevant grounds or irrelevant consideration; based wholly or partly on a mistake of law or fact; conduct for which reasons should be given but are not given; otherwise wrong, the Ombudsman is to make a report accordingly, giving his or her reasons.
 
In a report under this section, the Ombudsman may recommend: that the conduct be considered or reconsidered by the public authority whose conduct it is, or by any person in a position to supervise or direct the public authority in relation to the conduct, or to review, rectify, mitigate or change the conduct or its consequences; that action be taken to rectify, mitigate or change the conduct or its consequences; that reasons be given for the conduct; that any law or practice relating to the conduct be changed; that compensation be paid to any person; or that any other step be taken.

The Ombudsman shall give a report under this section: to the responsible Minister; to the head of the public authority whose conduct is the subject of the report; and where the public authority is employed under the [Public
Sector Management Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psma1988235/), to the Premier's Department.

The Ombudsman may give a copy of a report under this section: where the investigation arises out of a complaint to the
Ombudsman, to the complainant; to the public authority to whose conduct the report relates.

The person to whom a report is given under subsection (b) may, and on request by the Ombudsman shall, notify the Ombudsman of any action taken or proposed in consequence of a report under this section."
Limitations on legal proceddings against the Ombudsman against are set out in Sections 35A and 3513: "35A. (1) The Ombudsman shall not, nor shall an officer of the Ombudsman, be liable, whether on the ground of want of jurisdiction or on any other ground, to any civil or criminal proceedings in respect of any act, matter or thing done or omitted to be done for the purpose of executing this
Act unless the act, matter or thing was done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith.

Civil or criminal proceedings in respect of any act or omission referred to in subsection (1) shall not be brought against the Ombudsman or an officer of the Ombudsman without the leave of the Supreme Court. (3) The Supreme Court shall not grant leave under subsection (2) unless it is satisfied that there is substantial ground for the contention that the person to be proceeded against has acted, or omitted to act, in bad faith." "35B. (1) Where any question arises as to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to conduct an investigation or proposed investigation, the Ombudsman, or any interested party, may apply to the Supreme Court for a determination of that question.

On an application made under subsection (1) the Supreme
Court may make such order as it considers appropriate.

For the purposes of subsection (1), the following persons are interested parties: the public authority the conduct of which is the subject of the investigation or proposed investigation; the head of that public authority; if the investigation arises from the making of a complaint under section 12 (1), the complainant.

This section has effect notwithstanding section 35A."
No question of bad faith within s.35A is in issue; leave was not sought to commence the proceedings.
 [FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/)
The objects of this Act are set out in section 5: "5. (1) The objects of this Act are to extend, as far as possible, the rights of the public: to obtain access to information held by the Government; and to ensure that records held by the Government concerning the personal affairs of members of the public are not incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.

The means by which it is intended that these objects are to be achieved are: by ensuring that information concerning the operations of the Government (including, in particular, information concerning the rules and practices followed by the
Government in its dealings with members of the public) is made available to the public; and by conferring on each member of the public a legally enforceable right to be given access to documents held by the Government, subject only to such restrictions as are reasonably necessary for the proper administration of the
Government; and by enabling each member of the public to apply for the amendment of such of the Government's records concerning his or her personal affairs as are incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.

It is the intention of Parliament: that this Act shall be interpreted and applied so as to further the objects of this Act; and that the discretions conferred by this Act shall be exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and encourage, promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost, the disclosure of information.

Nothing in this Act is intended to prevent or discourage the publication of information, the giving of access to documents or the amendment of records as permitted or required by or under any other Act or law." 
The definition of "agency" section 6 includes a council. Part 3 deals with access to documents. By section 16 a legally enforceable right to get access in accordance with the Act is conferred; by section 17 application is to be made in writing and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to enable the document(s) to be identified. Section 25 deals with the rights of refusal of an agency. Section 25(1) states: "25. (1) An agency may refuse access to a document: if it is an exempt document; or ..........
if it is a document that is available for inspection at that or some other agency (whether as part of a public register or otherwise) in accordance with Part 2, or in accordance with a legislative instrument other than this
Act, whether or not inspection of the document is subject to a fee or charge; or if it is a document that is available from, or available for inspection at, that agency, free of charge, in accordance with that agency's policies and practices; or if it is a document that is usually available for purchase; or if it is a document that genuinely forms part of the library material held by the agency."
Pursuant to Ordinance 1, Clause 38(e) under the [Local Government Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/) the
Council's minute book may be inspected without cost, and copies of extracts made at any reasonable time.
By [section 28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/s28.html) an agency shall cause written notice to an applicant of the determination made on the application made to it.
[Part 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/index.html#p4) is headed "Amendment of records". [Sections 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/s39.html) and [40](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/s40.html) state: "39. A person to whom access to an agency's document has been given may apply for the amendment of the agency's records: if the document contains information concerning the person's personal affairs; and if the information is available for use by the agency in connection with its administrative functions; and if the information is, in the person's opinion, incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading." "40. An application for the amendment of an agency's records: shall be in writing; and shall specify that it is made under this Act; and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to enable the agency's document to which the applicant has been given access to be identified; and shall specify the respects in which the applicant claims the information contained in the document to be incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading; and if the application specifies that the applicant claims the information contained in the document to be incomplete or out of date-shall be accompanied by such information as the applicant claims is necessary to complete the agency's records or to bring them up to date; and (f) shall specify an address in Australia to which notices under this Act should be sent; and shall be lodged at an office of the agency."
Section 52 deals with review by the Ombudsman. Sections 52(1) states: "52. (1) The conduct of any person or body in relation to a determination made by an agency under this Act may be the subject of a complaint, and may (subject to this section) be investigated by the Ombudsman, under the [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/)." 
THE SUBMISSIONS
The plaintiff's submissions were to this effect:
The findings and recommendations proceed upon the assumption that Mr Foley had an entitlement under Section 39 of the FOI Act to make the application to amend the letter and the Mayoral Minute and that the Council had a statutory obligation to Mr Foley to consider is application. It is this that grounds the Ombudsman's jurisdiction under Section , and hence to make findings and recommendations.
This assumption that the Ombudsman was erroneous and he has misconceived his jurisdiction. The report is therefore amenable to judicial review under [section 35B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35b.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/): Anisminic Ltd versus Foreign Compensation
Commission <case>; [(1969) 2 AC 147] at 496; Public Service
Association (SA) versus Federated Clerks Union <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR ] was submitted as containing a history of [Section 35B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35b.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/).
Section 39 of the FOI Act spells out four conditions precedent to the right to apply for amendment of an agency's records, the first of which is that it must be a document to which access has been given by the agency in question. The others are to be found in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of that section. (d) It was not reasonably open to the
Ombudsman to conclude that these jurisdictional facts had been met in respect of the letter of 24 September 1992 as:
The letter to Mr Foley was not a document to which access was given pursuant to the FOI Act.
It does not fall within section 39(b) of the FOI Act; it does no more than advise him of the recommendations of the committee of the whole Council.
 
The letter accurately recorded the recommendations made by the committee and the Council's adoption of the resolutions. It would be manifestly unreasonable for the
Ombudsman to conclude that the information in that letter was incomplete, incorrect, out of date or misleading.
relevantly it does not deal with the information concerning personal affairs within section (a) of the FOI
Act.
The minutes accurately recorded what took place. That is their function: minutes are to reflect accurately what takes place at a meeting; if the content of a resolution is to be changed this should be done by subsequent resolution only:
Re Cawley and Co [(1889) 42 Ch D 209] at 77.
Mr Foley had a copy of this Mayoral Minute and did not seek access to it under the FOI Act.
It is unclear what information that Minute contains concerning Mr Foley's personal affairs.
The Ombudsman has taken issue with a resolution of the
Council and is endeavouring to exercise the role of the elected Council.
In essence, the defendant's submissions were to this effect:
The Ombudsman can conduct an investigation under the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) as required by section 52 of the FOI Act.
He had power to do so.
In accordance with [section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) he found the conduct under investigation unreasonable, so recorded, and made recommendations to rectify, mitigate or change the conduct or its consequences: [section 26(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). The findings of unreasonable conduct were made in paragraphs 8.1 and 8.3.
The effect of [sections 35A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35a.html) and [35B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35b.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) deprive the Court of jurisdiction. [Section 35B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35b.html) does not apply to completed investigations. The council was on notice as to the terms of the investigation and had plenty of time to complain about any jurisdictional matter.
Section 39 of the FOI Act applies; the words "has been given" should be read as applying to documents, however obtained and not just to documents under the FOI Act.
Counsel for the defendant referred to the objects of the FOI
Act as set out in section 5 in support of the interpretation placed by him on section .
 
REASONS AND FINDINGS
In my view the challenge made by the plaintiff fails.
I have referred to the terms of [Sections 35A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35a.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/).
That section has been the subject of two decisions of this court: Ainsworth v
The Ombudsman [(1988) 17 NSWLR 276 (Enderby] J), and The Commissioner of Police v The Ombudsman (Sackville AJ, unreported, 9 September 1994).
In Ainsworth, Enderby J held that [Section 35A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35a.html) prevents any form of civil proceedings being taken against the Ombudsman (other than those in respect of which leave is required).
He dismissed a summons brought against the Ombudsman seeking judicial review of the Ombudsman's decision to discontinue investigations into police conduct.
In The Commissioner of Police versus The Ombudsman the challenge related to draft reports containing provisional findings critical of the Commissioner.
The relief claimed included an order restraining distribution of the draft reports and a declaration that the Ombudsman was not authorised to publish any report or finding that the Commissioner had behaved unreasonably or oppressively.
Sackville AJ referred to Ainsworth. found Enderby J's reasoning convincing, and followed Ainsworth.
I agree with each of those decisions, and the reasoning expressed by
Enderby J and Sackville AJ.
Courts are, as Sackville AJ pointed out, astute to require clear words before concluding that a statute denies an individual access to them. But if the intent of a legislation is clear, jurisdiction may be denied. That is a conclusion which I reach in respect of the present proceedings.
The plaintiff's challenge is expressly put on the basis that the
Ombudsman lacked jurisdiction to conduct his investigations and make his findings and recommendations.
What is sought to be done is to make him "liable" on that ground, i.e. amenable to process in this court, to its orders, including cost orders. That is exactly what [Section 35A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35a.html) is intended to prevent.
Nor does [Section 35B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35b.html) help the plaintiff Council. That provision concerns the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman "to conduct an investigation", or to conduct a "proposed investigation". Plainly enough that refers to an investigation which is embarked on, or to be commenced. It cannot apply to an investigation which has already taken place. Such an interpretation would be directly at odds with [Section 35A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35a.html), and is contrary to the clear intent of [Section 35B(1):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35b.html) no question of jurisdiction to "conduct" to manage or carry out an investigation or proposed investigation can arise when the investigation is over. See generally The Commissioner of Police versus The
Ombudsman at pages 31 to 33. It follows that [Section 35A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s35a.html) affords no basis for any challenge to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman as sought in paragraph 1 of the summons.
Lastly, I turn to the general question of jurisdiction - as it may be termed of the Ombudsman. I do so with reference to each of the claims for relief made by the plaintiff.
The first thing to note is that the report itself is said to be a report pursuant to [section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). As I have pointed out, by Clause .1 of the report it is recorded that an investigation commenced as a result both of Mr Perry's and Mr Foley's complaint, and of the Ombudsman's own motion. This is a decision which the Ombudsman may take, and did take, pursuant to [section 13(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s13.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). The further provisions of that
Act then come into play. While the report was initiated by the refusal of the
Council to accede to the requests made of it pursuant to the FOI Act, the jurisdictional fact is that the Ombudsman was exercising powers pursuant to the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) and in particular [section 13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s13.html) and subsequent sections. He found that the Council's determination to refuse to amend Mr Maree's letter of September 1992 and the Mayoral Minute of 4 November 1992 was unreasonable in terms of [section 26(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) of the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). As will be seen from the terms of that section, where in an investigation under the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) the
Ombudsman finds that conduct is "unreasonable" he "is to make a report accordingly" with reasons. In that report he may, pursuant to [section 26(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) recommend that "action be taken to rectify, mitigate or change the conduct or its consequences."
That, in my opinion, is precisely what the Ombudsman has done. The
Ombudsman is not purporting to exercise any powers of the Council. He is not purporting to change the minutes or to change the Council's correspondence.
What he is doing is to exercise jurisdiction under the Ombudsman's Act (not the FOI Act) to make recommendations to the Council. Those recommendations may be accepted or rejected; that is entirely a matter for the Council.
I add that (as there was a fair amount of debate on the point) whether or not the plaintiff's argument to the effect that the letter of 24 September and the Mayoral Minute of 15 January 1993 were not "given" within Section , and that consequently, even if the other conditions specified in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Section 39 are made out, Section was wrongly invoked by Mr Perry and Mr Foley is correct, seems to me to be beside the point. The Ombudsman was exercising the jurisdiction conferred on him by the [Ombudsman Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/). Under [Section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) the Ombudsman's attention is directed, by [Section 26(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) to a number of matters. For example, under [Section 26(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) even though conduct is in accordance with law or established practice, it may still be unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory. In such circumstances he can made recommendations pursuant to [Section 26(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/s26.html) Assuming therefore that Mr Perry and Mr Foley were legally misguided in seeking amendments to the letter and the Mayoral Minute under the FOI Act, that does not mean that the Ombudsman is without power to make recommendations in respect of those documents. To hold otherwise would be to unnecessarily read down Section 26 and would be contrary to the objects of the Act: see Section .
In passing I note that in paragraph 4.6 of his report the Ombudsman, contrary to the thrust of the submission made by the plaintiff, appears to have applied himself to the correct legal criteria so far as Section 39 of the
FOI Act is concerned.
It follows that each of the claims for relief must fail.
 
ORDERS
I make the following orders:- . The summons is dismissed.

The plaintiff will pay the defendant's costs.
