Last Updated: 3 April 1998 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CUSTOMS versus CONGA FOODS PTY LIMITED /96 February 1998 
Simpson J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HER HONOUR: [S 165(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html) of the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (Cth) provides as follows: "(1) When any duty has been short levied or erroneously refunded the person who should have paid the amount short levied or to whom the refund has erroneously been made shall pay the amount short levied or repay the amount erroneously refunded on demand being made by the CEO within twelve months from the date of the short levy or refund." 
S 153 of that Act provides: "All duties shall constitute Crown debts charged upon the goods in respect of which the same are payable and payable by the owner of the goods and recoverable at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction by proceedings in the name of the Collector." 
By summons the plaintiff claims an order that the defendant pay to the plaintiff as a Crown debt within the meaning of <case> the sum of $13,951.32.
The question raised for determination by the summons concerns the proper application of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html), particularly whether, in the circumstances of the parties "any duty has been short levied". If it has, it is common ground that the time limit of twelve months imposed in the concluding words precludes recovery of the amount claimed.

The plaintiff is the Chief Executive Officer of Customs appointed pursuant to and having the administration of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). The defendant is an importer, and therefore for the purposes of <case>, the owner [(s 4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s4.html), of goods which include Italian canned tomatoes. It is the defendant's contention that, in the circumstances shortly to be related, duty was short levied and that, more than twelve months having elapsed since that occurred, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html) operates as a bar to recovery. The plaintiff's contention is that, while duty was exigible, none (of the relevant kind) was levied, there was therefore no short levy, and that <case> accordingly applies to permit the recovery now sought.

Legislation 
It is convenient before stating the factual basis for the claim to observe the relevant statutory provisions. They appear in the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and in the
Customs Tariff (Anti Dumping) Act 1975 ("the Anti Dumping Act") which, in <case>, incorporates the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and requires the two Acts to be read "as one". The relevant sections are designed to confer power on the Minister to take steps to protect Australian industry from what is perceived as unfair competition from overseas.
 [S
TG(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s269tg.html) and (2) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) empower the
Minister, on being satisfied of certain conditions, to declare by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, that <case> of the Anti
Dumping Act applies to goods that have been exported to Australia (sub <case>) or to goods that are similar to goods that have already been exported to
Australia (sub <case>).

S 269TJ(1) and (2) are similar provisions empowering the Minister, on being satisfied of certain other conditions, to declare that <case> of the Anti
Dumping Act applies to goods that have been exported to Australia (sub <case>) or goods that are similar to goods that have already been exported to
Australia (sub <case>).

S 8 of the Anti Dumping Act is directed to the practice known as dumping. It imposes, in relation to goods to which it applies by virtue of a <case> declaration, a special duty of Customs called a dumping duty. By sub <case> that sum is to be quantified as the amount by which the export price of the goods is less than the normal value of the goods. (S 269TG (3) requires a notice under subs <case> or (2) to include a statement of the amount ascertained by the Minister to be the normal value of the goods to which the declaration relates and <case> contains provisions for the determination of the normal value of the goods.) Sub <case> is, however, subject to sub <case>, pursuant to which the Minister may, by notice in writing, direct that an alternative method of ascertaining the amount of dumping duty is to be used.
By sub <case> a sub <case> notice may specify a date earlier than its date of publication as the date from which it applies.

S 10 of the Anti Dumping Act is directed to goods that have received the benefit of a subsidy or other financial assistance in their country of origin or country of export. It imposes a special duty of Customs called a countervailing duty on goods to which it applies by virtue of a <case> declaration. It follows a format similar to <case>: sub <case> provides for quantification of the duty by reference to the amount of subsidy the goods have received, but, like <case>, it is subject to sub <case>, pursuant to which the Minister may, by notice in writing, direct an alternative method of ascertaining the amount of countervailing duty. Sub <case> is in terms virtually identical to those of <case> and likewise permits the Minister to give the notice retrospective effect.

Facts 
There is no dispute about the relevant facts, most of which were put before me in the form of an agreed statement which became ex A.

On 21 April 1992, pursuant to his powers under [ss
TG(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s269tg.html) and (2) and [269TJ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s269tj.html)(1) and (2) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) the
Minister published notices in the Gazette declaring that ss 8 and 10 of the
Anti Dumping Act applied to canned tomatoes imported from Italy. The effect of the notices was that dumping duty and countervailing duty were imposed in relation to the goods. The notices were, in a statement of contentions attached to the summons, referred to respectively as the dumping decision and the countervailing decision and I gratefully adopt this convenient terminology. On the same date the Minister determined, under <case>, the normal value of the goods.

On 10 May 1994 pursuant to ss 8(5) and 10(5), the Minister directed that the dumping duty and countervailing duty payable in respect of relevant goods were to be ascertained in the way prescribed by those subsections, and not as prescribed by sub <case> of each section. Notice of the directions was published on 18 May 1994. Pursuant to sub <case> in each case he appointed 10
February 1994 as the date from which the notice applied. This notice has been referred to as the calculation decision.
 (There is an explanation for the long interval between publication of the dumping decision and the countervailing decision in 1992 and the calculation decision in 1994. On 21 April 1992, when he made the dumping decision and the countervailing decision, the Minister also purported to direct, in accordance with ss 8(5) and 10(5) that the amount of duty in each case be ascertained pursuant to that sub section. Litigation between the parties in the Federal
Court of Australia followed which established that the calculation decision was invalid. It was after the conclusion of this litigation that the presently operative and relevant notice containing the directions was given on 10 May .) 
Between 11 February 1994 (the day following the date on which the calculation decision became applicable) and 17 May 1994 (the day before publication of the calculation decision) the defendant made three importations of the goods. In each case, customs duty was levied and paid. There is no suggestion that the importations were other than procedurally orthodox and correct. No special duty of Customs (dumping or countervailing) was levied or paid.

On 19 February 1996 the plaintiff made a demand on the defendant for payment of the sum of $13,951.32. This is the sum which results from the application of the calculation decision to the goods imported.

The defendant argues that the omission by Customs officers to levy special duties of Customs is properly characterised as a short levy as contemplated by s 165(1). That being so, the time limit imposed by the sub section operates as a bar to recovery.

The plaintiff's contention is that, as there was no levy of either dumping duty or countervailing duty, there was no short levy of those duties either.

S 165 therefore has no application and <case> operates to permit the plaintiff to recover the duty at any time.

In support of his argument counsel for the plaintiff referred to Carmody v
FC Lovelock Pty Limited <case>; [(1970) 123 CLR 1.] That was a case in which a notice, equivalent to a <case> notice, was published on 21 May 1964 and given retrospective operation to 30
April 1962. The importations concerned were alleged to have been made after the date of commencement but before the date of publication of the notice. S was there unsuccessfully invoked as one of a number of grounds of demurrer to proceedings brought by the Comptroller General of Customs. It was held that, while the notice operated retrospectively, it nevertheless imposed "a special and additional duty on the importation ... in question" (McTiernan J, p 9) and that, because the duty was imposed after the importation had been completed, there could have been no short levy at the time of importation (Menzies J, p 12, and Gibbs J, with whom on this point Barwick CJ, Windeyer,
Owen and Walsh JJ agreed, p 25).

A distinction is to be drawn between the circumstances that appertained in
Carmody and those of the present case. In Carmody, at the time of importation, there was no applicable notice equivalent to a <case> notice and therefore no exigible duty. It is by the Minister's notice, published in the
Gazette, that <case> and/or <case> are brought into play and the duty is thereby imposed. Thus, at the time of importation in Carmody, no duty was exigible; at the time of the importation in the present case, by reason of the s 269TG and TJ declarations, both dumping and countervailing duties were exigible. At the time of importation, there being no valid sub <case> direction, the amount of duty payable was, in each case, quantifiable under sub <case>. Carmody is, therefore, as counsel acknowledged, useful only because it makes plain that special duties of Customs are "special and additional" duties separate from ordinary customs duty.

The distinction between Carmody and the present case is a significant one. It highlights precisely the argument advanced on behalf of the defendant.
It emerges clearly from two sentences in the judgment of Gibbs J: "Clearly <case>, in referring to short levy, refers to the case where duty which was exigible at the date of payment was not paid in full. It does not have any application to the present case, where a special duty was imposed subsequent to the payment of the ordinary duty." (p 25) 
For his part senior counsel for the defendant relied upon the decision of the
Queensland Court of Appeal in Carter Holt Harvey Manufacturing Group Pty
Limited versus Comptroller General of Customs [(1996) 128 FLR 96.] That case concerned importations which were, apparently mistakenly, treated as importations from New Zealand, with the result that a concessional rate of duty prevailed. Application of the concessional rate meant that the goods were assessed as liable to no duty. When the mistake was discovered the Comptroller
General of Customs, purporting to act under <case> (1), demanded payment of the duty. He did so outside the twelve months period prescribed by <case>, and, accordingly, if the goods had been short levied, and <case> applied, the demand was statute barred. It was held that in these circumstances duty had been short levied (even though the amount that had been levied was a nil amount).

That case, too, can be distinguished. It was concerned with ordinary duty of
Customs. There was no question of special duties. It was the very duty the subject of the later demand that was the subject of the assessment resulting in a nil levy. That is not this case. Here, Customs duty, but not special duty, was levied. What is now sought to be recovered is special customs duty, never previously levied.

The question now to be determined is whether, when Customs duty was levied at the time of import, the failure of the Customs authorities to levy an amount attributable to dumping duty and countervailing duty constituted a short levy of the duty payable. That really raises the question whether the words "any duty" in <case> are to be taken as referring to the total duty (or to all duties) exigible at the time duty is levied, or whether the words recognise the different classes of duty and are to be read distributively. In my opinion, the words "any duty" were intended to distribute the reference so as to acknowledge that different classes of duty may be levied. If this were not so, there would have been no need for the word "any" to have been included in the section. The special duties of Customs are discrete duties, separate and distinct from the duty otherwise imposed by the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). The inclusion of the adjective "any" before "duty" in my view, concludes the issue against the defendant. While "ordinary" duties of Customs were levied at importation, no attempt was made to levy any amount (or a nil amount) with respect to either of the special duties of Customs applicable. That is quite different to the situation in Carter Holt, where the earlier assessment of the very duty later demanded resulted in a nil levy. [S ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html) cannot apply unless there has been a levy of the particular duty that is the subject of the demand. There cannot be a "short levy" until there has been a levy. There was no levy of the duty now sought to be recovered and, accordingly, there was no short levy. [S ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html) does not apply.

I have hesitated in coming to this view because of the passage in the judgment of Gibbs J in Carmody already extracted. I do not think, in the first sentence, his Honour was intending to lay down a rule that, where a particular class of duty is exigible at the date on which any other duty is paid, and whether or not an assessment of the amount of that duty is made, duty is taken to have been levied in relation to that class of duty. His Honour was there making the point that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html) could have no application where, at the time of importation, no duty of the class later demanded was exigible.

I am of the view that in relation to the two special duties of Customs no duty was levied, there was therefore no short levy of duty, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s165.html) has no application, <case> applies, and the plaintiff is entitled to the amount claimed.

I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of $13,951.32, together with the plaintiff's costs of the summons.
