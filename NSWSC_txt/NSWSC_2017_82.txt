JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of an assessment in relation to an unexplained wealth order under [section 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act. [Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act says that the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person whose interest in property is sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime related activity, stating the grounds on which the suspicion referred to therein is based, and the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 14 February 2017. Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the Defendant is engaged in serious crime related activity or activities being the offences of obtaining a financial advantage or causing a financial disadvantage by deception contrary to [section 192E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s192e.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . That is an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years involving fraud and accordingly falls within the definition of 'serious criminal offence' in [section 6(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading a document entitled Summary of Evidence which was disseminated to it from ICAC in January 2017. Ms Bourne sought confirmation from the person believed to be the investigator that prepared the document, that the Summary of Evidence was true to the best of the investigator's knowledge and belief, that the investigator had prepared it and that it was prepared on information attained by ICAC as a result of its investigation and the officer replied in the affirmative to those enquiries.
Ms Bourne's suspicion is also based on information obtained from a financial analyst employed by the Plaintiff who engaged in searches identifying property believed to be owned by the Defendant. I have read the Summary of Evidence document provided to the Plaintiff and I am satisfied that Ms Bourne's suspicion that the offence or offences have been committed is reasonably held.
The Plaintiff seeks that the orders be made without prior notice to the Defendant. It does so based on Ms Bourne's statement in paragraph 8 of her affidavit that, based on her experience, in the absence of a restraining order it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate very quickly, to dispose of motor vehicles or back date transfer forms and to dispose of funds held in bank accounts very quickly all in an attempt to defeat the operation of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
I am satisfied that the orders should be made without prior notice to the Defendant. The Defendant has her rights under [section 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review of those orders.
I note that the usual undertaking as to damages is given by the solicitor for the Plaintiff. On that basis I make orders in terms of 1 to 3, 5, 7 and 9 of the draft order.
I grant the leave and liberty in paragraphs 4 and 6. I stand over the summons for mention before the Common Law Registrar at 9am on Monday 15 May 2017. These orders may be entered forthwith.
