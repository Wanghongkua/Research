Fexuto Pty Ltd versus Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd and Ors (No. 4) Matter No /97 [1998] NSWSC 617 (26 November 1998) 
Last Updated: 10 December 1998 `FEXUTO PTY LTD versus BOSNJAK HOLDINGS PTY LTD & ORS (No. 4)` `3799/97` `26 November 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The defendants have filed a notice of motion for directions as to the accounts ordered to be taken. 
The practice in New South Wales up to the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) was that when an appeal was filed, as has happened in this case, the accounts were not taken until after the appeal was determined, unless the court otherwise ordered. That followed from <case> of the Equity Act 1901. The reasons for that approach were set out in a judgment of Owen CJ in Eq in Parson versus Gillespie (No 2) (1896) 17 LR (E) 69, 70. The position in England was just the reverse and it was only if irreparable damage would be caused by conducting the enquiry pending the appeal, that there was a stay; Hyam versus Terry [(1880) 29 WR 32]; In re "Carvino" Trademark [[1911] 2 Ch 572], 580.

Section 86 was repealed and not replaced when the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) came into force. Probably as the Supreme Court Practice editor says, the English practice now applies that a stay does not automatically follow anything ordered to be done under the court's decree. However, the old English cases talked about special circumstances for there to be a stay and it is clear from other authorities in the New South Wales Court of Appeal that special circumstances are no longer a matter that is relevant in assessing whether a stay should be given.

The real question in this motion is whether the risk of wasting an expensive accounting exercise is greater than the risk the other way.

After discussing the matter this morning, the second to eighth defendants no longer press for an account at this stage and the matter can just stand over into my list at 9.30 am on 18 March 1999 at which time the vital factor in the equation may be known, that is when the appeal is likely to be heard.
