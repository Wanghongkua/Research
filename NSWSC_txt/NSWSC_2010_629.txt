JUDGMENT: - 1 - 
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
BALL J JUNE 2010 /110769 WOODLAND HOME PRODUCTS PTY LIMITED (ACN 002 060 246 & ANOR versus ALEX PICALOVSKI 
JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: This case involves an application under [sections 8(1)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/s8.html) and [5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html)(1)(b) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) which will, in effect, transfer proceedings which are currently on foot in the Industrial Court of New South Wales to the Federal Court. 
From 30 April 1996 to 30 March 2009 the defendant in these proceedings, Mr Picalovski, was employed by one or other of the plaintiffs (together "Woodland"). Mr Picalovski resigned from his employment on 30 March 2009. On 4 March 2010 he filed proceedings in the Industrial Court of New South Wales seeking to recover accrued annual leave, accrued long service leave and superannuation entitlements. Mr Picalovski relies on [sections 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aha1944163/s3.html) and [13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aha1944163/s13.html) of the [Annual Holidays Act 1944](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aha1944163/) , as well as Division 4 of [Part 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealedact/wra1996220/index.html#p7) of the [Workplace Relations Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/repealedact/wra1996220/) (Cth) and sections 4 and 12 of the Long Service Leave Act 1995 . Woodland oppose Mr Picalovski's claim in the Industrial Court proceedings. 
On 4 May 2010 Woodland brought proceedings in the Federal Court claiming that Mr Picalovski made a number of unauthorised transfers of funds out of Woodland's bank account on account of annual leave and long service leave for his own benefit. In those proceedings, Woodland seeks damages and/or an account of profits and ancillary relief for breach of fiduciary duties, breach of duties under an employment contract and breach of [sections 181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Mr Picalovski denies those allegations. However, he does not oppose the current application.  [Section 8(1)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s8.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) empowers this Court to remove proceedings in another New South Wales Court to the Supreme Court where it appears that such an order should be made so that consideration can be given to whether those proceedings should be transferred to another Court. 
Section 5(1)(b) of the Cross-Vesting Act empowers this Court to transfer proceedings pending in this Court to the Federal Court if it appears, relevantly, that it is more appropriate that the proceedings be determined in the Federal Court having regard to three factors. They are (a) whether the proceedings or a substantial part of them are capable of being instituted in the Federal Court but incapable of being instituted in this court; (b) the extent to which the issues raised arise under Commonwealth legislation and are not within the jurisdiction of this Court apart from the cross-vesting legislation; and (c) the interests of justice. 
Taking account of these three matters, I think the proceedings in the Industrial Court should be transferred. 
As to the first matter, Mr Picalovski's claim for annual leave undoubtedly arises under the [Fair Work Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fwa2009114/). Even if the claim originally arose under New South Wales legislation, schedule 3 item 6 of the [Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fwpacaa2009656/) provides that, where an employee has accrued annual leave during the period before 1 January 2010, the provisions of the [Fair Work Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fwa2009114/) relating to annual leave apply as if the leave had been accrued under that Act. This Court does not have jurisdiction to hear that claim but the Federal Court undoubtedly does. There may be a question whether the Federal Court would have jurisdiction to hear the claim in respect of long service leave alone, but whether or not it does, it would clearly have accrued jurisdiction to hear that claim: see, for example, Carr versus Blade Repairs Australia Pty Ltd <case> 
As to the second factor, the claim under the [Fair Work Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fwa2009114/) clearly arises under Commonwealth legislation and is not within the jurisdiction of this Court. 
As to the interests of justice, I accept that it would be desirable if the two proceedings were heard together. Both arise out of Mr Picalovski's employment with Woodland. Inevitably, therefore, there will be a substantial overlap in the evidence and findings that may need to be made on factual issues which are common to both proceedings. Indeed, the defendant concedes that there is an overlap in the two proceedings. Both proceedings are likely to involve credit findings concerning the same witnesses and the same subject matter. Those factors point strongly to the desirability of making the orders sought: see, for example, AMP Financial Planning versus Green <case>; <case>. 
For those reasons, I make the orders that have been handed to me and which I will initial and date today's date and place with the papers.
