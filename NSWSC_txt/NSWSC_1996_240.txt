JUDGMENT - (motion to extend the limitation period) 
HIS HONOUR: 
The plaintiff was an enlisted serviceman in HMAS "Melbourne", when that vessel collided with HMAS "Voyager" on 10 February 1964. He claims to have contracted a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resulting, in turn, in excessive cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, alcoholism, brain damage and laryngeal cancer.

The plaintiff had filed a notice of motion, claiming an extension of the limitation period. It was common ground that, without an extension of time, the plaintiff's cause of action was extinguished by effluxion of time.

The plaintiff applied for a ruling that, on the hearing of the motion, he should be entitled to rely on the evidence of expert witnesses (in the form of reports), without producing the witnesses for cross-examination. The defendant opposed the application, offering to make its own expert witnesses available for cross-examination.

For the purposes of the ruling, evidence was tendered showing the expert evidence (in the form of reports and other data) which the plaintiff and the defendant respectively intended to adduce on the hearing of the motion. The plaintiff's witnesses supported the diagnosis of PTSD, its alleged sequelae, including laryngeal carcinoma, and the alleged chain of causation leading back to the effect of the collision on the plaintiff's psyche. The defendant's witnesses impugned the diagnosis of PTSD, the causal connection between that alleged condition and excessive smoking and drinking, and the causal connection between the laryngeal carcinoma and excessive smoking and/or drinking. It was also part of the defendant's case that the history of events (including the plaintiff's mental/emotional condition since the collision) would not be shown to be as the plaintiff's experts had assumed.

I ruled that the defendant would not be permitted to cross-examine the plaintiff's expert witnesses on the hearing of the motion. I said I would give my reasons at a later time. They will appear in this judgment.

I then proceeded to hear the motion for extension of the limitation period. I made an order extending the limitation period. My reasons for that order appear in this judgment.

It is first necessary for me to set out my understanding of the relevant provisions of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

Although the plaintiff ultimately relied only on [ss
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) and [60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html), the terms of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) and [57B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html) bear upon the proper construction of the later sections.
 [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) and [57B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html) provide (relevantly) as follows: "58. (1) This section applies to a cause of action founded on negligence nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury, not being a cause of action which has survived on the death of a person for the benefit of his estate under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1944404/s2.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1944404/), and not being a cause of action which arises under section 3 of the Compensation to
Relatives Act of 1897.

Where, on application to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of action to which this section applies, it appears to the court that: any of the material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause of action was not within the means of knowledge of the applicant until a date after the commencement of the year preceding the expiration of the limitation period for the cause of action; and there is evidence to establish the cause of action, apart from any defence founded on the expiration of a limitation period, the court may order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended . . ." "57B. (1) For the purposes of this Subdivision: * * * * * * * the material facts relating to a cause of action include the following: the fact of the occurrence of negligence nuisance or breach of duty on which the cause of action is founded; the identity of the person against whom the cause of action lies; the fact that the negligence nuisance or breach of duty causes personal injury; the nature and extent of the personal injury so caused; and the extent to which the personal injury is caused by the negligence nuisance or breach of duty; material facts relating to a cause of action are of a decisive character if, but only if, a reasonable man, knowing those facts and having taken the appropriate advice on those facts, would regard those facts as showing: that an action on the cause of action would (apart from the effect of the expiration of a limitation period) have a reasonable prospect of success and of resulting in an award of damages sufficient to justify the bringing of an action on the cause of action; and that the person whose means of knowledge is in question ought, in his own interests, and taking his circumstances into account, to bring an action on the cause of action;" . . . 
Sections 60F, 60G and 60I provide (relevantly) as follows: "60F. The purpose of this Subdivision is to provide a procedure for a further discretionary extension of limitation periods where the plaintiff was unaware of the fact, nature, extent or cause of the injury, disease or impairment at the relevant time. This procedure is available for causes of action accruing on or after 1 September 1990, and also (by the operation of Schedule 5) for causes of action that accrued before that date.
 . . .

G. (1) This section applies to a cause of action that accrues on or after 1
September 1990, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury, but does not apply to a cause of action arising under the [Compensation to Relatives Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/).

If an application for an order under this section is made to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of action to which this section applies, the court, after hearing such of the persons likely to be affected by the application as it sees fit, may, if it decides that it is just and reasonable to do so, order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended for such period as it determines.
 . . . 
I. (1) A court may not make an order under section 60G or 60H unless it is satisfied that: the plaintiff: did not know that personal injury had been suffered; or was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered; or was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omission, at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted; and the application is made within 3 years after the plaintiff became aware (or ought to have become aware) of all 3 matters listed in paragraph (a) -(iii)." 
Schedule 5, cl 4, provides (relevantly) as follows: "4.(1) Section 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued or would have accrued before 1 September 1990, but does not apply to a cause of action arising under the [Compensation to Relatives Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/).
 . . . 
The court may make an order under section 60G or 60H, in relation to a cause of action referred to in this clause if an application for such an order is made within: the period of 3 years referred to in section 60I; or the period of 3 years commencing on 1 September 1990." 
Uninstructed by authority, I would construe <case> as follows. Subsection (1) specifies the causes of action to which the section is applicable. Subsection refers to an application made by a person "claiming to have a cause of action", not to a person having a cause of action. It would have been very easy - easier - to say "having a cause of action" if that had been intended.
The distinction is patently intentional. A cause of action to which the section applies is, therefore, one which the applicant claims to have, and not necessarily one that he has.

This colours <case>. The injury, nature and extent of injury and the connection between injury and the defendant's act or omission, referred to in <case>, are matters integral or related to the applicant's claimed cause of action. It is unlikely that the legislature intended to require proof of the actuality for those matters, but not proof of the actuality of the cause of action to which they are integral or related.

Being unaware is in a different category. That requires proof of the actuality of ignorance at the relevant time. But it is ignorance of a matter or matters claimed, not of a matter or matters which have to be established as the fact.

A further reason for this approach is that, otherwise, issues such as the fact of injury, the actual nature or extent of injury, and/or the fact of the causal relationship between injury and the act or omission constituting such breach of duty (including the fact of the act or omission constituting breach of duty) would have to be litigated out on their merits, as on the hearing of the cause. In many cases that would amount substantially to a hearing of the cause itself. That cannot have been intended. It is commonly the case that the only serious issue in the cause is the very matter, as to which the applicant says he was ignorant for the purpose of a motion to extend the limitation period. That might be the causal relationship between injury and the act or omission constituting breach of duty or the nature and extent of the injury so caused. It cannot have been intended that, in such commonplace circumstances, virtually the whole of the cause would have to be tried on its merits in order to decide a motion for an extension of the limitation period. (The present case is in point. As I understand it, the substantial issues in the cause, in the present case, are whether the plaintiff contracted a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); if so, whether that was causally related to the effect of the collision on him; whether such PTSD caused excessive cigarette smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol; and whether the laryngeal carcinoma was caused by such excess. On the competing construction of the legislation, it would, in effect be necessary in this case to try the cause for the purposes of the motion.) In other cases, the matter, as to which the plaintiff claims to have been ignorant, may be only one of several substantial issues to be tried, but a hearing of any trial issue on its merits (which might take days or weeks) can hardly have been intended.

Sections 58 and 57B are to be construed in a similar way, but more plainly so.
Section 58(2)(a) is directed to ignorance of material facts of a decisive character "relating to the cause of action". That is the cause of action mentioned in <case>(b), being a cause of action as to which there is "evidence to establish" the same. At the time of the enactment of ss 60G and
I that had been construed to mean the availability of evidence which, if accepted, would establish the cause of action. The authority for this construction is Briggs versus James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd [(1989) 16 NSWLR ]
and the decisions conveniently collected by Rogers AJA in that case. To those decisions, there may be added Sorrenti versus Crown Corning Ltd [(1986) 7 NSWLR .] 
In Martin versus Abbott Australasia Pty Ltd [(1981) 2 NSWLR 430] (cited in
Briggs (supra)), Hunt J said (at 443): "The test is thus somewhat less exact than that which is applied by a judge at the conclusion of the evidence at the trial itself in deciding whether there is a case to go to the jury. A certain amount of speculation as to the precise nature of the evidence which will be called at the trial necessarily must be permitted." 
The "material facts relating to a cause of action" referred to in <case> are, therefore, facts relating to a cause of action, as to which the legislature required proof only to the level of there being evidence available which, if accepted, would establish the cause of action. It is unlikely that the legislature would have required a higher level of proof of facts relating to the cause of action than of the cause of action itself.

It is then also unlikely that the legislature would have intended a higher level of proof for what are virtually the self-same matters when <case> came to be enacted. Because the cause of action in <case> is a claimed cause of action, whereas the cause of action in <case> is one as to which there is available evidence, the level of proof required under <case> is lower. What is required under <case> is proof of ignorance (in fact) of one or more of the matters specified in the section, which need not themselves be proved at a higher level than proof of what the applicant claims in the cause.

There is a need to tighten up the concept of a matter merely claimed by the applicant. It cannot have been intended that ignorance of a matter which was fanciful would provide the basis for an extension of time. Whether that qualification needs to be made in the construction of <case> or whether it would operate through the exercise of discretion under <case> in any event is unimportant. The exercise of discretion under <case> would accommodate the qualification, if it is not implicit in <case>.

There is authority for this approach. In Drayton Coal Pty Limited versus Drain (Court of Appeal , 22 August 1995, unreported), the basis of the applicant's claim for an extension of the limitation period was that he was unaware at the relevant time that his hearing loss resulted from negligent failure by his employer to implement an Australian Standard for the protection of his hearing. That failure was the "act or omission", in relation to which the applicant asserted he was unaware of the connection between personal injury and the defendant's act or omission, for the purposes of s
I(1)(a)(iii).

Gleeson CJ (with whom Priestley and Meagher JJA agreed) said (at 2-3): "When the respondent consulted a solicitor he was informed, for the first time, that there was an Australian Standard, which established a Hearing
Conservation Code, and which, in its application to his case, set out a number of requirements which, if complied with, would have protected his hearing.
According to the case the respondent will seek to make out at trial, those requirements included regular hearing testing, the provision to employees of advice and information as to steps that could be taken to protect hearing, and the supply of hearing protection devices. O'Reilly DCJ, of course, did not make any final determination of the merit of the respondent's complaints, but it was apparent from the particulars of negligence, the evidence, and the arguments of counsel, that the respondent was setting out to establish a case in negligence going substantially beyond any complaint, of the kind made in the late 1980's, about the failure to install, in the workplace, sound dampening materials." (Emphasis added) 
His Honour referred to the decision of the High Court in Dedousis versus The Water
Board <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 171.] He then said (at 5-6): "1. Section 60F is no more than an introductory provision that indicates the purpose of Subdiv 3. It is in s60I(1), and not in s60F, that the requirements to be satisfied by a plaintiff are to be found.
The requirement, in s60I(1)(a)(iii), that the plaintiff was, at a specified time, unaware of the connection between the plaintiff's personal injury and the defendant's act or omission, is not identical to a requirement (of a kind which might be inferred from s60F) that the plaintiff was unaware of the cause of the injury. (The decision in Dedousis turned upon that difference).
Section 60I(1)(a)(iii) is concerned with ignorance of the existence of acts or omissions rather than legal conclusions. The legal complexion which may be put upon a set of facts or circumstances (eg actionable negligence), and the plaintiff's awareness of that legal complexion, is not what matters for the purpose of s60I(1).
The acts or omissions referred to in s60I(1)(a)(iii) are the acts or omissions on which the plaintiff relies to found the cause of action referred to in s60G. Those acts or omissions, in a case such as the present (as in
Dedousis) will be found in the plaintiff's particulars of negligence. (In this connection I refer, not to the product of some word processor, which, as some of the particulars in the present case illustrate, might include allegations that are either inapplicable or of marginal relevance, but to the material particulars as they emerge from a consideration of the statement of claim and the evidence in support of the application for an extension of time).
If a plaintiff alleges that his or her employer has failed to provide him or her with a safe system of work and is able to establish that he or she was not aware that there was a safer alternative system then s60I(1)(a)(iii) will be satisfied.
Even so, it will still be necessary for the court dealing with the application for an extension of time to decide whether, under s60G(2), it is just and reasonable to extend the limitation period." (Emphasis added) 
The reference to "evidence in support of the application did not mean that the matter of which the plaintiff said he was ignorant (in Drain (supra), the connection between injury and an act or omission on the part of the defendant) had to be proved as the fact. The evidence on the motion would serve only (in this respect) to assist in establishing what case the plaintiff would seek to make on a hearing of the cause.

That this was the underlying approach in Dedousis (supra) is apparent from the following passage in the judgment of the Court in Dedousis itself.
Referring to a passage in the judgment of Clarke JA in the Court of Appeal, the High Court said (at 181-2): "The difficulty with these approaches is that they take an unduly restricted view of the acts and omissions upon which the plaintiff relies. The plaintiff's allegation of negligence is much broader than an assertion that the defendant failed to supply him with proper earmuffs, as Clarke JA appears to assume. In the plaintiff's statement of claim, the particulars of negligence include, inter alia, allegations that the defendant failed to devise, institute, supervise and maintain a safe system of work; failed to adjust or modify the environment, equipment, plant and machinery in or with which the plaintiff had to work so as to reduce noise levels; failed to warn or educate the plaintiff about the dangers to health and hearing arising from the use of the equipment he would be required to use and from exposure to excessive noise levels; failed to issue, properly fit, and supervise the use of adequate personal hearing protection; failed to conduct workplace sound level surveys; and failed to carry out hearing tests on the plaintiff.

It is true that s60I(1)(a)(iii) is concerned with ignorance of the existence of acts and omissions rather than legal conclusions. However, if a plaintiff alleges that his or her employer has failed to provide him or her with a safe system of work and is able to establish that he or she was not aware that there was a safer alternative system, then the proper conclusion is that the plaintiff was `unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omission' within the meaning of s60I(1)(a)(iii). On that hypothesis, the relevant act or omission is the employer's failure to provide the safer alternative system or to take suitable precautions." (Emphasis added) 
In Drain (supra), Gleeson CJ recognised that approach in the following terms: "In Dedousis the High Court accepted an argument based upon the difference between the particulars of negligence being relied upon by the plaintiff, and the somewhat narrower complaint which had been known to, and made by, the plaintiff some years before instituting his action." (Emphasis added) 
But Gleeson CJ appreciated, with respect, that there had to be some limit to reliance upon ignorance of a matter merely alleged as a basis for obtaining an extension of time. His Honour said: "The mere fact that a plaintiff's lawyers can think up some act or omission, upon which they will wish to place some reliance at a trial, which was not known to the plaintiff at the relevant time, does not automatically mean that the requirements of s60I(1)(a)(iii) are satisfied. On the other hand, the decision in Dedousis establishes that unawareness of a material act or omission which constitutes a substantial ground upon which reliance will be placed is sufficient to satisfy s60I(1)(a)(iii)." (Emphasis added) 
What constitutes a "substantial ground upon which reliance will be placed" introduces a question of judgment and degree, but it is a long way short of the proof of the matter in fact.

His Honour then went on to consider the exercise of discretion. He said (at -8): "It is important to bear in mind, however, that satisfaction of the requirements of s60I(1)(a)(iii) is not an end to the matter. One of the considerations which, in a given case, it may be proper to take into account under s60G(2) is the extent of a plaintiff's awareness at the critical time of acts or omissions which, by reason of their connection with the plaintiff's injury, are to be relied upon as constituting actionable negligence. It may well be that such questions of degree will also have a bearing upon the justice and reasonableness of extending a limitation period. The same applies to the other aspects of s60I(1)(a). For example, a plaintiff might be able to establish that he or she was unaware of the full extent of personal injury suffered, but a court might take the view that, at the relevant time, the plaintiff's awareness, although not complete, was so extensive that it would not be just or reasonable to extend the limitation period. Similarly, the state of a plaintiff's awareness of certain acts or omissions connected with the plaintiff's injury may, in a given case, lead a court to conclude that it would not be just or reasonable to permit the plaintiff to have an extension of the limitation period, even though the plaintiff is able to establish that some other act or omission only came to notice at a later time. In other words, s60G(2) may, depending upon the facts and circumstances of a case, operate as an important qualification upon the practical effect of s60I." 
In Spadotto & Co Pty Limited versus Raber (Court of Appeal , 27 October , unreported), the limitation period was extended at first instance, on a finding that the applicant had been unaware at the relevant time of the connection between his personal injury and the prospective defendant's act or omission; and that it was just and reasonable to do so.

On appeal, the only point taken in relation to the finding of ignorance was that the applicant was fixed with knowledge on the part of his solicitor. That argument was rejected.

It was further submitted, as a second ground of appeal, that the judge at first instance ought to have rejected the application in the exercise of his discretion. The applicant's claim in the cause was that he had suffered a deterioration in his hearing as a result of breach of duty by his employer. It was submitted on the motion that the applicant would inevitably fail because there was a lack of any expert opinion evidence available to him to prove the deterioration in his hearing during or caused by his employment. Priestley JA, with whom Clarke and Powell JJA agreed, rejected that submission, saying: "It may be that the appellant (the employer) will succeed at the trial against the respondent (the applicant in the motion) on the court's consideration of the available evidence against the appellant. However, it does not seem to me that it is for this court to say at this stage that the respondent must fail against the appellant; I say this because there seems to me to be some evidence to support the respondent's case against the appellant. Although the appellant submits that it is only lay evidence and extremely shadowy, I do not think it can properly be said that it follows from the state in which it is in at present that this court should conclude that the respondent must fail at trial." (Emphasis added) 
From this, it appears that no point was taken on appeal (and no point may have been taken at first instance) that the applicant had to establish as a fact the matter specified in <case>(a) as to which he said he was ignorant.

Insofar as the matter in question went to the cause of action - as it did in
Raber (supra) - the prospect of proof in the cause was relevant in the exercise of the Court's discretion under <case>. For that purpose, it was sufficient if there was "some evidence". The test proposed was that a deficiency of evidence bore upon the exercise of discretion if that would lead the Court to conclude that the applicant "must fail" in the cause.

Raber (supra) does not stand as authority in the same way as Drain , because the Court decided the case on principles propounded by the appellant. But there was no dissent by the Court from the approach so propounded.

In an earlier case, Southworth versus Commonwealth of Australia [(1992) 35 FCR ],
Foster J, in a hearing at first instance, took a similar approach to the exercise of discretion. A question arose as to the level of proof required concerning the applicant's cause of action in order to satisfy the Court that it was "just and reasonable" to extend the limitation period. (The case related to <case> but the relevant terminology is identical in <case>). The applicant conceded that it would not be just and reasonable to extend the limitation period if it was demonstrated that the applicant's cause was hopeless. The Commonwealth sought to impose a higher burden on the applicant.
Foster J said (at 583): "The use of the words `just and reasonable' are in terms much wider and much more liberal than the more restrictive provisions that one finds in the other sections." (The "more restrictive provisions" would have included a reference to s (2)(b).) In Southworth (supra), there was no proof of the availability of evidence which, if accepted, would establish the cause of action. There was proof of no more than a realistic prospect that such evidence would be available. In these circumstances, Foster J held that there was "enough material before the court to indicate that there is a proper claim of a cause of action within the meaning of <case>, which it would be just and reasonable to allow the applicant to pursue." 
The implication of this approach in relation to the cross-examination of expert witnesses arose in Scanlon versus American Cigarette Company (Overseas) Pty
Ltd <case>; [[1987] VR 261.] The legislation was equivalent to ss 58 and 57B. Nicholson J refused the prospective defendant's request to cross-examine the expert witnesses who had supplied affidavits which were read on the hearing of the motion for extension of the limitation period. The evidence went to the issue as to whether there was evidence to establish the cause of action which the applicant wished to prosecute. One of the reasons for refusing cross- examination was as follows (at 273-4): "(T)here is no obligation on the applicant to call the evidence in question, but merely to establish that it exists. This, in turn, means that it cannot have been contemplated that such evidence should be called and subjected to test by way of cross-examination . . . (I)t would be extremely improbable that all or any of the medical witnesses would have recanted under cross- examination to such an extent as to enable me to conclude that there was no evidence . . . I consider that unless it can be shown that the purpose of such cross-examination is to demonstrate that such witnesses are expressing quite untenable opinions, right outside the mainstream of accepted medical opinion,
I do not think that such cross-examination should be permitted." 
I respectfully agree with this approach.

On a superficial reading, there is a passage in Harris versus Commercial
Minerals Ltd <case>; [(1996) 135 ALR 353] which could be construed as being contrary to the foregoing approach to the construction of <case>. In that case, the High Court held that the test of knowledge is subjective (at 359). That is not presently relevant.
The Court also said that, where the applicant bases his claim on ignorance of the nature or extent of the injury - ie <case>(a)(ii) - it is the nature and extent of the injury, at the time of the application, of which the plaintiff must show he did not know, rather than the nature or extent of the injury at the expiration of the limitation period (or at a time earlier than that when the proceedings might reasonably have been instituted). As to those alternative constructions, the Court said (at 359-360): "If the first construction is correct, the applicant will have to prove the nature or extent of the injury at the expiration of the limitation period and that he or she was unaware of either its nature or its extent at that time.
Any subsequent consequences or developments of the injury will be irrelevant.
On the other hand, if the second construction is correct, an applicant will have to prove the nature or extent of the injury at the time of the application or other time and then show that at the expiration of the limitation period he or she was unaware of the nature or extent of the injury as proved at the time of the application or other time." (Emphasis added) 
Read literally, this passage would mean that an applicant must establish the nature or extent of the injury as a fact. But, what was said by the Earl of
Halsbury LC in Quinn versus Leathem <case>; [[1901] AC ] at 506 is in point: "... I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides." 
In Harris (supra), the nature and extent of injury at the time of the application was not in doubt. (The applicant was diagnosed as having silicosis in 1971. By the time of the application in 1991, this had developed into a massive fibrosis). There was no occasion for the High Court to consider the level of "proof" required in relation to the nature and extent of the injury, as to which the applicant said he was ignorant. The question related to another aspect of the legislation, namely, whether the section was directed to the nature and extent of injury at the expiration of the limitation period (or earlier) or whether it was directed to the nature and extent of the injury at the time of the application. The level of "proof" required as to the nature and extent of injury did not arise and was not part of the ratio decidendi of the decision. In the absence of specificity in Harris (supra) as to the level of "proof" required - or the need for specificity - I do not regard what was decided in that case as being inconsistent with the approach in Drain and Raber (supra).

Drawing the foregoing points together, I think the following general principles can be stated in relation to the hearing of an application under s
G:
The matter or matters in <case>(a), as to which the applicant says he was unaware at the relevant time, need not be proved as the fact.
Such matters need only have been claimed in the cause, subject to the following qualification.
The claimed matter must not be fanciful, in the sense that there must be a serious issue to be tried.
The last-mentioned requirement will ordinarily be satisfied by establishing that the plaintiff is likely to be able to adduce credible evidence at the trial which, if accepted, would establish the matter in question, or that there is a reasonable prospect that he would be able to do so.
Cross-examination of witnesses on the motion concerning such matters and/or concerning the merits of the cause of action as a whole will ordinarily be inapposite, subject to the following qualification.
Cross-examination of witnesses will be permitted if cross-examination might show that the plaintiff's prospects of proving the matter or matters, as to which ignorance is alleged, and/or the cause of action as a whole are hopeless or, at least, extremely low.
Proof of the applicant's unawareness, at the relevant time or times, of one or more of the matters specified in <case>(a) (as distinct from the matters themselves) must be proved as a fact.
Ordinarily, liberal, if potentially productive, cross-examination of the applicant and any other witnesses on the issue of ignorance will be allowed.

In the present case, there was credible evidence, in the form of expert reports, in support of the applicant's case that he had contracted PTSD as a result of nervous shock received at the time of the Voyager collision and that the various sequelae alleged, including laryngeal carcinoma, were causally related to that illness. There was evidence, in similar form but to the opposite effect, tendered by the defendant. The experts were at issue at virtually every point.

There was no realistic prospect that cross-examination of the plaintiff's experts would disclose that there was no serious issue to be tried in these respects. Also, to be of any conceivable value, cross-examination of the experts would have had to be very extensive, very time consuming and would have amounted to a trial on the merits of the major issues in the cause. For these reasons, I refused to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's expert witnesses.

In his affidavit, filed in support of the motion, the plaintiff gave evidence of the collision between the "Melbourne" and the "Voyager". He felt and heard the impact. He heard the sound of tearing metal, escaping steam and mens' screams. He did not know whether the "Melbourne" was afloat or not. There was a stampede to get out. A closed door barred the way. Someone said there was super-heated steam. He made his way to the boat-deck. There, he saw survivors from the "Voyager" being brought over the side. He had a feeling of disbelief that it was happening.

Thereafter, he said in his affidavit, the collision played on his mind, he had difficulty sleeping, he took alcohol in excess, smoked to excess, became a loner, and took to gambling. He was nervous on the ship. He developed a fear of enclosed spaces and of heights.

He further stated that, in 1968, he was discharged as unfit for service due to an anxiety state, said by the Navy to result from a motor car accident in
His employment, as a carpenter and joiner, since his discharge from the
Navy, had been patchy. He said his condition deteriorated over time.

The plaintiff was reviewed periodically by the Navy and his pension was increased.

In 1970, he consulted a Dr Kerr and was later hospitalised for chronic alcoholism.

In 1993, he lodged a claim for compensation with the Navy, after being informed by another ex-serviceman that the Navy was paying compensation to the survivors of the collision.

Shortly before his pension was adjusted in March 1994, he was told by a doctor that he had a post-traumatic stress disorder and that many of his problems, including anxiety, drinking and fear of heights were caused by the collision.
He said he first learned that he had laryngeal carcinoma in August 1995.

In cross-examination, it was brought out that, according to the plaintiff, he felt nervous and tense on the "Melbourne" after the collision, and that he was torn between furthering his career in the Navy and his discomfort in being on the ship. He knew there was something wrong with him after the collision, he said, but he did not know what it was. He asked a Navy doctor whether he was schizophrenic. The doctor said it was nerves. He consulted Navy doctors about his gambling.

The plaintiff was asked whether, after seeing Dr Kerr, he believed he had a nervous condition caused by the "Voyager" collision. He said he did not know.
He said he did not know what was causing him to drink, smoke and gamble. When the Navy told him he had an anxiety state due to the accident he accepted that as being the fact, he said. He agreed that he had lost interest in the Navy by the time he was discharged.

It was further brought out in cross-examination that when examined by a Dr
Briggs, in relation to his pension review in March 1994, he was told by Dr
Briggs that his condition could be related to the "Voyager" collision. He said, before that, he knew he had a problem since the collision, but he did not know it was related to the collision.

With one qualification, it was common ground that, in the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff had to establish: 
For the purposes of <case>, the plaintiff was unaware of one or more of the matters in <case>(a) as at the expiration of the limitation period or as at such earlier time when the proceedings might reasonably have been instituted.
(The limitation period expired six years after the event, on 10 February .) 
For the purpose of Schedule 5, cl 4(4), the plaintiff did not become aware of all three matters listed in <case>(a), nor ought he to have become so aware, earlier than three years before the motion was filed for extension of the limitation period. (The date three years before the motion was filed is 6
December 1992.) 
The qualification I refer to above is that it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that constructive knowledge ("ought to have become aware") in s
I(1)(b) did not arise where <case> applied (as in this case) only by operation of Sch 5, cl 4(4)(a). I reject that submission. The period of three years in <case>(b) runs either from the time when the applicant knew all three matters mentioned in <case>(a) or from when he ought to have known.

PTSD is an important part of the plaintiff's case, apart altogether from the allegedly resultant laryngeal carcinoma.

Commonwealth of Australia versus Dinnison <case>; [(1995) 56 FCR 389] shows that knowledge of anxiety does not necessarily amount to knowledge of the fact and/or extent of psychological illness.

The defendant has admitted that it was guilty of acts or omissions resulting in the collision of the "Melbourne" with the "Voyager". I accept, in substance, the plaintiff's evidence given on the hearing of the motion. I am satisfied that the plaintiff is in a position to adduce credible evidence at the trial, which, if accepted, would establish that he contracted PTSD as a result of the collision. I find that, until March 1994 or thereabouts, the plaintiff was unaware of the nature and extent of the psychological injury alleged and of a causal connection between that injury and the defendant's acts or omission constituting negligence. A fortiori, the plaintiff did not know of those matters or either of them at the time of expiration of the limitation period in 
February 1970, or at any earlier time.

It follows that at the time of expiration of the limitation period on 10
February 1970, the plaintiff was unaware of one or more of the matters in s
I(1)(a), and that the plaintiff had not become aware of all three matters mentioned in <case>(a), prior to 6 December 1992, that being the date three years before the motion was filed.

I do not find that the plaintiff "ought to have been aware" of those matters mentioned in <case>(a) of which he was unaware earlier than March 1994 or thereabouts. The plaintiff has established to my satisfaction that there was no reason for him to be so aware before that time. Nor was there a time before the expiration of the limitation period when the proceedings "might reasonably have been instituted" in view of the plaintiff's ignorance of the causal relationship between his symptoms and the "Voyager" collision, and of the nature and extent of his mental illness.

The proceedings having been commenced on 29 November 1995, March 1994 or thereabouts is comfortably within the three years specified by <case>(b).

The conditions for operation of <case>, as prescribed by <case> and Sch 5 cl (4), were accordingly made out.

The defendant submitted that the plaintiff's alleged excessive drinking and smoking and his alleged laryngeal cancer were too remote to sound in damages in law, notwithstanding any causal connection supported by the plaintiff's expert evidence. These matters, it was submitted, ought, therefore, to be put out of account for the purpose of <case>. As will have appeared, it has been unnecessary for me to decide that question for the purposes of <case> and Sch 5 cl 4(4). The plaintiff's ignorance of the nature and extent of his mental illness and its connection with the "Voyager" collision is sufficient.

That leaves the question, under <case>, as to whether it is just and reasonable to extend the limitation period.

The strength or weakness of the plaintiff's case is a relevant consideration.
So is the quantum of his claim. However, there is a practical limit to the extent to which these considerations can be brought to account. The prospects in the cause cannot be accurately appraised without a hearing on the merits, either as to liability or quantum. In a particular case, it may be apparent that the plaintiff has a very weak case or a very strong case as to liability or quantum of damages. But, ordinarily, it will not be possible on the hearing of an application to extend the limitation period to assess the prospects between those extremes. In the present case, it was apparent from the evidence led from the plaintiff and from the documentary material tendered in relation to injury and the causation of injury that the plaintiff's prospects of obtaining a worthwhile verdict in this case lay somewhere in that middle range.

It followed that the plaintiff would suffer a serious prejudice if the limitation period were not extended. It also followed that the defendant would suffer a serious prejudice if the benefit of the time bar were removed.
However, the impact of that prejudice on the plaintiff would be considerably greater than the impact of the prejudice on the defendant.

The defendant relied upon [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) of the [Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (Cth) as being fatal to the plaintiff's claim. However, in view of the decision of the High Court in Georgiadis versus Australian and Overseas Telecommunication
Corporation <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 297] and the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in
Mewett versus Commonwealth of Australia (31 August 1995, unreported), I have to hold that the defence does not run.

There is a period of unexplained delay between March 1994 or thereabouts (when the plaintiff became aware of the nature and extent of his psychiatric illness and its connection with the "Voyager" collision) and November 1995 (when these proceedings were instituted). However, having regard to the six year limitation period which existed at the time of the occurrence and the three year limitation period which is now prescribed by the statute, a delay of eighteen months in commencing proceedings did not seem to me to be a heavy consideration. It is, nonetheless, a relevant factor: Koumorou versus The State of Victoria <case>; [[1991] 2 VR 265], and I took it into account.

The defendant claimed to have suffered prejudice as a result of the proceedings not having been commenced within the original limitation period.

There is a general prejudice arising from the passage of time, perhaps better expressed as the risk of particular prejudice which is not identifiable and might never be identified. Kirby P said in Williams versus Minister, Aboriginal
Lands Rights Act 1983 [(1994) 35 NSWLR 497] (at 514): "I do not for a moment say that the long delay would not occasion considerable disadvantage to the respondents in mounting their defence to Ms Williams' case. But it is in the nature of any application to lift the time bar, that there will be some prejudice. The fading memories and the removal of witnesses are inherent in the passage of time. This consideration cannot therefore be determinative, of itself. It is necessary, in each case, to judge the prejudice and to weigh it against the prejudice to the plaintiff of refusing the extension sought." 
One might never know what could have been done earlier to defend the claim, what witnesses might have been found and are now lost, or what witnesses might have said but for faded memories. Of course, in a particular case, delay may be more prejudicial in this way to the plaintiff than to the defendant, but the risk that the defendant has suffered a greater disadvantage than the plaintiff is itself a prejudice.

The defendant submits that, in this kind of case, there is a particularly serious risk of such a disadvantage being suffered by the defendant. The plaintiff's case is one of psychiatric injury. His personality, before and after the event, is therefore critical. So too, in this case, the incidence of drinking, smoking and other behaviour before and after the incident. The recollection by others of their observations of the plaintiff in such respects is, it is said, particularly subject to decay. There is force in this submission. However, one has to direct one's mind to the defendant's position if the proceedings had been commenced within time. The plaintiff had six years to bring the action and, if commenced at the end of the limitation period, the proceedings would not have come on for hearing for some time after that. It may be doubted how much recall observers would have had of the plaintiff's demeanour and conduct by then. Nonetheless, I think there is something to be said for the defendant's submission about the special risk of prejudice in a case of this kind and I take that into account.

The defendant further claimed to have suffered identified prejudice in this case. Some of the points mentioned were really matters of general prejudice, with which I have dealt. There were really only two matters of arguably identified prejudice. The first was the loss of what was referred to as the shipwright's transfer file. These were the papers relating to the plaintiff's promotion to shipwright in 1966. His service record showed that he was found suitable for transfer. It was submitted that the file was likely to contain information that the plaintiff had been working satisfactorily and was not afflicted with any serious emotional disturbance, alcoholism or the like.
There was, however, no evidence to support this suggestion. For all I knew, the Navy's procedures and practices were such that the file would have contained no more than the plaintiff's formal credentials and the processing of his transfer.

The second matter of arguably identified prejudice was the death of Dr J
McGeorge, consultant psychiatrist, in 1979. The defendant's records showed that on 22 February 1968, the plaintiff was interviewed by Dr McGeorge, as an outpatient at the Naval Hospital, "Penguin". The background documentation shows that the plaintiff had sought medical assistance because of compulsive gambling. Dr McGeorge's notes are as follows: "Nil of significance in report of psychologist. Apparently he exaggerates his alleged lack of principles. Still claims he made up stories to get money & is worried because he did so. This is obviously a case of displacement of affect from the true cause to an unimportant one. He denies any other worries. Explained that in a nervous state one attaches undue importance to insignificant things. His wife believes that the car accident coincided with the onset of his present condition & in this she is probably correct. I suggest Mutabon A i t.d.s. for 1/52 & then review." 
The defendant submitted that this interview was of importance because of the absence of any reference to the "Voyager" collision, the denial of any worries other than in relation to gambling, and because of the reference to the car accident.

The plaintiff was an in-patient at the Naval Hospital, "Penguin", for a period in June 1968 and for a further period in July 1968. On the latter occasion, the plaintiff was seen by Dr McGeorge, on 5 July 1968. Dr McGeorge's report relating to that attendance was in the following terms: "Fed up, doesn't like the job he is doing. Feels if he got out he could make something of himself as a carpenter & joiner. Gambles just for something to do. Buying a house, baby due in October. It appears that his compulsive gambling is a reaction to stress. He is irritable today, & excitable, & his main object is to obtain his discharge. He is tense & anxious & it does appear that his service usefulness is at an end. Frustration & dissatisfaction is likely to result in serious disciplinary troubles & I would recommend his discharge for anxiety state before this happens." 
This note related the plaintiff's gambling problem to a broader underlying condition.

It was possible that the notes might be tenderable at the trial under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s69.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) . It also seemed to me that, if Dr McGeorge had been called to give evidence in say or 1973, he would have been unlikely to have been able to say more than appeared in his notes. The value of Dr McGeorge as a live witness as distinct from the tender of the notes seemed, accordingly, to be somewhat speculative.
This item also was, therefore, on analysis, more a matter of risk of prejudice than actual prejudice. As such, I took it into account.

No other features of the case were brought to my attention as being relevant to the exercise of my discretion.

Having regard to these considerations, I was of the opinion that it was just and reasonable to extend the limitation period so as to bring the proceedings within time. Accordingly, I ordered that the limitation period be extended to November 1995.
