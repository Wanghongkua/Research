JUDGE1
KIRBY P The question raised in this appeal by the Crown concerns the consequence of a procedural omission which is said to have occurred in the trial of Mr Dorin Birlut (the respondent).
Mr
Birlut was arraigned on 10 July 1995 in the District Court before
Solomon DCJ. The indictment charged that on 13 April 1994 he had supplied a prohibited drug, namely heroin, contrary to s25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and
Trafficking Act 1985. Mr Birlut entered a plea of not guilty.
 
Accused and prosecution consent to trial by judge alone
Before the trial, as [s32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s32.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) permits and requires, Mr Birlut's legal advisers approached the Crown for the consent of the Crown to a trial before a judge alone.
They tendered the prescribed election form. This was duly signed by Mr Birlut. By s31 of the Act, an accused, charged with an offence of the kind alleged against Mr Birlut, is ordinarily to be tried by judge and jury. The trial before a judge alone is an exception to the ordinary rule. To be allowed it requires compliance with, amongst other things, the election provisions contained in s32 of the Act.
Before 1 July 1995, s32(3) of the Act provided that consent to the conduct of a trial before a judge sitting alone had to be given by the accused and by "the prosecutor". However, as from 1 July 1995 a new statutory provision was substituted. By s3 Schedule 1, clause 1.4(1) of the Criminal Legislation
Amendment Act 1995, the principal Act was amended in s32(3) by omitting the word "prosecutor" and inserting instead "Director of Public Prosecutions". The
Director of Public Prosecutions thus became the person to consent, on behalf of the Crown, to a trial before a judge alone.
It is common ground that when the legal representatives of Mr Birlut applied to the Crown for consent to the conduct of the trial before a judge alone, the consent of the Director of Public
Prosecutions personally was neither sought nor obtained. The prescribed election form was signed by Mr
Birlut, as accused (with the signature of a witness) and also by a prosecutor consenting to the election or the Crown, namely Ms J Wright, Crown Prosecutor.
Within the prosecution service it appears that the amendment to the Act in was overlooked. The previous procedure was followed. The prosecutor who was assigned to the case, namely Ms Wright, purportedly gave the Crown's consent.
The prescribed form, so signed, was duly filed in the District Court as the election document. The trial proceeded. At the opening of the trial the representative of the prosecution tendered the election document. Mr Birlut pleaded not guilty. The Crown called its witnesses. At the close of the Crown evidence Mr Birlut made an unsworn statement. The case for the accused was closed. Counsel addressed. On 12 July 1995 Solomon
DCJ returned a verdict of guilty against Mr Birlut. His Honour does not appear to have formally pronounced an order of conviction.
However, in the course which he had adopted it seems clear that what occurred amounted, in law, to the conviction of Mr
Birlut. See
Della Patrona versus Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2),
Court of Appeal , unreported, 13 October 1995. So much was not really contested for Mr Birlut today. The matter then proceeded in the normal way to the sentencing stage.
 
An amending Act is belatedly discovered: proceedings adjourned
The representative of Mr Birlut sought and obtained an adjournment from
Solomon DCJ so that a pre-sentence report could be obtained. His Honour adjourned the proceedings to 25 August 1995. In the normal course, both the representative of the prosecution and of Mr Birlut would have expected that, on that return day, his Honour would have proceeded to sentence Mr
Birlut, conformably with his finding of guilty and the conviction. However, before the return day the amendment to the Act came to the notice of the prosecutor. Mr
Birlut's representatives were immediately informed. The matter was then drawn to the notice of Solomon
DCJ.
It appears, as the Court has been informed, that the failure to secure the specific and personal attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this case is not confined to Mr Birlut's proceedings. It affects a number of cases which arose between July 1995 (when the amendment came into force) and 28
July 1995 (when it was noticed). During that time, one can infer that a number of cases would have gone to trial before a judge alone. In some the accused would have been convicted. In some the accused would have been acquitted.
Solomon DCJ, being informed of what had occurred, adopted a procedure of adjourning the further proceedings, standing them over generally, with liberty to both parties to restore the matter to the list. This order was an interlocutory order within the meaning of [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
See R versus Powch [(1988) 14 NSWLR 136 (CCA)] CCA). 508ff, 511. The Director of Public Prosecutions, for the Crown, has now appealed to this Court pursuant to [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) against his Honour's order. The Court's jurisdiction, in an appeal such as this, is to affirm, or vacate, the order made or to give an interlocutory judgment or order of its own in lieu of that which was made by Solomon DCJ (see [s5F(2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) The Court does not have a general prerogative power, such as by the ancient writ of mandamus, to compel Solomon DCJ to proceed to the sentencing of Mr Birlut, if that is the view which the Court takes of the requirements of the law. However, it may confidently be expected, if the Court is of the view that his Honour erred in his understanding of his duty in the circumstances which I have outlined, that its order, setting aside the order of adjournment, will have the effect of returning the matter for reconsideration by his Honour, who will then proceed to conclude the proceedings in the ordinary way.
 
Applicable principles of law
The principles of law applicable to the resolution of this appeal can be briefly summarised: 
It is ordinarily the duty of the judge to proceed, after the lawful conviction of an accused person, to sentence that person. In the absence of a lawful justification for doing so, the procedure of standing the matter over generally is therefore irregular. An interlocutory order to that effect would ordinarily be set aside. See eg Regina versus Ellis [(1986) 6 NSWLR 603 (CCA)], 605;
Regina versus Robinson, unreported CCA 15 September 1989; Regina versus Denning, unreported CCA 15 May 1992. Such orders, unless warranted by law, tend to bring the administration of criminal justice into disrepute. That is why they cannot stand; .
The usual rule in a serious offence such as the supply of heroin is that the accused has a right to trial by jury. This is a basic rule, sometimes called a "fundamental" or "constitutional" rule. See eg Newell versus The King <case>; [(1936) 55 CLR 707], 711, 713). Any legislation which diminishes that right, at least in the absence of clear knowing consent of the accused, is given "the strictest construction; nothing shall be holden to come within its operation that is not expressly within the letter and spirit of the Act". See Newell, f, approved in Cheatle versus The Queen <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 541], 436, 446; 
Criminal procedure in our tradition is generally strict. The peril of liberty and the risk to reputation have imposed on criminal trials over the centuries a rigorous discipline so that procedural requirements are strictly complied with in the defence of the regularity of criminal process and the acceptability of its outcome. Rules of practical common sense and flexibility, which have become increasingly acceptable in civil trials, must be viewed with reservation and care in the context of criminal trials.
The fact that a point may be "technical" is irrelevant. The strict application of the rule of law in criminal proceedings is the essence of the way in which, in our legal system, courts have defended due process. The comment that the argument raised is "unmeritorious" is also beside the point. Cf Meagher JA in R versus Perry [(1993) 29
NSWLR 589 (CCA)], 594. If the matter raised has legal merit, that is enough;
The procedural error or omission may, in some cases, be so significant that it strikes at the heart of the jurisdiction of the court See Glennon v
The Queen [(1994) 179 CLR 1], 8; and Regina versus Yuill, unreported CCA 19
July 1994, 10f. This is particularly applicable in the case of a court of limited jurisdiction, such as the District Court of New South Wales. It has no large reserves of the inherent power, derived from the royal prerogative or the common law, to call upon. See Coles versus Burke [(1987) 10 NSWLR 429 (CA)]; Milosevic v
Government Insurance Office of New South Wales [(1993) 31 NSWLR 323 (CA)], 531. If a procedural error or omission strikes at the regularity of the mode of trial, this may not be regarded as merely technical, procedural or irregular. It may then deprive the court of jurisdiction. What then follows, at least in a court of limited jurisdiction, such as the District Court, may be classified by the law to be a nullity. See Regina versus Perry (1990) 29 NSW 589 (CCA), 593. Cf
Regina v Fisher, unreported CCA 22 May 1995 page 2; Regina versus Coles [(1993) 31 NSWLR 550 (CCA)], 551. Examples of cases in which irregularity of procedures have been regarded as fundamental and as undermining the validity of the trial include the cases which I have cited and also Regina versus Golding [(1980) 36 A Crim R 30]; 
Where a procedural requirement is established by legislation, the obligation of compliance and the consequences of non-compliance are sometimes analysed in terms of whether the language of the legislation is mandatory or directory. I have never myself regarded that classification as particularly helpful. One person's mandatory is another person's directory. In a sense, the classification is merely descriptive of the problem and the consequence of the ultimate allocation. It does not help very much in the process of assignment.
However, the exposition of the categories gives a clue to the purpose of the function involved. In Hatton versus Beaumont [(1977) 2 NSWLR 211 (CA)] 226, Mahoney
JA observed, concededly in the context of a civil case: "In determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory the question is not: what did the legislature intend?; it intended that the provision be observed. The relevant question is: what is the con-sequence if it is not observed. Chadwick v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties [(1977) 1 NSWLR 151] at page 156.
That question is to be answered by looking at the subject matter of the legislation and the relation of the particular provision to the general object to be secured by the Act. Chadwick v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties [(1977) 1 NSWLR 151] at pages 156, , and the cases there referred to.
 
In assessing the significance of the particular provision to the attainment of the general objection of the legislation, it is, in my opinion, important to bear in mind the effect of determining that the provision is mandatory. This, in genera1, will be that non-compliance with the provision will result in the 'total failure': Howard versus Boddington [(1877) 2 P.D. 203] at page 210; of anything sought to be done under the legislation, and of any rights which otherwise would flow from it. And this will be so, whatever be the circumstances of the non-compliance and whatever, in the particular case, be the injustice to flow from it. There will, no doubt, be cases in which such a severe sanction will be necessary or appropriate to the attaining of the general object to be secured by the Act, and I am conscious of the authority which exists for the view that, in the context of judicial proceedings, statutory provisions are generally construed as mandatory: see Chadwick's case at page 156.
But the rigidity of the operation of a provision, if mandatory, and the fact that its consequences will flow regardless of the merits of the individual case, must, in my opinion, be carefully weighed. Before a provision is held mandatory, a court should be clearly satisfied that the part played by the particular provision in the attainment of the general object intended to be secured by the legislation is such that it is necessary or appropriate to visit non-compliance with consequences of that kind." 
In Woods versus Bates [(1987) 2 NSWLR 560 (CA)], 567, McHugh JA, with the concurrence of Hope JA, said, also in the context of a civil trial: "In recent times the courts have shown great reluctance to invalidate an act done pursuant to a statutory provision because of the failure to comply with an antecedent condition: see Simpson versus Attorney General [(1955) NZLR 271]; Clayton v
Heffron; Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd versus Swiss Air Transport Co Ltd [(1966) 2 QB 306]; Ex Parte Tasker; Re Hannan (1971) 1 NSWLR 805;
Attorney General : EX rel Franklins Stores Pty Ltd v
Lizelle Pty Ltd [(1977) 2 NSWLR 955], reversed on another ground sub non Permewan Wright Consolidated Pty Ltd versus Attorney
General (Ex rel Franklins Stores
Pty Ltd [(1977) 52 ALJR ] Speaking generally, I think that, at the present time, the proper approach is to regard a statutory requirement, expressed in positive language, as directory unless the purpose of the provision can only be achieved by invalidating the result of any departure from it, irrespective of the circumstances 0r resulting injustice: Cf Hatton v
Beaumont [(1977) 2 NSWLR 211] at page 266 per Mahoney JA."
The ultimate duty of a court, applying a provision such as the amended provision in s32(3) of the Act, is to determine the purpose of the sub-section. It is to decide what is the consequence of non-compliance with its terms.
Where that consequence of non-compliance is not specified in exact language in the statute, it falls to this Court to do so. The
Court must provide its answer consistently with the foregoing principles. In particular, it must seek to achieve consistency with other decisions which have addressed the procedural requirements of the Act and the results of failure strictly to conform, such as occurred in Perry and Fisher; 
In ascertaining the meaning of legislation which is ambiguous, in order to determine the consequences of non-compliance, a court may nowadays have regard to relevant background documents, including Second Reading Speeches,
Explanatory
Memoranda and like material. It should remember that its ultimate duty is to the purpose of Parliament, as stated in the enactment.
In the event that such purpose will not stand with the expressed intention of Ministers, or of those who drew the preliminary documentation, the court must conform to the purpose as expressed in the Act. See Re Bolton and Anor; ex parte Bean <case>; [(1987) CLR 514], 518. In the present case, very correctly, counsel for Mr Birlut pressed upon the Court, as supporting the strict construction for which he argued, the language of s32(3) of the Act and, in particular, the use of the word "only". He also emphasised the importance of the provisions of s3l, which require, in cases where the pre-conditions are not established, that a trial, such as Mr Birlut underwent, should be conducted with a jury.
 
Non-compliance does not render the trial a nullity
I turn now to apply these principles to the present case. It is convenient to start with the purpose of the amendment. On the face of things it was not necessary to provide that a particular office holder, such as the
Director of Public Prosecutions, should sign the consent document. The prosecutors certainly otherwise had power to provide consent by the generous powers conferred upon them by [ss5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/s5.html) and 22 of the [Crown Prosecutors Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/). By [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/s5.html), for example, an individual prosecutor, such as Ms Wright, had power, relevantly: to conduct and appear as counsel in proceedings on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions; ..... and to carry out such other functions of counsel as the
Attorney
General or the Director approves.

The word "conduct" would ordinarily encompass, in such a context, the power to consent (as was previously the practice) to the conduct of criminal proceedings before a judge alone. However, once the amendment was enacted, as in 1995, I consider that such a power would have to be read as subject to the new requirement which had been laid down by Parliament apparently for purposes which appealed to Parliament when the amending Act of 1995 was enacted.
Why did Parliament so enact?
Especially given the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to delegate which is clearly and expressly provided for in his own statute why should it trouble to so provide? Cf [Director of Public
Prosecutions Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/), [s33(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/s33.html) The explanation is given in the Second Reading
Speech of the Attorney General to Parliament, which has been placed before this Court.
Moving the amending Bill, which became the Act which introduced the amendment, the Attorney General (Mr J W Shaw) said, relevantly: "Clause 1.4 of the Bill addresses necessary amendments to the [Criminal Procedure Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/). It amends [section 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s32.html), which permits an accused person to dispense with a jury and be tried by judge alone. This provision is presently being frustrated by the requirement that consent be obtained from the Crown
Prosecutor with carriage of the matter. ADMINISTRATIVE
DIFFICULTIES
IN CONTACTING A PARTICULAR CROWN PROSECUTOR WILL
BE RECTIFIED BY THIS AMENDMENT by enabling the Director of
Public Prosecutions or his delegate to consent to trial by judge alone." (Emphasis added)
This paragraph makes it clear that the mischief to which the legislation was addressed was not misuse, or inappropriate use, of the power by prosecutors or a particular prosecutor.
This could hardly be so by reason of the confidence necessarily inherent in such an office and because of the
Director of Public
Prosecution's power of delegation to individual prosecutors to which the Attorney-General referred. The mischief is the fact that particular prosecutors, with responsibility for a particular trial, could sometimes not be found in time to give the necessary consent within the requisite time prior to the hearing of the case, as the Act and as this Court in Perry required. In such circumstances, the purpose of the amendment, properly understood, was not to take away power, but to permit it to be extended to a wider category of persons, ie either the Director of Public
Prosecutions himself or a persons to whom he might delegate the power to give consent.
What Ms Wright failed to do in this instance was to obtain the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or to obtain the relevant delegation from him after the amendment. But I do not regard that failure as fatal or as going to the legal validity of what she did.
This opinion can readily stand with the view which the Court has taken as to the preconditions of pre-hearing consent.
That strict view, in the case of
Perry, for example, was explained by reference to the need to avoid, as far as possible, "judge shopping". Such a mischief had been identified and emphasised when the Act was originally introduced into Parliament. See New South
Wales
Parlimentary Debates (Legislative Assembly) 24 October 1990, 9160, 9841. It was also emphasised by Gleeson CJ in Perry, at p594; and by Abadee J in the same case, at p593.
No similar imperative requires that a particular office holder within the prosecution's service should consent to the trial by judge alone under the peril that, if that consent were not obtained or a mistake were made, the whole proceedings thereafter would be a nullity.
If, contrary to this opinion, this Court were to adopt the view that trials conducted without the signature of the Director of Public Prosecutions himself (or persons whom he had specifically delegated) were wholly invalid, the result would be to nullify the trials which were conducted in the interim, between 1 July 1995 and the date when the passage of the legislation was discovered. This would affect not only the cases in which those trials had resulted in a conviction with a point available to the accused. Subject to any special principle that would attach to the publicly announced verdict of not guilty, it could also apply to cases of acquittal. The inconvenience of such a result is obvious. Sometimes, of course, the law requires inconvenient results. But in judging whether this could be the purpose of Parliament in the present amendment, it is permissible to consider the consequences of such a holding. The application of that test produces such inconvenient results in this case that, in my opinion, it could not possibly have been the purpose of
Parliament's amendment. Such a conclusion is simply confirmed by looking at the Attorney-General's Second Reading Speech, with its limited, disclosed objective.
 
An alternative argument of continuing delelation rejected
Having come to this view, I do not need to consider at any length the other arguments which were advanced for the appellant, including those based on the provisions of the [Crown Prosecutors Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/) or the provisions of the
District Court Rules Part, 53 rule 10A and B. But I have some difficulty with those arguments.
The reasons, briefly, are these. The prosecutor (meaning relevantly, Ms
Wright) undoubtedly had the power of consent necessary under s32(3) of the Act as it stood before the amendment, taking effect from 1 July 1995. However, the relevant election document bears the date 7 July 1995. As the prosecutor's consent in that document is shown as having been given after the accused's request and consent, the inference (in the absence of contrary proof) is that it was given after the amending Act had taken effect. Once the amendment came into force, it is clear enough that Parliament's purpose was to introduce a new consent regime. True, the new regime, by substituting the "Director of
Public Prosecutions" for the "prosecutor" must be taken to import the
Director's general power of delegation under s33 of the Act. However, once a new statutory provision was introduced, it would be inherent in the amendment itself that any such delegation by the Director would have to be freshly provided. The Director would be obliged, in providing new delegations, to exercise his power of delegation by reference to the amending legislation and to give effect to its amending purpose. The Court is aware that the Director issues guidelines. It might be anticipated that he could wish to reconsider any applicable guidelines by reference to the purposes which lay behind the amendment. He is limited by [s33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/s33.html) of the [Director of Public Prosecutions
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/) and would have to consider and conform to its terms. He might wish to retain supervision by a particular prosecutor at a specified level of the hierarchy in the State's prosecution service. He might wish to lay down a requirement of some familiarity with the case or responsibility for its management. He might wish to limit the giving of consent without reference to himself to certain classes of cases. He might wish to exclude the giving of consent by solicitor advocates in some cases and to limit the facility of giving consent in such cases to Crown Prosecutors under the [Crown Prosecutors
Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/), whilst not limiting the latter to the particular prosecutor who had the general responsibility for the case. Once the amendments to the Act took effect in 1995, the pre-existing general powers of the prosecutor were not unaffected. They had to be read thereafter as subject to the new requirement which Parliament had taken the trouble to enact, namely that (from 1 July ) any election under s32(3) of the Act was reserved to the consent of the
Director of Public Prosecutions or his delegate.
Nor do I consider that the meaning of the terms of s32 of the Act can be delimited by the District Court Rules. The power by s32(6) of the Act to make rules is undoubted. But it is difficult to see how any such rules necessarily expressed in general language, could control the meaning and operation of s32(3). In particular, I find it impossible to accept that any such rules, make before the amendment of s32(3), could cast any light on the meaning to be given to the Act as amended. That is why I prefer to approach the matter in the way that
I have explained.
In view of the foregoing, in my opinion, there being no doubt whatever that consent of the accused was given and the trial having been conducted on that footing, any technical slip or failure to secure the consent of the
Director of Public
Prosecutions personally (or the consent of a person particularly delegated after the amendment) does not invalidate the proceedings or the finding of guilt which followed. The guilty verdict against
Mr Birlut was validly given. It stands.
 
Failure of Judge to express satisfaction that accused was advised
This conclusion leaves the remaining question of an objection which was raised, arising within the terms of section 32(1)(b) of the Act. That section reads in 32(1): "32(1) An accused person in criminal Proceedings in the Supreme
Court or District Court must be tried by the judge alone if: ...
 the judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election, sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor."
Objection is now made that Solomon DCJ did not, before proceedings to conduct the trial, expressly state that he was satisfied in terms of the section. The transcript of the trial has been placed before this Court. It is clear that his Honour did not, in terms, express his satisfaction that s32(1)(b) had been complied with. However, also placed before the Court, as before Solomon DCJ, is the form of consent signed by Mr Birlut. That form, in its material parts, states: " REGINA versus DORIN BIRLUT 
I, Dorin Birlut, of 1 / 127 Frederick Street, Ashfield, being charged with Supply Prohibited Drug, elect to be tried by a
Judge alone in respect of the alleged offence.

I have before making this election sought and received advice in relation to the election from my barrister Roland Bonnici and my solicitor Albert Sbrizzi.

The date fixed for my trial is 10 July, 1995.

DATED: 7 July, ....... (signed)...................... Accused
Witness to signature of accused ....... (signed)..............
The prosecutor consents to this election ..... (sgd) J. Wright
C.P...
Dated: 7-7-95" .
On the face of this document it appears that Mr Birlut was legally represented. No suggestion has been made before this Court, nor was it made before Solomon DCJ, that Mr Birlut was not in fact represented. Indeed, appearing before his Honour was the legal representatives of Mr Birlut. The document was tendered with their full knowledge. Its tender was obvious to all concerned. The Court should therefore infer that, although Solomon DCJ did not say that he was satisfied under the section, he was in fact so satisfied.
Having said this, I consider that it is desirable that judges should expressly specify their satisfaction that s32(1)(b) of the Act has been complied with. Doing so will provide a clear indication, on the face of the record, that they have turned their attention to the requirements of satisfaction. However, I do not consider that the failure to do this is fatal to the validity of the proceedings which followed.
In Regina versus Mifsud, unreported, CCA , 8 November 1994, a case came before this Court under cognate legislation.
There, the judge clearly made a finding of fact. He indicated that he was not satisfied, because of psychiatric evidence, that the accused person was capable of making the necessary election. That case is plainly distinguishable from the circumstances which are now before us. But it illustrates the care with which s32(1)(b) of the Act must be approached and the provisions applied.
 
Conclusions and orders
Each of the objections raised for the appellant having failed, I consider that the appeal should be allowed. The orders which I propose are: 
Allow the appeal; 
Set aside the orders of his Honour Judge Solomon standing over generally the proceedings concerning Dorin Birlut; and 
Order that the proceedings be returned to the District Court for the continuation of those proceedings.
JUDGE2
GLEESON CJ I agree with the orders proposed by the President. I have reached my conclusion on the main issue in the appeal by a somewhat different route. I will express the reasons for that conclusion briefly.
The consent to the election in the present case was given and signed by a
Crown Prosecutor, Ms Wright. In my view, she had power to give such consent by reason of the provisions of [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/s5.html) of the [Crown Prosecutors Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/). Under [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/s5.html), Ms
Wright, as a Crown Prosecutor, had power to conduct, and appear as counsel in, proceedings on behalf of the Director as well as power to carry out such other functions of counsel as the Attorney General or Director approved.
The language of [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/s5.html) makes it clear that the power to conduct proceedings is wider than the power to appear as counsel in them. It is common ground that
Ms
Wright did not intend to appear as counsel in the present proceedings. That was a function which was to be carried out by a solicitor advocate. On the other hand, the indictment was signed by a Crown Prosecutor, as I understand what we are told in the course of argument.
Whether that be so or not, the power to conduct proceedings on behalf of the Director was wide enough to enable Ms Wright, in her capacity as a Crown Prosecutor, to take the decision that it was appropriate to consent to the election of Mr Birlut to be tried by a judge alone and to signify that consent by counter-signing the instrument of election.
The orders of the court will be as proposed by the President.
JUDGE3
DOWD J I concur with the reasons given by the Honourable Chief Justice and I concur in the orders proposed.
I would wish to add this, that in the amendment to s32(3) neither the amendment, nor the reasons given by his Honour, nor those matters outlined by the Attorney General in his Second Reading Speech, deal with the clear structure enunciated in the [Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/) and reflected also in the [Crown Prosecutors Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/), that proceedings may be conducted both by the Attorney General and the Director of Public
Prosecutions.
[Section 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s31.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) covers criminal prosecutions in the State. [Section 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s32.html), in its pre-amended form, that is before the amendment made by Act Number 23 of 1995, contemplated prosecutions by either the Attorney
General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. In its present form, the section creates an anomalous result; unlikely though it is that the
Attorney General would make use of it, it was necessary to appropriately amend the section to preserve the Attorney General's inherent right.
If proceedings were brought by the Attorney General and not by the
Director of Public Prosecutions, under the new amendment it is the Director who would have to consent. The amendment ought properly, in my view, have provided that if the Crown
Prosecutor, under the [Crown Prosecutors Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986247/) or indeed, any prosecutor on behalf of the Attorney General, commenced criminal proceedings, in fact that Crown Prosecutor or the
Attorney General ought to be the person who consents to the election, rather than, as is contemplated here, the Director of Public
Prosecutions. This is particularly so as the Director may not have the conduct of the proceedings, nor have before him the brief or information to properly consider the matter.
It is an unlikely circumstance, but nevertheless the law remains and it was an important part of the parliamentary debate put in the setting up of the [Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/) to preserve that concurrent right of the Attorney General to bring proceedings: that is an inherent right which is reflected in [ss28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/s28.html) and [30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/s30.html) of the [Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/doppa1986343/).
Otherwise, I concur with the reasons given and the proposed orders.
