EQUITY DIVISION  
Lloyd AJ  
Tuesday, 17 October 2006  /06 COAST REO PTY LIMITED versus ROBERT O'BRIEN & (2) ORS  
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Coast Reo Pty Limited, is in the business of selling plaster board and other products for the building industry. The first defendant, Mr Robert O'Brien, is the sole director and company secretary of
Allcoast Linings Pty Limited. The second defendant is Mrs Joanne Therese
O'Brien, the defendant's wife, and the third defendant is Mr Ricki Craig
O'Brien, the defendant's brother. The second and third defendants are both shareholders in Allcoast Linings Pty Ltd ("Allcoast"). Allcoast is in the plastering business and purchases building materials from the plaintiff.  On or about 10 August 2003 Mr O'Brien signed a document called a "Commercial Credit Facility Application and Supply Agreement" made between the plaintiff and Allcoast. There is some dispute as to the circumstances in which the agreement was signed but I do not have to decide that dispute; what is important is that the agreement was signed and the parties are governed by its terms.  The plaintiff contends that the agreement enables it to charge any property of the first defendant with the obligations under that agreement including the lodging of caveats in respect of the interest thereby conferred.  The plaintiff has lodged two caveats on real estate owned by the defendant and now seeks to enforce the charge. Since the real estate in question is owned by the second and third defendants as well as the first defendant the plaintiff seeks the appointment of trustees for sale of the properties pursuant to [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).  The questions for determination are (i) whether in signing the agreement Mr
O'Brien did so only on behalf of Allcoast so that he did not become personally bound; and (ii) what is the proper construction of the agreement and, in particular, clause (o) thereof.  The agreement is, as I have said, entitled "Commercial Credit Facility
Application and Supply Agreement". The parties agree that the buyer described in the agreement is Allcoast Linings Pty Limited. The agreement is set out on a document which contains three A4 size pages in one continuing sheet and printed on both sides. It is fair to say, as Mr M W Young who appears for the defendant points out, that the application form is in two parts: the first part relates to the trading terms and credit facility, and the second part on the reverse side of the form is a guarantee and indemnity provision.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s1.html) of the document is headed "Details of Account Customer" and then there is space for ticks to be applied under three kinds of entity - "Company or Corporation", "Partnership" and "Sole Trader". The tick in the present case is placed alongside "Company or Corporation".  Section 2 is headed "If a Company or Corporation". Under that heading the details of that company or corporation are set out. Here the name of Allcoast
Linings Pty Ltd is stated and the date of incorporation of the company is stated as being May 2003.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s3.html) of the document is headed "If a Partnership or Sole Trader" and that section is left blank.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s4.html) is headed "Particulars of all parties to this Facility are required below. Full
Names of Addresses of Directors/Partners/Sole Traders". Under that heading is set out the full name of the first defendant, Robert Ian O'Brien. Alongside that name is a question "Do you own your own home? Y/N" and then "N" is circled. Mr O'Brien's private address is stated as "10 Dover Road,
Wamberal".  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s5.html) is headed "Operational Details" and that section has not been completed.
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s6.html) is headed "Trade References" and that section is also left blank.  On the following page of the application form are set out what are said to be "Trading Terms & Conditions of the Credit Facility". Those trading terms and conditions are set out in a number of sub-paragraphs marked from (a) to (o). Of particular relevance in the present case is sub-par (o), which is as follows:  
The Company and/or individual person(s) referred to in Section (2), (3) and/or of this application hereby Charge all their Right, Title, Interest (if any) in the property or properties referred to in Section (2), (3) and (4) of this application and also any property or properties that they own currently or may acquire in the future solely or jointly or have or become to have a beneficial interest in, in favour of "COAST REO & MIDCOAST", with the due and punctual observance and performance of all of the obligations of the
Buyer. Such person(s) acknowledge that "COAST REO & MIDCOAST", may at its discretion register and lodge a Caveat(s) on such property or properties in respect of the interests conferred on it under this clause. Such registration of a Caveat by "COAST REO & MIDCOAST" over the Customer(s) property(ies) shall not be challenged by the Buyer in any way whatsoever, and the Buyer agrees not to take any steps in filing a "Lapsing Notice" via the Land Titles
Office to have the Caveat removed, until such time the Buyer has paid all monies owing by it to "COAST REO & MIDCOAST" as claimed from time to time.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s7.html) is headed "Name of Person Authorised to Sign". Under that section the words "Robert Ian O'Brien" appear together with his signature and a contact telephone number.  There is then a heading "Authority under [Privacy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/pa1988108/) (As amended)" which concludes with the following printed statement:  
This is to certify that I/We have read, comprehended and accept the above- mentioned terms and conditions and further without undue influence or unfair pressure append my/our signature(s) hereunto. I/We further acknowledge having received, read and understood this application and further the Conditions of
Sale in respect to this Application for Credit."  Finally, in this part of the document there is space for what is said to be the "Buyer's Signature" and there appears the signature of Mr O'Brien alongside of which he lists his title as "Director".  The reverse of the document is the guarantee and indemnity provision which contains a number of sub-paragraphs but that part of the application form has not been completed or signed.  Mr M W Young, appearing for the defendant, submits that Mr O'Brien in signing the document was not intended to be personally bound and he is not a party to the agreement. As Mr Young points out, the document is in two parts and the second part, being the guarantee and indemnity section, has not been completed. According to the submission, if it were intended to personally bind
Mr O'Brien then that section of the document would have been completed.  I must say that there is some force in this submission, but notwithstanding the force of the submission it remains to determine precisely what it is that the first part of the document contains and whether or not that part itself binds Mr O'Brien in his personal capacity.  It is fair to say that the document has been somewhat poorly drafted and there are a number of inconsistencies throughout it. The references in it to "the Buyer" and to "the Customer" seem to be interchangeable but the agreement can nevertheless be construed on its face and according to its terms.  As I have noted, the heading to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/pa1988108/s4.html) of the agreement is "Particulars of all parties to this Facility are required below" and here the name of Mr O'Brien is inserted. He is thus clearly identified as a party to the agreement. It seems to be the intention that any individual person or persons whose names are identified in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/pa1988108/s4.html) would be parties to the agreement, otherwise there would be no point in identifying such persons.  In turning to the crucial clause, namely sub-par (o), it is important to bear in mind, I think, the opening words of that sub-paragraph, namely "The
Company and/or individual person(s) referred to in Section (2), (3) and (4) of the application hereby Charge all their Right, Title, Interest ...". The words "and/or individual person(s) referred to in Section (2), (3) and (4)" suggest it is not only the company but also the individual persons mentioned in those sections who agree to charge their right, title and interest etc in any property or properties that they own.  This is an inescapable conclusion drawn from a plain reading of those opening words. That, in my opinion, is sufficient to conclude the matter in favour of the plaintiff. The words which follow in sub-par (o) do not, in my view, cut down or limit the opening words. Despite the submissions of Mr Young to the contrary, I am forced to the inescapable conclusion that it is not only the company but also the individual person or persons referred to in those sections who agree to the giving of a charge on any property in favour of the plaintiff. In the present case only one such person is identified and that is
Mr O'Brien.  This conclusion means that the plaintiff must succeed and the application for the appointment of trustees for sale must be granted.  The two trustees nominated are liquidators. As Mr Young has pointed out, they are not the usual kind of persons who are appointed trustees for sale under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). The fact that they are liquidators, however, does not disqualify them from being appointed as trustees for sale. It is true that ordinarily the trustees for sale appointed under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) are a solicitor and a real estate agent, but liquidators are accustomed to doing such things in other contexts. I see no objection to their appointment.  The parties have informed me that there is no dispute as to the amount owing to the plaintiff by the defendant.  Accordingly, I grant the relief sought by the plaintiff and I make the formal orders as set out in pars 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the amended summons dated 6 July 2006. In relation to par 6 of the summons, in addition to
Scott Darren Biscoe I add the name of Alan Hayes. In par 3 I include the agreed sum of $330,125.95. At Mr Young's request these orders are stayed for days. The exhibits may also be returned after 28 days if no appeal is filed.  
I hereby certify that the preceding 26 paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the Honourable Mr Justice D H Lloyd.
