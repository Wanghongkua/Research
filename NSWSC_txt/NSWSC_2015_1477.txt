JUDGMENT
This is an application under [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth) in relation to property more particularly identified in schedules 1 and 2 of the summons. The application is supported by an affidavit of Glyn Evan Roberts sworn 8 October 2015.
[Section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the Act requires a court with proceeds jurisdiction to make a restraining order under the section if a Proceeds of Crime Authority applies for the order, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or an instrument of a serious offence, the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence or the property is an instrument of the offence and the Court is satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.
The application has been made by a Proceeds of Crime Authority. I have read the affidavit of Mr Roberts and I am satisfied that the suspicions that he more particularly refers to in paragraph 9 of his affidavit are held on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that the offences identified in that affidavit may have been committed.
The Applicant has asked the Court pursuant to [s 26(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s26.html) of the Act to consider the application without notice being given to the person named in Mr Robert's affidavit as being in possession of property. The Court is required to consider the application without notice when requested to do so by the responsible authority.
I note the undertaking of Mr Akbar on behalf of the Commonwealth and on that basis I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 9 of the short minutes of order. I stand the proceedings over before the Common Law Registrar on 24 February 2016 at 9:00am. Liberty to restore on three days' notice. These orders are to be entered forthwith.
