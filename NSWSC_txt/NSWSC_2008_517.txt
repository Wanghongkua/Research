JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
BARRETT J  
MONDAY 26 MAY 2008  /07 - WEBFORGE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD versus TECNISKILL CO-OPERATION LTD  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff makes application for leave under [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s471b.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) to enable it to continue an appeal against a decision of the Local Court.
 In the Local Court, the present defendant was successful, as cross-claimant, in obtaining a judgment for more than $30,000 upon the cross-claim.
 From the perspective of the defendant, as a company in liquidation, that $30,000 or so represents an asset available to creditors in the winding up, assuming that the judgment stands.
 The defendant became the subject of a winding up order made by the Supreme
Court of South Australia. That order was made on 22 January 2008.
 The fact that the winding up order was made by another court having jurisdiction over the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) does not mean that this court, which also has jurisdiction, cannot or should not deal with an application such as the present arising in the course of the winding up. I refer, in that respect, to the decision of Austin J in Sihota versus Pacific
Sands Motel <case>; [(2003) 56 NSWLR 721] (see also Maamari versus Ringwood & Ply Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2005) 187 FLR 477).] Another preliminary question is whether an appeal is within the purview of [s
B.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s471b.html)
It is sufficient to say on that that the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Skinner versus Jeogla Pty Ltd <case>; <case>
I should proceed on that basis.
 As to the merits, the position is, as I have said, that the question on appeal is, in essence, whether an asset will be available in the winding up.
There is no other vehicle for that proposition to be tested and, while that of itself is not determinative of an application such as this, it is a highly relevant factor.
 Another highly relevant matter is the attitude of the liquidator. In this case the liquidator has informed the plaintiff in writing that he neither consents to nor opposes the present application. I may therefore proceed on the basis that the liquidator has no view adverse to the grant of leave. In particular, it is not suggested that the attention of the liquidator will be diverted from more important matters.
 In the whole of the circumstances, it is appropriate that the discretion of the court be exercised in favour of the plaintiff. I therefore make order 1 and order 2 in the notice of motion filed on 12 May 2008.
