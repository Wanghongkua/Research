NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION versus AHLAM BARGHACHOUN /95 March 1998 
Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the plaintiff under paragraph (7) of a further amended summons filed in this court on 10 December 1996 for an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s.22 of what is now the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). 
The following material was before me: an affidavit of Clinton Porters sworn 24
March 1998 - P1; a file containing the plaintiff's submissions and relevant supporting affidavit material - P2; a certificate of conviction relating to the defendant - P3; an affidavit of Michael Charles Luland sworn 23 March 1998 - P4; an affidavit of Giuseppe Mammone sworn 12 February 1998.

The defendant was not present at the hearing of this matter and indeed has filed no evidence in opposition to any of the matters raised in the plaintiff's affidavits. As far as today is concerned, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied on the affidavit of Clinton Porters that sufficient service of today's proceedings was effected. I also note that the defendant, should she be so advised or wish, is able to take advantage of the provisions of [s.25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) of the Act in relation to any orders made today.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the Act sets out the procedures for the making of restraining orders in respect of interests in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity. It is essential for such a restraining order to be in force before an assets forfeiture order can be made under [s.22.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html)
I am satisfied by reason of the affidavit of Michael Charles Luland (P4) that such a restraining order is still in force.

The legislation has recently undergone substantial amendment by reason of the
Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Amendment Act 1997 which inter alia changed the former Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990 to the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) and the savings and transitional provisions therein results in the provisions of the new Act applying to proceedings commenced and orders made before 25 July 1997: see Schedule 1 Part 1.

On 14 September 1995, this court made the restraining order in these proceedings and on the same day an amended summons seeking an assets forfeiture order was filed in court. On 15 September 1995, a sealed copy of the restraining order and court stamped copies of the summons and the amended summons were personally served on the defendant. On 13 January 1997, a sealed copy of the varied restraining order and a further amended summons were personally served on the defendant.

I am satisfied that the conviction identified in the certificate of conviction constitutes a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity within [s.22(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). Bearing in mind the definition of "admixture" contained in [s.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s4.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), the evidence of Nicholas Clifford Bingham, William Shane Griffith and Hao Ngoc Thi
Dinh is clear evidence that the defendant had in her possession on 7 September a quantity of heroin of 5.15 grams.

Having so found, it follows that by reason of the terms of [s.22(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), I am obliged to make an assets forfeiture order. I therefore make the following orders:-
Pursuant to [s.22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), the interests of Ahlam Barghachoun in the property described in the Schedule attached to the short minutes of order which I initial and date and place with the file, be forfeited to, and vest in, the Crown.
Pursuant to [s.23(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s23.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/):- that the plaintiff or the Public Trustee, or both ("the prosecutor") have leave to serve notices in writing upon Ahlam Barghachoun requiring Ahlam
Barghachoun to do any act, deed or thing specified therein which, in the sole opinion of the prosecutor, is necessary to enable the prosecutor to prosecute the claim described in paragraph (d) of the Schedule attached to the short minutes of order.
 that no later than five days after service upon Ahlam Barghachoun of any notice of the kind described in the preceding sub-paragraph, Ahlam Barghachoun do the act, deed or thing so specified.
That Ahlam Barghachoun pay the plaintiff's costs of this application to be assessed if not agreed.
