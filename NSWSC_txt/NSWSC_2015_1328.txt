JUDGMENT
On 31 July 2015 I dismissed the plaintiff's application for judicial review of an assessment made under [s 94](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s94.html) of the [Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) of the amount of damages payable to the first defendant arising out of his motor vehicle accident on 14 May 2011 (Insurance Australia Ltd versus O'Shannessy <case> The plaintiff is the insurer of the vehicle that injured the first defendant.
At the time I dismissed the proceedings I ordered the plaintiff to pay the first defendant's costs. However in doing so I drew the parties attention to Uniform Civil Procedure Rule 36.16(3A) which enables a party to apply by notice of motion to set aside an order within 14 days of it being entered. Pursuant to this rule, on or about 12 August 2015 the first defendant filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the plaintiff pay its costs of the proceedings up to 29 April 2015 on the ordinary basis and thereafter on an indemnity basis. I ordered that the parties file brief written submissions. They requested the Court deal with the matter without a further hearing.
The basis for the application was that on 29 April 2015 a "Calderbank" letter (Calderbank versus Calderbank <case> to [15]).
The plaintiff contended that the offer that was made did not represent a "genuine" offer but instead amounted to an "invitation to surrender" (Regency Media Pty Ltd versus AAV Australia Pty Limited <case> at <case>). While in some cases an offer that involves the plaintiff discontinuing does not represent a genuine compromise that is not necessarily the case (Leichardt Municipal Council versus Green <case> at <case> per Santow JA). These are judicial review proceedings and, as such, there were only two possible outcomes being either the dismissal of the proceedings or the making of an order setting aside the assessment and requiring that it be re-determined according to law. In such a case it is difficult to see how offering one of the two possible outcomes can result in a characterisation of the offer as not being genuine. I consider that it was a genuine offer.
However was the plaintiff's refusal to accept the offer unreasonable? One matter affecting that assessment is the time allowed for the acceptance of the offer (Perisher at [16] per Gleeson JA). In this case that is of little moment. The almost instantaneous reaction of the plaintiff to the offer reveals that it considered that it had sufficient time to consider the prospects of success of its own case.
Nevertheless, at the time the offer was received the first defendant was unlikely to have incurred any significant costs. From the plaintiff's perspective it was seeking to challenge a large judgment entered against it and had substantial grounds upon which to do so (even if they were ultimately unsuccessful). Thus the plaintiff was confronted with an offer that, if accepted, involved the avoidance of a relatively small exposure to a potential liability and the foregoing of substantial grounds to challenge a substantial judgment. The onus of persuasion that it was unreasonable to accept the offer rests upon the first defendant (Lee versus Carlton Crest Hotel (Sydney) Pty Ltd (No 2) <case> at <case>). I am not satisfied that it has discharged it.
Accordingly the Court orders that: 
The first defendant's notice of motion filed 12 August 2015 be dismissed; and 
The first defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the notice of motion.
