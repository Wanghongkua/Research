JUDGMENT
This is an application for approval of a settlement pursuant to [s 75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s75.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) . The Plaintiff is a minor who applies, by his tutor, for the settlement which was effected before proceedings were commenced. [Section 75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s75.html) (2) is therefore relevant. The claim the Plaintiff makes is for physical and mental harm he suffered whilst in foster care from the time he was aged about three years until the present. He was born on 3 November 1999 and is currently aged 17 years.
The nature of the abuse alleged is set out in a draft statement of claim annexed to an affidavit of the Plaintiff's solicitor sworn 15 June 2017. It is not necessary for the purpose of this judgment to recite any of the matters contained in that statement of claim. It is sufficient to know that the allegations of abuse are very serious and the contemporaneous and subsequent medical evidence bears out the mental harm that the Plaintiff has suffered as a result of this alleged abuse.
I have been very considerably assisted by two reports from Dr Robert Hampshire, the psychiatrist, dated 3 December 2015 and 17 February 2017. The encouraging matter and perhaps the most encouraging matter in the material I have is the extent of the improvement that Dr Hampshire noted in the Plaintiff's condition between the time he saw him in November 2015 and some 14 months later in February 2017. Nevertheless the evidence discloses that the Plaintiff suffered considerably and still has a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. However, Dr Hampshire is much more optimistic about the future as a result of the improvements he saw in February 2017. Dr Hampshire attributes a great deal of that improvement to the carers that the Plaintiff has been residing with since November 2015, in contradistinction to those with whom he had been residing in his earlier years.
The parties settled the proceedings at a mediation for an amount of $625,000 clear of costs and of all other matters except a Medicare charge of $3,200 and a repayment to Victims Services of $20,000. The result is that if the settlement is approved the Plaintiff will be entitled to receive a little over $600,000.
I am satisfied from reading all of the material and from an advice from the Plaintiff's counsel, including a schedule of damages which was prepared, that in all the circumstances the settlement is an appropriate one.
The Plaintiff's tutor has requested that in lieu of the verdict being paid out to the NSW Trustee and Guardian it ought either be kept in court or paid out to the Plaintiff's solicitors for investment until he turns 18. He turns 18 in November 2017. In my opinion the most appropriate course is that the matter ought to be paid to the Plaintiff's solicitors to be held on trust for him and invested in the best possible manner for the Plaintiff until he turns 18 and gives instructions in relation thereto. I note an undertaking from the Plaintiff's solicitor in relation to any funds which are directed to be paid out to the Plaintiff's firm, Carroll & O'Dea, dated 19 June 2017.
I make orders in terms of paras 1 to 6 and 8 of the consent order. I note paras 9 to 15.
