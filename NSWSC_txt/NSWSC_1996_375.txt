REGINA versus KEVIN NEIL WILLIAMS REGINA versus PETER JAMES WILLIAMS /96 60288/96 
TUESDAY 27 AUGUST 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
PRIESTLEY AP, JAMES J, BARR J 
JUDGMENT 
JAMES J: Peter James Williams and Kevin Neil Williams, who is Peter James Williams' son, have applied for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on them by Judge Grogan in the District Court, after a jury had found them both guilty of one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on 2 September 1994 on a man named Lawrence Crooks. The jury found the applicant Peter Williams not guilty on a charge brought against him alone of assaulting Mr Crooks' wife occasioning her actual bodily harm.

The trial of the applicants had commenced on 11 March 1996 and had concluded on 21 March 1996, when the jury returned their verdicts of guilty. The proceedings on sentence were stood over to 3 May 1996 to enable a pre-sentence report to be prepared in the case of Peter Williams and a report from the
Office of Juvenile Justice in the case of Kevin Williams. Peter Williams was remanded in custody but Kevin Williams was remanded on conditional bail.

On 3 May 1996 the taking of evidence and the making of submissions in the proceedings on sentence were concluded and the proceedings were then further stood over to 17 May 1996.

On 17 May 1996 his Honour delivered lengthy remarks on sentence and formally passed sentence. His Honour sentenced both applicants to sentences of penal servitude for sixteen months, the sentence passed on Peter Williams consisting of a minimum term of ten months commencing on 21 March 1996, the date on which he had gone into custody, and an additional term of six months; the sentence passed on Kevin Williams consisting of a minimum term of eight months commencing on 17 May 1996, the date of the sentence, and an additional term of eight months.

An important fact in the sentencing and on the hearing of these applications is that Kevin Williams was born on 18 November 1976 and was accordingly under the age of eighteen years at the time his offence was committed and consequently a child for the purposes of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/), which I will refer to as "the Act". At the time he was sentenced Kevin
Williams was still under the age of twenty-one years and his Honour made an order pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s19.html) of the Act that the minimum term of the sentence passed on him be served in a detention centre.

It will be noted that his Honour found there were special circumstances within [section 5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/) in the case of both applicants.

At the trial both the applicants gave sworn evidence in which they strenuously contested the version of events given by the Crown witnesses. However, they were both found guilty on the first count in the indictment and, having regard to the jury's verdicts and the evidence of the Crown witnesses, his Honour was clearly entitled to make the findings of the facts of the offences which he set out in his remarks on sentence.

His Honour found that the two applicants lived next door to the victim and his wife. Kevin Williams had formed a relationship with Mr Crooks' daughter, of which Mr Crooks strongly disapproved.

On 15 August 1994, just two and a half weeks before the offences were committed, Mr Crooks had obtained an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order in the Childrens Court against Kevin Williams which, inter alia, required Kevin
Williams "not to assault, intimidate, threaten, molest, harass or otherwise interfere with" Mr Crooks. Kevin Williams did not oppose the making of this order.

On 30 August 1994 Peter Williams's father, that is Kevin Williams's grandfather, had died and on 2 September 1994, the date of the offences, his body had been cremated. After the cremation Peter Williams attended a wake at a hotel near his home.

At about 11.30 on the night of 2 September 1994 
Mr Crooks and his wife were returning to their home by car. The applicants were walking home from the hotel where the wake had been held, Kevin Williams having gone to the hotel to pick up his father, who his Honour found was "moderately affected" by alcohol.

After seeing the victim's car, Kevin Williams yelled, "There's that fucking
Lawrie. We're going to get him." The victim drove his car into the driveway of his own home, he got out of his car and approached the applicants, coming out on to the footpath just outside his property. He said, "Peter, we've got an order out on him. Shut him up or we'll ring the police." Kevin Williams then hit the victim, punching him on the forehead with his fist. Peter Williams then hit the victim. The victim was knocked to the ground and while he was moving back towards his house, he was punched by both applicants. The victim finished up lying on the ground near the porch of his house. The police were called and the victim was taken to hospital.

The victim was found to be suffering from a fractured, severely depressed, right cheek bone, his face was bruised and swollen and he had cuts on his face, arms and chest.

On 5 September 1994 an operation was performed on the victim to insert a plate and screws to stabilise the fractured cheek bone. The operation was performed because the depressed cheek bone was a cosmetic deformity and also because it could affect the victim's vision and his ability to move his jaw. When the doctor who performed the operation gave evidence at the trial he said that the victim was still complaining of some residual numbness in the area of the cheek bone. The doctor said this feeling of numbness was quite usual and in most cases would resolve within eighteen months.

The sentencing judge found that the two applicants had acted in concert and were equally culpable for the injuries received by Mr Crooks. His Honour found that there were circumstances of aggravation, namely: the victim suffered serious injuries; the offences had been principally committed in the front yard of the victim's home and in the presence of the victim's wife and children, except for occasions when they went inside the house for the purpose of calling police; the two offenders had attacked a lone victim; so far as Kevin Williams was concerned, his conduct was in breach of the recent Apprehended Domestic Violence Order.

The applicant Peter Williams was born in 1951 and was accordingly forty-four years of age at the time of the offences. He had a fairly minor criminal history but it did include two convictions for assault, one in 1979 when he was placed on a recognizance, and one in 1989 when he was fined $500. He had not previously been sentenced to any term of imprisonment. He had a fairly good employment history. He had been married for twenty-five years and had three sons, of whom Kevin Williams was the youngest. His wife was in poor health and was more than usually reliant on her husband. After 2 September Peter Williams had moved house because of the incident. The sentencing judge was not satisfied there was "any high degree of contrition" on the part of Peter Williams. With some hesitation the sentencing judge decided there were special circumstances within [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/) in the case of Peter Williams.

Peter Williams appeared for himself on this application for leave to appeal.
In a letter written to the Registrar of this Court he said he had never been in gaol before, he had suffered extracurial punishment because he had had to move house and had had to close a workshop near where he had been living and his wife was finding it hard to cope without him.

Mr Game, who appeared for Kevin Williams, was permitted to put further submissions to the court on behalf of Peter Williams. He submitted that Peter
Williams had been looking after his mother, he was conscious that he should have restrained his son, that he was contrite, that there had been a history of discord between the two families and that Peter Williams had never previously been in gaol.

I am, however, satisfied that the sentencing judge took all these matters into account. No specific error of fact or principle has been made out and I consider that the sentence imposed on Peter Williams was within a sound exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. In company with his son, Peter Williams had attacked the victim just outside and inside the victim's property, inflicting serious injuries upon the victim. I would propose that although leave to appeal be granted, Peter Williams' appeal against sentence be dismissed.

As I have already indicated, Kevin Williams was seventeen years of age and within three months of his eighteenth birthday at the time he committed the offence. He had no prior criminal convictions, although he was of course subject to the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order in favour of the victim. He left school in 1990 when he was in Year 9.

As at 1 May 1996 when the report of the Office of Juvenile Justice was prepared, he had been working for four weeks on a part time basis, although he was hoping to obtain full time employment. At some time after the incident, he and Mr Crooks' daughter had lived together, separately from Kevin Williams' parents, but in late 1995 he and Mr Crooks' daughter had moved to the Central
Coast to live with his parents.

His Honour had before him a number of references for Kevin Williams and his grandmother gave evidence favourable to him in the proceedings on sentence.

The sentencing judge clearly appreciated that the provisions of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) applied to
Kevin Williams. Pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s18.html) of that Act, his Honour decided that Kevin Williams should be dealt with according to law rather than in accordance with Division 4 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/index.html#p3) of the Act. In making this decision his Honour took into account the seriousness of the offence and the age of the offender, that is, that at the time of the commission of the offence he was only a few weeks short of his eighteenth birthday, and that he was nineteen and a half at the time of being sentenced. At the hearing of this application for leave to appeal no challenge was made to this decision by his Honour.

Pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s19.html) of the Act, his Honour made an order that the whole of the minimum term of Kevin
Williams' sentence be served in a detention centre, rather than a prison.

His Honour observed in sentencing Kevin Williams that general deterrence could properly be regarded as less important but should not be ignored completely.

As I have already noted, his Honour considered that Kevin Williams had acted in concert with his father and was equally culpable for the injuries sustained by the victim, that Kevin Williams's offence had the same circumstances of aggravation as his father's and the additional serious circumstance of aggravation that his conduct was in breach of the Apprehended Domestic
Violence Order which had been made such a short time previously.

Two principal submissions were made by Mr Game on behalf of Kevin Williams.
The first submission was that although his Honour had appreciated that the [Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) applied, his Honour had failed to apply [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) of that Act and that an application of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) could have led to a different result. The second submission was that his Honour had erroneously supposed that the principle of parity of sentencing applied as between Kevin Williams and his father, whereas the principle does not apply where one offender is a child and the other offender is an adult, and furthermore there were important differences between the cases of Kevin
Williams and his father.

I do not consider that his Honour fell into either of those errors. As I have already indicated, his Honour was clearly aware that the Act applied to the sentencing of Kevin Williams and I am satisfied, having read his Honour's remarks on sentence, that his Honour was aware of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) and its application to the sentencing of Kevin Williams.

On page 21 of his Honour's remarks on sentence his Honour set out an extract from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R versus Gordon [(1994) 71 A Crim R ] in which [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) and its application to an offender under the age of eighteen years is expressly referred to.

On page 20 of his Honour's remarks on sentence his Honour referred to R v
GDP [(1991) 53 A Crim R 112], a leading authority on the Act and in particular [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) 
In R versus GDP the leading judgment was given by Mathews J, with whom Gleeson
CJ and Samuels JA agreed, and [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) of the Act is set out in her Honour's judgment. In the present case the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence contain a number of statements derived from the judgment of Mathews J in R versus GDP or from cases cited by Mathews J in R versus GDP, including the statement that "in cases of youthful offenders punishment and general deterrence may properly be regarded as less important than individualised treatment aimed at rehabilitation" and "considerations of general deterrence should not be ignored completely when sentencing young offenders." 
It was submitted that his Honour should have applied paragraphs (b), (c) and of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) which are in the following terms: "that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance assistance; that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption; that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home;" 
With regard to [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s6.html) of the Act Mathews J observed in R versus GDP: "Some of these guidelines consist of sentiments and admonitions which are so general as to be of little assistance in the sentencing of young offenders," although some of the paragraphs may be capable of having more practical effect.

In the present case it was suggested that paragraph (b) was important because
Kevin Williams had committed his offence under the "leadership" of his father.
However, there was no finding to this effect by his Honour and indeed his
Honour's findings were to the contrary.

As regards paragraph (c), it was submitted that his Honour should have allowed the employment of the applicant to proceed without interruption. I am not satisfied that his Honour did not take this factor into account. The applicant's employment is referred to in the report of the Office of Juvenile
Justice, which his Honour said in his remarks on sentence "contains considerable matter of assistance." In any event, the employment the applicant had was part-time employment which he had had for four weeks.

It was submitted in relation to paragraph (d) that his Honour should have had regard to the desirability of allowing the applicant to reside in his own home. I am not satisfied that his Honour failed to take this matter into account. The importance of this factor was diminished by the circumstances that the applicant's parents had moved house since the offence was committed, that the applicant had for a period lived away from his parents with his girlfriend and that his Honour had concluded that the applicant's father had to be sentenced to a full-time custodial sentence and hence would not be living at home.

Nor do I consider that his Honour erroneously considered that the principle of parity of sentencing applied as between Kevin Williams and his father. It is true that in his remarks on sentence his Honour said that "the question arises as to parity." However, his Honour noted the submission by counsel for Kevin
Williams that "parity does not arise" and his Honour concluded that it was appropriate for him to adopt counsel's submissions that he should not treat the offenders the same.

It was submitted by counsel for Kevin Williams that the two cases could not properly be compared and that, if any comparison were to be made, Peter
Williams' case should be regarded as the worse, because he was an adult, he was Kevin Williams's father and should have restrained him and he had a criminal history including two prior convictions for assault. There is some force in these submissions. However, the further submission that Peter
Williams was the principal assailant is not supported by his Honour's findings.

On the findings made by his Honour the offence committed by Kevin Williams was a serious offence. He yelled out that he and his father should "get" the victim and he threw the first punch. He was found to be equally responsible for the injuries suffered by the victim. His conduct was in breach of the
Apprehended Domestic Violence Order made some three weeks before. His Honour was entitled to have some regard to the facts that the applicant was very close to the age of eighteen at the time the offence was committed and was aged nineteen and a half at the time of being sentenced and that his conduct in the commission of the offence and indeed in the circumstances leading up to the commission of the offence could fairly be described as the way in which an adult might conduct himself. His Honour implicitly found that Kevin Williams felt no remorse. In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to an answer given by Kevin Williams to an investigating police officer that "he (that is the victim) wants to get me locked up on the order. He had a go and I give him what he wanted." 
I would propose that while leave to appeal against sentence be granted to
Kevin Williams, his appeal against sentence should also be dismissed.

PRIESTLEY AP: I agree with what James J has said in each case. I agree with the orders he proposes.

BARR J: I also agree.

PRIESTLEY AP: The orders of the court are in each case application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.
