Obligation to pay interest not penal  
JUDGMENT 
INTRODUCTION
By formal notations and orders made by the Court (constituted by Pembroke J) on 23 October 2013, the parties to these proceedings settled a family dispute about beneficial entitlements to a number of parcels of land.
The dispute the subject of the settlement was primarily, in substance, between the first plaintiff and the first defendant. The first plaintiff is the sister in law of the first defendant, the widow of the first defendant's brother. All other parties to the proceedings (a second plaintiff, and a second and third defendant) are corporations.
The parties have largely carried their settlement agreement into effect, although the path towards performance of it was never smooth. Each side of the record filed a motion seeking orders for enforcement of the settlement. A judgment debt has been wholly satisfied, but for a contested claim for interest on the judgment.
The plaintiffs' notice of motion is dated 25 March 2014. It was filed on or about that date, but it was marked as having been formally filed only on 29 April 2014. Nothing turns on the discrepancy of dates.
The defendants' notice of motion (also dated 25 March 2014) was filed on 28 March 2014, and amended on 6 June 2014 and 21 August 2014.
The parties are agreed that, as events have unfolded, both motions have been spent (so that no orders are required dealing with competing claims for relief), but for: * (a) the plaintiffs' application (by paragraph 9 of their notice of motion) for an order that the defendants pay the costs of the motion; and * (b) the defendants' application (by paragraphs 8 and 9 of their motion) for: (i) an order that the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs; and (ii) an order that no interest be payable on a judgment debt arising from the orders made on 23 October 2013.

THE OBLIGATION TO PAY INTEREST ON A JUDGMENT DEBT
The first plaintiff claims an award of approximately $75,000 for interest said to have accrued between 23 October 2013 and 7 May 2014.
That interest is said to have accrued on the judgment debt by operation of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) NSW ("CPA"), [section 101(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html)
CPA [s 101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) provides that, "[unless] the Court orders otherwise, interest is payable on so much of the amount of a judgment (exclusive of any order for costs) as is from time to time unpaid."
The defendants apply, under or by reference to CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html), for an order "otherwise".
CPA [s 101(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) provides that [section 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) "does not authorise the giving of interest on any interest payable under this section". Given her reliance on [section 101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) for her claim of interest, the first plaintiff claims no "interest on interest" referable to the time that has elapsed since 7 May 2014.
In summary, the orders made by the Court on 23 October 2013 were to the following effect (with emphasis added): * (a) Order 1 embodied a declaration that the first defendant (the registered proprietor of a Strathfield property (the then residence of the first plaintiff) held the property on trust for the first plaintiff.
* (b) Order 2 ordered that there be judgment for the first plaintiff against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of $1.8 million.
* (c) Order 3 ordered that the defendants jointly and severally pay the plaintiffs' costs of the principal proceedings.
* (d) Order 4 took the form of a reservation of liberty to apply, including liberty "to bring an application for the appointment of a provisional liquidator of the second and third defendants upon non-compliance with the agreement hereunder, and/or an application to enforce the charge in the agreement hereunder." * (e) Orders 5 and 6 provided for the defendants to transfer a motor vehicle and mini motorcycle to the first plaintiff.
The Court also noted an agreement of the parties (made "in consideration of the settlement of" the proceedings), the terms of which agreement were contained in paragraphs numbered consecutively from and including "paragraph 7".
In summary, those terms were to the following effect (with emphasis added): * (a) paragraph 7 provided that "[subject] to the defendants' compliance with the terms of the Orders and this Agreement, the judgment in [order 2] will not be enforced, before 23 April 2014, and nor will the first plaintiff be entitled to interest on the judgment in respect of the period during which the judgment is not to be enforced." * (b) paragraph 8 provided that the defendants would, pending payment of the judgment sum recorded in order 2, pay all interest and charges in respect of all mortgages and loans and other liabilities secured against the first plaintiff's residence (excluding council rates, water rates and any land tax, if applicable) and they would not further encumber the residence, nor draw down or borrow further moneys, under any facility secured against the residence, nor do or omit to do anything which would have the consequence of the total amount of debt secured against the residence being increased.
* (c) paragraph 9 provided that the first defendant would grant to the first plaintiff a limited power of attorney for the purpose of selling the residence and all dealings with the mortgages of the residence for the purpose of or incidental to sale of the residence.
* (d) paragraph 10 provided for the first plaintiff to do all things and take all reasonable steps to procure the sale of the residence on or before 23 April 2014 (with a listing of the residence for sale by 1 February 2014).
* (e) paragraph 11 provided that the first plaintiff was entitled to keep for her own benefit the entire net proceeds of the sale of the residence.
* (f) paragraph 12 provided that the first defendant would not revoke his power of attorney or do anything to jeopardise or interfere with the sale of the residence by the first plaintiff.
* (g) paragraph 13 provided that, on or before 23 April 2014, the first defendant would: (i) if the residence had not been sold, procure the discharge of all mortgages and other encumbrances secured against the residence; and (ii) if the residence had been sold, pay to the first plaintiff (or directly to the holders of any mortgage or other security on completion) the amount that was required to be paid to the first mortgagee or other security holders to discharge their mortgage and/or other security on completion.
* (h) paragraph 14 provided that all payments made to discharge two identified mortgages in compliance with paragraph 13, not being payments of interest and charges that were required to be paid pursuant to paragraph 8, "shall be payments in reduction of the Judgment Sum".
* (i) paragraph 15 provided that any remaining amount of the Judgment that was payable after clause 13 had been complied with in full "shall be paid to the first plaintiff and the amount of the costs to which the plaintiffs are entitled under [Order 3] shall be reduced by that amount." * (j) paragraph 16 provided for five nominated properties (other than the first plaintiff's residence) to be charged with the liability of the defendants for the Judgment Sum.
* (k) paragraph 17 provided that the defendants agreed to pay the costs of and associated with the lodgment of caveats over those properties.
* (l) paragraph 18 provided that "[the] intention of the parties by the terms of this agreement and orders includes an intention that: [i] the residence is to be sold; [ii] the first plaintiff is to receive for her own benefit the value of the net sale proceeds of the residence as if it were unencumbered; [iii] in addition the plaintiffs are to be paid the amount of their costs." * (m) paragraphs 19-24 contained incidental provisions, including a mutual release of rights.
The dispute between the parties about the payment of interest focuses upon the defendants' contentions that: * (a) any obligation on their part to pay interest under CPA [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) (read with order 2 and the terms noted in the agreement, particularly those recorded in paragraphs 7, 13-15 and 18) constitutes a penalty (under the law analysed in Andrews versus ANZ Banking Group Limited <case>; [(2012) 247 CLR 205], especially at 216[10]); and/or * (b) an order should, in justice, be made under or by reference to [section 101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) relieving the defendants of any obligation to pay interest, because the judgment debt for which order 2 provided was, on a proper construction of the parties' agreement for compromise, intended as no more than security for performance of the obligation of the defendants to effect a timely discharge of mortgages over the first plaintiff's residence.
Pointing to the statement of intention recorded in paragraph 18 of the formal agreement, and noting that the defendants discharged all mortgages on the residence on 7 May 2013 (approximately a fortnight later than they were required to do on or before 23 April 2014), and that they had paid all interest payable on the mortgages in the meantime, the defendants contend that any obligation to pay the interest claimed by the first plaintiff (for the period between 23 October 2013 and 7 May 2014) must be characterised as penal. On their case, an obligation to pay interest for a period of 6.5 months arising in connection with a breach of the contract of compromise or, perhaps more accurately, an untimely performance limited to a delay of about a fortnight (in circumstances in which the first plaintiff is said to have suffered no loss) is inherently penal.
The first plaintiff does not concede that order 2 (or any underlying agreement) can be characterised as mere security. She says that the sum of $1.8 million must be taken to have been negotiated as a figure designed to embody a compromise of the whole of the dispute between the parties in the principal proceedings, not merely as a pre-estimate of an amount of money required to discharge mortgages over the residence and to pay costs payable to the plaintiffs.
As a matter of arithmetic, the total amount secured by the subject mortgages as at 23 October 2013 was $1,559,256.39, and the plaintiffs' costs were ultimately assessed at $227,357.39.
Any obligation the defendants have to pay interest to the first plaintiff in the present proceedings arises from CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html), read with the definitions of "judgment", "judgment creditor", "judgment debt" and "judgment debtor" in CPA [s3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s3.html) and the terms of the "consent orders" of 23 October 2013.
With emphasis added, CPA [s 3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s3.html) defines terms as follows: "Judgment includes any order for the payment of money, including any order for the payment of costs. 
Judgment creditor means the person to whom a judgment debt is payable. 
Judgment debt includes:  any amount payable under a judgment, and  any interest after judgment that is payable on that amount under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html), and  any other amount payable under rules of court without the need for a judgment. 
Judgment debtor means the person by whom a judgment debt is payable."
CPA [s101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) is in the following terms (with emphasis added): "101 Interest after judgment 
Unless the court orders otherwise, interest is payable on so much of the amount of a judgment (exclusive of any order for costs) as is from time to time unpaid. 
Interest under subsection (1) is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at such other rate as the court may order, as from:  the date on which the judgment takes effect, or  such later date as the court may order. 
Despite subsection (1), interest is not payable on the amount of a judgment if the amount is paid in full within 28 days after the date on which the judgment takes effect, unless the court orders to the contrary.

The court may order that interest is to be paid on any amount payable under an order for the payment of costs. 
Interest under subsection (4) is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at such other rate as the court may order, as from:  the date or dates on which the costs concerned were paid, or  such later date as the court may order.

This section does not authorise the giving of interest on any interest payable under this section. 
In this section, a reference to the "prescribed rate" of interest is a reference to the rate of interest prescribed by the uniform rules for the purposes of this section."
The introductory words of CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) are a source of power in the Court to make an order countermanding an obligation otherwise imposed by CPA [s 101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) to pay interest on a judgment. However, they are not the exclusive source of such a power. The Court generally retains control of its own processes, including proceedings for the enforcement of a judgment debt. Leaving aside its inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings (eg, as an abuse of process, illustrated by Walton versus Gardiner <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 378] at 392-396), the Court has statutory powers to grant a stay, including powers under CPA [s67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s67.html) and [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s61.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) NSW ("SCA").
CPA [s67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s67.html) is in the following terms: "67. Stay of proceedings 
Subject to rules of court, the court may at any time and from time to time, by order, stay any proceedings before it, either permanently or until a specified day."
SCA [s61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s61.html) is a product of the Court's adoption of a Judicature Act system of administration upon commencement of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and cognate legislation on 1 July 1972. It is in the following terms: "61 Defence or stay instead of injunction 
The Court shall not restrain by injunction any proceedings pending in the Court. 
Every matter of equity on which an injunction against the prosecution of proceedings in the Court might formerly have been obtained, whether on terms or conditions or not, may be relied on by way of defence in the proceedings. 
Where any person, whether a party to proceedings in the Court or not:  would formerly have been entitled to apply to the Court to restrain the prosecution of the proceedings, or  is entitled to enforce by attachment or otherwise any judgment or order in contravention of which the proceedings are taken,  the Court may, on application by the person, stay the proceedings either generally or to such extent as the Court thinks fit. 
This section does not affect the powers of the Court to stay proceedings otherwise than pursuant to this section.
As explained by Brereton J in In the matter of Prismex Technologies Pty Limited; Colin Lindsay Taggert versus John Matyear  <case> at <case>- <case>, SCA [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s61.html) is a source of jurisdiction in the Court to decline to enforce an order of the Court where it would be inequitable to do so at the time when enforcement is sought. 
Having reviewed Harvey versus Hall [(1873) LR 16 Eq 324], his Honour wrote as follows, in paragraph [49] of his judgment: "On those authorities, it seems to me...that Courts have a discretion to decline to enforce their orders where it would be inequitable to do so at the time when enforcement is sought. The necessary corollary is that, pursuant to [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) [s61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s61.html), the Court may stay further proceedings, including enforcement, where there is an equitable objection to doing so. Previously - that is to say, before
Judicature and the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), a Court of Equity would have restrained the plaintiff by injunction from proceeding or issuing enforcement. The effect of [s61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s61.html) is that that should now be done by a stay in the proceedings 'either generally or to such extent as the court thinks fit'".
Absent a countervailing order, the judgment for $1.8 million awarded in favour of the first plaintiff against the defendants by order 2 of the "consent orders" of 23 October 2013 was sufficient to enliven in the defendants an obligation, under CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s101.html), to pay interest on the judgment. Absent a countervailing order, the obligation to pay interest became, by force of the legislation and without more, an incident of the judgment debt for $1.8 million payable by the defendants to the first plaintiff.
Interest began to accrue on the judgment from the time of judgment and continued to accrue until, on 7 May 2014, the debt was satisfied. The defendants' obligation to pay interest did not spring up only after the time of judgment or contingently upon the defendants' non-performance of contractual obligations. The first plaintiff's agreement to forego an entitlement to interest was (as paragraph 7 of the parties' agreement provided) conditional upon "the defendants' compliance with the terms of the Orders and this Agreement".
Where proceedings are resolved by or with the benefit of consent of the parties based on a contract of compromise, care needs to be exercised in distinguishing between: (a) a judgment or order made by the Court; and (b) a formal notation by the Court of an inter partes agreement associated with a determination of the proceedings. Different considerations might apply to the different elements of a settlement of proceedings.
Whatever affinity there may be between a judgment or order made by the Court and an underlying, or associated, agreement between parties to the proceedings, a judgment or order made "by" or "with" the consent of the parties must be viewed, primarily, as a public act of the Court, not merely a private transaction between affected parties.
It is, at least, debateable whether (under the Court's Judicature Act system of court administration) the equitable doctrine governing relief against penalties applies directly to a judgment or order of the Court.
Whether a contractual obligation constitutes a penalty against which the Court will grant relief under the general law is a question of construction which focuses upon substance rather than form and upon the intentions of the parties (viewed objectively rather than subjectively) at the time the contract was made: O'Dea versus All States Leasing System (WA) Pty Limited <case>; <case>.
If an underlying contract is impeached (eg, because made by a lawyer with a want of authority to bind a party), a judgment or order of the Court might be set aside, inter alia, as having been made irregularly, illegally or against good faith: Harvey versus Phillips <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 235] at 175, 190-194 and 203.
A contention that a provision in a contract of compromise, embodied in a judgment or order of the Court, is unenforceable as a penalty may need to grapple with the reality that a requirement of the general law governing penalties, that questions of construction focus upon substance rather than form, may require substantial weight to be given to a decision by parties to embody an obligation in a judgment or order of the Court, not merely in an ancillary, inter partes agreement. As part of an overall arrangement affecting parties, an obligation imposed in the form of a judgment or order rather than simply as a term of an agreement might not readily be characterised as something less than a primary obligation (a collateral obligation or a mere security for performance of another obligation) for the purpose of determining whether it is penal. Form may be a strong indicator of substance where parties have deliberately engaged a formal procedure in recording an agreement to settle proceedings.
A contention by a party that a proposed judgment or order, sought to give effect to a contract of compromise of proceedings, might be penal could, if disclosed to the Court at the time of settlement, result in a refusal on the part of the Court to lend its aid to the parties' agreement, at least as formulated.
In an appropriate case, equitable principles might be applied by analogy in the process of enforcement of a judgment or order because, as Brereton J has demonstrated, the jurisdiction of the Court extends to staying a judgment or order it would be inequitable to enforce. In the current proceedings, the jurisdiction to grant a stay also merges with that under the introductory words of CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s101.html) to countermand the operation of the subsection.
A "consent order" giving effect to a contract of compromise can, generally, be impeached on any ground upon which an underlying contract can be impeached: Harvey versus Phillips <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 235] at 216-217[10]. There the High Court wrote as follows: "In general terms, a stipulation prima facie imposes a penalty on a party (the first party) if, as a matter of substance, it is collateral (or accessory) to a primary stipulation in favour of a second party and this collateral stipulation, upon the failure of the primary stipulation, imposes upon the first party an additional detriment, the penalty, to the benefit of the second party. In that sense, the collateral or accessory stipulation is described as being in the nature of a security for and in terrorem of the satisfaction of the primary stipulation. If compensation can be made to the second party for the prejudice suffered by failure of the primary stipulation, the collateral stipulation and the penalty are enforced only to the extent of that compensation. The first party is relieved to that degree from liability to satisfy the collateral stipulation."
I am not satisfied that, on their proper construction, read as a whole and viewed in substance, the notations and orders made on 23 October 2013 involve any imposition on the defendant of a penal obligation. On the contrary. The judgment debt created by Order 2, together with the incidental obligation to pay interest that arose under CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s101.html) and accrued from the time of judgment, was a primary, not a secondary, obligation imposed on the defendants, in the character of a present debt, albeit subject to an agreement for interest to be foregone by the first plaintiff upon a timely performance by the defendants of their obligations. The judgment was not merely security for performance of the agreement. It had an independent, primary character.
I do not accept, as the defendant would have it, that the judgment debt for which order 2 provided was intended to serve only as security for the defendant's due performance of an obligation to service, and to discharge in a timely manner, the mortgages charged against the residence which, by virtue of order 1, the first plaintiff was declared to own beneficially.
The "intention of the parties" identified in paragraph 18 of their agreement is recorded as "inclusive" of an intention that the first plaintiff receive the benefit of a sale of the residence as if unencumbered. That is consistent with an intention that she also receive the benefit of a judgment for $1.8 million as a freestanding entitlement, independent of the value of the mortgages (securing, as at 23 October 2013, a debt of $1,559,256.39) to be discharged.
The defendant's obligation to pay interest on that judgment arose, not by virtue of an express agreement on the part of the parties, but by virtue of CPA [s101(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s101.html), conditional relief against the operation of which was afforded by the agreement contained in paragraph 7 of the parties' agreement.
The obligation to pay interest did not arise, by virtue of an inter partes agreement, upon breach of the agreement or as a punishment imposed on the defendants. It arose, by virtue of legislation, upon judgment being given. Its purpose was to compensate the first plaintiff for delay in payment of the judgment debt, not to punish the defendants. Interest accrued from the outset subject to a conditional, inter partes agreement that the obligation to pay interest would not be enforced in the event of the defendants' timely performance of specified obligations. That agreement did not displace, rise above, or render collateral, the court order that created the judgment debt upon which, by virtue of the legislation, interest accrued from the time limited by CPA [s 101.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s101.html)
The agreement in paragraph 14 (for reduction of the principal sums owed on mortgages on the residence to serve as payments in reduction of the judgment debt) operated to the advantage of both parties in that it both reduced the indebtedness of the defendants (to their bank and the first plaintiff) and enlarged the equity available to the plaintiff as the beneficial owner of her residence. It did not render the defendants' liability under the judgment, or to interest on the judgment, a collateral obligation.
Nor did the agreement (in paragraph 15) for the balance of the judgment sum, after the discharge of mortgages, to be paid to the first plaintiff and to be applied in reduction of the entitlement of the plaintiffs (including, but not limited to the first plaintiff) to have their costs paid.
The amount of the judgment was the product of a compromise of competing contentions referable to several parcels of land, not merely the first plaintiff's residence. It might have been negotiated with an eye half-focussed on the amount of the mortgage debts secured against the title to the residence, or so the defendants might have reasoned themselves towards a settlement. However, viewed objectively, the judgment debt (including accruing interest) to which they consented was a primary obligation, not a collateral one or mere security for performance of another. Enforcement of the obligation to pay interest is not inequitable. It is but enforcement of the parties' bargain, unattended by a penalty.
All things considered, in my opinion the first plaintiff is entitled to an order, as she seeks, for the payment to her of interest accrued in the sum of $75,396.88 
COSTS
In deciding the questions of costs raised by the parties' motions, and allowing for the first plaintiff's success on the question of interest, regard must be had, on both motions, to the need, on both sides of the record, for the orders and notations of 23 October 2013 to be carried into effect.
Events overtook the substance of both motions: the defendants paid all moneys necessary to procure a discharge of the mortgages over the first plaintiff's residence, and she procured a sale of the residence.
Whether the motions were truly necessary, on one side or the other, cannot easily be grasped in retrospect. There is, however, an abiding impression that each party continued to engage in adversarial debate following settlement of the proceedings notwithstanding that their economic interests were largely bound together.
Allowing for the plaintiffs' success on the question of interest, the appropriate orders as to costs are: * (1) ORDER that the defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of the motions, limited to the costs of the hearing on 23 February 2015, preparation of the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 19 and 23 February 2015 and consideration of the defendants' written submissions dated 20 February 2015.
* (2) ORDER that each party otherwise pay or bear his, her or its own costs of the motions.

CONCLUSION
Accordingly, I make the following orders: * (1) ORDER that the defendants pay to the first plaintiff the sum of $75,396.88.
* (2) ORDER that each of the plaintiffs' notice of motion filed 29 April 2014 and the defendants' further amended notice of motion filed on 21 August 2014 otherwise be dismissed.
* (3) ORDER that the defendants pay the plaintiffs' costs of the motions, limited to the costs of the hearing on 23 February 2015, preparation of the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 19 and 23 February 2015 and consideration of the defendants' written submissions dated 20 February 2015.
* (4) ORDER that each party otherwise pay or bear his, her or its own costs of the motions.
