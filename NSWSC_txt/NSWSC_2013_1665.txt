JUDGMENT
The plaintiff, Sydney Airport Holdings Limited ("SAHL") as responsible entity of Sydney Airport Trust 2 ("SAT2"), seeks orders of the Court under [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) in respect of a proposed trust scheme. That trust scheme is part of a restructure of one of two managed investment schemes that together trade on Australian Securities Exchange Limited as stapled securities, which is intended to allow an increase in the permitted level of foreign ownership of those securities under the [Airports Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aa1996129/) (Cth) and provide increased certainty in respect of certain corporate governance and taxation issues.
At this first hearing, SAHL as responsible entity of SAT2 seeks the opinion, advice and direction of the Court that it would be justified in convening a meeting of unitholders in SAT2 to consider, and, if thought fit, agree to proposed scheme resolutions; distributing an Explanatory Memorandum to SAT2 unitholders in advance of that meeting; and proceeding on the basis that proposed amendments to the SAT2 constitution would be within the powers of alteration conferred by that constitution and [s 601GC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601gc.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth).
If that advice is given and the scheme were approved at the proposed meeting, SAHL, as responsible entity of SAT2, would then seek the opinion, advice and direction of the Court at the second hearing that it would be justified in implementing the scheme, giving effect to the amendments to the SAT2 constitution and doing all things necessary to effect the scheme.

Applicable principles
A responsible entity of a registered managed investment scheme holds scheme property on trust for the members under [s 601FC(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601fc.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the constitution of a registered managed investment scheme may be altered by a special resolution of members under [s 601GC(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601gc.html) of the Act. That power of alteration supports the Court's jurisdiction under [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) in the context of a trust: Re Mirvac Ltd <case>; [(1999) 32 ACSR 107]; Re DUET Management Company 1 Ltd above. 
The responsible entity of the scheme may obtain judicial advice under [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) at the first hearing, that it is justified in propounding resolutions to implement the scheme and in proceeding on the basis that proposed amendments to the constitution of the registered managed investment scheme to implement the scheme would be within the powers of alteration conferred by that document and [s 601GC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601gc.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/): Re Mirvac Ltd above at [47]; Re Macquarie Capital Alliance above at [19]; Re DUET Management Company 1 Ltd above at [9]. An explanatory statement is then sent to unitholders in respect of a meeting to consider the resolutions to implement the scheme, which will describe the proposed transaction, disclose that judicial advice and draw attention to unitholders' rights to appear at a second hearing and object to the trust scheme: Re DUET Management Company 1 Ltd above at [9]. If unitholders approve the proposed scheme, the Court may give judicial advice to the responsible entity at a second hearing that, having regard to the result of the meetings and any other relevant circumstances, it is justified in implementing the scheme: Re Mirvac Ltd above at [48]; Re Homemaker Retail Management Ltd <case>; <case>; Re Macquarie Goodman above at [10].

The proposed restructuring
SAHL is presently the responsible entity of Sydney Airport Trust 1 ("SAT1") and SAT2, which are managed investment schemes registered under Chapter 5C of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Units in SAT1 and SAT2 are "stapled" together on a 1:1 basis and together comprise the security traded on ASX. SAHL (in its capacity as responsible entity of SAT1 and SAT2) and Sydney Airport Limited ("SAL"), which is a public unlisted Australian resident company, have entered into an Implementation Agreement in respect of the proposed scheme which contemplates that, subject to the necessary approvals from existing securityholders, the necessary opinion, advice and directions of the Court and the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions precedent, a scheme meeting will be convened for SAT2 unitholders to consider and vote on the scheme resolutions. 
The proposed scheme provides for existing securities to be "destapled" and for SAT2 unitholders to transfer their SAT2 units to SAL in exchange for SAL shares, by way of the scheme. SAT2 unitholders would not pay any cash consideration for SAL shares issued under the scheme. Contemporaneous with the issue of the SAL shares in exchange for SAT2 units, SAL would undertake a capital reduction under [Part 2J.1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p2j.1) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and cancel the shares in SAL held by the original shareholder so that, after the scheme had been implemented, securityholders will hold shares in SAL in the same proportion as they held SAT2 units. Several further steps would be taken after the scheme was implemented, with the result that SAL would directly hold the Sydney Airport operating entities; a new and separate entity would act as responsible entity of and various Australian and foreign non-operating entities of the Sydney Airport Group would be acquired by SAT1. 
Explanatory Memorandum and expert reports
The proposed Explanatory Memorandum for the scheme is in evidence. There is evidence that a due diligence and verification process in the usual form has been undertaken in respect of that Explanatory Memorandum, as described in the affidavit of the General Counsel of Sydney Airport, Mr Jamie Motum, dated 21 October 2013 and in the affidavit of its external solicitor, Mr Julian Donnan, dated 25 October 2013. The proposed chairperson and alternate chairperson of the scheme meeting have consented to act in that capacity, as evidenced by affidavits of Messrs Max Moore-Wilton and Trevor Gerber dated 24 October 2013.
Deloitte was engaged to prepare an Independent Expert's Report which indicates that, in its opinion, the proposed restructure (including the scheme) is fair and reasonable and is in the best interests of securityholders. Mr Stephen Ferris of Deloitte, in his affidavit dated 24 October 2013, confirms that he holds the opinions expressed in the report; intends (subject to any matters raised by the Court) to sign a copy of the report in its current form for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum to be sent to securityholders; and is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would cause him to change the opinions expressed in the current version of that report.
The Explanatory Memorandum and Independent Expert's Report identify the anticipated advantages of the restructuring which include, as noted above, that the revised structure will allow increased foreign ownership of the relevant securities, to the maximum percentage specified in the [Airports Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aa1996129/) and potentially increase demand for and liquidity in the securities; will or may facilitate a proposed settlement of issues arising from a tax audit as to the deductibility of dividends on redeemable preference shares paid under the existing structure and allow future financing to be occur by an interest bearing loan proposed to be made by SAT1 to SAL; and introduce governance changes resulting from the introduction of SAL into the corporate structure and the appointment of an independent responsible entity to SAT1. The Explanatory Memorandum and that report also, appropriately, identify potential disadvantages and risks including transaction costs and the possibility of different views taken by the separate boards of SAL and the responsible entity of SAT1.
KPMG was engaged to prepare an Investigating Accountant's Report for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum. In his affidavit dated 22 October 2013, Mr Craig Mennie of KPMG confirms that he holds the opinions expressed in the report; intends (subject to any matters raised by the Court) to sign a copy of the report in its current form for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum to be sent to securityholders; and is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would cause him to change the opinions expressed in the current version of that report.
PricewaterhouseCoopers was engaged to prepare a summary of Australian income tax and GST issues relevant to the restructure (including the scheme) for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum. In his affidavit dated 22 October 2013, Mr Paul Abbey of PricewaterhouseCoopers confirms that he holds the opinions expressed in the report; intends (subject to any matters raised by the Court) to sign a copy of the report in its current form for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum to be sent to securityholders; and is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would cause him to change the opinions expressed in the current version of that report.
Ashurst Australia was engaged to prepare statements concerning the Australian stamp duty implications of the proposed transactions for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum, which are contained in section 10.7.4 of the draft Explanatory Memorandum, and to apply to the NSW Chief Commissioner of State Revenue for certain relief in connection with the transactions. In his affidavit dated 22 October 2013, Mr William Cannon of Ashurst confirms that he holds the opinions expressed in the statements; intends (subject to any matters raised by the Court) to approve the statements for inclusion in the Explanatory Memorandum to be sent to securityholders and is not aware of any facts or circumstances which would cause him to change the opinions expressed in the current version of the statements; and also confirms that the NSW Chief Commissioner of State Revenue has granted the relief sought in the relevant applications.
Arrangements have been made with the registry services provider for the despatch of the Explanatory Memorandum and a proxy form to securityholders on the register at 23 October 2013 and for the despatch of the Explanatory Memorandum and the proxy form to securityholders on the register as 11 November 2013 to whom those documents have not, as at that date, been previously despatched. A copy of the Explanatory Memorandum will not be sent to new securityholders who come onto the register between 11 November 2013 and 20 November 2013 (the voting record date for the scheme), but copies of the Explanatory Memorandum and proxy form will be available to be downloaded over that period (and until at least 22 November 2013, the date of the scheme meeting) on the listed entity's website. 
Other issues
SAHL notes in submissions that, by reason of [s 253E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s253e.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), a responsible entity and its associates are not entitled to vote their interests on a resolution at a meeting of scheme members if they have an interest in the matter other than as a member of the relevant managed investment scheme. It appears that section will not have application in this case, since there is no suggestion that either SAHL (as responsible entity of SAT2) or its associates has any interest in the resolutions to be considered at the meeting other than in their capacities as members of SAT2.
Several cases, in the context of corporate schemes of arrangement, have identified the need to address performance risk, by ensuring there is a mechanism for scheme members to enforce the right to entitlements that are to be received under a scheme: Re Kaz Group Ltd <case> at <case>- <case>; Re Tempo Services Ltd <case>; <case>- <case>; Re DUET Management Company 1 Ltd above. 
Orders
Having regard to these matters, I was satisfied that judicial advice leading to a meeting of the members of the managed investment schemes should be given as sought, and I made orders substantially in the form sought by the Plaintiffs, as initialled by me and placed in the file.
