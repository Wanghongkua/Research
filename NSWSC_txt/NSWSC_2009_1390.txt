DECISION: 
Appropriate for Chief Commissioner to act under the [Taxation Administration
Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/), [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/s72.html)  
JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
GZELL J  
FRIDAY 11 DECEMBER 2009  /08 MAXWELL PHILIP DELMEGE & ANOR versus CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STATE
REVENUE (NO 2) 
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT I have before me an application by the Chief Commissioner of State Revenue for approval to act under the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/), [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/s72.html)
It provides as follows: "The Chief Commissioner may require a person, by written notice, to do any one or more of the following: to provide to the Chief Commissioner, (either orally or in writing) information that is described in the notice, to attend and give evidence before the Chief Commissioner or an authorised officer, to produce to the Chief Commissioner an instrument or record in the person's custody or control that is described in the notice." The Chief Commissioner does not intend to require the persons to whom he proposes to address such a requirement to attend to give evidence before him.
 The reason the Chief Commissioner has appeared before the court to seek its approval to act under that provision is because an adverse decision on a notice of objection with respect to the 2004 to 2006 land tax years is before the court and it might be said that to so act at this stage constitutes contempt.
 Since the matter was last before the court, the Chief Commissioner has issued amended assessments with respect to those years and has issued amended assessments with respect to the 2002 and 2003 land tax years in all of which he raises the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/), s
T(2)(c). It provides that the principal place of residence exemption is not available unless, while the owner is the owner, the land is not used or occupied except as his or her principal place of residence.
 In opposition to the application, it is pointed out that much of the information which should have given the Chief Commissioner the basis for seeking the information at an earlier stage was available to him and the current application is not timely. The Chief Commissioner was aware of occupation of the premises by persons other than Mr and Mrs Delmege.
 The taxpayers are content if, instead of this procedure, subpoenas are issued when the matter is before the court for the production of documents to the court, for the giving of evidence before the court, or for both.
Otherwise, it is said, the Chief Commissioner may rely upon information unknown to Mr and Mrs Delmege or divulged to them at the last moment.
 It seems to me that concern will not arise if the Chief Commissioner acts under the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/s72.html) because, if any information obtained under that provision is used by him to reject the current objection that the taxpayers have lodged with respect to all the amended assessments, they will be apprised of the use of that information in the making of the objection decision.
 It seems to me that it is appropriate for the Chief Commissioner to exercise power under the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/), [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/taa1996269/s72.html) *
