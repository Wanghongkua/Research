Coles Myer Property Investments Pty Ltd ("CMPI") owned two shopping centres, one at Forster and the other at Bondi Junction. Various "Coles Myer" companies (excluding CMPI) entered into a Joint Venture Agreement together with the respondent ISPT Pty Ltd ("ISPT"), the objectives of which included the acquisition of the two properties by unit trust. On 27 January 1995 a series of complicated steps were taken to effectuate these intentions for each property, the procedures not differing in any material respect. In consequence, the properties were transferred by CMPI to ISPT Nominees Pty Ltd to be held by the latter company as nominee for ISPT.

On 6 March 1995 a Transfer of each property from CMPI to ISPT Nominees was submitted to the Commissioner for Stamp Duties. ISPT contended that each
Transfer attracted on $2 duty in terms of [s73(2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s73.html) of the Act, being a conveyance made for nominal consideration in consequence of a change of trustees. The Chief Commissioner asserted that the transaction in relation to each property gave rise to liability to duty pursuant to Div 3A of the [Stamp Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/), assessing each transaction as liable to substantive duty. Each assessment was met with a Notice of Objection to Assessment. Each Notice of Objection was formally disallowed by the Commissioner.

ISPT appealed to the Supreme Court by way of summons. Studdert J made orders setting aside the disallowance of ISPT's objection and allowed that objection in relation to each property. His Honour held that the changes in beneficial ownership that had occurred were as a consequence of the issue or redemption of units in a unit trust scheme and exempted from duty by [s44(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) of the [Stamp Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/).

HELD, dismissing each appeal and allowing each cross appeal; (By Fitzgerald AJA; Meagher JA concurring; Mason P dissenting) The process by which the properties became assets of their respective unit trusts did not involve "a change in the beneficial ownership of an estate or interest in" the properties within the meaning of Div3A of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/index.html#p3) of the [Stamp Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/).

(By Mason P dissenting) A dutiable change in the beneficial ownership of the properties occurred when the equitable interest in those properties was brought into the unit trusts, and held by ISPT subject to the equitable obligations of an active sub-trustee.
 (By the Court) Where a trustee acquires land for the trust, the beneficial interest in the land vests immediately in the beneficiary or beneficiaries and is not held by the trustee for any instant in time.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STAMP DUTIES v ISPT PTY LTD (TWO APPEALS) 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: Two appeals, heard concurrently, raise common issues. Each involves a complex and admittedly contrived set of steps intended to transfer beneficial ownership in land in New South Wales without incurring substantial stamp duty. The appellant contends that stamp duty as on a conveyance is attracted on one or more bases, by reason of Division 3A of [Pt 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/index.html#p3) of the [Stamp Duties Act 1920](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/) [(ss 44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html)-[44F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44f.html)). The respondent contends that it brought each transaction within an express statutory exemption (in [s44(2)(d))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) for changes in beneficial ownership occurring as the consequence of the redemption of units in a unit trust scheme. 
The respondent was successful at first instance in having its Notices of
Objection to the appellant's assessments of duty allowed. The Chief
Commissioner has appealed, and the respondent has cross-appealed seeking a declaration that it was not obliged to lodge statements under Division 3A.

DIVISION 3A 
The general proposition that stamp duty is a tax on instruments and not on transactions (Allders International Pty Ltd versus Commissioner of State Revenue (1996) 186 CLR 630 at 641, 649-50, 657, 675-6) may yield to the dictates of a specific provision. Division 3A departs from the traditional form of stamp duty by isolating particular transactions and compelling lodgement of a statement containing prescribed information. "There is, in substance, a duty on the transactions although the statement is deemed an instrument in each case. This mechanism enables the provision of [Division 3A] to fit in with the other provisions of the Act" (Mertune Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties [(1994) 35 NSWLR 636] at 640 per Smart J).

Division 3A was introduced as an anti-avoidance measure: see Legislative
Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 26 May 1987, pp 12428-30. Among the intended targets nominated in the Minister's second reading speech was the "Clayton's contract, whereby one party made a written offer to another who accepted orally thereby effecting a contract without creating a document". 
But the Division clearly goes beyond such "Clayton's contracts". Its key provision, latching onto transactions which "cause or result in a change in beneficial ownership", evinces a parliamentary intent to strike at a broad sweep of tax avoidance schemes. Such intent should not be frustrated by judicial nit-picking. The language of the statute should be given a fair reading (Greenberg versus Inland Revenue Commissioners [[1972] AC 109] at 137;
Federal Commissioner of Taxation versus Students World (Aust) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1978) 138 CLR 251] at 265).

A recent commentary has pointed out that: 
In linking the concept of beneficial ownership to legal and equitable interest, the legislature has attempted to `piggy-back' on the established rules for the creation and transfer of property interests. In focusing on the concept of benefit, it has used terminology which straddles the established concepts of property law. The use of property law concepts to determine liability in the context of revenue law is not uncommon and inevitably creates difficulties by using concepts which developed for quite different purposes.
(Stone and Lesnie, "Some Thoughts on Beneficial Interests and Beneficial
Ownership in Revenue Law (1996) 19 UNSW LJ 181 at p183.) [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) informs the reader about the type of transaction to which Division 3A applies.
Pursuant to [s44(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html),
Division 3A "applies to a transaction which ... causes or results in a change in the beneficial ownership of an estate or interest in ... land situated in
New South Wales". [Section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44a.html) requires a person who is a party to a transaction to which Division 3A applies which is not effected or evidenced by an instrument chargeable with ad valorem duty in accordance with the Second Schedule under, inter alia, the heading "Conveyances of any Property" to lodge a statement in approved form. This statement is deemed to be an instrument effecting the transaction to which it relates and is chargeable with appropriate duty [(s44A(5)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44a.html) 
However, [s44(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) is qualified by [s44(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) which excludes various transactions some of which could otherwise fall within the general concept of a transaction causing or resulting in a change in the beneficial ownership of property. [Section (2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) stipulates that a reference to a change in beneficial ownership in [s44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html) does not include "a reference to a change in beneficial ownership occurring as the consequence of ... the issue or redemption of units in a unit trust scheme". "Unit trust scheme" is defined in [s3(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s3.html) 
THE TRANSACTIONS 
Coles Myer Property Investments Pty Ltd ("CMPI") owned properties at Forster (Forster Shopping Village) and Bondi Junction (Eastgate Shopping Centre). On November 1994 various "Coles Myer" companies (excluding CMPI) entered into a Joint Venture Agreement together with the respondent ISPT Pty Ltd ("ISPT").
The expressed objectives of the Agreement included the acquisition of the two properties. Clause 3.1 expressed the intention of establishing a separate unit trust for the acquisition of each property. Clause 4.1 expressed the intention that ordinary units in each trust would be held as to 75% by ISPT and 25% by
Coles Myer Trust Investments Pty Ltd. The balance of the Agreement set out details of the joint venture.

On 27 January 1995 various steps were taken in Melbourne to effectuate these intentions. In consequence of these steps, the properties were transferred by
CMPI to ISPT Nominees Pty Ltd ("ISPT Nominees") to be held by the latter company as nominee for ISPT. One or more of these steps are said by the appellant to represent a transaction exposing the respondent to stamp duty liability as for a conveyance, because there was a transaction to which
Division 3A applied. I shall describe the steps touching the Forster property.
Those touching the property at Bondi Junction differed in no material respect.
The steps were taken in the order indicated: 
The parties to the Joint Venture Agreement, together with ISPT Nominees and ISPT Custodians Pty Ltd ("ISPT Custodians") first executed a Supplementary
Agreement which amended and further defined their intended relationships in the proposed transaction. Among other things: 
The beneficial ownership in the proposed unit trusts was restructured (cl .1). Forster was to be owned by ISPT Coles Myer (Forster) Property Trust (No ) (described as the property holder) in which ordinary units were to be held as to 50% by ISPT and as to 50% by ISPT Coles Myer (Forster) Property Trust (No 2) (described as the upstream trust), in which units were to be held as to % by ISPT and 50% by Coles Myer Trust Investments Pty Ltd.

Clause 4.1 declared "for the avoidance of doubt" that until payment of the purchase price under a contract for the acquisition of the land: no party shall have any right in, or right or interest to seek to enforce any proposed contract concerning, the relevant property, nor shall any party be regarded as a beneficiary or entitled to any interest under an Initial Trust [ie a Trust in respect of, inter alia, the Forster and Bondi Junction properties] until an issue or transfer of units in favour of that party has been effected.

A Trust Deed was executed, constituting the ISPT Coles Myer (Forster)
Property Trust (No 1) ("the Forster No 1 Trust"). ISPT was appointed the trustee. The beneficial interest in the Fund was divided into equal units.
Clause 3.2 provided that: 
A Unit shall not confer any interest in any particular investment, asset, property or cash comprising the assets of the Trust, but only a beneficial interest in the Fund as a whole. Each unit of the same class shall confer on the unit holder an equal entitlement and be of equal value at all times.
 [It was common ground that the Deed constituted a unit trust scheme as defined in the Act.] 
The Trust Deed contemplated the appointment of a nominee for the holding of any investment forming part of the Fund, subject to the prior written approval of the Unitholders (clause 8.10).

CMPI applied for the issue of 17,973,996 units in the Forster No 1 Trust.
[$17,973,995 had been the purchase price for the acquisition of the Forster property stipulated in clause 6.3 of the Joint Venture Agreement.] An application from CMPI and its cheque in the sum of $17,973,996 payable to ISPT were tabled. The units were then issued in favour of CMPI. At that stage, they represented the entire beneficial interest in the relevant unit trust Fund.

ISPT then offered in writing, as the trustee under the Forster Property
Trust (No 1), to purchase the property at Forster from CMPI. The letter indicated that: 
CMPI may accept this offer verbally, whereupon we will pay the full purchase price of $17,973,995.
 [In this context I read "verbally" as meaning "orally".] 
The offer was then accepted orally by a duly authorised officer of CMPI.

An officer of ISPT then endorsed to CMPI the cheque for $17,973,996 that had been paid by CMPI in favour of ISPT for the purchase of units in the
Forster No 1 Trust earlier in the meeting. The cheque was then handed to
CMPI's representative. Since the cheque was for $1 more than the agreed purchase price of the property, $1 change was handed back. According to the letter of offer, CMPI then became appointed to hold the property as nominee under the Deed of Trust. This is because the letter relevantly stated that: 
If the offer is accepted: ...
Once the purchase price is paid in full, CMPI is appointed to hold the property as a nominee under the deed establishing the Trust for so long as
CMPI remains the registered proprietor....

ISPT in its capacity as trustee of the "Industry Superannuation Property
Trust" and ISPT Custodians as trustee for the ISPT Coles Myer (Forster)
Property Trust No 2 each made application for and were issued units in the
ISPT Coles Myer (Forster) Property Trust (No 1). 8,986,998 units were allotted to each applicant. These allotments gave effect to the intention stated in cl .1 of the Supplementary Agreement (see para 1(a) above). Two cheques payable to ISPT (each in the sum of $8,986,998) were tabled.
 [At this stage, the following units in the Forster No 1 Trust were held: 
CMPI 17,973,996 
ISPT 8,986,998 
Coles Myer (Forster) 
Property Trust No 2 8,986,998.] 
ISPT then redeemed from CMPI the 17,973,996 units previously acquired in the Forster No 1 Trust (para 3 above), endorsing in favour of CMPI the two cheques (totalling $17,973,996) which ISPT had received for the units in the
Forster No 1 Trust as described in para 7 above.

CMPI then resigned as nominee under the Forster No 1 Trust and requested
ISPT to appoint a new nominee.

ISPT then nominated ISPT Nominees as replacement nominee.

A Transfer of the Forster property in registrable form was then completed, transferring the land from CMPI to ISPT Nominees as a nominee of the Forster No 1 Trust. The stated consideration was "nil".

STAMP DUTY ASSESSED 
On 6 March 1995 the Transfer was submitted to the Commissioner for Stamp
Duties (together with the corresponding Transfer relating to the land at Bondi
Junction). ISPT's solicitor contended that each Transfer attracted only $2 duty in terms of [s73(2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s73.html) of the Act, being a conveyance made for nominal consideration in consequence of a change of trustees (nominees). There was subsequent debate as to the respondent's liability for Stamp Duty. The Chief Commissioner asserted that the transaction in relation to each property gave rise to liability to duty pursuant to Div 3A. This liability was disputed, although a cheque in the amount claimed by the Commissioner was tendered in order to avoid any possible penalty.

The Chief Commissioner assessed each transaction as liable to substantive duty, amending that assessment on two occasions (cf s35B). Each assessment was met with a Notice of Objection to Assessment. The ultimate basis of assessment was expressed in a letter dated 21 September 1995 as follows: 
It is considered that contracts for sale and purchase of land, created by acceptance of the written offers dated 27 January, caused or resulted in a change in the beneficial ownership of land situated in New South Wales. ISPT, being a party to those transactions who would have been liable to pay duty if such transactions had been effected or evidenced by an instrument liable to ad valorem duty under the heading `Conveyances of any property', is required to lodge 2 statements under [section
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44a.html)
As ISPT has failed to lodge such statements, duty has been assessed in accordance with [s127B.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s127b.html) 
Subsequent Notices of Objection were formally disallowed. Ultimately the Chief
Commissioner approved the respondent's request to proceed by way of appeal and appeals to the Supreme Court were promptly filed by the respondent (cf s124(8)).

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE STUDDERT J 
In relation to each disallowed Notice of Objection the respondent brought proceedings by summons in the Administrative Law Division. The appeal was by way of rehearing the objection and limited to the grounds of objection .

Expressed in simple terms, ISPT's case was that the change in beneficial ownership of the properties occurred on the issue of new units in the No 1
Trust (step 7 above), but that such change was exempted from the operation of
Division 3A by [s44(2)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s44.html)
No earlier change in beneficial ownership had occurred. Because CMPI's acceptance of the sale offer had been oral, the requirements of s23C(1)(a)) of the Conveyancing Act were not satisfied, and no constructive or resulting trust arose (cf s23C(2)) because equity would have declined relief for various reasons.

Studdert J accepted these submissions. And he rejected the Chief
Commissioner's submissions that s44 was satisfied because the composite effect of the various steps was to shift beneficial ownership in the properties; alternatively, that the oral acceptance of the offer for sale (step 5 above) was the critical step that brought about a change in beneficial ownership. His
Honour identified the events in step 7 as being the point at which the relevant change occurred, and concluded that s44(2)(d) provided an exemption from duty. The judgment is reported: (1997) 98 ATC 4084; [(1997) 38 ATR 128.
(Studdert] J numbered the steps differently. His step 9 corresponded with my step 7.) 
In each matter it was ordered that:
The decision of the defendant of 22 February 1996 disallowing the plaintiff's Notice of Objection dated 20 October 1995 to a notice of assessment by the defendant dated 21 September 1995 be set aside.
The plaintiff's Notice of Objection be allowed.
The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs.

APPELLANT'S BROAD SUBMISSION 
The appellant Chief Commissioner is correct in pointing out that a dutiable transaction may comprise a single-step or a multi-step process: cf Inland
Revenue Commissioners versus Brebner [[1967] 2 AC 18.] However, I reject the submission inviting the Court to take what I would term a broad brush approach to the events of 27 January 1995 by regarding it as sufficient that the legal and equitable interest in the property moved from CMPI at the start of the day to a situation where ISPT Nominees held a registrable transfer in its favour at the end of the day.

The appellant submits that s44(2) should be read as operating only where the relevant transaction comprises an activity nominated in that provision. So much may be granted. But the need remains for the relevant transaction to be identified. Both the taxing and the exempting provisions turn upon the application of notions of causation applied to legal concepts. If the net result of the complex series of events of 27 January 1995 was the passing of the beneficial interest in each property from CMPI to ISPT Nominees, then the court must grapple with the task of identifying when and how this occurred, if only to be able to answer the question posed by s44(2)(d) itself. The legislative scheme requires precise identification of an event having a defined legal effect coupled with satisfaction that it is not one of the exempted transactions mentioned in subsection (2).

Sometimes a series of individual steps may be viewed as parts of a single "transaction". Brebner is an example. In that case, such a construction was assisted by a taxing provision referred to tax advantages derived "in consequence of a transaction in securities or of the combined effect of two or more such transactions" (Finance Act 1960 (UK), s28(1)). In the absence of a legislative scheme which permits such a broad-brush approach to be taken, such analysis as found in Brebner cannot be applied to the present case.

Ultimately, senior counsel for the appellant appeared to accept that his case depended on establishing that beneficial ownership changed at step 6, when
ISPT paid the agreed purchase price consequent upon CMPI's oral acceptance (through its officer) of ISPT's written offer to purchase the property.

APPELLANT'S NARROWER CASE 
Propositions stated 
Alternatively, the appellant submits that a "change in beneficial ownership" occurred upon payment of the purchase price (ie step 6). Since CMPI's acceptance was unwritten and unsigned, the requirements of [s23C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) were not satisfied. That provision states that "no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent lawfully authorised in writing". However, [s23C(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) adds that the section "does not affect the creation or operation of resulting, implied, or constructive trusts". The appellant contends that a constructive or resulting trust arose at step 6. Reliance is placed on the proposition that, upon payment of the purchase price of land agreed to be sold (absent statutory restrictions upon transfer), "the purchaser is entitled in equity to the land and the vendor is a bare trustee" (McWilliam v
McWilliams Wines Pty Ltd <case>; [(1964) 114 CLR 656] at 660; Stern versus McArthur <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 489] at 523). (The trust is frequently described as a constructive trust, but according to Gummow J it is a resulting trust: Herdegen v
Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1988) 84 ALR 271] at 281.) Additionally, or in the alternative, the appellant relies upon the trust arising out of the express agreement, recorded in the letter of offer, that if the offer were accepted and the purchase price paid in full "CMPI is appointed to hold the property as a nominee under the deed establishing the Trust for so long as CMPI remains the registered proprietor".

The respondent does not dispute that it was the expressed common intent of the parties that, upon the oral acceptance of the written offer (ie at step 5) and receipt of the full purchase price (ie at step 6), CMPI was bound to hold the land as vendor/bare trustee for and as nominee/trustee for ISPT. (See also letter from Freehill, Hollingdale & Page dated 9 March 1995 §4.) Since this is common ground, I need not trouble with any difficulty touching the nominee relationship stemming from the fact that the relevant clause of the
Trust Deed (clause 8.10(a)) contemplated the "prior written approval" of the Unitholders to the appointment of a nominee to hold any investment.

Respondent's answer: CMPI's beneficial interest stayed at home with CMPI 
The respondent's answer to the appellant's submission about the passing of an equitable interest at steps 5 or 6 is based upon what may be termed principles of merger, circuity and futility. The consequence of the appellant's submissions is that the outcome achieved by step 6 was that CMPI purported to hold the land on trust for ISPT which purported to hold it on trust for CMPI.
In these circumstances, the respondent contends that equity would withhold any relief that would entail recognition of a constructive or resulting trust, with the consequence that no equitable interest in the land moved from the legal owner (CMPI) at this stage.

The respondent invokes the principle that no equitable estate passes if A purports to be trustee for A alone (DKLR Holding Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties  <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 431] at 474 (Brennan J) and cases cited there; Suncorp
Insurance & Finance versus Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) (1997) 97 ATC at 4838 (Davies JA)). This principle is based on the concept that equity will not lend its aid to a futility (Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity
Doctrines and Remedies, 3rd ed, 1992, §2029). More specifically, the respondent invokes the following passage from the judgment of Deane J in
Corin versus Patton <case>; [(1990) 169 CLR 540] at 579, where he said that: equity, with its regard for substance rather than form, would not go through the charade of intervening to create trusts of property under which the legal owner held as bare trustee for another who in turn held as bare trustee for the legal owner. To the contrary, equity firmly denies the possibility of any such intervention in that it would disregard the interposed beneficiary whom it would see as having no interest in the property at all (see Grainge v
Wilberforce [(1889) 5 TLR 436] at 437; In re Lashmar; Moody versus Penfold [[1891] 1 Ch 258] at 267, 270;
Baker and Langan, Snell's Principles of Equity, 28th ed (1982), p104;
Meagher and Gummow, Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia, 5th ed (1986) par ; Pettit, Equity and the Law of Trusts, 6th ed, (1989) p73; Hanbury and Maudsley, Modern Equity, 13th ed (Martin) (1989) p113). That means that such a trust is not possible since, once the interposed beneficiary is disregarded, the trustee and the beneficiary would be the same person with the result that the legal and beneficial interests were merged.

It is well established that a person may not be, at the same time, sole trustee and sole beneficiary of the commensurate legal and equitable estates in property (Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, 1984, vol 48 Trusts, para ; Scott on Trusts, 4th ed, 1987 §99). The proposition is usually stated in the context of a prior equitable estate, being co-extensive with an acquired legal estate, merging in such legal estate (Selby versus Alston <case>; [(1797) 3 Ves 339], [30 ER 1042]; In Re Selous [[1901] 1 Ch 921]; Fung Ping
Shan versus Tong Shun [[1918] AC 403] at 411). However there is no reason in principle why there would not also be merger where the legal interest is earlier (DKLR at 473-4) or, indeed, where there are two commensurate reflexive trusts each of which purport to have as their subject matter an equitable interest in property.

The respondent also relies by analogy upon cases where equity declined the specific performance of transient interests, such as an agreement for a tenancy at will, or to enter into a partnership for no fixed term (Hercy v
Birch <case>; Ves Jun 357, [32 ER 640).] "Equity, like nature, does nothing in vain" (Seeley v
Jago <case>; [(1717) 1 P Wms 389] per Lord Cowper
LC. See also Snell's Equity, 29th ed, 1990, p592). I acknowledge the authority of these cases, although it has been doubted whether such a bright line principle exists independently of the broader principle that specific performance will not be ordered unless damages are inadequate (Spry,
Equitable Remedies, 5th ed, 1997, pp133-8; Burrows, Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract, 2nd ed, 1994, p347).

Appellant's riposte: an equitable interest passes when a sub-trust is created 
The appellant sought to meet these arguments about merger and futility by submitting that there was utility in granting specific performance in the putative proceedings to enforce the trust, because the creation of a sub-trust at step 6 was an intended, necessary and pre-ordained step in a wider transaction that had been set in train by the Joint Venture Agreement and the earlier events of 27 January 1995.

It is useful to isolate the particular steps touching the land that occurred on 27 January 1995, and to describe them according to the expressed intent of the parties involved: - From start to finish CMPI held the legal interest in fee simple.
 - At step 6, two things happened eo instanti: 
CMPI received from ISPT the full agreed purchase price in circumstances which, had they stood alone, would have imposed a resulting trust over the land in favour of ISPT as purchaser.

CMPI agreed to hold the land as nominee of the Forster No 1 Trust in circumstances which, had they stood alone, would have imposed an express trust over the land were it not for absence of writing and signature. But the concatenation of (1) and (2) meant that [s23C(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) enabled the trust to be enforced. The terms of that trust were as set out in the Trust Deed. At that point of time, ISPT was the trustee of the Property
Trust and CMPI held all of the issued units.
 - The subsequent issue of additional units to third parties (step 7) and redemption of CMPI's units (step 8) did not in terms address the land, but (according to the respondent) collectively moved the beneficial interest in the land from CMPI to the continuing unit holders. This treats the beneficial interest in the land as an asset of the Forster No 1 Trust.
 - CMPI's resignation as nominee of the Forster No 1 Trust and its replacement as such by ISPT Nominees (steps 9 and 10) also treated the beneficial interest in the land as a continuing asset of that Trust. Such interest is also reflected in the nominal consideration in the Transfer from CMPI to ISPT
Nominees (step 11).

What emerges from this analysis is that it is inaccurate to say that step 6 merely brought about the result that, upon payment of the purchase price, CMPI purported to hold the land in trust for ISPT which purported to hold it in trust for CMPI. The arrangements stemming from CMPI's receipt of purchase moneys and nomination were more complex. In truth, CMPI purported to hold its pre-existent legal interest in the land as nominee for ISPT, the trustee under the Trust Deed. It necessarily followed that ISPT was purporting to hold the interest in the land that it thereby acquired as an asset of the Forster No 1
Property Trust (in which CMPI held all of the issued units at the time). It was vital to the transaction taken as a whole that the entire beneficial interest in the land move into the Forster No 1 Property Trust at step 6. Were it not so, the later issue (step 7) and redemption (step 8) of units would have left the land unaffected. And the ultimate Transfer (step 11) would have involved much more than a change in the trustee of the land, because the land would not have been held on any trust.

Fecund equity conceived the shifting use and the springing use. But equity would be relinquishing its role as mother for that of magician if (without the use of mirrors) it enabled the beneficial interest in the land to move into the Forster No 1 Property Trust without touching the tripwire of [s44(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s44.html)
If there was no such change in the beneficial ownership of the land at step 6, the later dealings would have had nothing to do with the land.

Analysis 
If the principle of merger eclipsed step 6 from the view of equity, it would defeat the whole transaction intended by the parties. Equity may do nothing in vain. But neither does it work to defeat the lawful intentions of parties.
Here, those intentions required that equity perceive, recognise, declare and (in the event of breach, enforce) the sub-trust whereby CMPI held its legal interest in the land as nominee for the trustee (ISPT), with that trustee treating such interest in the land as a trust asset held on behalf of the unit holders from time to time. The terms of that sub-trust are spelled out in detail in the Trust Deed for the Forster No 1 Trust. If principles of merger and futility precluded the passing of a beneficial interest into the Forster
No 1 Trust at this stage, then that interest never became a trust asset. And the later issue and redemption of units were dealings in a Trust that owned nothing but interests in various cheques. And the Transfer of the land (step ) was anything but a mere change of trustees of the Forster No 1 Trust.

The doctrine of Walsh versus Lonsdale [(1882) 21 Ch D 9], whereby an agreement for sale or lease that is specifically enforceable will to that extent confer an equitable interest, does not require that the beneficiary seek and obtain the remedy. It is enough that a court can determine ex post that equitable relief could have been granted had it been sought at the earlier point of time. Cf McMahon versus Ambrose <case>; [[1987] VR 817.] Thus, in the usual vendor/purchaser situation the "trust" will arise and continue for purposes such as beneficial succession without specific performance first being decreed. "It is enough that at the time the beneficial ownership is alleged to have arisen or devolved equity would have decreed specific performance, without the remedy now being administered in the proceedings in which the question of beneficial ownership has become material" (Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity: Doctrines and Remedies, rd ed, 1992, §241. See also Brown versus Heffer <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 344] at 349.) 
In the passage from Corin that is set out above, Deane J states that "equity, with its regard for substance rather than form, would not go through the charade of intervening to create trusts of property under which the legal owner held as bare trustee for another who in turn held as bare trustee for the legal owner". In re Lachmar; Moody versus Penfold [[1891] 1 Ch ] at and the other authorities cited by Deane J demonstrate that the reference to a bare trustee is critical. Where there are active duties, equity will recognise a sub-trust whose beneficiary is the same as the legal owner. This is because the failure to do so would defeat the parties' intent that the sub- trust operate according to its terms, including the term that the nominated sub-trustee act as such. Thus, where A holds on trust for B who holds on trust for C, then B will not "disappear from the picture" (Grey versus Inland Revenue
Commissioners [[1958] Ch 375] at 382) if B's trust is active and not bare. See also at 715 per Lord Evershed MR.

It is of the essence of a trust that property is vested in the trustee.
Accordingly, where the subject matter of a trust is a beneficial interest in property - for that is the discrimen of a sub-trust - it must follow that the beneficial interest passes to the sub-trustee in order that it can be held by the sub-trustee for the benefit of the ultimate beneficiary. Another way of expressing this is to state that the effective vesting of a sub-trust depends upon the beneficial interest in property which is its subject matter to be vested in the sub-trustee. This is what distinguishes a duly created sub-trust from the appointment of a new trustee. See Scott on Trusts, 4th ed, 1984, §83 and the passages from Grey cited above.

Speaking in Corin in the context of a bare trust, Deane J said (at 579) that: the equitable rights of the beneficiary attach to the property at the instant of transfer and the transferee receives the property subject to the equitable obligations of a bare trustee for the transferor or the third party.

Having stated this proposition, his Honour went on to distinguish the situation of an active trust in explaining when equity would intervene to protect the interest of the intended beneficiary. This is the passage quoted above at p18 of my judgment. I have already endeavoured to explain why I consider this distinction to be critical. See also Pettit, Equity and the
Law of Trusts, 7th ed, 1993, pp93-4. In the present case the active nature of the sub-trust means that, of necessity, the equitable interest had to pass from CMPI to ISPT en route to being held on trust for the beneficiaries from time to time of the Forster No 1 Trust (CMPI, at the relevant time).

The nature of a "bare trust" remains a matter of continuing academic controversy. The presence of active duties of management has generally been regarded as the touchstone of the distinction between an active and a bare trust (Schalit versus Joseph Nadler Ltd [[1933] 2 KB 79] at 81-2;
Restatement of the Law of Trusts, 2nd ed, 1959, §69; Herdegen versus Federal
Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1988) 84 ALR 271] at 282). It is equally clear that some active duties, though not of management, are imposed on some, but not all, bare trustees ( Ford and
Lee, Principles of the Law of Trusts, 3rd ed, para [9780]). Meagher JA, referring to a bare trust, observed in Corumo Holdings Pty Ltd versus C Itoh
Ltd [(1991) 24 NSWLR 370] at 398 that "as a matter of strict logic, almost no situation can be postulated where a trustee cannot in some circumstances have active duties to perform".

In Christie versus Ovington [(1875) 1 Ch D 279] at 281,
Hall V-C expressed the opinion that a bare trustee is: a trustee to whose office no duties were originally attached, or who, although such duties were originally attached to his office, would, on the requisition of his cestuis que trust, be compellable in equity to convey the estate to them, or by their direction.

As to the latter part of this suggested definition, his Lordship rejected the proposition that the beneficiaries must have actually requested the trustee to transfer the estate. In other words, he equated a bare trustee with one who was presently amenable to a direction in accordance with the principles in
Saunders versus Vautier <case>;
Beav 115, [49 ER 282.] A contrary view was expressed by Jessel MR in Morgan v
Swansea Urban Sanitary Authority [(1878) 9 Ch D 582] at 585 when he said: if the tenant for life or the remainderman has not requested, how can the trustee be called a `bare trustee'? What the writers mean must, I think, be this: Where a trustee has active duties to perform, and the cestuis que trust are more than one and have not requested, then he is not a bare trustee; but if they are all competent and have requested, then he is, because he has then kept the estate, so to speak, by wrong; that is, upon request he ought to have conveyed, and he is thus a `bare trustee'.

I note that Hall V-C's view was preferred to that of Jessel MR in Re
Cunningham versus Frayling [[1891] 2 Ch 567] at 572, and that Ford and Lee loc cit regard Hall V-C's description as the more illuminating. Nevertheless, I have a clear preference for Jessel MR's position, because it is hard to think of any trust to which the principle in
Saunders versus Vautier is not potentially applicable. Fortunately, there is a discussion of the "modern" meaning of "bare trust" by Gummow J in
Herdegen at versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1988) 84 ALR 271] at 281-3. His Honour's reasoning (at 282) rejects, in terms, a definition of bare trust that would equate it with a trust terminable according to the principle in Saunders versus Vautier, in preference for a definition that equates active duties with duties expressly imposed by the settlor.

No charade of equitable intervention (cf Corin at 579) is involved in equity holding CMPI to its assumed role of nominee for ISPT as trustee of the
Forster No 1 Trust in relation to CMPI's interest in the land. As stated already, equitable recognition of that role is a vital step in bringing the land into the Trust. By accepting the role as nominee for ISPT on the basis that ISPT held as trustee for the unit trust, CMPI assumed a trusteeship whose terms were to be found spelled out in the Trust Deed. That was an active trust, despite the duties being exiguous (see IRC versus Silverts Ltd [[1951]
Ch 521] at
See generally Snell's Equity, 29th ed, 1990, p103; Herdegen).

The respondent relied upon the recent decision of the Queensland Court of
Appeal in Suncorp Insurance & Finance. The relevant provision discussed in that case (Stamp Act 1894 (Qld), s54 AB(2)) is distinguishable from Div 3A of the New South Wales Act, because the Queensland provision requires it to be shown that a transaction of the requisite type resulted in a person "obtaining" an estate or interest in real property in Queensland.
This was critical to the appellant's success in that case, because the Court concluded that the relevant step merely restricted the putative tax payer's absolute enjoyment of its property in consequence of its acceptance of the imposition upon it of a trust. By contrast the New South Wales provision is broader, with its reference to a transaction which "causes or results in a change" in beneficial ownership.

Accordingly, I hold that a change in beneficial interest in the land occurred at step 6 when CMPI received the agreed purchase price and accepted the role as nominee for ISPT. In order to effectuate the intentions of the parties, which was to bring the entire equitable interest in the land into the Forster
No 1 Trust, ISPT received the property subject to the equitable obligations of an active sub-trustee. An equitable interest is capable of being made the subject of a (sub) trust, and it is axiomatic that the creation of a trust creates an equitable estate (see Commissioner of Stamp Duties v
Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (Quigley's Case) <case>; [(1926) 38 CLR 272], discussed in DKLR Holding Co (No 2) Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties  <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 431).] This was a change in beneficial ownership sufficient to engage s44(1).

TWO ALTERNATIVE ARGUMENTS OF THE APPELLANT 
Two further propositions were advanced by the appellant.

ISPT's recoupment right as a beneficial interest 
It was submitted that ISPT's indemnity rights with respect to trust expenses properly incurred gave it a beneficial interest in the land. At the relevant stage, ISPT (through its nominee CMPI) held its interest in the land subject to the Trust Deed, and that Deed empowered the trustee to incur liabilities in relation thereto (see eg clauses 7.3(f) and 11) for which a right of recoupment existed in accordance with the principles discussed recently in
Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties versus Buckle <case>; [(1998) 72 ALJR 243] at 252-3. It was submitted by senior counsel for the appellant that the "priority in the further administration of the trust" (Buckle at 252) which such entitlement conferred on the trustee meant that ISPT received a beneficial interest at the outset.

One problem with this argument is that the value of such beneficial interest would have been much less than the whole value of the land. But there is a more fundamental misconception involved in the submission. A trustee's right of indemnity arises at the time when a liability is incurred, and it is at this stage that the lien over trust assets arises: see Custom Credit
Corporation Ltd versus Ravi Nominees Pty Ltd [(1992) 8 WAR 42] at 52-3 (and authorities cited). The reference in Buckle to "priority" simply means that, if termination of a trust is sought by all beneficiaries in accordance with the rule in Saunders versus Vautier, the trustee has (at that stage) a right in the nature of a lien for the recoupment of any trust expenses actually incurred at that point of time, such right being superior (prior) to that of the beneficiaries to receive the trust assets (see Vacuum Oil Co
Pty Ltd versus Wiltshire <case>; [(1945) 72 CLR 319] at 335, Octavo Investments Pty Ltd versus Knight <case>; [(1979) 144 CLR 360] at 369-70).

Right to injunction as equivalent of equitable interest 
In recent years the High Court has repeatedly emphasised that the type of specific performance of a contract capable of giving rise to the passing of an equitable interest extends beyond specific performance in its strict sense to relief by injunction or otherwise: see Chan at 252-3 (and authorities cited there). The appellant invoked this principle in support of an alternative argument that an equitable interest passed at step 5 (when the contract for sale was formed). The respondent argued that the High Court passages cannot be taken that far. In my view, it is unnecessary to grapple with the proposition, because the appellant can rely upon the clearer situation at step 6 when a trust arose consequent upon the receipt of the totality of the purchase price and CMPI's nomination. At this later point of time, specific performance in its strict sense would have been available if required, together with the range of equitable protection consequent upon recognition of a trust relationship stemming from the express acknowledgment that CMPI held the property as ISPT's nominee.

In each appeal the following orders should be made:
Appeal allowed.
Cross appeal dismissed.
Set aside orders made by Studdert J on 19 December 1997
In lieu thereof, dismiss summons with costs.
Respondent to pay appellant's costs of the appeal, and to have a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act if qualified.

FITZGERALD AJA: Coles Myer Property Investments Pty Ltd ("CMPI") formerly owned two shopping centres, one at Bondi Junction (the "Eastgate Shopping Centre") and the other at Forster (the "Forster Shopping Village"). Each shopping centre is now owned by ISPT Nominees Pty Ltd ("ISPT Nominees") as trustee of a unit trust. The transaction by which each change of ownership was effected involved a number of steps, which were materially identical in relation to each shopping centre. It is necessary to discuss only one of the two transactions, since each will be liable to the same stamp duty, if any. In conformity with the approach adopted by the President, I will discuss the transaction with respect to the Forster Shopping Village. It is unnecessary for me to repeat all the details contained in his Honour's reasons for judgment, although there are additional matters to which I find it necessary to refer. 
Broadly speaking, the Forster Shopping Village transaction involved the following steps, which were all taken on 27 January, 1995:
ISPT Coles Myer (Forster) Property Trust (No.1) (the "Forster No.1 Trust") was established by a deed executed by CMPI and ISPT Pty Ltd ("ISPT"). ISPT was appointed trustee of the Forster No.1 Trust.
CMPI applied for the issue of 17,973,996 units in the Forster No.1 Trust and provided ISPT as trustee of that trust with a cheque in the sum of $17,973,996. The units applied for were issued to CMPI. No other units in the
Forster No. 1 Trust had been issued at that time.
ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust made a written offer to CMPI to purchase the Forster Shopping Village for $17,973,995. The offer made provision for CMPI "... to hold the property as a nominee under the deed establishing the Trust for so long as CMPI remains the registered proprietor ...".
CMPI orally accepted the offer.
The cheque for $17,973,996 in favour of ISPT as trustee of the Forster No.
 Trust which CMPI had paid for its 17,973,976 units in that trust was then endorsed by ISPT in favour of CMPI and returned to it. An overpayment of $1.00 was returned to ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust.
ISPT as trustee of the Industries Superannuation Property Trust (the "ISPT
Trust") and ISPT Custodians Pty Ltd ("ISPT Custodians") as trustee of the ISPT
Coles Myer (Forster) Property Trust No. 2 (the "Forster No. 2 Trust") each applied for 8,986,998 units in the Forster No 1 Trust, and each paid for those units by a cheque for $8,986,998 in favour of ISPT as trustee of the Forster
No. 1 Trust. The units applied for were issued to each of ISPT as trustee of the ISPT Trust and ISPT Custodians as trustee of the Forster No. 2 Trust.
ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1. Trust redeemed the 17,973,996 units in that trust which had previously been issued to CMPI, and endorsed the two cheques, each for $8,986,998, which it had received from ISPT as trustee of the ISPT Trust and ISPT Custodians as trustee of the Forster No. 2 Trust in favour of CMPI.
CMPI resigned as the "nominee" of ISPT under the Forster No. 1 Trust, and was replaced as "nominee" by ISPT Nominees.
The Forster Shopping Village was transferred by CMPI to ISPT Nominees as the "nominee" of ISPT under the Forster No. 1 Trust. The stated consideration for the transfer was "nil".

In summary, the effect of the transaction was to transfer the legal title to the Forster Shopping Village to ISPT Nominees, and beneficial ownership of the property to a party other than CMPI, which no longer has any estate or interest, legal or equitable (beneficial) in the property.

It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss the Joint Venture Agreement entered into on 28 November 1994 or the Supplementary Agreement entered into on 27 January 1995. The dutiability of those documents is not in issue in this proceeding, nor is the dutiability of any document by which the transaction was effected. The contention of the appellant, the Chief Commissioner of Stamp
Duties, is that ISPT was required by subs44A(1) of the [Stamp Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/) to lodge a statement in the approved form, which, by subs44A(5) of the Act, would be deemed to be an instrument effecting the transaction and chargeable with ad valorem conveyance duty on the value of the Forster Shopping Village, which has been accepted as $17,973,995. In the absence of such a statement, the Commissioner issued an assessment to ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1
Trust in reliance on s127B of the Act.

ISPT objected to the assessment and, when the Commissioner disallowed its objection, appealed to the Administrative Law Division. The primary judge made orders setting aside the disallowance of ISPT's objection and allowing that objection. The Commissioner appealed to this Court, and ISPT cross-appealed, contending that the primary judge should also have declared that ISPT is not obliged to lodge a statement under Div3A of Part 3 of the Act.

That is the only part of the Act relied on by the Commissioner, and ISPT is the only party which the Commissioner contends should have lodged a statement and is liable for ad valorem conveyance duty on the value of the Forster
Shopping Village. It is convenient merely to note at this point that, if the
Commissioner is correct, some care might be needed in defining the transaction to which the statement must relate.

One other point should also be noted. ISPT has been assessed in its capacity as trustee of the Forster No.1 Trust. While that might be appropriate if the assessment related to an instrument effecting or evidencing a purchase of the
Forster Shopping Village by ISPT as trustee of that trust, or a conveyance of that property to ISPT in that capacity, Div3A of Part 3 of the Act is materially concerned only with "... a change in the beneficial ownership of an estate or interest in ... land situated in NSW". The Commissioner's argument is dependent upon ISPT's "beneficial ownership" of the Forster Shopping
Village.

Clearly, the overall transaction "... [caused] or [resulted] in a change in the beneficial ownership of an estate or interest in ... land situated in NSW" which was not effected or evidenced by an instrument chargeable with ad valorem duty under a material heading in the Second Schedule to the Act, so that Div3A of Part 3 applies.[1] If beneficial ownership of the Forster
Shopping Village has been transferred to the unitholders in the ISPT Trust and unitholders in the Forster No.2 Trust,[2] the Commissioner does not dispute that those beneficial estates or interests in the property were obtained "as the consequence of ... the issue or redemption of units in a unit trust scheme", so that ad valorem conveyance duty is not payable in respect of that element of the transaction.[3] 
The foci of the Commissioner's argument are the agreement, partly written and partly oral, for the sale of the Forster Shopping Village by CMPI to ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust, and ISPT's payment, as trustee, of the purchase price to CMPI. According to the Commissioner, the beneficial ownership of the property passed by that transaction, from CMPI to ISPT, notwithstanding that ISPT was acting only in its capacity of Trustee of the
Forster No. 1 Trust and that the sole unitholder in that trust was CMPI. It merits emphasis that, since the Commissioner has assessed ad valorem conveyance duty on the full value of the Forster Village, his argument involves the proposition that, although acting in its capacity of trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust, ISPT became full beneficial owner of the property by virtue of the identified transaction. It should also be noted that, unless the change in unitholders in the Forster No. 1 Trust from CMPI to the ISPT
Trust and the Forster No. 2 Trust altered the position, on the Commissioner's argument ISPT as the trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust is still the full beneficial owner of the Forster Shopping Village.

The argument in this Court involved considerable debate concerning CMPI's dual roles at the material time; i.e., as the holder of the legal title to the
Forster Shopping Village as "nominee" of ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1
Trust and as holder of all the issued units in the Forster No. 1 Trust. It is well-established that the owner of land does not have separate legal and beneficial interests or estates.[4] However, it is convenient to put this point to one side for the moment, and to consider a hypothetical transaction in which a stranger was the holder of all the issued units in the Foster No. 1
Trust at the time of the material contract of sale and purchase of the Forster
Shopping Village and the payment of the purchase price.

There is no reason to doubt that, in the circumstances postulated, CMPI's estate or interest in the property would have been reduced to the legal estate.[5] What requires determination is whether ISPT as trustee of the
Forster No. 1 Trust for the sole unitholder in that Trust would have obtained the beneficial ownership of the property by the sale, purchase and payment of the purchase price.

The issue of beneficial ownership between trustee and sole unitholder of the
Forster No. 1 Trust must depend primarily, at least, on the terms of the deed for that trust.[6] The question whether, although not a unitholder of the
Forster No. 1 Trust, ISPT was, at least at the material time, the beneficial owner of the Forster Shopping Village is not answered by a conclusion that
ISPT as trustee for the Forster No. 1 Trust could have successfully sued
CMPI for specific performance of the contract of sale and purchase or other equitable relief notwithstanding [s23C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) . I do not understand the Commissioner to dispute that, when a trustee of an "ordinary" trust estate in which the beneficial interest is vested in an identified beneficiary is entitled to specific performance against a third party, the beneficiary, not the trustee, is entitled to beneficial ownership of the property to which specific performance is applicable, notwithstanding that the trustee, in that capacity, can invoke the aid of equity to protect the trust and its assets. It will be necessary to refer later to the
Commissioner's proposition that, nonetheless, in such circumstances the beneficiary's equitable interest or estate is derived through the trustee who, for an instant, has the beneficial interest in the property.

The primary judge, whose judgment is reported,[7] set out a number of provisions in the trust deed for the Forster No. 1 Trust in his judgment. It is sufficient for my purposes to note or summarise only some of the clauses to which his Honour referred.

The trust deed provides for the assets of the Forster No. 1 Trust to constitute a "Fund". So far as presently material, clauses 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 provide: "3.1 The beneficial interest in the Fund ... is divided into equal units.
 .2 A unit shall not confer any interest in any particular investment, asset, property or cash comprising the assets of the Trust, but only a beneficial interest in the Fund as a whole. Each Unit of the same class shall confer on the unit holder an equal entitlement and be of equal value at all times ...
 .5 Except as provided in this deed or as agreed between all Unit Holders, a
Unit Holder may not: interfere with or question the rights, powers, authority or discretion of ... or the Trustee under this deed; ...
 ...
 require that any part of the Fund be transferred to Unit Holders ..."(Emphasis added).

By [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p7) of the trust deed, 90% of unitholders can set any date for the vesting of the
Fund, but, by [Parts ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p7) and [22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p22), the trustee is entitled to an indemnity in respect of specified costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages and liabilities, and to retain from the
Fund the amount to which it is entitled under its indemnities. (Emphasis added). The Commissioner did not dispute the primary judge's conclusions that no event giving rise to an entitlement under the indemnities had arisen, so that ISPT's indemnity rights had not been activated.[8] In any event, any rights ISPT as trustee of the Forster Shopping Village No. 1 Trust has in respect of the Forster Shopping Village under the trust deed or the general law plainly do not constitute full beneficial ownership of that property, which is the sole basis upon which the Commissioner's assessment is founded.

As I stated in Suncorp,[9] in accordance with authorities there cited,[10] a unitholder in a unit trust commonly has an interest in the trust property and its constituent parts. It is unnecessary to consider that general proposition further in this matter. It is also unnecessary to consider the usual effect of a provision such as clause 3.2. Consistently with the opinion which I expressed in Suncorp with respect to the broadly comparable trust deeds there under consideration, I am of opinion that the trust deed of the Forster
No.1 Trust entitles a sole unitholder to the full beneficial ownership of the trust fund and its constituent assets, subject only to any rights of the trustee with respect to those assets at the particular time. It follows, of course, that ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust would not ordinarily be the beneficial owner of the Forster Shopping Village when there is only one unitholder, and would have no estate or beneficial interest in the Fund or the assets comprising the Fund beyond any estate or interest derived from rights as trustee under the trust deed or the general law.[11] The matter can be emphasised by pointing out that a sole unitholder could direct the trustee not to require a conveyance, to appoint another nominee and perhaps to resign as trustee in favour of another, and could set an immediate vesting date and require a conveyance of the property to itself. The trustee's rights under the deed for the Forster No. 1 Trust are substantially under the effective control of a sole unitholder.

The Commissioner did not provide authority to support his proposition that a sole beneficiary of a trust which is entitled to specific performance of a contract to purchase property derives beneficial ownership of the property through the trustee in the sense that, for an instant, beneficial ownership is vested in the trustee as it passes from vendor to beneficiary. It is convenient to return from the hypothetical situation of a unit trust in which the sole unitholder is a different person from the vendor of the property to the present case in which CMPI occupied both roles, since it then becomes unnecessary to decide whether or not the Commissioner's submission might be correct in other circumstances.

The beneficial estate or interest in the Forster Shopping Village which passed to ISPT was the concatenation of rights, enforceable in equity against CMPI both as vendor and sole unitholder, which ISPT obtained in respect of the property under the contract of sale and purchase and the trust deed with respect to the Forster No.1. Trust. Nothing else passed to ISPT, or to or from
CMPI.[12] It was unnecessary for that to occur.[13] 
Such a conclusion does not deny that the Forster Shopping Village became an asset of the Forster No. 1 Trust. However, that was not because there was "a change in the beneficial ownership of an estate or interest in" the property whether the meaning of Div3A of Part 3 of the Act, which is materially concerned with a change which involves different persons beneficially owning an estate or interest before and after the relevant transaction.

If what is stated to this point is correct, it does not matter whether, at the next stage, when the ISPT Trust and the Forster No. 2 Trust acquired units,
ISPT as trustee of the Forster No. 1 Trust or the unitholders in that trust became beneficial owners of the Forster Shopping Village. Whatever occurred to that point was "the consequence of .. the issue or redemption of units in a unit trust scheme".[14] 
I am accordingly of opinion that the appeals should be dismissed with costs.
The Commissioner did not dispute that, in these circumstances, the cross- appeal should be allowed with costs, and I would so order.

MEAGHER JA: I have read the draft judgments of the President and of Fitzgerald AJA. I agree with the latter. 
The facts are set out in both judgments. The crucial events are those which took place at steps (5) and (6) in the President's list of events. They can be further simplified as follows: the owner at law of the freehold was CMPI (I use the President's abbreviations); ISPT made an offer to purchase the land from CMPI for a nominated figure; CMPI orally accepted that offer. ISPT paid the full purchase price to CMPI. However, ISPT made its offer as trustee for a unit trust, all units in which were held by CMPI. Could that transaction result in a transfer of the beneficial interest in the land from CMPI to ISPT, as the appellant alleges? 
I must confess I am quite unable to see how it could. The legal estate resided in CMPI both before and after steps (5) and (6). Either [ss
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) and [54A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), applied to nullify the ordinary effect of those two steps, or they did not. If they did, the beneficial interest remained with CMPI. If they did not, the beneficial interest also remained in CMPI, in its capacity as sole unit holder in ISPT. In neither event is there any change of beneficial interest. On this basis the appellant's submission must fail.

However, argument ranged far and wide and there are some aspects of that argument, to which I will refer. One concerns a famous footnote to Sir
Frederick Jordan's "Chapters in Equity" (Sixth edition, p.52, footnote (e).)
The text to which the footnote refers is, relevantly, as follows: "An agreement for valuable consideration for the present assignment of any property whatsoever (assuming it to be assignable at all) operates in equity to transfer the equitable title to the property from the promisor to the promisee. This result is to be ascribed to the maxim that equity considers done that which ought to be done; and the principle is effective only in so far as the Court of Equity would, in all the circumstances of the case, grant specific performance of the agreement." To this text is appended a footnote, which, relevantly, reads as follows: "Specific performance in this sense means not merely specific performance in the primary sense of the enforcing of an executory contract by compelling the execution of an assurance to complete it, but also the protection by injunction or otherwise of rights acquired under a contract which defines the rights of the parties." As far as the statement of law contained in the text is concerned, it conforms with classic statements of the position, and in particular with that of the Lord Westbury L.C in Holroyd v Marshall <case>; [(1862) 10 HLC 191.] However, the width of its language is no longer defensible: it can hardly be accurate, for example, with regard to the transfer of purely equitable property because if the entire beneficial interest goes when agreement is reached, nothing would remain in the vendor's hands even if no purchase money had been paid; that much emerges from Oughtred versus IRC <case>; [[1960]
AC 206.] To render it precise, some careful narrowing of its language is required.
However, the footnote widens, not narrows, its scope. Great as is the homage we all owe to Sir Frederick Jordan, one must state that the footnote is nonsense. It has, of course, been approved by the High Court on about four occasions: Hewett versus Court <case>; [(1983) 149 CLR 639], Legione versus Hateley <case>; [(1983) 152 CLR 406], Stern versus McArthur <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 489], Chan versus Cresdon Proprietary Limited <case>; [(1989) 168 CLR 242], ; but that does not convert it into sense. (Incidentally, it has been accorded a chillier welcome by Gummow J, writing extrajudicially:
The Equity of Sir Frederick Jordan [[1991] SydLawRw ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/SydLawRw/1991/22.html "View Case" ); [(1991) 13 SydLR 263).] In its expanded form it means that a contract of sale of land to which a Minister's consent is required would effect a total assignment of the beneficial interest in the land, a proposition which Egan versus Ross <case>; [(1928) 29 SR 382];
Butts versus O'Dwyer <case>; [(1952) 87 CLR 267]; McWilliam versus McWilliam's Wines Pty Ltd <case>; [(1964) 114 CLR 656]; Booker Industries Pty Limited versus Wilson Parking (QLD) Pty
Ltd <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 600]; Bahr v
Nicolay (no 2) <case>; <case>; [(1966) 116 CLR 340] at 351: "While the question whether the Minister would consent was still pending, the testator or his executor was not at liberty to enter into any transaction inconsistent with an obligation to perform his contract with the purchaser. The purchaser's rights to have the testator and his executor do nothing to his prejudice were enforceable in equity by injunction. But they did not create an equitable interest in the land." 
At stages during the course of argument, a derivative proposition was advanced, viz. that if one were, actually or potentially, entitled in equity to any form of remedy in relation to an asset, one had, by virtue of that fact, an equitable interest in that asset. This cannot be correct. In
Commissioners of Stamp Duty versus Livingston <case>; [[1965] AC ] the
Privy Council held that a residuary beneficiary had no proprietary interest in the residue of the estate, despite being entitled to limited equitable rights with regard to that residue. Similarly, a beneficiary in a discretionary trust has no interest in the trust assets, although possessing limited equitable rights against the trustee; Gartside versus IAC <case>; [[1968] AC ], even if he be the only beneficiary: Re Weir's Settlement Trusts [[1971] Ch .] In
The Queen versus Toohey & Anor; ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited <case>; [(1883) 158 CLR 327] at 342, Mason J said: "No one who has a merely personal right in relation to land can be said to have an "estate or interest" in that land." 
Another proposition which was advanced by the appellant was that when a trustee acquires land for his trust, there is a moment, a nanosecond, when the beneficial interest in the land belongs to the trustee and not his beneficiary. Not surprisingly, no authority was quoted in favour of so farouche a proposition.

I agree with Fitzgerald AJA that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
