ACTING MASTER BERECRY  February 2005  of 2003 Michael Charles MURPHY versus Karin ELLIS (Plaintiff)  
SUMMARY OF ADVICE 
Whether the trust created by the will entitles the beneficiaries to their respective proportionate shares of capital or whether it is only a trust for the payment of income: 
Opinion: The trust is only a trust for the payment of income.  
Whether the trust is, in whole or part, a trust for payment of income in perpetuity: 
Opinion: Except in relation to the plaintiff, the trust is for the payment of income in perpetuity.  
Whether the trust fails, in whole or in part, because it is a trust for payment of income in perpetuity or by reason of the rule against accumulation of income: 
Opinion: On the death of the plaintiff the income payable to the plaintiff impinges against accumulations. In respect of Messrs Zundel and Irving the terms of the will impinge the rule against perpetuity.  
Whether the trust, in whole or in part, constitutes a valid gift for charitable purposes:  
Opinion: The trust fails in respect of the National Anti-Vivisection Society Limited, the Adelaide Institute and the Institute of Historical Review. The plaintiff is directed to tender further material concerning the purpose of the World League for the Protection of Animals by 30 March,2005.  
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to distribute the proportionate shares of the capital of the rust to any or all of the beneficiaries:  immediately; or  if those beneficiaries whose trusts succeed agree: 
Opinion: Subject to question (vi), the plaintiff is entitled to distribute a proportional share of the capital of the trust to the beneficiaries whose trust succeeds if they agree.

Opinion: It is not necessary to join any other party to these proceedings.  
JUDGMENT  CORAM: On 10 December 2003 the plaintiff filed a summons seeking judicial advice pursuant to section 63 of the [Trustee
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), 1925, in respect of the trust created by the will of the late Michael Charles Murphy (the deceased). The plaintiff is the executrix of the deceased's estate.  The deceased died on 7 October 2002 and probate was granted on 28 August of his will (28 August 2002) and codicil (3 October 2002). The plaintiff is the deceased's sister the other executrix, Kerry Morrissey, renounced probate. The deceased married Rosemary Lynne Heritage on 9 December 1995. That marriage ended in divorce. The deceased was not in any relationship at the date of death and had no children. He was survived by the plaintiff and his father Charles Alexander Murphy. His mother predeceased him on 21 August 1998.
The deceased left property in New South Wales and Queensland. Apart from the
Queensland property the assets of the estate have been realised and are approximately $560,000. The deceased drafted his will. There are a number of problems with the document. However, the application is concerned only with the trust created by the will.  The trust was created to continue the work of the deceased. It is to be administered by trustees, one of whom is the executrix, the plaintiff. A trust account and investment fund are to be created. Into the trust account are to be paid cash funds from his accounts, superannuation and profits and royalties. Provision is then made for any of the estate's debts and running costs out of the trust and its assets.  The bulk of accumulated funds were to be used to restore the deceased's property at Annandale. This property was to be used as an investment property with the rents forming part of the investment fund. The estates real property was to be owned and administered by the trust. Because it was not economically viable the Annandale property was sold. Directions were made concerning how the investment funds were to be invested. There are eight beneficiaries of the trust namely:-  The plaintiff,  The National Anti-Vivisection Society Limited,  World League for the Protection Animals  Ernst Zundel  David Irving  Adelaide Institute  Institute of Historical Review and  Egypt Exploration Society.  The will provides as follows in relation to the funds profits  "Portion of the investment fund profits (100%) is to be distributed as a proportion. Karin Ellis is to receive 40%. The rest of the beneficiaries listed to receive 8.57%."  In respect of Karin Ellis further provision was in the following terms:  "When deceased this portion returns to the trust's account."  The will identifies the source from which the trust account is to be made up.  It is Commonwealth Bank account, Super Funds and Investments..  In construing the terms of the will, the structure of which purports to reveal the scheme, the court must first, if it is possible, ascertain what is the basic scheme which the deceased had conceived for dealing with his estate, and then construe the will so as, if possible, to give effect to the scheme: see Perpetual Trustees versus Wright & Ors [(1989) 9 NSWLR 18] at 32C -
B per Bryson J.  The following paragraphs of the will set out the scheme intended by the deceased.  .1 Introduction 
In December, 2001 I was informed that I had terminal cancer, and if I succumb, then I had been prematurely preventing from completing the many projects that had occupied most of my life.  .2 During the shortness of time I've tried to compose a Will which maintained my intentions. It would have been a simple matter to disperse my worldly goods to those close kin and loved ones, but my perspective has always been the long term, and as such I hope to benefit them by adopting a strategy which invests my capital to generate profits.  .3 Such a strategy may disappoint some, perhaps expecting a direct legacy or that they are not named. These omissions are not meant to be construed as a personal rebuff, but my strategy choice was made under very difficult circumstances, and ask them for their patience and understanding.  From these paragraphs the scheme of the deceased has devised it to enable his projects to be completed and to invest his capital so that from any profits received the beneficiaries will receive long-term benefits.  Under the heading "The Trust" he reaffirmed the above in the following manner.  "My wish is create a trust which in essence continues my work even though I am no longer living, with the objective of fulfilling the long-term goals that were always intended to benefit others."  It was the deceased testamentary intention that all income derived from whatever source was to be paid into the fund and the income from the corpus of that fund was to be distributed to the beneficiaries in proportions set out in the will namely the plaintiff to receive 40% of the fund profits the rest of the beneficiaries to receive 8.75%. This does not amount to 100% of the fund profits and their needs to be an adjustment of .01%. This adjustment should form part of the residue of the estate.  There is no clause in the will dealing with residue. On intestacy or partial intestacy the father of the deceased takes pursuant (section 61B) the
Wills [Probate and Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/) of The plaintiff seeks an opinion advice and direction in respect to a number of questions put to the court. The first question is as follows:  Whether the trust created by the will entitled the beneficiaries to their respective proportionate shares of capital or whether it is only a trust for the payment of income.  Whether a gift of the produce of the fund amounts to a gift of the capital is a question of intention of the disposer. It is not a rule of law, rather a rule of construction. The rule is the same whether the gift is to an individual or a charity. The beneficiary is entitled to capital unless there is a clear intention expressed or applied from the will that the beneficiary is not to take more than the income. See Congregational Union of NSW v
Thistlethwayte <case>; [(1952) 87 CLR 375] at 438 - 440.  Facts that might be taken into consideration are also to be found in Re
Inman <case>; [[1965] VR 238] at 240. A number of other decisions have also considered the question of what factors are relevant for the purposes of determining this matter. Matters that the court might take into account is the character of the institution or body to which the gift is made, whether there is to be taking of account at annual intervals, whether there are directions as to the form of investments, whether there are conditions regarding the seat of income, the payments made out of net income after payments of costs of administering the fund and directions to trustees regarding the manner of investment in certain events.  It is well established as a rule of construction that a special gift of income from real or personal property carries with it an absolute interest in the capital of the fund to which the person is entitled to call for Re
Denhert  <case>; [[1973] VR 449] at 450 per Starke J. Three of the eight beneficiaries are persons the remaining five are organisations with either a stated purpose or no stated purpose.  In determining whether the deceased intended that the capital as well as the income was to be given to the beneficiaries it is necessary to look at the will. By applying the above authorities to the deceased's will the following matters emerge. Firstly, the significance of the introductory clauses of the will 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 setting out the scheme. Secondly, the provisions regarding the objects and operations of the trust under the headings "The Trust," in "The Trust Account" and "The Investment Fund" on pages 5 and 6 of the will.
Thirdly, the reference to distribution of any portion of the investment fund profits see page 6. Fourthly, reinvestment of the proceeds of sale of the
Milne Road property after the death of the father of the deceased (page 9).
Fifthly, provisions regarding the trust generating income on the unpublished works and photographs of the deceased and sixthly at no point in the will does the deceased appear to contemplate the termination of the trust.  Taking the above matters into consideration I am of the opinion that the trust is only a trust for payment of income.  The second matter the plaintiff seeks advice on is:  Whether the trust is, in the whole or in part, a trust for the payment of income in perpetuity.  In respect of the plaintiff the will provides at page six that she is receive 40% of the fund profits. When she dies this portion returns to the trust account. As it is income she receives, it cannot be returned to the trust. Therefore, the qualifying words "when deceased this portion returned to the trust account", can only mean that the 40% of the profit hitherto received by the plaintiff will remain with the fund and become part of the corpus. That is there will an accumulation of income which is not payable to any of the other beneficiaries.  It should be noted that the will makes no provision for any residue of the estate. Whilst the plaintiff's gift is for her lifetime the position of Messrs
Zundel and Irving is different. The will places no temporal limit on the payment of income to each of them. Coupled with the fact that it was not the deceased's intention to give corpus to the beneficiaries, the income will be paid to their estate upon their death as such the payment is characterised as one in perpetuity.  Similarly payment of income to each of the organisations is a payment in perpetuity. Therefore, except in relation to the plaintiff, the trust is for the payment of income in perpetuity.  Next matter requiring answer is as follows:  Whether the trust fails, in whole or in part, because it is a trust for payment of income in perpetuity or by reason of the law that relates to the accumulation of income.  
In determining this question it is necessary to consider the [Perpetuities
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pa1984172/), 1984.  The perpetuity period. 
For the purpose of the rule against perpetuities, the perpetuity period the principal to an interest created by settlement shall be eighty years from the date in which the settlement takes effect.  
When an appointment of an interest is made under a special power of appointment, the perpetuity period shall be reckoned from the date in which the settlement creating the power takes effect.  Accumulation of income.  
Where property is disposed of in such a manner that the income of a property may be or is directed to be accumulated wholly or in part, the power or direction to accumulate that income is valid if the disposition of the accumulated income is, or may be valid, but not otherwise.  
This section does not affect the power of the person to terminate an accumulation that is for the person's benefit, or any jurisdiction or power of the court to maintain or advance out of accumulations, or any power of a trustee under the Trustees Act 1925, or under any other Act of law or under any settlement.  There is no provision in the will which either ends the trust or makes provision for any residue of the estate. Therefore, the income which might accumulate after the death of the plaintiff will continue to accumulate without limitation. It follows that it, therefore, breaches the rule against accumulations. The question whether there is a valid power or direction to accumulate the income. There is no provision in the will which deals with the plaintiff's entitlement once she dies. Thus there is not a valid power for the option to accumulate income and no disposition of the accumulated income. The will is silent on both matters. The result is that by reason of the rule against accumulations of income the trust fails in respect of that part.  In respect of Messrs Zundel and Irving the terms of the will impinge the rule against perpetuities - see paragraph 23 above. Therefore, the will fails in respect of the provision for Messrs Zundel and Irving.  The next matter raised by the plaintiff is:  Whether the trust, in whole or in part, constitutes a valid gift for charitable purposes.  To constitute a valid gift the trust must fall into one of four categories namely:  For the relief of the poor, aged or impotent;  Educational purposes;  Religious purposes;  Other purposes beneficial to the community not falling under any of the other heads.  The court may recognise a general charitable intention if the gifts be made for the purposes, of an institution that has as its purposes predominately charitable purposes see Attorney General versus Perpetual Trustee
Company Limited <case>; [(1940) 63 CLR 209] at 222. The Public Trustee versus The Attorney General [(1997) 42 NSWLR 600] at 602, Santow J considered section 23 of the [Charitable Trusts
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cta1993201/)
His Honour said that it is necessary that the court be able to sever non- charitable objects for charitable objects in order to apply the section.
If after severing the non-charitable and invalid purposes what remains permits an application for charitable purposes is one way of completely satisfying the cash testator's presumed intention, the trust will be valid.  In the present matter there are five organisations who are included as beneficiaries of the trust. In order to determine whether there has been a valid gift for a charitable purpose it is necessary to consider the purpose of each organisation.  
National Anti-Vivisection Society  In Inland Revenue Commissioners versus National Anti-Vivisection Society [(1946) 1 KB 185] and in National Anti-Vivisection Society versus Inland
Revenue Commissioners <case>; [(1948) AC ] it was held that the question of public benefit is one of fact which the court must of itself determine and on the facts it was held that the primary purpose of the society was to obtain a change in the law and that this purpose was not charitable.  Enclosed with the plaintiff's statement of facts was material obtained from the National Anti-Vivisection Society's website. Its objects have not changed since the two cases referred to above. The position therefore, is that, a gift to the Society fails.  
Royal League for the Protection of Animals.  The deceased directed that the gift to this organisation should go towards cat welfare. In Re Wedgwood [(1915) 1 Ch 113] at 122
Swinfen Eady LJ said that a gift for the protection or benefit of animals, irrespective of whether or not they are useful to man, is prima facie, a charitable gift and because  "It tends to, inter alia, promote kindness towards them ...... thus elevate the human race."  (See also Re Moss <case>; [[1965] VR 238] at 242)  Material has been provided in the plaintiff's statement of facts from the
Royal League's website. The material states the League is committed to promoting the well-being and rights of all animals throughout the world both native and non-native. It also indicates that it receives no government subsidies and is staffed primarily by volunteers. However, from this material it is difficult to ascertain whether the predominant purpose of the league is charitable in nature. It may well be that the League also conducts a campaign of a political nature to influence governments in respect of certain aspects of animal rights. In the absence of further material I am not in a position to make a finding in respect of the League. To that end I direct the plaintiff to provide further material in relation to the purposes and operations of the
League.  
Adelaide Institute  The evidence suggests that this organisation does not fall within any of the four categories for a charitable trust. In the words of the founder it is a one-man crusade sponsoring a revisionist view of the holocaust. It does not have any community benefit nor could it be regarded as having as its purpose a bona fide educational purpose.  The gift fails because the purpose of the institute is either political or propaganda. In Tudor on trusts, 9th edition, the learned author says at 2.020 .... Whilst 'educating' has consistently been given a wide meaning, a gift to increase the sum of knowledge available without provision for propagating it has been said not to be charitable. (Re Shaw [(1957) 1 WLR ).]
A useful summary of the distinction is made by Iacobucci J in Vancouver
Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women versus Minister of National
Revenue [(1999) 169 DLR (4th) 34] at 113:  he threshold criterion for an educational activity must be some legitimate targeted attempt at educating others, whether through formal or informal instruction, training, plans of self-study or otherwise. Simply providing an opportunity for people to educate themselves, such as by making available materials with which this might be accomplished but need not be, is not enough.  .......... Secondly, the purpose must not be propagandist. The public must be presented with neutral information so that they can choose for themselves:
Re Bushnell (Deceased) [(1975) 1 All ER 721] at 729 per Golding J and cannot be presented with slanted and selective information in support of a pre-conceived point of view.  Therefore, the gift fails as it is clear that the purposes of the institute are neither educational nor beneficial to the community.  
Institute of Historical Review  The purpose of the institute is stated as being for the promotion of public awareness of key chapters of 20th century history that has social-political relevance today. This is achieved by publishing material and conducting seminars. However, the material accompanying the plaintiff's statement the facts revealed that the institute promotes a revisionist view of history in particular of the holocaust and appears to have a fixation towards Jews and
Jewish organisations.  The purpose of the institute is purely propaganda or a revisionist view of history held by its members. The material published by the institute lacks objectivity for neutrality. In Re Hopkins (Deceased) [(1949) 1 All ER ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281949%29%201%20All%20ER%20346 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 350, 352 Vasey J noted that  ".....political propaganda masquerading... as education is not education as defined for charitable purposes ..... the testators object was, not education in the proper sense of that word, but the furtherance of his political view and the better equipping of those who make it their business to further them."  
Clearly the trust fails in respect of the Institute.  
Egypt Exploration Society  The purpose of the Society appears to be to explore archaeological sites, provide online database for scholars and provide library facilities to the public and conduct seminars. Society purports to be registered as a charity.
However there is no evidence one way or the other concerning its purported registration. The promotion of archaeology has been held to be a charitable purpose: see Yates versus University of London [(1873) LR 8 Ch 454.]
Therefore, the trust in respect of the Society is valid.  
Conclusion  The trust, in part, constitutes a valid gift for charitable purposes. It fails in respect of the following beneficiaries.  National Anti-Vivisection Society Limited.  The Adelaide Institute.  The Institute of Historical Review.  
In relation to the World League for the Protection of Animals I direct that the plaintiff furnish more information concerning the purpose object of the
League.  The next matter raised by the plaintiff is:  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to distribute the proportionate shares of the capital of the trust to any or all of the beneficiaries:  immediately; or  if those beneficiaries whose trust succeed agree. 
In Re Inman <case>; [[1965] VR 238] the court was requested to determine in whether one of a number of the charitable gifts failed and if so whether the lapsed gift would go to the next of kin or to the remaining charities. At 248 Gowans J said:  "The result so far, with respect to the trust of the net annual income, is that two of the parts have been disposed of to a charitable institution - and a third purported to be disposed of to a non-charitable body - and non- charitable person and purpose. It has not been suggested that section 131 of the Property Law Act operates on this situation. But even if sub- section 1 were applicable, the result of sub-section 2 would merely be that the trust would be construed and given effect to in the same manner and in all respects as if no application of the trust fund or any part thereof to or for a non-charitable and invalid purpose had been directed or allowed. Having regard to the initial divisions of ten parts and the disposal of only one such part to each of the charitable institutions, the result of applying the sub- section would not increase the quantum of the share going to each charitable institution, and would leave a share purported to be given to the non- charitable body and disposed of. It would, therefore, go to the next of kin.
It is a share only of the net annual income of the trust fund to arise in perpetuity. But I think the only way to deal with the matter is to regard the next of kin as entitled to a tenth part of the corpus, and the remaining nine- tenths being held to produce an income to be divided between equal parts."  Section 131 of the Property Law Act 1948 (Vic) is in similar terms to section 23 of the [Charitable Trusts
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cta1993201/) 1993 . In my opinion the manner in which Gowans J applied the corpus is in all the circumstances the appropriate way in which to deal with the corpus in the deceased's estate. Namely, that those gifts that fail either because they infringe the rule against accumulations, the rule against perpetuities or were not for charitable purposes then the corpus together with any accumulated income forms part of the deceased's residual estate. As there is a partial intestacy the relevant provisions of the Wills Probate Administration
Act 1898, apply.  Subject to the opinion in respect of question 6 the plaintiff is entitled to distribute a proportionate share of the capital of the trust to the beneficiaries whose trust succeeds if they agree.  The next matter raised by the plaintiff is:  Whether, in the event that some or all of the trust fail, the plaintiff should: 
Distribute the capital shares of the failed trust to the father of the deceased; or  
Should do so only after providing notice to the beneficiaries of the failed trusts pursuant to section 63(8) of the Trustee Act 1925 and subject to those beneficiaries not making application to the court under [section (10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/).  
The plaintiff should only distribute the capital shares of the failed trusts to the father after notice is given to the beneficiaries of the failed trust pursuant to [section (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) 1925.
The time for an application under section 63(10) of the Act shall be in accordance with Part 70 rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules. Notice should be given to the Royal League for the Protection of Animals and the direction made in paragraph 35 above to be complied with by 30 March 2005  The last matter raised by the plaintiffs:  Whether any party should be joined to these proceedings.  
In the circumstances it is not necessary to join any other party to these proceedings.  In respect of costs of the application the plaintiff's costs should be paid out of the estate on the indemnity basis.  Liberty to the plaintiff to mention the proceedings on 14 days notice.
