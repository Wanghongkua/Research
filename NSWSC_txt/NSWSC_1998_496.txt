DASS versus CORPORATE INSURANCE MANAGEMENT GROUP PTY LIMITED & ANOR /97 July 1998 
Master Malpass 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
MASTER: The plaintiff was the owner of an aircraft. It crashed on or about 28 May 1996. 
These proceedings were commenced in 1997. The process propounds a claim for damages. The causes of action are as pleaded in the Amended Statement of
Claim.

The first defendant is an insurance broker. The second defendant is an insurer. The plaintiff claims that a contract of insurance was entered into in respect of the aircraft. There has been a refusal to indemnify the plaintiff.

The proceedings became subject to Differential Case Management. The parties were ordered to give discovery by serving a verified list of documents on or before 30 September 1997. The second defendant prepared a List of Documents.
Privilege was claimed, inter alia, in respect of the following:- "64 4 June 1996 Memorandum from D Hooper to J Fraser.
 4 June 1996 Memorandum from D Hooper to J Poulton.
 20 June 1996 Two file notes of meeting on 20 June 1996" 
The proceedings came before Registrar Irwin. He was asked to determine the question of the claim for privilege. He delivered a written decision on 30
March 1998. It appears that he decided that the claim for privilege was not made out in respect of documents 64 and 65. He ordered that those documents be made available for inspection.

On 29 April 1998, a Notice of Motion was filed on behalf of the second defendant. It seeks, inter alia, a review of the decision made by the
Registrar.

The Registrar had before him three affidavits. One was sworn by Mr Poulton (the National Claims Manager). One was sworn by Mr Fraser (the State Branch
Manager for Victoria). One was sworn by Mr Finegan (the solicitor for the second defendant). None of the deponents were cross-examined. Also, the documents were placed before him for inspection.

I shall briefly refer to some of the information thrown up by this material.
This recitation is not intended to be exhaustive. The material revealed that a claim form had been received from the plaintiff. Mr Poulton had formed a preliminary opinion that there was no cover for the aircraft and further that there was a strong probability that litigation would ensue if the claim was denied. He made a decision to obtain legal advice as to the second defendant's liability for the claim.

Mr Fraser was instructed to prepare material for the purposes of briefing solicitors. He spoke to his assistant (Mr Hooper), who was given the task of preparing the material. Mr Hooper provided a file note (document 64). Mr
Poulton required a further memorandum setting out additional information. Mr
Hooper provided a further document (document 65).

On 6 June 1996, Mr Finegan received instructions to provide legal advice. On June 1996, he received certain documents from the second defendant (including documents 64 and 65). On 12 June 1996, he provided a preliminary advice. A meeting was then arranged with officers of the first defendant. On June 1996, Mr Finegan provided further advice to the second defendant.

The dispute falls to be determined according to the rules applicable to proceedings commenced on or after 1 October 1996 (see Part 23).

Rule 1 contains definition provisions, including the following:- "privileged document" means in relation to proceedings: a document of which evidence could not be adduced in the proceedings over the objection of any person, by virtue of the operation of Part 3.10 (other than [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) and [130](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s130.html)) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/); 
The provisions to be found in [Part .10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.10) include [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) provides that evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the
Court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of, inter alia, a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer or the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) prepared by the client or a lawyer for the dominant purpose of the lawyer providing legal advice to the client.

The hearing has been approached on the basis that the second defendant bears the onus of satisfying the Court that the documents are privileged. The second defendant relies on the provisions of both [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) and [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html).
In my view, for present purposes, it is not necessary to look at the provisions of [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) 
In his written decision, the Registrar said:- "For privilege to attach to documents by the application of [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) the documents must have been brought into existence for the `dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating - to an anticipated proceeding - in which the client may be a party.' This was the test applied in Collins versus London General Omnibus Company which was cited in
Warner versus Womens Hospital <case>; [1954 VLR 410.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1954%20VLR%20410 "View LawCiteRecord" ) Charles J said in Collins `where there is a high probability, amounting almost to certainty, that an action will ensue, and a report is made to enable the solicitor to conduct the defence of any action which may be brought - when a document comes into existence under circumstances such as these, privilege will attach, though an action be not in existence or even threatened.' 
It is the intention of Mr Poulton, at whose direction the documents were produced, which is relevant. In my opinion it was too early for Mr Poulton to have formed a reasonable apprehension of legal proceedings because at the time he directed the documents preparation he had not made a final decision on the claim (and perhaps the claim had not been received). Also the provision of the `professional legal services' for which the documents were prepared did not relate to litigation but to advice as to whether the plaintiff should be indemnified.

The other basis of the claim for privilege is [Section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) I am satisfied that documents 64 and 65 can be brought within subsection (c) of this section if it is the case that the dominant purpose of preparing the documents was for Mr Finegan to give legal advice to the defendant. The evidence is that Mr Poulton had decided when he requested the production of the documents that he would obtain legal advice but there is no evidence that this was the only or dominant reason. As set out above I think the information would have been required in any event in order to permit management to make an informed decision as to whether to grant indemnity. Document 64 prepared by Mr
Hooper contains a recommendation which I think is inconsistent with a dominant purpose being the obtaining of legal advice. I have already referred to the fact that much of the information in document 64 and 65 would principally assist management in exercising its discretion. It could not be said that the circumstances giving rise to the claim were routine but I am not satisfied that the dominant purpose test has been met." 
It seems to me that the Registrar has fallen into error. Broadly speaking, there has been, inter alia, misunderstanding as to the evidence, the contents of the documents and as to the use to be made of material.

For present purposes, the relevant question is whether or not the contents of the two documents were prepared by the second defendant for the dominant purpose of Mr Finegan providing legal advice to the second defendant.

In my view, the evidence suffices to demonstrate that documents 64 and 65 were confidential documents prepared at least for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the second defendant is entitled to maintain the claim for privilege in relation to documents 64 and 65.

I set aside the orders made by the Registrar. The plaintiff is to pay the costs both of the review and of the application heard by the Registrar.
