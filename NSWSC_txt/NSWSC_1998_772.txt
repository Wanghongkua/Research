LAMPHUD MARCHLEWSKI, ROMAN MARCHLEWSKI and DELORES MARCHLEWSKI (by her next friend LAMPHUD MARCHLEWSKI) versus HUNTER AREA HEALTH SERVICE (No. 2) /95 December 1998 
Dowd J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
In these proceedings brought by Lamphud Marchlewski, Roman Marchlewski and
Delores Marchlewski ("Lamphud", "Roman" and "Delores") against the defendant, judgment was given by me on 14 August 1998, in which verdict was entered for
Lamphud and Roman against the defendant and a verdict for the defendant in the claim on behalf of Delores. I made a series of findings in respect of various heads of damage, there having been an admission of liability in respect of
Roman and Lamphud, reserving the finalisation of the claims until submissions were made in relation to the form of orders and the remaining issues which had not been determined. I reserved costs for argument. The matter was listed again before me on Friday 11 December last to deal with the remaining matters.
On that day an application was made by the defendant for a stay of part of the verdict of Roman and Lamphud.

I had awarded general damages in favour of Roman in the sum of $180,000.00 and assessed aggravated damages at $36,000.00 making a total of $216,000.00. I had not apportioned damages as to past general and aggravated damages until further argument. In discussion with Counsel on 11 December last it was agreed between the parties that I should apportion past general and aggravated damages for Roman each in the sum of $108,000.00. It has therefore been agreed between the parties that interest on past general and aggravated damages should be awarded in the sum of $12,960.00.

Economic loss for Roman, prior to June 1994 was assessed at $20,000.00 and from 1 July 1994 to date of judgment being 14 August, at $69,300.00 making $89,300.00 in all. The parties then agreed on a figure for interest on past economic loss to 11 December 1998 but subsequently agreed this at $28,708.00 to which I have added the agreed per diem rate of $16.46 for six days of $98.76. I therefore allow $28,806.76 for interest.

For future economic loss Roman was awarded $188.071.00; future therapy $86,192.00; therapy that he had to pay for Delores $5,000.00; future medication $12,422.00 and future travel $5,017.00. These sums total $643,768.76.

After some discussions between Counsel on 11 December 1998, the day of the hearing, some additional matters have been resolved and the following sums were agreed in respect of the undermentioned matters. From the amount claimed for Philomena Bowman, the sum of $5621.00 has been excluded, being the medico- legal component, which sum is claimed under the order for costs. I have apportioned the agreed HIC Medicare claim between Roman and Lamphud in approximate proportion of the amounts originally claimed by the HIC, since there is a need to apportion those sums between the two plaintiffs. The further sums allowed are; 
HIC (Medicare) repayment $ 16,000.00 
Funeral Expenses under 
Compensation to Relatives 
Claim $ 835.00 
Interest agreed thereon $ 550.92 
READ Clinic previously agreed $ 4999.00 
Translator/Interpreter $ 10,000.00 
Philomena Bowman $ 6,000.00 (excluding medio-legal component) 
Sub-Total $38,384.92 
It was agreed that the defendant was to be allowed credit for a payment of $32,007.12, being an advance made of $30,000.00 and interest calculated thereon. To this sum should be added $9.04 per day interest, for six days being $54.24, making the total deduction for the loan and interest of $32,061.36 to date of this judgment.

In respect of Lamphud I allowed general damages in the sum of $200,000.00 and aggravated damages of the order of $40,000.00. There had not been an apportionment between past general and aggravated damages and future general and aggravated damages. After discussion with Counsel and an indication from the Court as to what was likely to be an appropriate apportionment the parties have agreed that general and aggravated damages be apportioned as to $120,000.00 for the past and $120,000.00 for the future. It has therefore been agreed that interest on past general and aggravated damages is the sum of $14,400.00 which I allow. I had allowed economic loss of $60,000.00 for
Lamphud and future treatment $25,000.00 to which I allow for HIC repayment $7,000.00 making a total sum of $346,400.00, as the verdict for Lamphud.

There remained several matters still in dispute, being claims by Roman which had been agreed in terms of the mathematics of the claim but not in terms of the entitlement. These comprise expenses for a Dr Borody, the Hills Private
Hospital, Chubb Protective Services and the NSW Ambulance, as set out hereunder; 
Dr Borody $ 2,353.88 
Interest on his account $ 409.00 
Hills Private Hospital $ 10,437.60 (Interest and legal costs) $ 3,408.58 
Chubb Protective Services $ 2,502.95 
NSW Ambulance $ 181.11 
The claim for Roman is that Dr Borody's services were necessary for Lamphud's subsequent pregnancy due to their fear that attending a public hospital for the birth of the child would place their child at risk. Roman's evidence was set out in his affidavit of 16 February 1998. The same reasoning was applied for the Hills Private Hospital for the birth expenses.

It is perfectly understandable that any person who had had a child die through the negligence of a public hospital would have some resistance to further using a public hospital, even without the psychiatric state of the parties. In particular, the action in arranging for a private hospital and doctor with the attended expenses would have appeared reasonable to Roman and Lamphud.

However the test applied as to whether the actions of Roman "is of such a kind as the reasonable man should have foreseen" (The Wagon Mound) (No 1) (1961)
AC 388 at 426. This damage was too remote and I do not think the plaintiffs have shown any direct causal connection with the breach of duty by the defendant. It is put on behalf of the plaintiff's that the development of a fear was reasonably forseeable. I consider that the claim for damages is not such that the reasonable man should have foreseen and therefore is too remote from the fault of the defendant. I consider that the conception and birth of another child being reasonably foreseeable might have resulted in avoiding the
John Hunter Hospital, but it would not be foreseeable that the plaintiff would have resistance to the state health system altogether. I thus disallow the claims for the doctor and private hospital.

Roman, as a result of a visit by the NSW Police attending on his home searching for weapons and being advised that he might be dangerous, hired
Chubb security because he was concerned for protection against the NSW Police.
This again appeared reasonable to Roman but on an objective standard could not in any way be caused by the negligent act of the defendant. The actions of the defendant were not causative of Roman's concern about security. It is put that the actions of the plaintiff Roman, were all encompassed within the concept of a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury. There was no base shown in terms of a reasonable man for any fear of the police or GIO investigators. Roman's mistrust of the whole state system based on his previous experience and history is not something that the reasonable man would foresee. I consider this expense incurred too remote from the negligence of the defendant and do not allow any amount for this claim. Similarly the claim for the use of an ambulance to take him to the casualty ward of the mater Hospital in Newcastle following the ongoing stress caused by the attendance by the NSW Police at his home as deposed by him in his affidavit of 16 February 1998 is not a result of the action of the defendant, nor has it been shown to be. I therefore do not allow this claim. Neither of these claims are such that the reasonable man should have foreseen.

Roman also claims on behalf of himself and Lamphud the costs of the proceedings and order made as a result of the appointment of the Protective
Commissioner as receiver and manager of the estate of Lamphud and Roman.

Subsequent to the hearing I have received and admitted in evidence the Notices of Motion in the Protective Division of this Court dated 13 November 1998 with respect to Lamphud and similarly in respect of Roman. These were accompanied by affidavits in support and the reasons of Hodgson CJ in Eq. of the
Protective Jurisdiction of this Court. Both Notices of Motion were opposed by
Roman and Lamphud. I reject the submission of the defendant that the reason of the defendant was to supervise the expenditure of verdict monies. The
Protective Commissioner adduced evidence as a result of which His Honour found that the mental state of Roman goes far beyond that of mere concern and that he was unable to make a rational decision in the litigation against the defendant. His Honour found that Lamphud was under the influence of Roman and therefore His Honour, without expressing a final view as to their state obliged him to make an interlocutory order that the Protective Commissioner be receiver and manager of the estate until further order.

Subsequently, as proved in evidence before me by the affidavit of Mr David
Hirsch, a motion in the Protective Jurisdiction of this Court for the revocation of the orders appointing the Protective Commissioner as receiver and manager. It is clear that there was a basis for revocation of the order on the evidence before Hodgson J and the order was revoked.

It is out by the defendant that the making of the order in favour of the
Protective Commissioner was as a result of a condition which had affected
Roman for a number of years before the breach of duty by the defendant and therefore it is not the result of or caused by the tort but is a pre-tort condition. It is argued, therefore, that there is no causative connection.

I consider however that the defendant must take the plaintiff as the defendant finds him. Clearly Roman and through him, Lamphud had a pre-existing psychological condition but that does not absolve the defendant from his duty of care. Roman's "eggshell skull" psychological state made him vulnerable to the injury that was sustained but I find that the basis for the order in favour of the Protective Commissioner was the effect on Roman's mind caused by the breach of duty of the defendant and I therefore allow the claim for costs for the obtaining and subsequent revocation of orders in favour of the
Protective Commissioner at $6,870.00, as damages claimed by Roman, and allow that sum.

Roman also claims some $6,000.00 being travel costs and miscellaneous costs.
These are simply lifted from an annexure to the affidavit of Roman of 16 February 1998.

There was some evidence during the course of the hearing of additional travel and an inference can clearly be drawn that there were other expenses relating to the actions of the plaintiffs caused by the defendants breach of duty. As to whether the total amount expended bears a reasonable relationship to miscellaneous expenses and travel caused by the action of the defendant is fairly difficult to determine. Clearly many of these expenses related to
Delores and were actions of the plaintiff going beyond the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the defendant's action. Notwithstanding the paucity of evidence. I assess, however, that some $2,000.00 of this sum should be incurred for additional travelling and miscellaneous expenses and I therefore allow the sum of $2,000.00 to Roman.

Therefore there will be a verdict in favour of Roman in the following sums; 
Past General damages $ 90,000.00 
Aggravated damages on past general damages $ 18,000.00 
Interest on past general and aggravated damages $ 12,960.00 
Future general damages $ 90,000.00 
Aggravated damages on future damages $ 18,000.00 
Past economic loss $ 89,300.00 
Interest on past economic loss $ 28,806.76 
Future economic loss $188,071.00 
Future therapy $ 86,192.00 
Therapy paid for Delores $ 5,000.00 
Future medication $ 12,422.00 
Future Travel $ 5,017.00 
HIC (Medicare) repayment $ 16,000.00 
Funeral Expenses under 
Compensation to Relatives 
Claim $ 835.00 
Interest agreed thereon $ 550.92 
READ Clinic previously agreed $ 4999.00 
Translator/Interpreter $ 10,000.00 
Philomena Bowman $ 6,000.00 (excluding medio-legal component) 
Costs of the Protective Commissioner $ 6,870.00 
Miscellaneous and travelling expenses $ 2,000.00 
Total $691,023.68 
Costs 
Application has been made by Roman and Lamphud for costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis. The basis of this application is an offer of compromise made by the plaintiff of $385,000.00 plus costs to be agreed or assessed on 2
July 1996. This was in turn countered by the defendant offering the sum of $320,000.00 plus costs to be assessed, on 14 November 1996. Subsequent to this a further offer was made by the defendant on the third day of the hearing, that is, 18 February 1998, of $500,000.00 inclusive of costs for all of the plaintiffs. That offer was declined by letter from the plaintiff's solicitor in that it was an inappropriate offer because it included costs. It is clear that the verdict obtained by the two plaintiffs considerably exceeded either of the figures the subject of offer.

Orders for the payment of costs on an indemnity basis may be made either under the Court's inherent jurisdiction or pursuant to the power contained in Part
A of the SCR. Costs are otherwise awarded on a part-party basis.

The offer of compromise that was made by the plaintiffs was under Part 22 of the SCR. It is clear on the offer that was made and the verdict that was obtained that this is a proper case for indemnity costs on and from the date of the offer. The defendant has made no submission to the contrary.

Costs have been sought by the defendant in respect of the claim by Delores on the basis that she was unsuccessful in her claim. It has been put by Counsel for Delores that this has been run as a joint trial and therefore no order for costs should be made. In the circumstances it seems to me that a proper order is that an order for costs be made in favour of the defendant for those costs not otherwise referable to the claim for Roman and Lamphud.

Stay Application 
The defendant having indicated a desire that certain of the orders made in the proceedings be the subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal, sought a stay of the verdict in favour of Roman and Lamphud. An offer was made of an interim payment of $350,000.00 for both plaintiffs including an advance of $30,000.00 already made. In addition, it was suggested that this would cover the Housing
Insurance Corporation and the Department of Social Security obligations of the plaintiffs. I indicated to the parties that I thought that it was difficult for the Court to assess an appropriate amount to be obtained for HIC and DSS purposes since the amount of the final judgment would not been determined until the appeal had been dealt with by the Court of Appeal.

Mr Menzies Q.C submitted that the payment should be substantive and of the order of $750,000.00 of the total of the verdict for Lamphud and Roman.

It seems to me that in taking into account the offer made by the defendant, on the evidence, the clear and present need of the plaintiffs to have available the proceeds of the verdict to meet commitments and taking into account the likely nature of the appeal that a proper sum to advance to enable the plaintiffs to meet their commitments and make provision for their short term needs and to commence the process of rehabilitation that will now be necessary for them, would be the sum of $550,000.00.

Since the greater part of the present needs in terms of existing financial commitments and obligations will fall on Roman, it seems to me that the proper proportion to pay to Roman of that sum is $400,000.00 to Roman which will take into account the $30,000.00 already advanced and interest accrued thereon and the balance of $150,000.00 be paid to Lamphud and that the verdict and costs in respect of both of them be otherwise stayed. The defendant has indicated that payment can be made in respect of the $320,000.00, it being the balance of the offer of $350,000.00, that was made within seven days. It seems to me desirable since interest has been calculated to date of judgement on the sum of $30,00.00 already advance that the amount of the advance payment and the interest calculated to date be deducted from the sum of $400,000.00 
The orders therefore that I make are as follows;
That the plaintiff, Roman Marchlewski, shall have verdict and judgment against the defendant in the sum of $691,023.68.
That the plaintiff, Lamphud Marchlewski shall have verdict and judgment against the defendant in the sum of $346,400.00
Verdict and judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff Delores
Marchlewski.
The defendant is to pay the costs of the plaintiffs, Roman and Lamphud
Marchlewski, proceedings on a party-party basis until the 2 July 1996 thereafter costs to be paid on an indemnity basis.
That the plaintiff Delores Marchlewski pay the costs of her proceedings not otherwise attributable to the joint hearing on behalf of Roman and Lamphud
Marchlewski.
That the judgment in favour of Roman Marchlewski and the costs orders shall be stayed, except for the sum of $400,000.00 less the amount of the advance of $30,000.00 and interest thereon of $2,061.36, the balance of $368,938.64 to be paid as to a further sum of $320,000.00, within seven days of the date hereof and the balance of $47,938.64 to be paid twenty one days from the date hereof.
That the judgment in favour of Lamphud Marchlewski and the costs orders made be stayed except for the sum of $150,000.00 which sum is payable twenty one days from the date hereof.
The parties have liberty to apply on two days notice.
