JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks damages in the sum of approximately $86,000,000 for alleged medical negligence.
The plaintiff is Wei Fan. The defendant is South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. The plaintiff's wife is Yue Wang ("Ms Wang"). During the hearing, Ms Wang sat at the bar table with Qing Zhang Fan (known as and referred to as David Fan in this judgment). David Fan is the son of the plaintiff and Ms Wang. David Fan is in his final year of Law School and acted as an advocate for his father. It was a difficult position for him to be placed in. The hearing of these proceedings was not without its difficulties.
The plaintiff was legally represented up until May 2013. His solicitors drafted the further amended statement of claim and medical reports, instructed medical legal experts and obtained experts' reports on damages.
The plaintiff speaks Mandarin. He is not fluent in the English language, nor is Ms Wang. When the proceedings came on for hearing, the plaintiff did not have an interpreter. No statements of witnesses had been prepared nor served.
This Court arranged and paid for an interpreter for the plaintiff while the evidence was being given. Time was allowed for David Fan to prepare statements. The Court provided David Fan with a copy of each day's transcript. The plaintiff tendered three folders of hospital records but they were not in any particular order. Documents from different hospitals were interspersed with each other, mixed with pleadings and what I think can best be described as written commentary.
The hearing took place over nine days commencing 16 March 2015 and concluding on 28 May 2015. Some months after this Court reserved its judgment, the plaintiff, without leave of this Court and without explanation, forwarded a folder of documents relating to out of pocket expenses, and later, again without leave of this Court and without explanation, forwarded a new occupational therapy assessment report of Anna Everett, of ARW, dated 12 August 2015. In relation to the admissibility of these documents, after the receipt of written submissions by both parties in relation to each, I decided to allow the tender of the out of pocket expenses folder. However, I disallowed the tender of Ms Everett's occupational therapy assessment report. Reasons for these decisions are given under the headings "out of pocket expenses" and "the plaintiff's psychiatric condition and care" respectively.
Both David Fan and Ms Wang were witnesses in the plaintiff's case. They provided statements and were cross examined. As some of their evidence was strongly contested, both David Fan and Ms Wang, as witnesses, had to absent themselves from court while the plaintiff was being cross examined. At very short notice, Paul Glissan barrister appeared for the plaintiff on a pro bono basis. Mr Glissan was present when the plaintiff was being cross examined in the absence of his wife and son.

Tutor
At the outset of the hearing, there was an issue as to whether the plaintiff still had a tutor acting on his behalf. On 16 March 2015, David Fan repeatedly referred to Ms Wang as "the tutor". This Court sought to clarify whether or not the plaintiff had a tutor. David Fan informed this Court that Ms Wang had been the plaintiff's tutor, but that order had been revoked the week before this hearing.
On 19 March 2015, this Court again raised the issue of a tutor with David Fan, having not been able to locate an order revoking the need for the plaintiff to have a tutor act on his behalf. Counsel for the defendant had also tried and failed to locate the order by looking through transcripts from recent directions hearings. It became apparent that no such revocation order was ever made.
David Fan agreed. I then noted that during these proceedings, the plaintiff had been under no legal disability and a tutor had not been required. As this Court had been earlier told by David Fan that the order for the tutor had been revoked and the proceedings had been conducted on that basis, the order was backdated to 16 March 2015, the first day of the hearing.
As the proceedings continued, I carefully observed the plaintiff while he gave evidence, was cross examined and sat in the back of the court. I have read the transcript of his evidence a number of times. I formed and have continued to hold the view that the plaintiff understood what was being said in court (with the assistance of the interpreter).

A brief overview of the plaintiffs claim
Between 20 January and 16 March 2007, the plaintiff attended three hospitals, Sutherland Hospital ("Sutherland hospital"), Prince of Wales Hospital ("Prince of Wales hospital") and St George Hospital ("St George hospital").
On 4 April 2012, the plaintiff filed a further amended statement of claim ("FASC") which had been prepared by his former solicitors. The plaintiff separated his claim into two causes of action, headed "Claim in tort of negligence" and "Claim for breach of contract". However, liability based on negligence is determined by the application of [Part 1A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/index.html#p1a) of the [Civil Liability Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) , which "elides the traditional categorisation of causes of action and instead imposes uniform rules and principles wherever there is a claim for harm resulting from a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill": see Leeming JA in Paul versus Cooke  <case>. [Section 5A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5a.html) explains the application of [Part 1A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/index.html#p1a), and reads: "5A Application of Part 
This Part applies to any claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, regardless of whether the claim is brought in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise."
The reasoning of Leeming JA in Paul versus Cooke makes it clear that "negligence" is not a reference to the tort, "but to a category of conduct, which may be an element of a cause of action in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise": at [40]. At [41] Leeming JA commented that: "[Part 1A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/index.html#p1a) of the Act applies uniformly to a class of claims for damage, irrespective of how the cause of action has been formulated, so long as the damage results from a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill." Hence, the plaintiff's two separate causes of action do not need to be distinguished from one another in these reasons.

At paragraph [60] of the FASC, the plaintiff alleges that there have been fifteen separate breaches of the duty of care owed to him. While the pleading is not entirely clear, doing the best I can, they can be summarised as follows: 
Failing to investigate, diagnose and manage type 2 diabetes mellitus ("type 2 diabetes"), with no follow up after initial tests were undertaken in January ;

Failing to properly diagnose and manage the plaintiff's gallbladder condition, by: 
Failing to diagnose the condition as cholecystitis and treat it accordingly; and 
Delaying a cholecystectomy (at various points in time up until 15 March 2007, when a cholecystectomy was performed) and not performing an ERCP first on 30
January 2007; 
Wrongly allowing the plaintiff to fall from his hospital bed on 11 March 2007; 
Wrongly discharging the plaintiff from St George hospital on 16 March 2007 when he was not fit to be discharged; and 
Failing to give the plaintiff information about treatments and the costs involved (considering his Medicare status).

The plaintiff alleges that as a result of those breaches of duty, he suffered the following damage and loss: * Exacerbation of type 2 diabetes with development of complications including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, cataracts and vascular disease; * Progression of cholecystitis to a severe state; * A Fractured skull on 9 March 2007; * Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone (SIADH) release secondary to the fracture of his skull; * Further injury to his skull and brain as a result of the fall from his bed while in St George hospital on 11 March 2007; * A Traumatic brain injury resulting in widespread, permanent and progressive brain damage.
It is common ground that by May 2008, the plaintiff had developed type 2 diabetes as well as a moderately severe sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. These conditions were diagnosed on 15 May 2008 (see letter from Professor Michael Anthony, Ex B, Tab N). It is also not in dispute that on 9 March 2007, the plaintiff suffered a skull fracture.
By amended defence to the FASC filed 19 September 2013, the defendant admits that it owed the plaintiff a duty of care in providing health services to him. The defendant admits that the relevant hospital staff at St George hospital, Prince of Wales hospital and Sutherland hospital, where the plaintiff was a resident, were at all material times employees of the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service (formerly the Area Health Service) and that it is vicariously liable for negligent acts and/or omissions of those staff where those acts or omissions were performed during the course of their employment. (see amended defence at [67] and [68]). This duty of care will be discussed in more detail later in this judgment. However, the defendant denies the existence of the duty of care contended for by the plaintiff, denies breach of duty and causation, pleads [s 5O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5o.html) [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) as a defence; and alleges contributory negligence, failure to mitigate damage and volenti not fit injuria (see amended defence at [69] to [73] and [76] to [79]).
Before I deal with the facts that I will set out in chronological order, it is convenient that I refer to the medical experts, whose evidence will appear throughout this judgment. I will also discuss some issues about credibility, and set out the legal principles of duty and standard of care as these are referred to throughout the chronology of events. I will deal with the alleged breaches of duty of care as they arise throughout the chronology. However I will also make general conclusions on breach of duty after I have set out the facts, and before I determine causation and damages. Consequently, it is unavoidable that there will be some repetition.

The medical experts
Professor Ross Smith, Dr Christopher Vickers and Associate Professor Neil Collier provided individual medical reports, wrote a joint report dated 17 December 2014 (Ex A, Tab F) and gave helpful concurrent evidence at Court on 23 March 2015. Professor Smith was retained by the plaintiff and both Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier were retained by the defendant. The medical experts were asked for their opinions on various medical issues. Where they agree on issues I shall refer to them jointly as "the medical experts". Where they do not agree I shall refer to them by name.
Professor Smith is a consulting hepato-pancreatico-biliary and upper gastrointestinal surgeon at the Royal North Shore hospital, St Leonards. His report is dated 8 December 2014. Dr Vickers is a gastroenterologist and etiologist at St Vincent's hospital, Sydney. His report is dated 17 October 2014. Associate Professor Collier is a hepato-pancreatico-biliary and upper gastrointestinal surgeon at the Royal Melbourne hospital and Airport Health Care, Melbourne. His report is dated 16 September 2014. They are all experts on the hepatobiliary system. However, not being a surgeon, Dr Vickers declined to answer some questions about hepatobiliary surgery.
Professor Smith and Dr Vickers also offered opinions about diabetes despite not being endocrinologists. Dr Vickers provided opinions on diabetes as a specialist consultant physician as he frequently admits patients to hospital for gastrointestinal conditions, with diabetes as a common accompaniment. Dr Collier declined to answer questions about diabetes as it is out of his expertise.
In their individual medical reports, some of Professor Smith's opinions differed from those of Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier. In their joint report, the opinions of Professor Smith to a lesser extent differed from those of Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier on some issues. However, in cross examination it became apparent that some of Professor Smith's opinions were based on information that had been provided during a conference with the plaintiff and his family. Consequently, when the medical experts gave concurrent evidence in Court, Professor Smith, having been shown the actual hospital records, abandoned some of his earlier opinions and agreed with Drs Vickers and Collier.
While I am on the topic of medical reports, there are a number of medical terms that are defined throughout this judgment. I have used Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing and Health Professions (3rd Edition), except where otherwise stated.

Credibility in the plaintiff's camp
It is convenient that I now also record my observations concerning the credibility of the plaintiff and his witnesses, Ms Wang and David Fan, as it is relevant to my findings on both liability and damages. They all provided statements and were cross examined (the plaintiff's statement is dated 17 March 2015 (Ex E), Ms Wang's statement is dated 18 March 2015 (Ex G) and David Fan's statement is 17 March (Ex F)).

The plaintiff
The plaintiff made no submissions in relation to his credibility other than a request that this Court "decide upon the facts, and justice according to law". Counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiff's evidence is frequently contrary to contemporaneous medical records and where there is a conflict, the objective hospital records ought be favoured over the plaintiff's recollection.
While it is not ideal that disputed evidence is dealt with here out of chronological order, it explains why I have reservations accepting the plaintiff's evidence in relation to various admissions to hospital. I shall refer to a number of examples where the plaintiff gave evidence that is at odds with the medical records. They are: * On 31 January 2007, when the plaintiff was discharged from Prince of Wales hospital, he denied being provided with any advice in relation to the need to see a surgeon (T72.8-29). However, the clinical notes indicate that he was advised of the need to talk to the surgical team (Ex 7, p 78).
* On 15 February 2007, the plaintiff denied telling Dr Keogh (a surgeon at the Prince of Wales hospital) that he had not had any further pain (T77.15-25; T77.40-42). In contrast, Dr Keogh recorded that the plaintiff told him that he had no further pain (Ex A, Tab O p 77).
* The plaintiff admitted that he did not actually recollect how he felt on 15 February 2007 at the Prince of Wales hospital surgery review clinic (T78.44-46) but could not explain why he put a definitive statement as to how he felt into his statement dated 17 March 2007 (Ex E [6]).
* On 9 March 2007, the plaintiff discharged himself from Sutherland hospital against medical advice. He signed the "Discharge From Hospital Against Medical Advice" form. The clinical notes record that there was a medical registrar who spoke Mandarin (Ex 4, 50-57). This is in contrast with the evidence given by the plaintiff where he denied the presence of an interpreter and says that he was told "sign this then you can go" (T82.17-49; T90.33-50). The plaintiff denied being advised that he ought not leave Sutherland hospital on 9 March 2007 and maintained that he was told that he could go. The hospital records are detailed and are supported by the statements of the staff involved in caring for the plaintiff. Dr Aziez (being the doctor who provided the treatment to the plaintiff and gave him the drip) denied telling the plaintiff that he could go home (Ex 17). Associate Professor Warrier (who at that time was a surgical registrar at Sutherland hospital) denied that he told the plaintiff he could go home (Ex 16). Ms Fuchs, (a registered nurse) confirmed her role in relation to the discharge of the plaintiff (Ex 15). The plaintiff did not challenge the evidence of Dr Aziez, Associate Professor Warrier or Ms Fuchs. The plaintiff was aware that an interpreter had been booked for that morning but maintained his view in evidence that he was told that he could go home (T 82.35).
* The plaintiff denied being weighed at St George hospital (T95.40-59; T96). Yet St George hospital clinical notes record the plaintiff's weight (Ex B, Tab O, p 290). This is a critical issue and is the subject of detailed analysis later in this judgment.
There were other occasions when the evidence of the plaintiff was internally inconsistent. Two examples are: * In relation to his fall at St George hospital, the plaintiff said that "four or five nurses at the door saw me having the fall" (T93.39-40). However, he also admitted that they did not see him fall (T92.50).
* The plaintiff gave evidence that he told Dr Chu that he had a fall at home on 26 February 2007 but he was not injured (T94.21-22). However, he contradicted that by saying that the first fall he had was on 9 March 2007 (T30-31).
There are other occasions where the plaintiff's credibility is in issue but I will refer to them when they arise in the chronology of events.
I have taken into account the plaintiff's lack of proficiency of English and that he may have, at times, had difficulty expressing himself during hospital admissions. He did not appear to have any discernible difficulty when he gave evidence and was cross examined in Court with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter.
As previously stated, I carefully observed the plaintiff when he was giving evidence and during cross examination. I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the plaintiff was deliberately attempting to present his case at its highest and tailored his evidence to further this objective. Hence, I have come to the conclusion that I can only accept the plaintiff's evidence where it is uncontentious. Where the plaintiff's evidence conflicts with the evidence of the hospital staff and contemporaneous hospital records, I prefer the contemporaneous records.

Ms Wang's credibility
As far as Ms Wang's credibility is concerned, again the plaintiff made no submissions other than a request that this Court "decide upon the facts, and justice according to law".
Counsel for the defendant submitted that the evidence of Ms Wang was of limited assistance to these proceedings and should not be taken as a truthful recount of events. Counsel for the defendant also drew this Court's attention to numerous occasions where Ms Wang's evidence was riddled with inconsistency. When giving evidence and in cross examination, the defendant submitted that Ms Wang was combative and uncooperative in answering questions.
I carefully observed Ms Wang throughout the hearing and in particular when she gave evidence and was cross examined. Overall, my conclusion is that Ms Wang was less than a satisfactory witness. She gave evidence with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter but her evidence was evasive. She temporised. She gave unresponsive answers to questions. She took notes. The interpreter, at times, expressed difficulty in translating her evidence. After a while, this Court requested Ms Wang to stop taking notes as it thought this was an explanation as to why she was giving unresponsive answers to questions as her note writing may have distracted her from properly formulating her answers. After this Court's request to desist with the note taking, she continued to do so until this Court had to make a further request for her to stop.
On a number of occasions, this Court directed Ms Wang to focus on answering the question and not to volunteer evidence. It was explained to her that if she did not do so, this Court may reluctantly have to reach the conclusion that she was endeavouring to bolster her husband's case. She chose not to heed this instruction.
As previously stated, throughout the hearing, Ms Wang sat at the bar table. She spoke to David Fan. From time to time, she insistently drew David Fan's attention to documents. Throughout this litigation and during this hearing Ms Wang took what can only be described as a very active role. An example of her behaviour prior to the hearing concerned an expert, Ms Joanne Oates, an occupational therapist. Ms Oates interviewed the plaintiff on 10 September 2014 (T277.26-27). Ms Wang was present during this appointment. I shall briefly refer to what occurred. Ms Oates gave evidence that she found it a "difficult interview process in terms of the questioning and the response process" (T262.45-50, T278.28-29). The plaintiff was hindered from providing direct answers to Ms Oates' questions because Ms Wang was "dominating that process" (T278.35). Ms Oates added, "Or, if he sometimes would respond to things, I found that that would then be negated or altered in response from his wife" (T278.35-36). When Ms Wang was questioned in Court about her role in the plaintiff's interview with Ms Oates, she refused to concede that she had been involved in a discussion during that interview, where the plaintiff said he could be left alone (T281.34, T282.2). This illustrates Ms Wang's approach to the pre-litigation process and the litigation process.
Perhaps the most confusing evidence Ms Wang gave was on the topic of the plaintiff's entitlement to Medicare. The case pleaded by the plaintiff was that he was not entitled to Medicare and the hearing proceeded on this basis. However, Ms Wang disputes that the plaintiff was not entitled to Medicare. In cross examination she stated: "Q. That decision by the family to discharge was because you were paying overseas rates for the hospital stay, that's true isn't it? 
A. Because on 26 January I married Wei Fan and I have a Medicare card, and because Wei Fan is marrying me so he is entitled to have the same treatment the same status so - because at that time I have already applied for PR visa for Wei Fan at that time. At that time all the information has already sent to the immigration department. I do know about these conditions and the circumstances. 
Q. As at 31 January 2007 it was your understanding that Wei Fan had to pay overseas rates at the hospital wasn't it? 
A. Very simple, that day nobody talk to us about the hospital fees, the only thing mentioned was he would be discharged on that day. 
Q. ... Mrs Wang, it was your belief on 31 January 2007 that Mr Wei Fan had to pay overseas rates for the hospital stay weren't you? 
A. Yes." (T254.29).
There is no doubt that Ms Wang has been the driving force in this litigation. Her evidence has been focused on presenting her husband's case at its highest regardless of the truth or the consequences. Where her evidence is disputed, I have not accepted it unless it is corroborated by contemporaneous records or evidence other than that of the plaintiff or David Fan.

David Fan's credibility
David Fan also sought to present his father's case at its highest. The plaintiff made no submissions in relation to the credibility of David Fan. David Fan acted as interpreter for his parents during attendances at hospitals and medical appointments. His oral and written English is good. But regrettably I have reservations about the veracity of his evidence.
As I have said, David Fan has been placed in a difficult position. He prepared the statements for the plaintiff, his mother and himself. One of the most hotly disputed topics in the trial was the weight of the plaintiff on 27 February 2007. The plaintiff, Ms Wang and David Fan all say that the plaintiff weighed 44 kilograms on that day. I do not accept the plaintiff's or his witnesses evidence on this issue and that includes the evidence of David Fan. It is not necessary for me to reach a conclusion as to whether David Fan's evidence on this topic is deliberately false or a reconstruction, but it is definitely not a mistake.

Duty and standard of care
Before I set out the plaintiff's submissions in chronological order, it is necessary to briefly set out the legal principles regarding the duty and standard of care for medical professionals, as throughout the chronology I will make assessments about whether or not the relevant medical professionals met the requisite standard of care. Later in this judgment, I will set out the legal principles relevant to my analysis of breach of duty, causation and damages.
It is not in dispute that the defendant, through its employees, owed the plaintiff as a patient, a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment: Rogers versus Whitaker <case>; <case>: "8. ... A component of th[e] single comprehensive duty is ordinarily to warn the patient of 'material risks' of physical injury inherent in a proposed treatment. A risk of physical injury inherent in a proposed treatment is material if it is a risk to which a reasonable person in the position of the patient would be likely to attach significance, or if it is a risk to which the medical practitioner knows or ought reasonably to know the particular patient would be likely to attach significance in choosing whether or not to undergo a proposed treatment."
The standard of care owed by a medical practitioner will depend on their relevant skill and it is necessary to give content to the duty in the given case. To ascertain the precise content of the duty in a particular case it is necessary to determine what, in the circumstances, constitutes reasonable care and what constitutes ordinary skill in the relevant area of medical practice: Gaudron J in Rogers versus Whitaker at 492. In Rogers versus Whitaker, Mason CJ stated at 487: "In Australia, it has been accepted that the standard of care to be observed by a person with some special skill or competence is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill."
In Rogers versus Whitaker, Mason CJ continued at 487, that "that standard is not determined solely or even primarily by reference to the practice followed or supported by a responsible body of opinion in the relevant profession or trade". However, since the introduction of [s 5O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5o.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/), a medical professional will not be liable for negligence arising from the provision of medical services if it is established that they acted in a manner that, at the time, was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. [Section 5O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5o.html) reads: "5O Standard of care for professionals 
A person practising a profession (a professional) does not incur a liability in negligence arising from the provision of a professional service if it is established that the professional acted in a manner that (at the time the service was provided) was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. 
However, peer professional opinion cannot be relied on for the purposes of this section if the court considers that the opinion is irrational. 
The fact that there are differing peer professional opinions widely accepted in Australia concerning a matter does not prevent any one or more (or all) of those opinions being relied on for the purposes of this section. 
Peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to be considered widely accepted." [Section 5O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5o.html) can operate as a defence. In Dobler versus Halverson <case>; [(2007) 70 NSWLR 151], Giles JA at 167-168 stated: "[Section
O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5o.html) may end up operating so as to determine the defendant's standard of care, but the standard of care will be that determined by the Court with guidance from evidence of acceptable professional practice unless it is established (in practice, by the defendant) that the defendant acted according to professional practice widely accepted by (rational) peer professional opinion."
Hence, in dealing with the plaintiff's submissions it will be necessary to refer to the relevant skills of the medical professionals and, based on the opinions of the medical experts, determine whether those professionals acted in a manner that was widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent medical professional practice. It is important to reiterate that [s 5O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5o.html) provides that that peer professional opinion does not have to be universally accepted to be considered widely accepted.

The facts
The plaintiff was born in March 1962 in China. He came to Australia in July 2000. In January 2007, the plaintiff was 44 years old. When the plaintiff attended court he ambulated with the use of a walking frame. Outside Court he wears rugby style headgear. He has a hearing aid in his left ear. The plaintiff's submission was that his weight before 20 January 2007 was approximately 70 to 75 kilograms and that when he lived in China his weight had always been 70 to 75 kilos for all his health checks. (T69.29-30). In other words, the plaintiff says that he had consistently weighed between 70 and 75 kilograms.
It is common ground that the plaintiff attended the defendant's hospitals or clinics on the following occasions: * (a) From 20 January 2007 to 23 January 2007 - St George hospital; * (b) From 23 January 2007 to 31 January 2007 - Prince of Wales hospital; * (c) On 8 February 2007 - the Prince of Wales hospital gastroenterology outpatient clinic; * (d) On 15 February 2007 - Dr Keogh's Prince of Wales hospital clinic; * (e) On 21 February 2007 - the Prince of Wales pre admission clinic; * (f) [NOTE: On 22 February 2007 - the cholecystectomy was cancelled]; * (g) On 8 March 2007 and 9 March 2007 - Sutherland hospital; * (h) From 9 March 2007 to 16 March 2007 - St George hospital; * (i) During April 2007 - Sutherland hospital; and * (j) From 25 May 2007 to 15 June 2007 - the rehabilitation ward of St George hospital.

St George hospital from 20 to 23 January 2007
On 20 January 2007 at about 7.00 pm, the plaintiff attended the accident and emergency department at St George hospital seeking medical attention. He was accompanied by David Fan.

Diabetes
Prior to being admitted, Ms Amy Ashcroft, a registered nurse, reviewed the plaintiff. The hospital records indicate that the plaintiff presented with symptoms of abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting. A glucometer recording was taken showing the plaintiff's blood glucose level was raised at 10.8mml/L. A urine glucose recording was also taken showing that the plaintiff had glucose in his urine of 250mg/dl.
Dr Laura Cotiga, a resident medical officer, and Dr Melvin Muralidharan, a surgical registrar, reviewed the plaintiff. The plaintiff was admitted to St George hospital under the care of Dr Frances Chu. Dr Chu is a consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at St George and Sutherland hospitals. Dr Chu provided a witness statement (Ex 8) but was not required for cross examination. The plaintiff was not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when reviewed by Drs Cotiga and Muralidharan, nor was he diagnosed with diabetes during his admission to St George hospital under the care of Dr Chu.
Diabetes is a complex disorder of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism that is primarily a result of a deficiency or absence of insulin secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas or resistance to insulin. Patients with type 2 diabetes are usually not insulin dependent but may be insulin requiring, are commonly obese, are generally older than 40 years and often have a genetic predisposition to develop the disease. Type 2 diabetes usually begins insidiously (Mosby's p 513-514).
Professor Smith and Dr Vickers were asked what the glucometer reading of 10.8mml/L and the multisticks 10 sg test result of 250mg/dg indicated, either alone, or in combination. Professor Smith and Dr Vickers agreed in their joint report that the results showed elevated blood sugar, but not necessarily diabetes. They also agreed that the results did not necessitate treatment as and of themselves (joint report Ex A, Tab F, p 2). Dr Vickers in his report stated that the normal course of action would be to monitor the blood sugar and HbA1c during an admission. Where a hospital admission was brief, Dr Vickers said that the patient would normally be told of his elevated sugar level and that it ought to be checked again when he is well. Dr Vickers added that a single elevated blood sugar reading of 10.8mml/L does not necessarily indicate diabetes. Professor Smith in his report stated that it would have been important for the staff to make a comment on the elevation of blood and urine glucose and to monitor it over a period of time. The experts were not cross examined on this issue.
Dr John Carter, an endocrinologist, prepared an expert report dated 17 April 2013 concerning the plaintiff's diabetes. His opinions supplement those of Professor Smith and Dr Vickers regarding the diagnosis of diabetes. Dr Carter was not required to give evidence or required for cross examination. Dr Carter was asked to address (in his report) what the appropriate follow up of the plaintiff's blood sugar tests should have been. Dr Carter's opinion was that a random level of 10.8mm/L is not diagnostic of diabetes as the diagnosis can be made if the random glucose level is greater than 11mm/L and symptoms of high glucose levels, such as increased thirst or urination, are present. The plaintiff's level was less than 11mm/L and those symptoms were not present. Dr Carter commented that he would have interpreted the reading as being above the normal range as being due to genetic predisposition for diabetes or due to the stress associated with his illness. The appropriate follow up would have been to monitor further glucose levels to determine whether they returned to normal.
On the basis of the opinions of Professor Smith, Dr Vickers and Dr Carter, I do not make a finding that when the plaintiff was admitted to St George hospital on 21 January 2007, he should have been diagnosed and treated for diabetes. That assertion is not supported by the medical evidence. I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the actions of the Drs Cotiga, Muralidharan and Chu were in accordance with competent professional practice within their various specialities.

Initial diagnosis of cholangitis (not cholecystitis)
The plaintiff's evidence is that through his son, he informed hospital staff that he wished to have his gall bladder removed by way of a cholecystectomy [surgical removal of the gallbladder, often due to cholecystitis] and that hospital staff refused this request.
On 22 January 2007 at 12.30 pm an ultrasound was undertaken. Dr Chu reported, "Mr Fan's presenting problem was obstructive jaundice." Dr Chu referred to the ultrasound report. It showed multiple stones in the gallbladder with no evidence of cholecystitis. The report concluded, "Cholelithiasis with no ultrasound evidence of cholecystitis nor of biliary dilation". The plaintiff's common bile duct had multiple stones (Ex 3, p 325). Cholelithiasis is "the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder" (Mosby's p 350). Hence, the results of the ultrasound indicated that there were stones in the plaintiff's gallbladder but no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
The plaintiff was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cholangitis. However, he was not diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. All three of these conditions occur within the biliary system.
The biliary system involves the gallbladder and bile ducts, which transport bile These are often called the biliary tract. The cystic duct is the duct through which bile from the gallbladder passes into the common bile duct. Gallstones, also known as biliary calculi, are stones formed in the biliary tract consisting of cholesterol or bile pigments and calcium salts. I have reproduced a diagram of the biliary system which shows common sites of biliary calculi (see Mosby's pp 204 and 471): ![2015123500.png](1235.1.png)
Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are complications of cholelithiasis. Cholangitis is "inflammation of the bile ducts caused either by bacterial invasion or by obstruction of the ducts". Acute cholecystitis is "acute... inflammation of the gallbladder". Cholecystitis can be acute or chronic (Mosby's pp 350 and 351).
While cholangitis and acute cholecystitis both involve biliary inflammation, they are very different conditions (see evidence of Dr Collier at T188.28). It is important to keep in mind the differences between the conditions of cholangitis and acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis is usually caused by a gallstone that cannot pass through the cystic duct. Cholangitis is caused either by bacterial invasion or by obstruction of the bile ducts by calculi or a tumour (Mosby's p 350). Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis tend to be separate conditions as it depends on whether the inflammation is in the gallbladder or the bile duct. Dr Keogh said that it is very unusual to get acute cholecystitis combined with cholangitis (T173.35).
It is also important to keep in mind the differences between the indicators of acute cholecystitis and the indicators of cholangitis, some of which overlap. Indicators of acute cholecystitis are pain felt in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen accompanied by nausea, vomiting, eructation (burping) and flatulence. Indicators of cholangitis are severe pain felt in the right upper quadrant, jaundice (if an obstruction is present), intermittent fever and blood tests that reveal an elevated level of serum bilirubin and leucocytes (Mosby's p 350).
The treatment differs depending upon whether the diagnosis is cholangitis or acute cholecystitis. Treatment for cholangitis may include antibiotics before surgery for acute obstruction (Mosby's p 350). With acute cholecystitis, surgery is the preferred treatment, and usually occurs within 48 hours of presentation (see evidence of Dr Keogh at T166.30).
At the conclave, the medical experts were asked about whether or not cholecystitis should have been diagnosed from the ultrasound. Professor Smith stated that "I've reviewed the literature on whether an ultrasound can diagnose acute cholecystitis, and clearly, if the ultrasound shows the gallbladder swollen and inflamed and thick-walled, it's 100%. But if you look at patients coming [to the hospital] with a syndrome of upper abdominal pain, inflammation, unwell and that gets better after a cholecystectomy, then the ultrasound report is only 60 to 70% accurate."
By contrast, Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier were jointly of the view that the plaintiff had cholangitis rather than cholecystitis and this was correctly diagnosed on the ultrasound. Associate Professor Collier's opinion was that "all the evidence points to his presenting complaint being one of cholangitis and with a normal ultrasound in terms of the wall thickness of the gallbladder, and the lack of tenderness mass, whatever when he's examined, and the subsequent finding of a cholecystectomy is that he didn't have acute cholecystitis, all these things point to the diagnosis on admission as being correct, of cholangitis, not cholecystitis, and that changes the way the patient is managed." The evidence was strong that the stone was lodged in the bile duct. (T188.25).
Based on the opinion of Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier, it is my view that the diagnosis of cholangitis rather than cholecystitis made on 22 January 2007 by Dr Chu, was in accordance with competent medical professional practice. The ultrasound indicated that the gallstones were lodged in the bile duct, not the cystic duct, which is indicative of cholangitis, and the plaintiff presented with jaundice and abdominal pain, also indicating cholangitis. 
Removal of gallbladder?
The plaintiff wanted to have a cholecystectomy at St George hospital. A cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. As mentioned above, the plaintiff was diagnosed with cholangitis and cholelithiasis. In patients with severe attacks of biliary pain associated with cholelithiasis, cholecystectomy is recommended to prevent such complications as cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis. However, surgery may be delayed while acute inflammation is treated.
Initial treatment for acute inflammation from cholangitis, before a cholecystectomy, can occur via antibiotics or by an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreaticography ("ERCP") to drain the bile duct. An ERCP is an endoscopic test that provides radiographic visualisation of the bile duct through a flexible fibreoptic duodenoscope placed in the common bile duct. It involves inserting the endoscope into a natural opening in the body such as the mouth or anus for viewing (although incisions may be made for specific areas) (Mosby's p 602). An ERCP can be used to remove stones from the bile duct before a cholecystectomy rather than removing the stones from the bile duct at the same time as the cholecystectomy (see evidence of Associate Professor Collier at T181.10). If an ERCP is successful, a cholecystectomy can then be performed to prevent further episodes of cholangitis.
After the ultrasound, the hospital staff, in particular Dr Chu, decided to perform an ERCP as an initial treatment rather than to undertake a cholecystectomy. The plaintiff's evidence is that the hospital staff proposed: "an operation but they [staff at the hospital] did an ultrasound on my stomach and a chest X-ray and they told me there was a stone in my chest area. They told me that the surgeon suggested to remove the stone by some explosives. The plaintiff explained what he meant by "explosives" for treatment as: "It was a doctor or a nurse, I'm not sure on the identities, I was told there is this stone in my chest. They will put in a tablet to explode the stone into pieces. The outcome is after two year GP check ups in Princes of Wales hospital he was told there was no stone in my chest." (T71.32.36).
The plaintiff says that he was told there was a "1% risk of death, that's all" and that the staff did not refer to the word, "ERCP" (T70.28-34). The plaintiff also gave evidence that he knew what an ERCP was, but did not think that the doctors were referring to an ERCP in that conversation. The plaintiff's account conflicts with the clinical notes that record "Discussed: Dr Chu who strongly advises ERCP. Discussed: patient who is now happy to have ERCP tomorrow ... Consent completed with son but interpreter will be needed to confirm it tomorrow."
When Ms Wang and David Fan became aware that the doctors wanted to perform an ERCP on the plaintiff, they both say that they did some research on the topic of ERCP overnight, and then decided that the procedure was too risky. The plaintiff's evidence is that when Ms Wang and David Fan told him it was too risky he decided not to go ahead with the ERCP (T70.35.39). In cross examination, Ms Wang first agreed that she left St George hospital and did research on ERCP at home. Ms Wang then denied that she left the hospital and said that rather, she and David Fan waited at the hospital from 10.00 pm to 1.30 am (T245.37). Later in cross examination, Ms Wang agreed that she was aware that the doctors wanted to perform an ERCP and that she was removing the plaintiff against medical advice. She wanted the hospital to transfer the plaintiff to Prince of Wales hospital because she was of the opinion that it was a better hospital with better facilities.
On 23 January 2007 at 1.30 am, Ms Wang and David Fan arrived back at St George hospital. Ms Wang called the plaintiff from the public phone in the hospital foyer and the plaintiff answered the phone next to his bed. Ms Wang asked the plaintiff to come downstairs and told him that they should leave because the ERCP procedure was very risky and could involve a 1% risk of death. The plaintiff's evidence is that the family told the front desk that he was going to discharge himself (T71.1-12). The clinical records from 1.30 am to 2.00 am reveal that a discussion then took place between the doctors, the plaintiff, David Fan and Ms Wang about whether or not the plaintiff should leave St George hospital. The clinical notes record: "0130 Long discussion with son and wife - Want to remove patient from hospital  - Reasons are unclear 
Came to ward to talk to patient but patient had absconded. 
Security notified Explained risks/severity of current illness 
Adamant about leaving 
Discharged against medical advice 
Advised to return if unwell." (Ex B, Tab O, p 28).
Ms Wang confirmed this conversation took place. She agreed that the doctor told her that the plaintiff should stay at St George hospital but she was adamant that he leave. However, the plaintiff gave evidence that when he left St George hospital he did not understand that he was leaving against medical advice because he did not understand what they were talking about, and he was only aware that he needed to sign the form if he wanted to be discharged from the hospital. Further, during cross examination, the plaintiff said he had heard that not only in China but also in Australia, most of the hospitals were not using explosives for treatment. (T71.25.30).
On 23 January 2007, the plaintiff signed a certificate of removal from the hospital against medical advice, certifying that he was departing from St George hospital at his own risk. The hospital notes record that there was a long discussion that included "Discharge against medical advice". As David Fan was present when this occurred, it is more likely than not that David Fan would have translated the conversation for his father. I make a finding that the plaintiff understood that he was leaving hospital against medical advice. This is the first occasion when the plaintiff discharged himself against medical advice.
The medical experts were asked what the treatment options available to the plaintiff were during his admission to St George hospital with respect to his medical condition. In their joint report the medical experts agreed (Q2, p 3) that there were two alternatives. The first was a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (the procedure that the plaintiff wanted) to remove the gallbladder; and the second was an ERCP. A cholecystectomy can remove the stones in the bile duct at the same time as removing the gallbladder [Associate Professor Collier]. The medical experts agreed that the cholecystectomy carried with it the usual surgical and anaesthetic risks. These risks could increase with the presence of jaundice. The stone might not always be cleared in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the procedure may need to be converted to an open procedure. Dr Vickers said that the risks associated with an ERCP were small. Associate Professor Collier agreed that the risks were small and that an ERCP does not carry the same anaesthetic risk as a cholecystectomy.
In their joint report (Q3, p 4), the medical experts were also asked whether, in accordance with competent professional practice, it was appropriate for St George hospital staff to decline to perform a cholecystectomy on the plaintiff without him first undergoing an ERCP. Associate Professor Collier answered yes. Professor Smith said it was a decision for the surgeon on the day, but it was not inappropriate. [Dr Vickers declined to comment as it was a surgical question]. I make a finding that on 23 January 2007, the decision not to perform a cholecystectomy on the plaintiff without him first undergoing an ERCP was in accordance with competent hepatobiliary surgical practice.

Prince of Wales hospital from 23 - 31 January 2007
At about 6.00 am on 23 January 2007, the plaintiff arrived at Prince of Wales hospital (T71) where he was admitted under the care of firstly, Professor Stephen Riordan and later, Dr Gregory Keogh. Professor Riordan is a staff specialist physician gastroenterologist/hepatologist at the Prince of Wales hospital and has worked there since 1999. He provided two statements dated 8 April 2013 and 12 March 2015. Dr Keogh is a senior staff specialist upper gastrointestinal surgeon at the Prince of Wales hospital and has worked there since 1995. He provided two statements dated 16 February 2015 and 12 March 2015. Both doctors gave evidence and were cross examined.

Evidence of Professor Stephen Riordan
On 23 January 2007, the plaintiff presented to the emergency department of Prince of Wales hospital with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis. Professor Riordan described those conditions as: "Jaundice is a build of bilirubin in the blood due to a number of different ideologies. Obstructive jaundice applies to when there's some pathology of the bile duct interrupting bile flow, so obstructive jaundice is that. And
Cholangitis is a very important complication of that in which there becomes infection of the bile and hence infection of the bile ducts and a systemic inflammatory illness consequently". (T134.30).
Professor Riordan telephoned St George hospital to obtain the results of the plaintiff's earlier ultrasound report. He gave evidence that the report was significant because it showed that although there were stones in the gallbladder, the clinical diagnosis was a problem with the bile duct. His evidence was: "This is a very important report because the issue in patients that have gall stones in the gallbladder is whether the symptoms and the signs are due to inflammation of the gallbladder itself from the gall stones, or whether those stones in the gallbladder are for the moment incidental and the pathology lies elsewhere. So what is looked for in an ultrasound, and this is done routinely, is to look for signs of cholecystitis. 
Our clinical diagnosis, as I mentioned, was not a problem with the gallbladder itself, sure there were stones in the gallbladder, but our clinical diagnosis was a problem with the bile duct so gallbladder, cystic duct coming off that and joining the bile duct and the bile duct drains into the bowel and the clinical diagnosis based on the history, the degree of jaundice and the pain, in particular, and the inflammatory element, raised white cell count, low ..(not transcribable).. level in blood the clinical diagnosis was bile duct pathology, Cholangitis, rather than acute cholecystitis and the cause for the bile duct problem was assumed but not proven by this report to most likely be a stone, a small stone that had come out of the gallbladder and passed into the bile duct and got stuck before passing through" (T134.41).
Professor Riordan, as a gastroenterologist and hepatologist, diagnosed cholangitis not cholecystitis. In my view, there was nothing inappropriate about this diagnosis and it was in accordance with competent professional medical practice.
Professor Riordan said that the appropriate treatment for cholangitis involves two key elements. First is antibiotic therapy and the second is to ensure biliary drainage [through an ERCP] because the effectiveness of antibiotics in reducing infection will be compromised if there is no potential for infected bile to flow. He explained that the vast majority of patients with biliary obstruction and cholangitis settle with antibiotics in the short term, but around 15-30% of patients do not settle with antibiotics alone. The medical team at Prince of Wales hospital decided to perform an ERCP upon the plaintiff. This was the same test that the medical team had decided to perform at St George hospital.
Professor Riordan says that the plaintiff was symptomatic, had had a stormy course over the previous eight days, and that it was important for the medical team to know that there was no biliary obstruction. The plaintiff received antibiotics.

Evidence of Dr Gregory Keogh
The plaintiff was referred to Dr Keogh, who reviews patients in both the adult outpatients department and within the professional suite of Prince of Wales hospital.
On 24 January 2007, the plaintiff was initially reviewed by Dr Keogh's Registrar, Dr Gandy. Dr Gandy made the preliminary diagnosis that the plaintiff had biliary sepsis and required an ERCP. The clinical notes record that Dr Gandy indicated that it would not have been "advantageous" to perform a cholecystectomy while the plaintiff had biliary sepsis and that a cholecystectomy could be performed at a later date. The plan was for Dr Keogh to review the plaintiff the following day and provide an opinion as to whether he required a cholecystectomy. It was noted that the plaintiff's liver function tests were normalising but his temperature was still high. Dr Keogh was aware that the plaintiff had undergone an ERCP earlier that day but this had been abandoned because his oxygen saturation levels had dropped to 78 % on room air.
On 25 January 2007, the plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Keogh. Dr Keogh's clinical diagnosis was cholangitis. In cross examination, Dr Keogh confirmed that the plaintiff did not have acute cholecystitis, and that this was based on clinical presentation and ultrasound findings (T162.6). Dr Keogh said that "the investigations, the presentation and the subsequent course of the illness were all consistent with an infection in the bile called cholangitis and were not consistent with cholecystitis which is inflammation of the gallbladder". Like the medical staff at St George hospital, Dr Keogh reviewed the ultrasound report and in combination with the plaintiff's clinical presentation, made a decision that the condition from which he suffered was cholangitis, not cholecystitis. This decision was appropriate and in accordance with competent professional medical practice.
Dr Keogh explained in evidence, that an ERCP is the intervention of choice to manage bile duct infection [cholangitis] as it drains the infected bile and usually removes the underlying gallstone cause. If ERCP is not possible, Dr Keogh said that radiological intervention to drain the bile is required, and if this is not possible, surgical intervention to explore the bile duct is then considered.
Dr Keogh's view was that in a patient such as the plaintiff, the decision to perform an initial ERCP was the most expedient and the safest. This is because to try and do an operation for cholangitis can be quite difficult. Sometimes if endoscopy and percutaneous approaches have failed, surgery is the only option. That may require laparoscopy, bile duct exploration and possibly open surgery. Dr Keogh gave evidence that In a man who is unwell systemically with infection, it is better to wait for the infection to resolve and aim to do the operation when they are better (T163.19-26).
Dr Keogh's opinion was that the decision to drain the bile duct by ERCP was the most appropriate way to manage the plaintiff's problem. The subsequent decision to perform a cholecystectomy at a staged interval, was the most appropriate decision on that day, and this remains his usual practice to this day.
The medical experts were asked whether it was in accordance with competent professional medical practice to recommend an ERCP on 25 January 2007 and proceed with the procedure on 30 January 2007. In the joint report, both Associate Professor Collier and Dr Vickers answered "yes" and Professor Smith answered "yes" but with a qualification, namely that "it would have been better had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy been performed". In cross examination, this issue was elaborated upon. Associate Professor Collier's evidence was that there is an ongoing debate in medicine and surgery, which has never quite resolved, as to whether there should be an initial ERCP to remove stones from the bile duct, or whether a cholecystectomy should be performed, removing stones from the bile duct at the same time as removing the gallbladder. He indicated that both procedures are accepted methods of management of the condition and would generally come down to local expertise.
In cross examination, Professor Smith agreed with the proposition that both procedures are accepted ways of management of this condition. He added that the condition that the plaintiff presented with is difficult to label and the way in which such problems are treated are a matter of local expertise. Professor Smith explained "People don't come in with a label on top of their head I have cholecystitis or I have obstructive jaundice... they come in with symptoms of pain and discomfort and they might have jaundice and it's a complex issue ... . When it's sort of a frequent problem mostly it's handled very well, occasionally things go haywire and it really does depend on local expertise to choose the right way to go". (T181.32).
Associate Professor Collier, Dr Vickers and Professor Smith agreed that the plaintiff was sick when he arrived at Prince of Wales hospital and needed some intervention, and whether "you went down that arms towards endoscopic management followed by surgery or initial surgical management [an ERCP] probably doesn't matter that much". They agreed that "both methods achieve a good outcome in the majority of patients". Professor Smith said that in a patient sick with infection from his bile duct, like the plaintiff, then there would be risks with surgery which would be ameliorated by clearing the bile duct first and letting the jaundice settle. Associate Professor Collier (T182.7) felt strongly that if the plaintiff was his patient he would have carried out the ERCP first. Dr Vickers' opinion on the decision to do an ERCP before surgery was that if a patient presented with no features of cholecystitis, no tenderness, no distension of the gallbladder and was deeply jaundiced, as the plaintiff was, then "that would lead you more to ERCP, and in this case that was the direction that this fellow was going, and it was the correct decision..."
Based on the medical experts' evidence, while both procedures were acceptable, it came down to local expertise, but as the plaintiff was sick with infection an ERCP should have been undertaken first. It is my view that the decision by Dr Keogh to carry out an ERCP first was made in accordance with competent medical professional practice.

The ERCP
After an unsuccessful attempt at an ERCP on 30 January 2007, the plaintiff underwent a successful ERCP performed by Dr Kurtovic, a staff specialist gastroenterologist. Dr Keogh does not perform ERCPs as they are not classified as a surgical procedure and can be performed by gastroenterologists. At Prince of Wales hospital, ERCPs are performed by the gastroenterology service. In other hospitals, ERCPs are performed by both gastroenterologists and surgeons, and in some hospitals, ERCPs are only performed by surgeons.
The ERCP showed no residual bile duct stones. The inspection of the plaintiff's ampulla endoscopically suggested that there had been recent passage of a stone. The bile was draining freely. Clinically, the plaintiff was improving. His liver function tests were improving. His fever settled fairly quickly.
On 31 January 2007, Dr Keogh recommended that the plaintiff have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy as an outpatient.

Discharge - 31 January 2007
On 31 January 2007, the clinical notes record that there was a discussion between the family and Dr S Jamani, a gastroenterologist. The clinical notes also recorded that the plaintiff's family wanted him to be discharged because he was paying overseas rates. The clinical notes (Ex 7, p 78) record: "1030 pt feeling improved c/o mild pain o/n  result of ERCP explained  obs stable  afeb.  will d/w surg team re: cholecystectomy  ? take over care ...  - d/w family - want to D/C pt today as are paying for overseas rates  - advised family of need to talk to surgical team before discharge  - family not willing to wait as state pt is feeling well  - unable to contact upper GI reg as in theatre,  - acute surgical reg in theatre.  - d/w gastro reg - refer pt to outpt clinic  for arrangement of time for lap chole.  - letter faxed to outpt clinic  - will contact pt with date/time of appt."
In contrast with these contemporaneous written notes, both Ms Wang and the plaintiff deny that a conversation took place between them and Dr Jamani. Ms Wang said that she, her eldest child (David Fan) and her youngest child went to the hospital together but she did not speak to a doctor because her English was poor. Ms Wang does not know if David Fan spoke to Dr Jamani. While David Fan was not cross examined on this topic, he was the only member of the family present at the hospital who could have interpreted for the plaintiff and Ms Wang and spoken to Dr Jamani.
Ms Wang denied that she is the family member who said that the plaintiff is paying overseas rates. In cross examination, Ms Wang said that the plaintiff was entitled to Medicare because he was married to her. Ms Wang's evidence was that they married on 26 January 2007 (T254.31) (this would have occurred when the plaintiff was an inpatient in hospital).
Despite a marriage taking place between Ms Wang and the plaintiff on 26 January 2007, I find it unlikely that his visa would have been processed in only a few days. As set out earlier in this judgment, I do not accept Ms Wang's evidence, that on 31 January 2007 the plaintiff was entitled to Medicare, as being correct.
The plaintiff gave evidence that when he was discharged from Prince of Wales hospital he was still suffering from persistent stomach pain. He says that he was told that after the ERCP there was "no stone in my chest" and that he could go home (T72.23-24).
The plaintiff gave the following evidence (at T72.32-50; T73.1-12): "Q. When you left the hospital on 31 January 2007 you were feeling well, that's true isn't it? 
A. I felt there was no stone in my chest. I felt good however I still couldn't eat, this is the fact. 
Q. You were feeling well, you agree with that? 
A. I felt this is what I can say, it was a big relief. In my mind I avoided a life threatening situation 
Q. You did not have a fever when you left the hospital? 
A. No, no fever. 
Q. You were told by the hospital to come back to the hospital if you became unwell? 
A. Yes. 
Q. You were told to come back to the hospital if you developed a fever? 
A. Yes. 
Q. You were told to come back to the hospital if you had any further pain?  ... 
Q. When you left the hospital you didn't have any pain, did you? 
A. Yes, I did but not too painful and also during any stage while I was in the hospital I tried to talk to the doctors or nurses for having an operation but there had been no response at all. It only turned up on 8 January we started to realise how to contact the theatre for operation. 
Q. You were told on 31 January 2007 that you needed to discuss your condition with the surgical team so that an arrangement could be made for an operation, that's true, isn't it? 
A. No."
On 31 January 2007, Dr Jamani referred the plaintiff to Dr Keogh for review. The referral recorded (Ex 7, p 15): "Thank you for reviewing this 44 yr old gentleman who was recently under the care of Prof. Riordan for biliary sepsis. (u/s at St George - showed stones in
GB). 
He presented to POW ED on 23/01/07 and had 2 ERCP. The second ERCP showed no sludge or calculi, a basket could not be inserted into the CBD. 
He was seen by the surgical team for opinion, who suggested lap chole as an outpatient in the near future. 
Could you kindly r/v re: lap cholecystectomy?"
Dr Keogh gave evidence that at the time of discharge, although the plaintiff's liver function test had not normalised, it was certainly improving, consistent with the pattern of a passage of a bile duct stone. Dr Keogh said that the plaintiff was deemed suitable to be discharged on the basis of improving jaundice and improving liver function tests and no abdominal symptoms. In addition to this, the plaintiff's white cell count was normal with a slight rise in the neutrophilfill count but this was consistent with improving infection. It was arranged for the plaintiff to attend the surgical outpatient clinic at Prince of Wales hospital. On 31 January 2007, the plaintiff was discharged from hospital. Ms Wang collected him.
The medical experts were asked whether it was in accordance with competent professional practice to discharge the plaintiff from Prince of Wales hospital on 31 January 2007 so that he could be reviewed in an outpatient clinic regarding a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Professor Collier (with whom Dr Vickers agreed) said yes, because the plaintiff was improving and the stone must have passed spontaneously. Professor Collier added that "there was an advantage in waiting for the jaundice to resolve which would decrease the risk of surgery". Professor Smith disagreed. He said no and explained "many people would have discharged, but I do not feel that it was appropriate. The raised white cell count and low albumin and the presence of fever suggests that the plaintiff was more ill than the staff realised."
The medical experts were cross examined on this issue. Counsel for the defendant showed the medical experts the hospital records which indicated that by 28 January 2007, the plaintiff was afebrile and by 30 January 2007, his white blood count had normalised, both in relation to the while blood count and the neutrophils. Counsel for the defendant also showed the medical experts the clinical note recorded on 31 January 2007 at 12.15 pm that "Family not willing to wait as patient is feeling well." Counsel then asked the medical experts to consider, given the plaintiff's physical condition at this time, whether it was in accordance with standard practice to discharge. After reviewing this information, Professor Smith changed his position and said that if the plaintiff wished to leave, that would be fine, so long as he had follow up arrangements. It is my view that the decision by Dr Keogh to discharge the plaintiff was in accordance with competent medical professional practice.
The medical experts were also asked, as at 31 January 2007, what degree of urgency was attached to the need for the plaintiff to undergo surgical review to determine when a cholecystectomy should take place. Dr Vickers said that as the plaintiff was improving and getting over cholangitis with his bilirubin improving, the surgery was not urgent and it was better to wait for him to improve further. Associate Professor Collier said that the review needed to take place in two to three weeks, as there was an advantage in waiting for the jaundice to resolve which would decrease the risk of surgery. Professor Smith said that the surgery was not immediately urgent. In summary the medical experts agree that the surgery was not immediately urgent.
David Fan asked the medical experts whether a reduced appetite and weight loss would reinforce the case for a quicker surgery. Dr Vickers said "All I think you can say from that is that he doesn't have any acute abdominal signs to indicate cholecystitis and that he wasn't eating at a time when his blood tests were improving so to me that would indicate there's a separate cause for his not eating and that separate cause could be just the fact that he's recovering from an acute illness, from a serious illness." According to Dr Vickers, "it does not necessarily mean that he needs to have another urgent operation because he had no features, he had to indicate ongoing acute illness because all of his blood indices are improving and his abdomen is reported to be normal" and "you couldn't justify a decision to do an operation on that." Associate Professor Collier agreed that appetite is not an absolute in terms of an indication for operation. He also said that "it is often the case when we do ERCP on patients with cholangitis you see ulceration in the duodenum, it's a common finding at the same time and the ulceration can lead to appetite changes so I think that Professor Riordan's suggestion maybe a repeat endoscopy was appropriate was a reasonable option to think about why he wasn't eating, not to go for urgent surgery to correct an appetite disorder which was not explained fully". In other words, as at 31 January 2007, although the plaintiff had reduced appetite and some weight loss, urgent surgery was not required. The medical opinion is that as at 31 January 2007, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not immediately urgent.
Based on the medical experts' opinion, the plaintiff did not have acute cholecystitis as at 31 January 2007 so it was appropriate that acute cholecystitis was not diagnosed. Adopting the opinion of the medical experts, in my view the surgery was not urgent and the decision to discharge the plaintiff and delay the cholecystectomy was in accordance with competent medical professional practice.

Gastroenterology Outpatient clinic of Prince of Wales hospital on 8 February 2007
On 8 February 2007, the plaintiff attended the gastroenterology outpatient clinic at Prince of Wales hospital conducted by Professor Riordan. The plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Kim, a surgical registrar. There was no interpreter present. The plaintiff gave evidence that Dr Riordan "only showed his face for a second from a room at the very end of the outpatient clinic" and that he did not exchange any words with Professor Riordan (T73.22; T74). The plaintiff also gave evidence that he told Dr Kim that he had reduced appetite and that he had constant pain in his abdomen, and that the abdominal pain was more severe than before but of a different type. The plaintiff says he did not have severe constant pain, fevers, raised temperature or sweating. The plaintiff also gave evidence that he did not mention unsteadiness or difficulty walking because at that time he did not have such difficulties. However, the plaintiff then stated that over the next few days, he felt "lightness" while he was walking. He described the feeling as"like walking on a cloud". He says he did not tell the doctor about it but that is how he felt. He says that walking was not difficult at that time because he could control himself.
On 8 February 2007, neither Dr Kim or Professor Riordan diagnosed the plaintiff with cholecystitis. Professor Riordan referred the plaintiff to the surgical outpatient clinic conducted by Dr Keogh on 15 February 2007.
The medical experts were asked what degree of urgency there was to perform the cholecystectomy that was recommended on 8 February 2007. Associate Professor Collier in the joint report said that the procedure was not urgent as the plaintiff "did not have acute cholecystitis" and there was a benefit to delay because jaundice, after stones are removed or passed from the bile duct, can take several weeks to resolve. It was better, he concluded, to let the jaundice resolve completely before embarking upon surgery. Dr Vickers, in the joint report (Q4, p 7), did not wish to comment, as it was a surgical matter. Professor Smith's comment, in the joint report, is that the surgery was due to be undertaken within 30 days from the outpatient appointment.
As at 8 February 2007, the expert medical opinion was that the plaintiff did not have cholecystitis and that the operation was not urgent. Hence, it was appropriate and in accordance with competent medical professional practice that neither Dr Kim or Professor Riordan diagnosed the plaintiff with cholecystitis, and for the cholecystectomy to be delayed.

Surgical review on 15 February 2007
On 15 February 2007, the plaintiff attended the Prince of Wales surgical outpatient clinic and was reviewed by Dr Keogh. David Fan accompanied the plaintiff.
It is not disputed that on 15 February 2007, a conversation took place between the plaintiff and Dr Keogh. However, there is a dispute as to whether the plaintiff told Dr Keogh that he was experiencing severe pain. Dr Keogh performed liver function tests on the plaintiff. The plaintiff gave evidence that Dr Keogh did not examine him physically and that he told Dr Keogh that he had severe pain. It is Dr Keogh's evidence that the plaintiff informed him that he had no further pain and he recorded it in his clinical notes.
During cross examination, Dr Keogh gave evidence that when he saw the plaintiff on 15 February 2007, he formed an opinion that the plaintiff did not have acute cholecystitis (T165.35).
The plaintiff's evidence is that by this stage, he had developed difficulty walking, his legs were weak and when he walked he had to hold onto some support. He says this problem was constant. The plaintiff admitted that he did not tell Dr Keogh about this unsteadiness nor about his difficulties when walking. So far as the plaintiff's weight was concerned, Dr Keogh said that there was no obvious malnutrition and no obvious recent weight loss because if there had been significant weight loss, it would have been noted. I accept that based upon Dr Keogh's usual practice, he would normally make a note of weight loss and malnutrition.
The plaintiff agreed that he and Dr Keogh (with David Fan acting as interpreter) discussed the plan for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Despite the fact that this was the same operation that the plaintiff had requested be performed on 22 January 2007 at St George hospital, he says that on 15 February 2007, he expressed the view that he was "strongly opposed" to having the operation. As there was no independent interpreter present, Dr Keogh did not obtain the plaintiff's written consent for the operation to be performed. Instead, he directed the plaintiff to attend the preadmission clinic on a later date in order to ensure that he properly consented to having the procedure performed. Dr Keogh completed the "Recommendation for Admission Form" and wrote to Professor Riordan to advising him of the plan for the plaintiff to be placed on a waiting list to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Dr Keogh's letter to Professor Riordan is dated 15 August 2007 (it should read 15 February 2007).
Dr Keogh's aim (in terms of clinical priority) was to operate on the plaintiff within 30 days. That clinical priority was based on an assessment of whether the plaintiff would potentially run into medical complications while awaiting surgery. Dr Keogh was of the opinion that "it was safe to put off surgery for a short period" because the plaintiff had no gallbladder symptoms that prompted urgent surgery. Dr Keogh's evidence is that at that time, a delay of 30 to 40 days was reasonable.
The procedure for allocating a date for surgery is that once the preadmission clinic receives the preadmission forms, a date for surgery is automatically generated according to the clinical priority of the patient as noted on the form by the referring doctor. In this case, the scheduled date for surgery was 28 February 2007.
I accept the opinion of Dr Keogh that as at 15 February 2007, the operation was not urgent and it remained safe to put off surgery for a short period. I also accept the finding of Dr Keogh that the plaintiff did not have cholecystitis on 15 February 2007. These surgical and diagnostic decisions made by Dr Keogh on 15 February 2007, were appropriate and made in accordance with competent professional medical practice.

Prince of Wales hospital pre-admission clinic on 21 February 2007
On 21 February 2007, the plaintiff attended the Prince of Wales hospital preadmissions clinic for a pre-operative appointment in anticipation of his surgery, which was then scheduled for 28 February 2007. He was accompanied by David Fan. Ms Wang was not present.

Was the plaintiff 44 kilograms?
A critical fact in issue at this hearing, which has to be determined, is whether the plaintiff's weight was 44 kilograms when he attended this pre-operative appointment. It appears that the plaintiff's actual weight had not been recorded in his earlier admissions to both St George and Prince of Wales hospitals. The only reference to weight appears in the clinical notes dated 20 January 2007 where it is recorded, "no weight loss" (Ex 6, p 482). The first time that the plaintiff's weight is recorded in the hospital notes is on 13 March 2007 where it was 61 kilograms. On 14, 15 and 16 March 2007, it was also recorded in the hospital notes as approximately 61 kilograms.
On 10 May 2007, the plaintiff's weight fell to approximately 55 kilograms. On 11 May 2007, it had increased to 60.8 kilograms. On 30 April 2007, the plaintiff's weight was next recorded as 60 kilograms. Weight is usually accurate to within half a kilogram, provided the same scales are used (T186.33). [A chart of the plaintiff's recorded weight appears later in this judgment].
The plaintiff's version of events that occurred on 21 February 2007 is contained in his statement at [8]. It is as follows: "8. I and my son attended Pre-Admissions Clinic (Peri-Operative Unit) at
POW Hospital. Upon arrival at the Peri-Operative Unit: a. My son has went to the service desk enquired in regards to my appointment.  b. The (sic) we have been directed to follow a line straight down the hall way, into a room for assessment.  c. In that room, there was a female staff member, waiting for us, and then
I and my son was welcomed into the room by the staff member, and then we all sat down.  d. The female staff held a form, and started asking questions to me, then my son translated for me and I responded with answers, which my son then translated into English. In the process, the female staff member wrote down the answers on a piece of form.  e. After completion of the form, I and my son was asked to go to another room.  f. In this room, there was another female staff member. This female staff has taken some of my blood.  g. Then I stepped up to the scale it was 44 kilos. Then I called the female staff member, and then she came and saw the scale, she stated: '44 kilos'.  h. Then I saw she wrote the weight 44 kilos on to the form."
David Fan's version of events mirrored the plaintiff's version of what occurred at the clinic. At [8] he says: "8. I and my father carried a letter from POWH dated 19 February 2007, which confirmed his surgery was booked for 28 February 2007. This letter requested his attendance at the pre-operative unit.  . I and my father attended Pre-Admissions Clinic (Peri-Operative Unit) at
POW Hospital. Upon arrival at the Peri-Operative Unit.
 a. I went to the service desk enquired in regards to his appointment.  b. Then me and my father have been directed to follow a line straight down the hall way, into a room for assessment.  c. In that room, there was a female staff member, waiting for us, and then me and my father was welcomed into the room by the staff member, and then we all sat down.  d. The female staff held a form, and started asking questions. I have translated those for my father, and he responded with answers, than I translated them into English, and responded to the female staff member.
 i. In the process, the female staff member wrote down the answers on a piece of form.  ii. After completion of the form, me and my father was asked to go to another room.
 e. In this room, there was another female staff member. This female staff has taken some of my father's blood.  f. Then my father stepped up to the scale it was 44 kilos. Then my father called the female staff member, and then she came and saw the scale, she stated: '44 kilos'.  g. Then I saw her wrote the weight 44 kilos on to the form.  h. After this pre-operative unit, me and my father left the unit, and went to a cashier.
 i. I and my father have paid $500.00 for the surgery on that day, which is due to be performed on 28 February 2007, by Dr Keogh.  ii. I remembered the cashier wrote us a receipt, and she stated 'Dr Keogh is a very good doctor ...'."
At [10] to [12] of his statement David Fan set out a conversation he had with Ms Wang when he arrived home with his father. Ms Wang also referred to this conversation in her statement.
 "10. Upon return to my home, my mother opens the door. My father's first response to my mother was: 'My weight is at 44 kilos'.  . A bit later on, I told her the same thing, I said: 'my father's weight today is 44 kilos'.  . I also told my mother that 'my father has been checked by an elderly lady, blood tests, weighed at 44 kilos etc. And the check up date was written and documented'."
The plaintiff did not mention in his statement that he said to Ms Wang in the presence of David Fan that, "my weight is at 44 kilos".
At the clinic, both the plaintiff and David Fan say they were first directed to one room where a female staff member (the first female staff member) was waiting for them. They all sat down. That first female staff member asked the plaintiff a number of questions. David Fan translated for the plaintiff. The first female staff member wrote down the answers on "a piece of the form". After that task was completed, both the plaintiff and David Fan were directed to another room where there was another female staff member present (the second female staff member). She took the plaintiff's blood and, they say, weighed the plaintiff. The plaintiff and David Fan say that after the plaintiff stepped onto the scales, the plaintiff called the second female staff member; she came and looked at the weight recorded on the scales and said "44 kgs". Both the plaintiff and David Fan say they saw that she "wrote the weight 44 kilos on the form". In cross examination, the plaintiff stated that all the paragraphs in his statement were based on his own memory of the events (T67.44-46).
However, when the plaintiff was cross examined as to his observation of his weight being 44 kilograms, he contradicted the evidence in his statement about witnessing the second female staff member write down "44kgs". The plaintiff admitted that he only saw the weight on the scale, but did not see it written down on the form. His evidence was: "Q. You were only saw the weight on the scale; is that what you are telling her Honour? 
A. Yes. 
Q. You didn't see your weight on the form; is that what you're telling her
Honour? 
A. Correct." (T98.1-7)
In cross examination when asked about the accuracy of his recollection of his weight of 44kgs, the plaintiff said: "Q. In your statement which you have said is true you said that, "then I saw she wrote the weight 44 kilos onto the form". That was a deliberate lie in your statement, wasn't it? 
A. Incorrect. Because the nurse got the figure and she wrote 44, regarding how she wrote it I couldn't see. 
Q. You were prepared to lie in your statement to try and prove that you were weighed on that day, weren't you? 
A. INTERPRETER: Which statement prove I was lying? 
Q. In your statement when you said that you read the form? 
A. I only said she wrote it in the form. Regarding what was written in the form she didn't show me." (T98.9-21).
There is no entry in the hospital records which records the plaintiff's weight being taken on the 21 February 2007.
The second female staff member, who took the plaintiff's blood on the 21 February 2007 and who the plaintiff and David Fan allege took the plaintiff's weight, was identified as Janet Beetles. She provided a statement (Ex 14) and was briefly cross examined (T236-237). Ms Beetles' evidence was that she had no specific recollection of the plaintiff or of taking a blood sample from him. However, relying on the pathology form dated 21 February 2007 signed by her (a copy is annexed to her statement) she confirmed that she had taken a blood sample from him. She gave evidence that since the plaintiff was not attending an anaesthetic clinic on that day there would have been no requirement to weigh him.
However, in cross examination Ms Beetles conceded that while it is not the practice to weigh patients at pre admission clinics, the only way the plaintiff could have been weighed is if a doctor had asked her to weigh him. Hence, she could not deny the possibility that he could have been weighed (T236). However, had she weighed the plaintiff, it would have been more likely than not that she would have recorded the plaintiff's weight in her clinical notes for the doctor's information.
Ms Wang provided a corroborative version of the plaintiff and David Fan's version based on what she had been told by the plaintiff and David Fan when they arrived home. At [7] to [10] of her statement she says: "7. On the 21 February 2007, I was at home. I know my Son accompanied my husband to POW Hospital, peri-operative unit for pre-surgery assessments. With them is a letter from POW Hospital dated 19 February 2007.  . After I open the door, my husband my son arrived home. My husband's first response was: 'My weight is 44kilos'.  . A bit later on, my son told the same thing, he said: 'my father's weight today is 44 kilos'.  . My son also told me that 'my father has been checked by an elderly lady, blood tests, weighed at 44kilos etc. And the check up date was written and documented'."
In cross examination, Ms Wang reiterated that both the plaintiff and her son had told her on 21 February 2007 that the plaintiff's weight was 44 kilograms.
I accept that there is a later representation made by the plaintiff on 3 May 2007, recorded in the notes of the clinical dietician that states, "pt reported that he was down to 44 kgs (24/2/07) while waiting for cholecystectomy" (Ex B, Tab O, p 577).
Counsel for the defendant submitted that there is nothing inherently unreliable about the evidence of Ms Beetles. He submitted that it is possible that the plaintiff and David Fan were mistaken in relation to the plaintiff's weight because at the time, the plaintiff was 44 years old and it is far more likely that an entry of "44" in the hospital notes was a reference to the plaintiff's age, not his weight.
The medical experts were asked about the plaintiff's apparent weight loss of 28 kilograms that according to him occurred in the space of between two and three weeks. Dr Vicker's view was, "I think it's almost impossible in medicine to lose 28 kilograms of weight in the space of two or three weeks that we're talking about here, without some obvious features of serious illness, and for a person to walk into hospital and come back two or three times. I think that is almost impossible. Someone would have to be on their deathbed, and they have to stay in hospital, to lose 28 kilograms of weight in a short space of time." (T182-23). At the conclave, Dr Vickers was the only medical expert to address this issue.

Weight loss - SIADH?
An explanation for the plaintiff's alleged rapid weight gain following his alleged rapid weight loss was postulated by David Fan. David Fan suggested to the medical experts that the plaintiff was suffering from Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion ("SIADH") which was caused by his brain injury. SIADH is an abnormal condition characterised by the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone ("ADH") that alters the body's fluid and electrolytic balances. It results in various malfunctions. Common signs and symptoms of SIADH are weight gain despite anorexia, vomiting, nausea, muscle weakness and irritability (Mosby's p 1667).
David Fan drew the medical experts attention to clinical notes dated 13 March 2007 from St George hospital (Ex B, Vol 2, p 265) that record "?SIADH - 2 degree to Head injury". David Fan suggested that this syndrome had caused the plaintiff to put the weight back on and bring the plaintiff's weight back to 61 kilograms by 13 March 2007. Dr Vickers explained it this way (T184.5-10): "To a degree anti diuretic hormone is a natural hormone secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain, that's one of the body's protective ways of retaining water in cases of dehydration, but an inappropriate response is an abnormal response and that will be brought on by various drugs and head injuries. And what happens then the body retains water inappropriately and dilutes all chemistry of the body on blood tests."
Professor Smith answered that the effect of SIADH would make the plaintiff heavier not lighter so "I don't know what you are getting at, sorry ..." (T186.22).
Associate Professor Collier said that if the plaintiff had the inappropriate ADH secretion he would have retained some fluid which may have increased his weight. However, he stated that the weight increase alleged by the plaintiff was unlikely. The reason for that, he said, was that most people with an appropriate ADH will experience a 5% weight gain. The 10% weight gain alleged by the plaintiff was, in Associate Professor Collier's opinion, not compatible with life (T186.41-50).
Dr Vickers opinion on the SIADH issue was similar to that of Professor Smith and Associate Professor Collier (T187.1). Dr Vickers opined that: "... the treatment of inappropriate ADH is fluid restriction, so if his weight between 13 and 16 March is fairly stable it means that he was receiving proper medical treatment by having fluid restriction. Now, 1 lite of water is equal to 1 kilogram of weight, and if he had gained a little bit of weight from this injury between 9 March to 13 March, it would have only been minimal, perhaps three or 4 kilograms. On the 9 March he was an unknown weight; on 13
March he'[s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s61.html) kilograms. Now, the most he could probably drink in a day is 2 kilograms or 2 litres of fluid, so the most he could have gained would be two or 3 kilograms per day, because 1 litre of water is equal to 1 kilogram. Nobody could possibly drink 5 or 6 kilograms of water per day or 5 or 6 litres of water per day." (T187.15).
As to whether the plaintiff weighed 44 kilograms on 21 February 2007, the evidence given by the plaintiff, David Fan and Ms Wang on this topic conflicts with the evidence of Nurse Beetles, the hospital records and the evidence of the medical experts. Firstly, there is no hospital record of the plaintiff being weighed on 21 February 2007. Secondly, in cross examination the plaintiff changed his evidence, from that he saw the second female staff member write down the words "44 kgs", to that he saw the weight on the scales but he did not see the weight of 44 kilograms written on the form. The plaintiff gave evidence that "What was written in the form she didn't show me." If Nurse Beetles did not show the plaintiff what she had written, then it is difficult to accept the evidence in the plaintiff's statement that, "I saw her wrote the weight 44 kilos on to the form."
Ms Wang's evidence on this topic is of little evidentiary value as she simply records what she was told by the plaintiff and David Fan, although it is very odd that the plaintiff does not mention in his statement that he said anything about his weight to her when he arrived home. If the plaintiff did not say anything about his weight to Ms Wang, David Fan could not have heard him do so. Whether or not the plaintiff said anything to Ms Wang when he arrived home adds nothing to the veracity of their versions. While there is a hospital note, made some months later, that the plaintiff informed the dietician he weighed 44 kilograms on 21 February 2007, I find that this is either a reconstruction or that he is mistaken. Thirdly, the medical experts do not accept the proposition that the plaintiff could have weighed 44 kilograms on 21 February 2007 and then weighed 61 kilograms on 13 March 2007, even when the SIADH explanation was taken into account. For these reasons I do not accept that the plaintiff weighed 44 kilograms on 21 February 2007.

Cancellation of surgery scheduled for 28 February 2007
On 22 February 2007, Dr Keogh received a call from Mr Gavin Meredith (the waiting list manager) who asked whether the plaintiff's cholecystectomy could be postponed in light of the plaintiff's outstanding debt to the hospital (on the basis that he was ineligible for Medicare).
Dr Keogh considered that it was safe to put off surgery for a period. Hence, the plaintiff's clinical priority was changed from 30 to 90 days. However, even though the form for surgery stated 90 days, Dr Keogh says that there was no intention to postpone the surgery for a period approaching 90 days, and that the plan was to perform surgery within a period of more than 30 but less than 40 days. Dr Keogh's evidence was that there was no clinical urgency to perform a cholecystectomy at that time as the underlying problem had been managed successfully. As there were no gallbladder symptoms that required prompt surgery, the cholecystectomy would be performed within an appropriate time frame and this was deemed appropriate treatment (Ex 2, p 49).
During cross examination, Dr Keogh gave evidence that after he had seen the plaintiff's blood tests from 21 February, he was still of the opinion that the plaintiff did not have acute cholecystitis (T165.43).
On 22 February 2007, the plaintiff was advised that his operation, scheduled for 27 February 2007, had been cancelled.
In my view, it was appropriate and in accordance with competent professional medical practice for the cholecystectomy scheduled for 27 February 2007 to be cancelled by Dr Keogh on 22 February on the basis it was to be performed in the near future.
On 26 February 2007, the plaintiff says that he fell while he was walking from the kitchen to the living room of his family home. He says he did not hit his head. He did not seek medical attention.

Appointment with Dr Chu
On 27 February 2007, the plaintiff attended Dr Chu's private rooms in Miranda. The plaintiff says that he was still suffering from abdominal pain, jaundiced and vomiting. However, in cross examination, the plaintiff said that when he saw Dr Chu the jaundice had gone. The plaintiff's evidence is that Dr Chu examined him physically and touched his abdomen, which was tender. The plaintiff says he reported to Dr Chu that he had a fall on 26 February 2007.
Dr Chu's evidence (Ex 8 [4]) is as follows: "4. On 27 February 2007 I consulted Mr Fan in my private rooms upon referral from his GP regarding elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mr Fan was no longer jaundiced and his abdomen was soft and non tender. He expressed concern about his lack of a Medicare card and that there was a waiting period of two months under his private health insurance. I provided him a Request for Admission Form for Sutherland Hospital to have an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As his abdomen was soft and non tender he did not warrant an emergency operation. I wrote a letter to Mr Fan's GP dated 27 February 2007."
I prefer and accept the evidence of Dr Chu that on 27 February 2007, the plaintiff was no longer jaundiced and his abdomen was soft and non tender. Dr Chu does not mention the plaintiff informing him of a fall on 26 February 2007.
The medical experts were asked whether, on 27 February 2007, having regard to the plaintiff's condition at that time, there was a degree of urgency to perform the cholecystectomy scheduled 27 February 2007 but cancelled on the 22 February 2007. In the joint report, Associate Professor Collier's view was that it was not urgent as there was no acute cholecystitis and the procedure could be done electively. Dr Vickers said it was purely a surgical matter but that the plaintiff needed to get better with nutrition and antibiotics prior to surgery. Professor Smith held the view that since there were signs of sepsis with a raised white cell count and a decreased albumin and fever, and a question of tenderness and whether or not the plaintiff had an inflamed gallbladder; that consequently, there was more urgency to perform surgery than those treating the plaintiff appreciated. Professor Smith added that the plaintiff did not need to be taken straight to theatre, but that he required treatment in the form of antibiotics and monitoring and to be kept in hospital so that the procedure could be done on the next routine operating list.
Counsel for the defendant asked the medical experts to assume that when the plaintiff saw Dr Chu on 27 February 2007, he was no longer jaundiced and his abdomen was soft and non tender. On those assumptions the doctors were firstly asked whether there was any evidence of acute cholecystitis, and secondly, whether there was anything that would lead to a change in urgency of the operation. In the light of these factors, Professor Smith significantly changed his position by saying: "WOODS: Doctors, the plaintiff saw a Dr Chu on 27 February 2007, and I want you to assume that at that stage he was no longer jaundiced and his abdomen was soft and tender, knowing those pieces of information was there any evidence at that time of acute cholecystitis?  ... 
SMITH: No, no evidence, but as it recovers, you know, he's not necessarily still tender but it doesn't necessarily mean it's not recovering and therefore going through the healing process of information. 
WOODS: Is there anything in the clinical examination by Dr Chu, based on the material that I provided to you, that would lead to a change in urgency of operation?  ... 
SMITH: No. 
WOODS: Would it even be correct to say that at the time that Dr Chu saw the plaintiff it was appropriate for Dr Chu to organise surgery within about 30 days or so of his examination of the plaintiff? 
SMITH: It would be very reasonable." (T213.21-44).
Dr Vickers' opinion was that on 27 February 2007 there was "no evidence of cholecystitis" (T213.26) and that there was nothing in the clinical examination conducted by Dr Chu that would lead to a change in urgency of the operation (T213.36). Associate Professor Collier did not address whether there was evidence of cholecystitis but added that in his opinion it was "quite appropriate" for Dr Chu to organise surgery within 30 days of the examination (T213.46).
The medical expert's agreed that there was nothing inappropriate about Dr Chu's examination of the plaintiff. They agreed that there was no evidence of cholecystitis and that it was reasonable and appropriate for Dr Chu to organise surgery within 30 days of the examination. As at 27 February 2007, the plaintiff was no longer jaundiced and his abdomen was soft and non tender. I agree with the opinions of the medical experts, that it was appropriate and in accordance with competent medical professional practice for Dr Chu not to diagnose the plaintiff with cholecystitis and to delay the cholecystectomy.
During the period between the plaintiff attending Prince of Wales hospital on 21 February 2007 up until his admission to Sutherland hospital on 8 March 2007, he says that he became weaker and weaker because he could not eat any food. David Fan also said that the plaintiff had progressively lost weight during this period. When asked what he observed during this period, David Fan replied that he noticed that the plaintiff's appearance had shrunk, especially in his face, arms and the muscles on his arms. (T103.11-13).
The cholecystectomy surgery was scheduled to be performed at Sutherland hospital on 30 March 2007. However, prior to the surgery, the plaintiff was admitted to Sutherland hospital.

Admission to Sutherland hospital on 8 March 2007
On 8 March 2007, at approximately 11.00 pm, the plaintiff was admitted to Sutherland hospital. He was accompanied by Ms Wang. David Fan was not present. The plaintiff complained of abdominal pain, jaundice, vomiting and persistent reduced appetite.
Ms Wang (statement [14]) says that after the plaintiff saw the doctor in the emergency department, he gave his admission letter for his cholecystectomy, scheduled for 30 March 2007 at Sutherland hospital, to the doctor. As Ms Wang and the plaintiff do not speak English, the doctor found a member of hospital staff who did speak Mandarin. At that time, Ms Wang said she spoke to the doctor and informed him that "since February, Wei Fan's eating capacity has been progressively reduced." Ms Wang also said "Patient feels hunger all the times; after dinner tonight, he had vomited a few times; it's progressively worse one after another. Last vomit, is consist of coloured liquid." Ms Wang says that the female person said "she will interpret it and inform the doctor who is looking after Wei Fan."
At approximately 3.30 am on 9 March 2007, Ms Wang says that the plaintiff was on the bed with the IV drip next to him. He was still vomiting sometimes. In addition, Ms Wang saw that the liquid consisted of a small amount of blood. Ms Wang took the bag with the vomit and gave it to the nurse. The plaintiff was seen by a doctor and given an IV injection. The emergency nursing assessment records from 3.30 am (Ex 4, Vol 3, p 52) indicate that when that injection was given, the medical registrar who spoke Mandarin was present. The clinical notes record: "0330 Pt placed in bed by RMO. Pt speaks NO English. Med reg speaks pt's language -  nil known allergies, decrease oral intake and vomiting.? Bloated feeling in central abdomen. Bowels not opened for 2 days.

Nil anagesea taken today. Denies urinary symptoms. Hx of Gallstones. Given mg IVI maxalon, N/saline, 1L commenced STAT. Pt transferred to MID. Await further instructions."
Dr Syed Aziez, a registrar; Associate Professor Sanjay Warrier (who is now a surgeon, but who at the time was a surgical registrar); and Shannon Fuchs, an emergency department registered nurse, were involved in the plaintiff's care at Sutherland hospital during this admission. They all provided statements (Exs 17, 16 and 15 respectively) but were not required for cross examination.
Dr Aziez had a recollection of the plaintiff, David Fan and Ms Wang's attendance at Sutherland hospital on 9 March 2007. He relied upon his perusal of the clinical records and his usual practice together with his recollection in making his statement.
At 3.45 am on 9 March 2007, Dr Aziez reviewed the plaintiff. An interpreter and Ms Wang were present. Dr Aziez took a history from the plaintiff. He was told that the plaintiff had been experiencing abdominal pain since 4.00 pm the previous afternoon, that he had been vomiting and that his vomit was yellow or green (indicative of it being bilious). Dr Aziez was told that the plaintiff had been well until he developed pain and was diagnosed with acute cholelithiasis, and that he was booked for a cholecystectomy on 30 March 2007 at Sutherland Hospital. Dr Aziez was also told by the plaintiff that he had been constipated since the Tuesday before and that he had abdominal distension and vomiting. Dr Aziez said in his statement that he did not remember the plaintiff vomiting when he reviewed him.
Dr Aziez conducted a physical examination of the plaintiff. He noted that the plaintiff's abdomen was distended with percussion and that it was tympanitic all over (which meant that there was probably lots of gas in his stomach). There were no gut sounds, meaning the plaintiff probably had either intestinal obstruction or paralytic ileus. Dr Aziez's assessment was that the plaintiff may have had an intestinal obstruction or obstructive jaundice. He did not diagnose the plaintiff with cholecystitis. Again, my view is that this diagnosis by Dr Aziez, as a medical registrar, was appropriate and in accordance with competent medical professional practice.
Dr Aziez's plan was for the plaintiff to undergo blood tests and x-rays, be given IV fluids and to undergo surgical review. The plaintiff subsequently underwent blood tests, x-rays and IV fluids were administered. A surgical review took place. As a result of that review, the cholecystectomy scheduled for 30 March 2007 was brought forward to take place on 12 March 2007.

Did the plaintiff discharge himself against medical advice?
On the morning of 9 March 2007, the emergency nursing assessment records record: "0730 Pt alert. Pt denies pain when asked. Awaiting surg R/N.
 Pt wishing to D/C self. Med reg interpreting for pt to surg Reg. Pt not wishing to pay for admission, attempting to contact Area Health interpreter service, have now been on hold 25mins, pt has signed form to D/C self against medical advice as explained to him by med Reg, pt keep holding this form up to staff, pt is now changed into own clothes.  Interpreter booked 0930 with surg reg. Pt not interested in staying and seems to understand the meeting has been arranged.  IVC out as pt stated he would go home with it in.  Pt left hospital after phoning wife."
Ms Fuchs wrote the above progress notes. She deposed that she did not have any actual recollection of the plaintiff attending Sutherland hospital on 9 March 2007. She relied on the progress notes in preparing her statement. She observed that those notes were particularly detailed. She said that it is not her usual practice to record notes in such detail unless she is concerned about a particular issue. Her view is that in a situation such as this, where a patient was emphatic about discharging against medical advice, she would record detailed notes to make it clear that appropriate medical advice was offered and that the patient was assuming full responsibility for their own health.
As referred to in the progress notes, shortly after 8.00 am on 9 March 2007, there was a discussion between the plaintiff and Associate Professor Warrier (Associate Professor Warrier was the "surg Reg" referred to in the 0810 entry). Dr Aziez was present. At that time, Dr Aziez was aware that the plaintiff had been reviewed by a surgical registrar and that the intention was for him to undergo a cholecystectomy on 12 March 2007. Dr Aziez's recollection was that a member of the hospital staff was interpreting, and that at the same time another member of staff was attempting to get in touch with the interpreter service. Dr Aziez heard Associate Professor Warrier tell the plaintiff that he needed to have an operation. The plaintiff, through the staff member interpreting, said words to the effect, "I am not willing to pay for the admission" and "I have signed the discharge form". Dr Aziez recalled the plaintiff holding the discharge form up and showing it to Associate Professor Warrier. An official interpreter was booked to attend at 9.30am, but the plaintiff said that he was not willing to wait for the interpreter to come. Dr Aziez said that throughout the course of the discussion between Associate Professor Warrier and the plaintiff, the plaintiff was able to repeat back the information he had been told, indicating that he understood it.

Associate Professor Warrier recorded that the plaintiff was to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and that he had a history of presenting with vomiting, abdominal discomfort and bloating. He conducted a physical examination of the plaintiff and noted that there was mild abdominal distension and that bowel sounds were present. This meant that the plaintiff required a hospital admission. Associate Professor Warrier's plan was to administer intravenous antibiotics and an anti-coagulant to the plaintiff prior to his surgery, which was still scheduled for 12 March 2007 (which was in 3 days time).
Associate Professor Warrier had limited recollection of the events. He does not believe he was present when the plaintiff discharged himself against medical advice. He had previously communicated to the plaintiff, through a medical registrar who was interpreting, that it had been planned for the plaintiff to undergo a cholecystectomy. He believed that his noting of *Private* in his notes was probably in reference to the plaintiff's status as a private patient.
At about 8.00 am on 9 March 2007, Associate Professor Warrier handed over the plaintiff's case to the day shift surgical registrar. It was intended that the plaintiff undergo further surgical review with the day registrar together with an authorised interpreter.
Both Associate Professor Warrier and Dr Aziez deny that they told the plaintiff that he would be able to leave Sutherland hospital after the IV fluids had been administered. Associate Professor Warrier said he did not at any time inform the plaintiff that he could go home. He said that usual practice, when surgery is planned, is to keep the patient in hospital until that surgery takes place.
The plaintiff gave evidence that he told the doctors that he was not willing to pay for the hospital admission and was going to discharge himself, because at the time he did not have any money.
The plaintiff disputes that he discharged himself against medical advice. The plaintiff's evidence is that he was told that he could go home from Sutherland hospital sometime during that morning. He says that he thinks that it was the doctor who gave him the IV injection that told him that he could go home after the injection he could go home. However, he also admitted that they did not tell him that he was well enough to go home. Later in evidence, the plaintiff said that the doctor who gave him the IV infusion told Ms Wang he could go home after the infusion.
According to Ms Wang, at around 5.00 am a doctor came to the plaintiff's bed and appeared to be looking at the hospital chart. Ms Wang asked the doctor "Can he go home?" The doctor replied "Yes". The plaintiff's evidence is that he overheard the doctor telling Ms Wang this, as she was next to him at the time, at the side of the bed. Ms Wang's evidence is that she talked to the Mandarin speaking registrar about the plaintiff's condition and that at 5.00 am the plaintiff was told he could go home. Ms Wang says that the doctor only replied yes, but he did not get an interpreter to speak to her, nor did he tell her the diagnosis or the severity of the plaintiff's illness. She volunteered the opinion that maybe the plaintiff should have been categorised as an intensive care patient. She also said that the hospital did not initiate the protective processes of intensive care of putting the rails on both sides of the beds up or providing a wheelchair. I find it curious that Ms Wang volunteered this opinion as she said the doctor had told her that the plaintiff could go home.
The plaintiff confirmed that at about 7.50 am he was seen by a registered nurse, and that at that time he was awake and alert. His evidence was that there was no interpreter present and so he was not sure what the nurse was asking him. He confirmed that there was a medical registrar in the hospital who spoke Mandarin, but he says that he "didn't talk", other than to speak and exchange a few words. At approximately 6.00 am on 9 March 2007, Ms Wang says that she spoke to the plaintiff and said "the doctor said you can go home, I have leave now." The plaintiff replied "that's fine." Ms Wang left the hospital.
The plaintiff and Ms Wang's evidence conflicts with the clinical notes which record that the Mandarin speaking registrar was translating for the plaintiff.
On 9 March 2007, the plaintiff signed the "Discharge from Hospital Against Medical Advice" form wherein he certified that he was "taking his departure from [Sutherland hospital] at his own risk and against the advice of the medical officer."
The plaintiff's evidence is that the nurse told him "sign this then you can go". At the time, he says, they asked him to sign the form and he was told that he could leave after he signed. According to the plaintiff, the doctor who spoke Mandarin had finished work. Because there was no interpreter, the plaintiff says that he did not understand what was being talked about. Once again, the plaintiff's version of events conflicts with what was said by Dr Aziez, Associate Professor Warrier and Ms Fuchs. It also conflicts with the contemporaneous nursing and clinical notes which record that the Mandarin speaking registrar explained the discharge against medical advice form to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff admitted that he had been told that an interpreter had been booked and would attend in 30 minutes time. However, he said that the doctor had already told him that he could go home. The plaintiff says that at 9.00 am, Ms Wang had gone home. He called Ms Wang before he left the hospital but she did not answer, David Fan did. The plaintiff explained that he has no idea why an interpreter would be coming if he was allowed to go home and further he did not know that before he went home he had to be reviewed by a surgeon.
I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence because it is at odds with what is recorded in the clinical notes and the evidence given by the treating doctors and nurse. I find that there was a Mandarin speaking registrar interpreting at the meeting that occurred between 8.10 am and 9.00 am on 9 March 2007. Neither the treating doctor, nor the nurse told the plaintiff he could go home. If they had told him that he could go home, then there is no logical reason why the nurse would have wasted time booking an interpreter to be present at 9.30 am that day. I find that the medical and hospital staff acted in accordance with competent medical professional practice. It is my view that the plaintiff knew that surgery was to be performed on the following Monday (12 March 2007) but as he did not want to pay for the hospital admission, he discharged himself against medical advice. This was the second time the plaintiff had taken it upon himself to discharge himself from hospital against medical advice.

Fall after discharge from Sutherland hospital
On 9 March 2007, after the plaintiff had discharged himself against medical advice from Sutherland hospital, he took a taxi home. Apparently, when he was exiting the taxi he fell outside his home. All that is known about this fall is where the plaintiff (statement [16]) states "I have been discharged from SH 9th March 2007; I have a fall outside my home when exiting the taxi." No witness, such as a neighbour, was called to give evidence and no other statements were produced that would have shed light as to what the circumstances of the plaintiff's fall were. It is not known whether the plaintiff tripped, fainted, experienced muscle weakness or whether there is any other explanation for the fall. What is clear is that, as a result of that fall, he suffered a base of the skull fracture which is a significant injury. He was taken back to Sutherland hospital by ambulance. When Ms Wang saw the plaintiff at 10.00 am on 9 March 2007, he was already in the ambulance. In cross examination, she expanded on this and said "The time on the March the 9th the year 2007 when I was downstairs and my neighbour said - called me and I saw on the floor lots of blood on the floor and Wei Fan was already - he was already in the ambulance. And then I went together with the ambulance to Sutherland Hospital" (T241.36). The plaintiff arrived back at Sutherland hospital at 10.24 am on 9 March 2007
On 9 March 2007, Dr Sean Gomes, a resident medical officer at the emergency department of Sutherland hospital, reported (Ex B, Vol 2 p 236): "Unfortunately he [the plaintiff] decided to discharge himself against medical advice this morning and had a fall sustaining a confined BOS #. [base of skull fracture] 
On presentation he had bleeding from his left ear canal but that has since settled. 
He has been alert and responsive while in the department with no objective neurological findings. ..." 
The cause of the plaintiff's fall
The plaintiff's submission was that this fall was caused by a peripheral neuropathy secondary to undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. A peripheral neuropathy is an impairment of the peripheral nervous system as a result of disease (Mosby's p 1323).
The defendant submitted firstly, that there is no coherent evidence available to link the plaintiff's discharge from hospital to the fall, other than the mere fact of chronology; and secondly, that Professor Smith does no more than suggest that there was a possibility that the plaintiff's physical condition at the time caused the fall.
The medical experts were asked about the possible causes of this fall, and other subsequent falls (detailed later in this judgment). Professor Smith, in his report, was of the opinion that the plaintiff's significant weight loss was causative of the falls. In his report, Dr Vickers indicated that a medical neurology registrar on 1 May 2007 (a date later in time) had written that the plaintiff had lower limb stiffness, which could indicate a pre-existing central or spinal cord problem where the muscle tone is one of stiffness. Dr Vickers explained that patients with stroke or spinal damage have stiff limbs. But simple joint disease and muscle spasm could do the same, predisposing the patient to falls. He opined that stiffness is not entirely consistent with a severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy where the limb muscle tone is either normal or flaccid. Dr Vickers expressed the view that it is possible that the plaintiff may have had an unrelated syndrome of postural hypotension, where there can be a significant fall in blood pressure when standing from a sitting or lying position. This often occurs in the older population, particularly if they sit or lie for prolonged periods, resulting in falls or dizzy spells. Dr Vickers noted that the registrar also reported symptoms of worsening postural dizziness. Dr Vickers' conclusion was that the plaintiff probably had a postural hypotension syndrome, unrelated to diabetes, that was made worse after his sickness and surgery.
During the conclave (from T217.8), the medical experts were asked about the cause of the falls. Counsel for the defendant directed the medical experts to a review conducted by Dr Golding. He then asked them to make the assumptions, as set out in the history given to Dr Golding by the plaintiff, namely that the plaintiff had had seven episodes of collapse since February 2007, that his legs did not obey commands, that the episodes lasted hours with no warning, that there was no loss of consciousness and that there were no sensory changes. He also asked the medical experts to assume that in answer to a question (T81) the plaintiff was asked, in relation to the period of time the problem would last for: "But then the next day it would be perfectly better, that's true isn't it?" that the plaintiff answered "Correct". In summary, counsel for the defendant asked them to assume the correctness of the history in the medical records coupled with the fact that the next day the plaintiff would be better. He then asked the medical experts whether those assumptions were indicative of anything that might have been causative of the falls. Dr Vickers opined that since the falls were intermittent episodes lasting hours with normal function of the plaintiff's legs or lower limbs in between, they could not be caused by a myopathy or a neuropathy "because that would add more permanence to the symptoms, and ... they wouldn't recover without any defect".
Dr Vickers continued that the "only things that I can think of that would do something like that would be some sort of vascular insufficiency to that part of the brain that controls the two lower limbs which is in the midline of the skull, and the things that could do that would be a vasculitis or that - a stuttering sagittal sinus thrombosis. The only other thing could be is awareness of low blood pressure. He may have postural hypotension where the blood pressure drops if you stand up for too long, and that as you walk along your blood pressure gets more and more weaker and you feel like your legs were - are going to collapse... And the more you walk the greater demand on the heart to try and maintain the blood pressure, which is not occurring because your blood pressure's too low. So eventually you will feel weak and have to collapse." This is a reflection of the opinion expressed in his report.
Dr Vickers also proffered the opinion that the plaintiff may have had very low potassium levels, but discounted this explanation as it did not accord with the medical records. Another explanation was a psychiatric problem called "a conversion reaction where patient may not walk or collapse or feel that they cannot walk in response to very acute stressful events".
Professor Smith's opinion was that the cause of the falls is "a very complex issue". He said that "somebody who has been in intensive care for a period of time, lost a lot of weight, had sepsis then they have a general weakness, you can't put a finger on exactly what is wrong". Eventually, he was more equivocal in his interpretation and accepted that this assumption, that it may have been an effect of the weight loss, was incorrect. However, Professor Smith then stated that his understanding of the plaintiff's weight loss from the beginning was it went down to 44 kilograms but that now he understands that there is a lot of doubt about that, that maybe the plaintiff's weight loss was not as gross as indicated in his original reports [I have made a finding that the plaintiff's weight did not go down to 44 kilograms]. After having been shown the weight chart, recording a 10% weight loss only, Professor Smith said "Now 10% weight loss usually would not be bad enough to cause such a severe tripping up but I've looked after the patients who come with surgical disease which cause weight loss for many years and some patients are just so weak that they trip and all that."
When asked if the intermittent nature of the alleged muscle weakness was consistent with being caused by weight loss, Professor Smith replied "I mean I can't say yes or no to that, I don't really know the answer to that question but one would expect that it wouldn't get better - it wouldn't come back but maybe it depends how much sugar you have in your muscles or whatever, I don't know, but I wouldn't expect - I would expect it to be a long term slow process". However, Dr Vickers was adamant that nutritional muscle weakness would not be intermittent. He said "I cannot think of any disease that would cause this particular problem of true muscle weakness being normal one day and bad the next day. I thought if someone had a nutritional muscle weakness I just couldn't imagine that they would be good one day or bad the next day either."
Associate Professor Collier's opinion was that "in the thousands of people I have treated with gallstone disease over many years I have never seen something similar related to gallstones. I can't really relate the weakness and the collapses to his gallstone disease; I can't see a connection."
The medical experts were also questioned specifically about whether the fall was caused by a diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
The medical experts gave the following evidence: "D FAN: ... I wish to draw the doctors attention to is not in relation to the diabetes but whereas on that page 74 ...[that] "it's highly likely that the fall Mr Fan had on 9 March 2007 resulting in a fractured skull and traumatic brain injury [TBI] complicated by the development of SIADH [a recognised complication of head injury] was caused by or contributed to by his subsequently diagnosed moderately severe sensory motor peripheral neuropathy [diagnosed on 15 May 2008]" doctors and professors would you care to comment on that statement? 
COLLIER: Well there's no evidence that he had diabetes at that stage so he's not going to have a peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, so I don't think his fall had anything to do with his diabetes subsequently diagnosed, I think it was a subsequent event. And certainly wouldn't have peripheral neuropathy at that stage. 
VICKERS: It's simply not possible because on 1 May 2007, which was about three weeks after his fall, the neurology ward ran reports "No changes in his sensation" he did not have a peripheral neuropathy on objective examination and because neuropathy is a progressive disease and not an intermitted disease if it wasn't there on 1 May 2007 it could not have been there on 9 March 2007. 
WOODS: Whilst we're still with Professor Vickers, the fact that there's about a six week gap between 9 March and 1 May, six or seven weeks doesn't change your answer? 
VICKERS: No. 
SMITH: I don't see how diabetic neuropathy could have occurred so quickly and particularly when his blood sugars were normal when he was at Prince of
Wales Hospital, and I mean you have to have prolonged hyperglycemia if you get neuropathy due to diabetes. It doesn't mean he didn't have some sort of general weakness because of being sick, whether it's weight loss or whatever, being sick for a long period of time, you know, sick people can sometimes trip more easily, and they're just not strong but I don't think the diabetic neuropathy, ..." (T226.30-30).
The medical experts' opinion is that the plaintiff did not have diabetic peripheral neuropathy as at 1 May 2007, so this condition was not the cause of his fall on 9 March 2007.
It is extremely difficult to make a finding as to what caused the plaintiff's fall when there is no evidence as to the circumstances in which it occurred. Overall, the evidence from Associate Professor Collier and Dr Vickers does not support the proposition that the plaintiff's weight loss and any muscle weakness caused the plaintiff to fall. Professor Smith's evidence on this topic was equivocal. On the basis of the opinions of the medical experts, I do not accept that any weight loss leading to muscle weakness was causative of the plaintiff's fall on 9 March 2007. Nor do I accept that the weakness and collapses are related to the plaintiff's gallstone disease.

Transfer and admission to St George hospital from 9 March 2007 to 16 March 2007
On 9 March 2007, the plaintiff was transferred from Sutherland hospital to St George hospital where he remained until 16 March 2007. David Fan was at school when the plaintiff was transferred to St George hospital.
The plaintiff says that after he was admitted, he told the doctors he needed to have the operation for his gallbladder, but that one of the doctors said "let's see how you go with the head treatment first, and then talk about the operation".

The plaintiff's weight at St George hospital
The plaintiff's evidence is that he was not weighed while at St George hospital in March 2007. The reason he gave for that was that he could not have been weighed was because he was always lying in bed. However, a document headed "Fluid Balance Summary" (Ex B, Tab O at 290) in the clinical notes indicates that the plaintiff was weighed on 13 March 2007, 14 March 2007 and 16 March 2007. As previously stated, the clinical records record that the plaintiff's weight on those days was 61, 61 and 60.44 kilograms respectively. Also, the clinical records of 15 March 2007 indicate that the plaintiff was weighed prior to his operation, and was approximately 61 kilograms.
As previously stated, the plaintiff's evidence is that on 21 February 2007 his weight was 44 kilograms and from then on he could not eat anything; and that is the reason that he was admitted to St George hospital in March 2007. The plaintiff disputed that his weight was 61 kilograms on 13, 14 and 15 March 2007 because it could not have changed from 44 to 61 kilograms if he was not eating at all.
The table below shows that the plaintiff's weight from 13 March 2007 to 16 March 2007 averaged between 60 and 61 kilograms.

The record of 60.44 kilograms on 16 March 2007 can only have arisen from the plaintiff being weighed. The plaintiff denied he was weighed on that date and said he could not stand yet (T95.15-20). In my view, this is yet another occasion where the plaintiff has created a version of events to support his claim. I do not accept his evidence that he was not weighed at St George hospital between 13 and 16 March 2007. I make findings that on 13, 14 and 16 March 2007, the plaintiff's weight was between 60 and 61 kilograms.

The fall from the hospital bed - 11 March 2007
On 11 March 2007, the plaintiff, while still an inpatient at St George hospital, had a fall. It is important to appreciate that this fall occurred only two days after the plaintiff had fractured his skull and any further injury to the plaintiff's head could have had serious consequences. I have carefully read through the hospital notes of 9 March 2007 to 11 March 2007 which refer to the plaintiff's admission to Sutherland hospital on 9 March 2007 with a fractured skull, to ascertain whether there was any advice given by the doctors and/or nursing staff as to whether precautions should be taken, as the plaintiff was at risk of falling from his hospital bed. I was unable to find any notes to this effect.
On admission to St George hospital on 9 March 2007, Dr Gomes recorded that the plaintiff was alert and responsive with no objective neurological findings. The clinical notes similarly record that on arrival the plaintiff was "alert and oriented, no distress, grossly normal neuro?" (Ex B, Tab 0, p 262).
The plaintiff gave evidence that when that he tried to reach out for the telephone he fell from his bed. The clinical notes from that day (Ex B, Tab 0, p 262) record: "Pt was found on floor in room. Neither other occupants of room, nor nurses were able to describe mechanism of fall. 
Pt is NESB and very difficult to communicate with. He is however, alert + oriented - No LOC.  ... 
O/E Afebrile; [indecipherable] stable 
Pt has two old lacerations [indecipherable] crusted over blood 
Pt has two old lacerations over blood  ) From (L) inner ear  ) Occipital region (L) side. 
The latter has some very small fresh blood - scab appears to have been picked.  ... 
NURSING: Pt. found sitting on the floor near the bed, pt. said he was trying to reach the phone but slipped and landed on his buttocks. 
Obs stable and within normal limits, all limbs  moving. Pt. denies any pain on his body..."
Once again, the clinical notes conflict with the plaintiff's version of events, although it is common ground that the plaintiff did fall from his hospital bed. The plaintiff gave evidence that he did not slip, that he did not reach the phone, but that he ended up falling off the bed and that when he fell, four or five nurses at the door saw him fall and his head bump into the wall. Later in his evidence, the plaintiff conceded that when the fall occurred there were no nurses in the ward because it was sudden, but that other patients in the ward saw the fall. Any injury that occurred as a result of that fall on 11 March 2007 would have occurred if, as the plaintiff said, he "hit my head in the wall". The plaintiff was cross examined about the extent of that injury (T93.30): "Q. You landed on your buttocks and you did not hit your head; that's true, isn't it? 
A. I hit my head, yes, and also the wound I got from 9 March was bleeding again. 
Q. That's because you'd picked at the scab, isn't it? 
A. No."
In summary, the plaintiff says that he hit his head and that the wound from his fall on 9 March 2007 was bleeding again. In cross examination he denied that this was because he had picked his scab. The hospital notes record that neither the other patients in the ward, nor the nurses, were able to describe the mechanism of the plaintiff's fall. The hospital notes also record that the plaintiff had two lacerations, one from the ear and another where scabs had appeared to have been picked. I accept that when the plaintiff tried to reach for the phone he fell from his bed. However, I do not accept that he fell hitting his head first, because the hospital notes record that he slipped and landed on his buttocks, not his head. However, he said that he fell onto his buttocks first. He may have bumped his head as there was some blood on the left hand side of his head near his ear but I cannot determine how this occurred.
The clinical notes from 9 March 2007 and 11 March 2007 record that although the plaintiff was difficult to communicate with and uncooperative, he was alert and oriented and his observations were within normal limits. However, there is no record that the plaintiff suffered any significant injury as a result of the fall. I accept that for days after the plaintiff fell from bed, the nursing staff supervised him when he was mobilising. The hospital notes prior to the fall did not make any mention of the plaintiff being unsteady on his feet or at risk of falling. It follows that prior to the fall, there is no record in the hospital notes that any precautions to prevent the plaintiff falling were put into place, such as bedrails.
On the days following the plaintiff's fall from his bed, the hospital staff supervised him when he was mobilising.
On 12 March 2007, clinical notes record "Nursing : S/C ./c ADC's however supervised while mobilising ...". (Ex B, 265).
On 13 March 2007, the clinical notes record "Nursing: pt SOOB during the morning, walks under sup to toilet due to fails risk. ... Pt independent ./c ADC's. ...". (Ex B, 276).
On 14 March 2007, the clinical notes record "NURSING: Pt independent ./c ACL's. Mobilises under supervision ....". (Ex B, 277)
There is no expert medical evidence as to what the appropriate precautions to prevent the plaintiff falling, if any, should have been undertaken by the nursing staff. Nor is there any expert medical evidence as to whether the hospital, in allowing the plaintiff to fall from his hospital bed in these circumstances, fell below competent medical professional practice.

Cholecystectomy - 15 March 2007
On 15 March 2007, Dr Mark Davies diagnosed the plaintiff as having, "gallbladder - chronic cholecystitis". As at 15 March 2007, I accept that the plaintiff was diagnosed with chronic cholecystitis for the first time. However, it is important to note that he was not diagnosed with acute cholecystitis.
Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier were both of the opinion that as at 15 March 2007, the plaintiff did not have acute cholecystitis. I agree with their opinion.
On that same day, the plaintiff underwent a cholecystectomy. The cholecystectomy was performed by Dr Chu.
Later that day, Dr Chu sent a letter to Dr M Lau of Hurstville Medical Centre, providing an operation summary of the cholecystectomy and the findings from it. That letter relevantly reads: "FINDINGS/PROCEDURE: Acute cholecystitis".
The medical experts were asked to comment on Dr Chu's finding of acute cholecystitis in the operation summary. Professor Smith said that "when you look at the gallbladder at the scope you can see whether it looks inflamed or not and my presumption is that if Dr Chu was a good biliary surgeon, made an assessment that there was acute cholecystitis and... tissues around it would have been swollen" (T201.24). He added that "it's amazing how the findings you see at operation don't always match the findings that are before, and pathology reports are not always absolute". (T201.32-34).
Associate Professor Collier's opinion was that in Dr Chu's assessment of the surgery, Dr Chu does not say why he thought the plaintiff's condition was acute cholecystitis and so "we don't quite know what that means". He explained that: "If a patient's got an abscess in the gallbladder and it's distend and there's puss in it then you say well that's obviously acute cholecystitis; there's no evidence that that was the case... Acute cholecystitis is a range of things from very mild to severe, so we don't really know what the surgical description really means, and I would [take] more notice of the final histological diagnosis that he it seems from the histology that the lining of the gallbladder, the mucosa, was intact and there were no stones seen so that suggests the stones have been passing and it all passed. But normally with cholecystitis you would find, or acute cholecystitis, you would find laceration of the lining of the gallbladder, or some evidence of acute infection and there was none of that. So I think on and the diagnosis on histology of chronic cholecystitis, if you remove someone's gallbladder and send it to the histologist if they've got stones in the gallbladder the report nearly always says chronic cholecystitis. That means there are some inflammatory, chronic inflammatory changes which is concomitant with the presence of gallstones. You never get I don't think I've ever seen a report come back in a patient with gallstones saying normal gallbladder.  ... 
So the chronic cholecystitis again can be a range of things from very minor chronic inflammatory changes to dramatic thickening and scarring and changes and we don't quite know from these two documents which of those we're dealing with. But my putting this together I think this is more consistent with the presence of stones causing some chronic inflammatory changes in the gallbladder rather than acute cholecystitis." (T201.43).
Dr Vickers added that "If you read the pathology report the pathologist has examined the whole gallbladder in detail and not just the mucosal internal lining, and he says in the report here the serosa which is the external visible surface to a surgeon, is unremarkable' therefore there are no features that the surgeon would see that would be compatible with acute cholecystitis." (T202.27-31).
I agree with the opinions of Associate Professor Collier and Dr Vickers. There is not enough evidence to suggest that the plaintiff had acute cholecystitis based solely on the operation summary of Dr Chu. The pathologist examined the whole of the gallbladder once it was removed and his report does not support Dr Chu's opinion. The evidence that I have summarised establishes that the defendant did not fail to diagnose acute cholecystitis at some stage before the cholecystectomy. Hence I remain of the view that the defendant, in its diagnosis of cholelithiasis, cholangitis and eventually chronic cholecystitis, acted in accordance with competent professional medical practice.
The plaintiff's evidence was that he was going to leave that day (of surgery) but the nurses said he still had a few needles and that they still needed to let the bleeding settle, so he agreed to stay.

Discharge on 16 March 2007
Despite the plaintiff's evidence that "I was not weighed in hospital in March. I could not stand." He was discharged that day and able to walk out of hospital.
The medical experts were asked, in their joint report, whether it was in accordance with competent medical professional practice to discharge the plaintiff from St George hospital on 16 March 2007, the day after surgery. Associate Professor Collier said the discharge was standard practice and that there was nothing to keep the plaintiff in hospital, from the surgical prospective. Professor Smith agreed with Associate Professor Collier. Dr Vickers did not comment as it was a surgical matter. The medical experts were not cross examined on the issue.
In his report, Professor Smith said that at the time of discharge on 16 March 2007, the plaintiff had undergone a cholecystectomy, been reviewed by a social worker, a neurosurgeon and by an endocrinologist, and it was considered that there was no reason why the plaintiff should not be discharged at that stage. He appeared to be fit, alert and stable. In summary, the medical experts agreed that the plaintiff's discharge was in accordance with competent medical professional practice.
I accept the medical experts' opinions that on 16 March 2007, the plaintiff was fit to be discharged from St George hospital and that this was in accordance with competent medical professional practice.

Further admission to Sutherland hospital on 28 April 2007
Between 16 March 2007 and 24 April 2007, the plaintiff alleges he had another three falls in his home. On 25 April 2007, he alleges that he fell on the kitchen floor.
On 28 April 2007, the plaintiff was re-admitted to Sutherland hospital. The plaintiff says he was weighed twice. After he was first weighed, he says the dietician told him that he was too weak, so added cheese between his morning tea and afternoon tea. The plaintiff says that the second time he was weighed his weight had increased to about 50 or 51 kilograms. The hospital records show that on 30 April 2007, the plaintiff's weight was 60 kilograms. On 1 May 2007, his weight is recorded at approximately 55 kilograms. The plaintiff's recollection of his weight on 28 April 2007 and 1 May 2007 is inaccurate.
On 29 April 2007, the plaintiff says that he told a doctor that he had had seven episodes of collapse since February 2007 and that his legs did not obey commands. He says it would last for hours, but that the next day it would be better.
As outlined earlier in this judgment, as at 1 May 2007, according to the expert medical opinion, the plaintiff did not have diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Hence, that was not the cause of his falls between 16 March and 25 April.

The plaintiff's further alleged falls
Between 24 August 2007 and 30 September 2010, the plaintiff alleges that he had a series of falls. They are outlined in his statement as follows: * On 24 August 2007 the plaintiff fell at home and hit his head against the wall. He was later taken to Sutherland hospital.
* On 26 February 2008, he fell at home. On 3 November 2008, he had another fall at home.
* On 14 January 2009, he fell in his bedroom. On 31 March 2009, he fell at home.
* On 9 January 2010, he fell while walking at home. On about 21 January 2010, the plaintiff fell on the street near Jannali train station. On 1 July 2010, he fell at home. On 30 September 2010, he had a fall at Sutherland hospital.
These falls were not included in the plaintiff's FASC. No submissions were made about these falls and there was no evidence that any treatment of the plaintiff was inappropriate in relation to the falls. No medical records were provided after 4 January 2008, when the plaintiff had an assessment at Sutherland hospital. Hence, there is no connection between these falls and the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff.

Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and neuropathy
On 15 May 2008 the plaintiff underwent motor nerve conduction tests. Those tests showed abnormalities, which Dr Peter Brimage, neurologist at Miranda Neurology, noted were "consistent with a significant generalized sensori-motor peripheral neuropathy" (see the report of Dr Brimage dated 15 May 2008, Ex A, p 62). On 16 May 2008, Professor Michael Anthony, neurologist wrote to Dr Nasreen Sultana (Ex A, p 63) indicating that "the EMG/Nerve Conduction Study demonstrates a moderately-severe widespread sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy". Professor Anthony recommended that the plaintiff have a glucose tolerance test due to the "extreme thinness of the muscles of his arms and calves".
On 20 May 2008, the plaintiff had a glucose tolerance test at Sutherland hospital which was diagnostic of type 2 diabetes. That test showed a fasting glucose of 20.8mm/L and a two hour value of 32.8mm/L (see the report of Dr Carter, Ex A, p 177). Professor Anthony was of the view that the peripheral neuropathy diagnosed on 15 May 2008 was secondary to the plaintiff's type 2 diabetes (see Ex 3 pp 469-488).
In his report, Dr Carter agreed with the view that the peripheral neuropathy diagnosed on 15 May 2008 was secondary to type 2 diabetes. However his conclusion was that "the development of peripheral neuropathy in 2008 is unlikely to have been avoided".

Breach of duty of care [Section 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5b.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) sets out the necessary, but not sufficient, pre-requisites for civil liability to arise. Although headed 'duty of care' it is directed toward questions of breach of duty: see Adeels Palace Pty Ltd versus Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd versus Bou Najem <case>. [S 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5b.html) reads: "5B General principles 
A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless: the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and  the risk was not insignificant, and  in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.

In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things): the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,  the likely seriousness of the harm,  the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,  the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm."
The inquiry is directed toward a consideration of what a reasonable person would have done, looking forward from a point of time before the injury, rather than retrospectively at what could have been done to avoid the injury: see Vairy versus Wyong Shire Council <case>- <case>.
It has always been the common law on foreseeability that it cannot be judged with the benefit of hindsight. [Section 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5b.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) requires the same approach: see Adeels Palace at [31].
As outlined at the beginning of this judgment, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached the duty of cared it owed him by: * (1) Failing to investigate, diagnose and manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes was diagnosed on 20 May 2008); * (2) Failing to properly diagnose and manage the plaintiff's gallbladder condition, by: * (a) Failing to diagnose the condition as cholecystitis and treat it accordingly; * (b) Delaying a cholecystectomy until 15 March 2007, and performing an ERCP first on 30 January 2007; * (3) Wrongly allowing the plaintiff to fall from his hospital bed on 11 March 2007; * (4) Wrongly discharging the plaintiff from St George hospital on 16 March 2007 when he was not fit to be discharged; and * (5) Failing to give the plaintiff information about treatments and the costs involved (considering his Medicare status).

Failure to investigate, diagnose and manage type 2 diabetes mellitus?
At FASC [12] the plaintiff pleads that "at all material times Mr Fan had type 2 diabetes which the defendant's servants or agents, including Dr Cotiga and Dr Muraliharab, did not diagnose" and that the defendant was negligent in not doing so.
It is not in dispute that the plaintiff had developed type 2 diabetes by 20 May 2008, when it was first diagnosed. The question for this court is whether the defendant acted in accordance with competent medical professional practice in its management and monitoring of any potential diabetic condition.
So far as the plaintiff's initial admission to St George hospital is concerned, Professor Smith, Dr Vickers and Dr Carter were of the opinion that the blood and urine glucose test results taken on 20 January 2007, although indicative of elevated blood sugar levels, were not necessarily indicative of diabetes. As previously mentioned, Dr Carter indicated that a diagnosis from blood glucose levels can be made if the reading is above 11mm/L and other symptoms of high glucose levels are present. No such symptoms were present on 20 January 2007. Professor Smith and Drs Vickers and Carter were of the opinion that the normal course of action would be to monitor those blood sugar levels. As indicated earlier in this judgment, in my view the medical staff, Dr Cotiga and Dr Muraliharab, acted in accordance with competent medical professional practice when responding to those test results.
Following the plaintiff's discharge from St George hospital, his blood sugar levels were consistently monitored. On 9 March 2007, while at Sutherland hospital, the plaintiff's blood sugar level was 7.9mm/L, and on 12 March 2007 (still at Sutherland hospital) it was 5.1mm/L. On 28 April 2007, again at Sutherland hospital, his blood sugar level was 6.7mm/L. From 1 May 2007 to 15 May 2007 the plaintiffs blood sugar levels were monitored multiple times and ranged from 4.8mm/L to 9.3mm/L. On 24 August 2007, at Sutherland hospital, the plaintiff's blood sugar level was 9.5mm/L. On 31 December 2007, at St George hospital, the plaintiff's blood sugar was 7.3mm/L. The plaintiff's blood sugar levels did not rise above 11mm/L until mid May 2008, when he was diagnosed with diabetes. In the joint report, Dr Vickers commented that the plaintiff's blood sugar levels were normal until just before his eventual diagnosis.
Dr Carter, in his report, was asked to consider the blood sugar tests taken in March 2007, which appeared to be normal. Dr Carter was of that opinion that: "If I had been managing Wei Fan, and was aware of a random blood glucose level of 10.8mm/L on 20 January 2007 but noted that multiple blood sugar levels taken in March 2007 were normal, I would have recommended an annual check of his fasting blood glucose levels. In effect this is virtually what happened as the glucose tolerance test was taken 14 months 'after the finding of multiple normal blood glucose levels'."
Dr Carter commented that "it is not possible to tell how long Mr Wei Fan had been suffering from diabetes". The diagnosis of the plaintiff was dependent on high glucose levels being recorded or glucose being found in urine (see the report of Professor A Steinbeck dated 27 April 2008).
The plaintiff's claim concerns the actions of the defendant between January and May 2007. As previously stated, the plaintiff was not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes until May 2008. His blood sugar levels were normal throughout March, April and May 2007. There is no evidence during this time of the plaintiff suffering from symptoms of high glucose levels. In August and December 2007 the plaintiff's blood sugar levels were still normal. The blood sugar levels did not present as abnormal until May 2008. The medical staff appear to have responded appropriately to these results and continued to monitor the plaintiff's blood glucose levels. The evidence of Drs Vickers and Carter supports this position. They were not cross examined on the issue and no evidence was presented to the contrary. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the medical staff who reviewed the plaintiff acted in accordance with competent medical professional practice in the management and monitoring of any potential diabetic condition of the plaintiff. Hence, there is no breach of duty of care in failing to diagnose and manage type 2 diabetes.
 (a) Failure to diagnose and treat cholecystitis
The plaintiff submitted that the defendant was negligent in diagnosing and treating him for an alleged condition of cholecystitis. The plaintiff pleaded that specifically, the defendant, failed to diagnose his cholecystitis promptly; wrongly excluded cholecystitis on the basis of an ultrasound performed 22 January 2007; and failed to treat his cholecystitis promptly and properly (FASC [60(b), (c) and (d)]).
As outlined throughout the chronology of events, I am of the view that the defendant, in its diagnosis of cholethiasis, cholangitis and eventually chronic cholecystitis, acted in accordance with competent medical professional practice. The plaintiff alleges that at some point between 22 January 2007 and 15 March 2007, he should have been diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. The initial ultrasound in January 2007 did not show acute cholecystitis and the plaintiff's symptoms supported this conclusion. Following that diagnosis, on repeated occasions up until 15 March 2007, the plaintiff's condition was reviewed and the possibility of acute cholecystitis considered. As discussed throughout this judgment, on 22, 23, 24, 25 and 31 January; 8, 15, 22 and 27 February and 9 March 2007, medical specialists examined the plaintiff and found no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
On 15 March 2007, Dr Davies diagnosed the plaintiff with chronic cholecystitis for the first time. However, the plaintiff was never diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. There is scant mention of acute cholecystitis in the medical records. Dr Chu mentioned acute cholecystitis in his operation summary of 15 March 2007. However, Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier were of the opinion that the plaintiff never, at any stage, suffered from acute cholecystitis. Their opinion was that there is insufficient information in Dr Chu's operation summary to make a conclusion that acute cholecystitis was present, and that the operation summary is inconsistent with the histopathology findings after the cholecystectomy.
I agree with and accept the opinions of Dr Vickers and Associate Professor Collier. The plaintiff never suffered from acute cholecystitis. In my view, the conclusions of the doctors on diagnosis at various stages, as recorded above, were appropriate and reasonable and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was no breach of duty of care in not diagnosing acute cholecystitis. Nor did the doctors or the defendant breach their duty of care by failing to diagnose chronic cholecystitis until 15 March 2007.
 (b) The delay in performing a cholecystectomy and decision to first perform an ERCP
I am also of the opinion that the defendant acted appropriately and in accordance with competent medical professional practice when it delayed the cholecystectomy. Although I have found that the plaintiff did not have acute cholecystitis, and therefore did not need an urgent operation, it was common ground between the medical experts that a cholecystectomy was still required to be performed at some stage to treat the plaintiff's ongoing gallbladder complications. On the 22, 23, 24, 25 and 31 January 2007; 8, 15, 22 and 27 February 2007, the plaintiff was reviewed and the urgency for a cholecystectomy considered. As outlined earlier in this judgment, in my view, and adopting the opinions of the medical experts, there was nothing inappropriate about the defendant's decision to perform an ERCP first, nor the medical specialist's decisions to delay the cholecystectomy. Those decisions were in accordance with competent medical professional practice.
On 9 March 2007, the plaintiff was scheduled to have a cholecystectomy on 12 March 2007. However, on 9 March 2007 he discharged himself against medical advice, and on his return home, fell and suffered a skull fracture. Due to this injury, the cholecystectomy was unable to be performed until he was well enough, on 15 March 2007. This delay was also in accordance with competent medical professional practice. Overall, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that all of the decisions to delay the cholecystectomy were consistent with competent medical professional practice. There is no breach of duty here.

Fall from hospital bed on 11 March 2007
The plaintiff pleaded that the defendant was negligent in "wrongly allowing him to fall from his hospital bed on 11 March 2007" (FASC [60](n)). So far as the fall from the hospital bed on 11 March 2007 is concerned, as outlined in the chronology of events, I accept there is no evidence that the hospital acted contrary to competent medical professional practice. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was no breach of duty here.

Discharge from St George hospital on 16 March 2007
The plaintiff pleaded that the defendant was negligent in wrongly discharging him from St George hospital on 16 March 2007, when he was not fit to be discharged (FASC [60](o)).
Similarly, there is no evidence indicating that there was anything inappropriate about the plaintiff's discharge from St George hospital on 16 March 2007. As mentioned earlier in this judgment, the medical experts unanimously agreed that that decision to discharge the plaintiff was in accordance with competent medical professional practice. I accept and adopt their opinions on these issues. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant did not breach its duty of care to the plaintiff when he was discharged the day after the cholecystectomy was performed.

Information and advice
The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant failed to provide him with information and advice concerning the options for diagnosis and treatment, and the time and costs involved in the various options; failed to provide him with the cheapest form of treatment for his cholecystitis, namely, removal of his gallbladder rather than requiring him to have an first; and failed to take into account when planning the management of the plaintiff the fact that he was not insured, was categorised as a private patient and would be required to pay the cost of hospital admissions, medications, investigations and specialists.
As outlined above, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the duty or duties owed by the defendant to the plaintiff did not extend to having to give him his demanded "one step" treatment or having to consider his costs, being a person ineligible for Medicare. So far as a duty to provide the plaintiff with information about procedures is concerned, from the evidence outlined above it appears that at all times appropriate information was given. Effort was made to obtain the services of interpreters, and caution was taken where hospital staff suspected that the plaintiff did not understand or fully consent. There are several examples of this, an important one being Dr Keogh's decision on 15 February 2007 to refer the plaintiff to the Prince of Wales hospital preadmission clinic on a later date in order to ensure he properly consented to having a cholecystectomy performed. Dr Keogh was of the view that if the plaintiff urgently required a cholecystectomy, it would have been performed regardless of his Medicare status.
Overall, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant did not breach its duty of care to the plaintiff in its treatment of him by the medical specialists and hospital staff at Sutherland, Prince of Wales and St George hospitals in any of his hospital admissions or preadmission clinics. In the event if am wrong and that the defendant breached its duty of care in failing to promptly diagnose and treat diabetes and cholecystitis, delaying the cholecystectomy, allowing him to fall from his hospital bed on 11 March 2007 discharging him on 16 March 2007 or failing to provide adequate information, I will consider whether any of these alleged breaches of duty of care were causative of the plaintiff's injuries.
The plaintiff alleges that as a result of the breaches of duty of care by the defendant he suffered various physical injuries, which in turn led to psychiatric injuries. For reasons discussed later in this judgment, I have made a finding that the plaintiff's psychiatric injuries were not related to any of his physical injuries. So far as causation is concerned, it is only necessary for this Court to determine whether any breach of duty caused the plaintiff's physical injuries. The physical damage which the plaintiff claims to have suffered is a neurological disorder. As a result of that neurological disorder the plaintiff's case is that when he fell on 9 March 2007 and suffered a skull fracture, this further aggravated his neurological disorder. The main question for this Court in determining causation is whether that neurological disorder, and the fall that allegedly aggravated it, could have been avoided by the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, the diagnosis and treatment of cholecystitis, the cholecystectomy surgery taking place on an earlier date, the prevention of the plaintiff from falling out of his bed on 11 March 2007 and the prevention of the plaintiff from discharging from hospital on 16 March 2007.

The law on causation
The common law test for causation is no longer relevant. It has been replaced by [s 5D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/): Adeels Palace at [41] and [44].
[Section 5D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) provides: "5D General Principles 
A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements: that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm ('factual causation'), and  that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's liability to extend to the harm so caused ('scope of liability').

In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party. 
If it is relevant to the determination of factual causation to determine what the person who suffered harm would have done if the negligent person had not been negligent: the matter is to be determined subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances, subject to paragraph (b); and  any statement made by the person after suffering the harm about what he or she would have done is inadmissible except to the extent (if any) that the statement is against his or her interest.

For the purpose of determining the scope of liability, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party." [Section 5E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5e.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) deals with the onus of proof: "In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, any fact relevant to the issue of causation."
In order to succeed the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that, but for the breach, "particular harm", would not have been suffered. This involves two elements: "factual causation" and "scope of liability": Adeels Palace at [42]; Wallace versus Kam at [12].
Determination of factual causation under [s 5D(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) is a statutory restatement of the "but for" test of causation. That determination is "entirely factual, turning on proof by the plaintiff of relevant facts on the balance of probabilities in accordance with [s 5E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5e.html)": Wallace versus Kam at [14]. To prove that a change in circumstances might have made a difference does not alone prove factual causation: Adeels Palace at [50].
The determination of "scope of liability" involves a value judgment (Wallace versus Kam), as does the determination of "factual causation" (Paul versus Cooke at [11]).
The application of the subtractive effect of [s 5D(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) will be a finely balanced one: Paul versus Cooke, Leeming JA at [117]. What is clear is that the policy argument, "that negligent medical practitioners should be liable for harm which is causally connected with their breach" is not correct: Paul versus Cooke, Leeming JA at [114].
[Section 5D(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) provides a limiting factor upon the liability of a negligent medical practitioner, despite the existence of factual causation, whereas, as discussed below, [s 5D(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) provides for the imposition of liability despite the absence of factual causation. The operation of such a limiting factor is unlikely to arise other than in cases analogous to Paul versus Cooke.
The requirement of [s 5D(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) for "factual causation" and "scope of liability" do not include the common law concepts of material contribution or increase in risk: see Woolworths Ltd versus Strong <case> at <case>- <case>: causation requires a determination that "the negligence was a necessary condition of the harm".
Where a negligent delay in treatment has led to an increased risk of an adverse outcome, the plaintiff has lost a chance of a better outcome. Damages are not recoverable for the loss of such a chance unless the better outcome is the probable result: see Tabet versus Gett <case>.
[Section 5D(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) provides for the imposition of liability where the 'but for' test of factual causation is not established: see Adeels Palace at [53].
[Section 5D(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) applies in circumstances of "an exceptional case". In Adeels Palace the High Court stated at [54]: "[Section
D(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) makes provision for what it describes as 'an exceptional case'; but the Act does not expressly give content to the phrase 'an exceptional case'. All that is plain is that it is a case where negligence cannot be established as a necessary condition of the harm; the 'but for' test of causation is not met.
In such a case, the Court is commanded 'to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not a wide responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.  ...Beyond the statement that this is to be done 'in accordance with established principles', the provision offers no further guidance about how the task is to be formed. Whether, or when, [s
D(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) is engaged must depend, then, upon whether and to what extent 'established principles' countenance departure from the 'but for' test of causation."
The application of [s 5D(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html), inter alia, requires evidence (see King versus Western Sydney Local Health Network  <case> per Hoeben JA at [155]) and needs to be raised on the pleadings (King per Ward JA at [222]). This is not an exceptional case. The plaintiff did not allege it to be one and no evidence was adduced to support this proposition.

Diabetes
The question for this Court is whether the plaintiff's diabetes had been monitored, diagnosed and treated sometime during his admission to the defendant's hospitals, would that diabetes have been exacerbated and would he have developed complications, including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, cataracts and vascular disease, and would the plaintiff had fallen and fractured his skull on 9 March 2007, leading to various other disabilities?
So far as the exacerbation of diabetes and the development of further complications are concerned, it is not in dispute that the plaintiff had developed diabetes by May 2008, and that as a consequence, there was a diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the medical experts were of the opinion that treatment of his diabetic condition in early 2007 would not have prevented that development and complications. In his individual report, Dr Vickers said that "Any damage to the nerves must have been slowly evolving over some years and not clinically detectable. It was only in 2008 that years of insidious damage may have culminated in a frank clinical presentation. If his diabetes were known and treated [in early 2007] that would not reverse pre-existing nerve damage". Dr Vickers' view was that the plaintiff "probably had a silent diabetic tendency present over many years in an insidious form. At some stage, he may have had either a tiny brain stem or spinal stroke to account for the limb stiffness. He then later developed fully blown complications of overt diabetes during a period of considerable weight gain. This brought out his diabetes and nerve damage in forme-fruste [a term that is used in medicine sometimes to express the absolute flowering of disease in all its glory] a presentation rarely seen in clinical practice." (T227.2-3).
Dr Carter was asked whether the development of peripheral neuropathy in 2008 could have been avoided. In response, Dr Carter noted that the plaintiff was taking Seroquel tablets at the time diabetes was diagnosed in May 2008, and that there is an increased incidence of diabetes in people who have developed schizophrenia and also in people who are taking anti-psychotic drugs such as Seroquel. His view was that the plaintiff had a genetic predisposition for diabetes and that the development of his mental illness, plus his taking of Seroquel may well have played a significant role in the marked increase in his glucose levels between March 2007 and May 2008.
Dr Carter explained that peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes is more likely to develop if glucose levels are high for a prolonged period of time, and that if diabetes is diagnosed at an early stage and well managed with normal glucose levels, it is very unlikely that a significant peripheral neuropathy will develop. However he said this is not always the case, and if it is assumed that the plaintiff's diabetes developed sometime during the 14 months prior to presentation in May 2008, it remains that it is extremely uncommon for a severe peripheral neuropathy to develop over such a short period of time. Dr Carter concluded that the fact that the plaintiff's glucose levels were normal in March 2007 and a peripheral neuropathy was noted 14 months later when diabetes was diagnosed, indicates that in accordance with competent medical professional practice (such as a follow up with an annual fasting plasma glucose level) the development of peripheral neuropathy in 2008 is unlikely to have been avoided.
So far as the fall on 9 March 2007 is concerned, the plaintiff alleges that his diabetic neuropathy arose sometime between January and March 2007, which weakened him, and led to his fall on 9 March 2007, and his subsequent falls between 16 March 2007 and 24 April 2007. However, in their joint report, the medical experts were in unanimous agreement that any failure by the defendant to diagnose diabetes was not causally related to his weakness and tendency to fall. This is because as at 1 May 2007, although the plaintiff may have had "insidious" diabetic tendencies, he did not have a diabetic neuropathy which could have been causative of the fall and skull fracture. (For the moment, I leave aside the ramifications of the plaintiff discharging himself from hospital against medical advice as this event preceded his fall). In his individual report, Dr Vickers said that the plaintiff had limb stiffness which "is not entirely consistent with a severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy where the limb muscle tone is either normal or flaccid". Associate Professor Collier and Professor Smith opined: "WITNESS COLLIER: Well there's no evidence that he had diabetes at that stage so he's not going to have a peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, so I don't think his fall had anything to do with his diabetes subsequently diagnosed, I think it was a subsequent event. And certainly wouldn't have peripheral neuropathy at that stage. (T226.14-18). 
WITNESS SMITH: I don't see how diabetic neuropathy could have occurred so quickly and particularly when his blood sugars were normal when he was at
Prince of Wales Hospital, and I mean you have to have prolonged hyperglycemia if you get neuropathy due to diabetes. It doesn't mean he didn't have some sort of general weakness because of being sick, whether it's weight loss or whatever, being sick for a long period of time, you know, sick people can sometimes trip more easily, and they're just not strong but I don't think the diabetic neuropathy, I mean I couldn't see how that-" (T226.33.40).
The medical experts concluded that the plaintiff suffered no injury as a result of any failure to treat his diabetic condition.
Accordingly, if the plaintiff's diabetic tendency had been monitored and diagnosed in early 2007, it cannot be said that his injuries would not have occurred, since they were not caused by his diabetes, but by something else, the most probable cause being postural hypotension.
It is common ground that the plaintiff was not diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy until May 2007. I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the diabetic neuropathy caused his fall on 9 March 2007 when he suffered a skull fracture. It follows that I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that his falls between 16 March 2007 and 24 April 2007 were caused by diabetic neuropathy.

Diagnosis of cholecystitis
The plaintiff alleges that but for the failure of the defendant to promptly diagnose and treat his cholecystitis he would not have suffered from "progression of cholecystitis to a severe state". He also alleges that he would not have lost such a large amount of weight between 20 January 2007 and 15 March 2007 (30 to 40 kg), would not have suffered from nutritional deficiencies which made him weak, and consequently would not have had a fall on 9 March 2007, which caused a skull fracture. He also alleges that the failure to diagnose cholecystitis led to diabetes.
So far as the alleged "progression of cholecystitis to a severe state" is concerned, I assume the plaintiff means either chronic or acute cholecystitis. When the plaintiff was diagnosed with chronic cholecystitis on 15 March 2007, he was operated upon on that same day.
So far as the plaintiff's alleged weight loss and consequent fall is concerned, I have made findings earlier in this judgment that the plaintiff did not lose a large amount of weight nor did he suffer from significant nutritional deficiencies. It follows that the plaintiff was not made "weak" and the alleged loss of weight and nutritional deficiencies did not cause him to fall on 9 March 2007, nor did they aggravate that neurological condition.

Delay in cholecystectomy
Despite the fact that the plaintiff did not have cholecystitis until 15 March 2007, there was no dispute about the fact that he needed treatment for his gallbladder illness, whether by ERCP, cholecystectomy, or both. The plaintiff's submission on this topic was that "due to the delay of surgery caused the plaintiff to suffer weight loss, which eventually caused neuropathy, which led to disabilities". In other words, the plaintiff alleges a complex causation chain which hypothesises weight loss, causing a neuropathy/myopathy, causing falls, causing base of skull fracture and causing ongoing significant disability. The question for this Court is whether it has been established on the evidence that, had the plaintiff been given a cholecystectomy at an earlier time than he did, would he still have lost weight, developed a neuropathy/myopathy and fallen and fractured his skull?
The defendant submitted that it is clear that various links in this chain that form this hypothesis do not exist. The medical experts were carefully asked about the timing of the cholecystectomy, the decision to perform an ERCP first, and the impact of the cancellation of the cholecystectomy. Initially, Professor Smith was of the opinion that an earlier cholecystectomy could have prevented the plaintiff's weakness and falls. In their individual reports, the medical experts were asked whether the cancellation of the scheduled cholecystectomy, and the further delay of the cholecystectomy, was causally related to any of the plaintiff's disabilities. While Associate Professor Collier and Dr Vickers said no, Professor Smith was of the opinion that the most efficient way to have managed the plaintiff would have been for him to undergo a cholecystectomy when he was first admitted to either St George or Prince of Wales hospitals, and that as a result of the delay, he lost weight, became weak and developed complex neurological conditions that resulted in his fall and subsequent skull fracture. Professor Smith continued to say that the cancellation of the cholecystectomy on 28 February 2007, "one month after the initial onset of cholecystitis", was an important factor and contributed greatly to the plaintiff's deterioration after that stage.
However, as discussed earlier in this judgment, this opinion was based upon a version of events given to Professor Smith by the plaintiff. As a consequence, Professor Smith gave those opinions based on an incorrect assumption that the plaintiff had been diagnosed with cholecystitis. After being shown the plaintiff's accurate admission history during the conclave, that showed no diagnosis of cholecystitis, Professor Smith understandably resiled from his earlier opinion. The result of that was that there was a consensus between the medical experts that the delay in treatment made no difference to the plaintiff's condition. In fact, the medical experts were of the opinion that it was a favourable course to delay the treatment, due to the risks involved in operating on a patient with cholangitis too early.
I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that not carrying out the cholecystectomy at an earlier date was not causally linked to the plaintiff's injuries.

Information about procedures and costs
While the plaintiff contended that the duty owed by the defendant was to provide to him with a "one stage treatment" (considering his status as a person ineligible for Medicare) I do not agree. If the plaintiff is alleging that the defendant breached its duty of care to provide appropriate information about procedures, none of the medical experts suggested that any information that was given was inappropriate nor deficient. The plaintiff gave no evidence on this issue nor was there any evidence about how this alleged lack of information was causally linked to the damage suffered by him.

Fall from hospital bed on 11 March 2007
The plaintiff alleges that but for the negligence of the defendant in allowing him to fall out of his hospital bed on 11 March 2007, he would not have suffered "further injury to his skull or brain".
The hospital records from that day (Ex B, p 262) state that an old laceration crusted over with blood had "some very small fresh blood". The hospital notes also record that he fell on his buttocks. Earlier in this judgment, I have referred to the plaintiff's conflicting evidence about this fall.
I am not satisfied that there is a causative link between the fall from the plaintiff's hospital bed on 11 March 2007 and any damage allegedly suffered by him. Even if I am wrong and the hospital and nursing staff should have monitored the plaintiff more closely or taken other precautions, no significant injury was suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the fall.

Discharge from St George hospital on 16 March 2007
The medical experts unanimously agreed that there was nothing inappropriate about the discharge on 16 March 2007. No other evidence was presented by the plaintiff to the contrary. Hence, I am not satisfied that the discharge is causally linked to any injury or damage suffered by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff has not established on the balance of probabilities that the defendant breached its duty of care to him. Nor has the plaintiff established on the balance of probabilities that if the defendant had breached its duty or duties of care to him it caused the plaintiff to suffer any injury or damage. The plaintiff's case against the defendant in negligence and breach of contract fails. I enter verdict and judgment in favour of the defendant.
However, in case I am wrong, I will briefly outline the submissions and give a brief overview of how I would approach contributory negligence, failure to mitigate, volenti non fit injuria and damages, but I acknowledge that this reasoning is dependent upon the particular findings of breach of duty of care and causation.

Contributory negligence, failure to mitigate and volenti non fit injuria
Counsel for the defendant submitted that if this Court was to find that there was a breach of duty before 9 March 2007 by delaying the cholecystectomy, and that the plaintiff's damage occurred because he left the hospital on 9 March and suffered a further fall on 11 March 2007, then such loss was caused entirely (100%) by his own contributory negligence as the plaintiff deliberately chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. Contributory negligence consists of a "failure of a plaintiff to take reasonable care for the protection of his or her person or property": see Astley versus Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1; <case> at <case>.
Specifically, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff was negligent by: * Failing on 31 January 2007 to remain at Prince of Wales hospital to have his medical condition managed and/or monitored; * Failing to attend an appointment scheduled with Professor Riordan on 12 February 2007; * Failing on 3 March 2007 to remain at Sutherland hospital to undergo a cholecystectomy and have his medical condition managed and/or monitored; * Failing on 9 March 2007 to remain at Sutherland hospital to obtain treatment and have his medical condition managed and/or monitored.
Alternatively, the defendant submitted that any injury, loss and damage was caused or contributed to by the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate his loss by failing to remain at hospital on 31 January, 3 March and 9 March 2007 and by failing to attend the appointment on 12 February 2007.
[Section 5R](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5r.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) deals with the standard of contributory negligence: "5R Standard of contributory negligence 
The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributory negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm. 
For that purpose: the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and  the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time."
In Richardson versus Schultz [(1980) 25 SASR 1] at 20, Williams J distinguished between contributory negligence and failure to mitigate on the basis that: "contributory negligence is concerned with negligence of the plaintiff before the cause of action has matured by the occurrence of some damage; after damage has occurred and an action in tort is vested in the plaintiff, he has a duty to take care to mitigate his loss" (referring to Street, the Law of Torts (4th Edition) p 448).
The defendant also relied upon the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria, submitting that by voluntarily declining to attend appointments and to remain in hospital, the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of declining treatment in hospital. According to Fleming's The Law of Torts (10th Edition) at p 335 voluntary assumption of risk is "a defence in proceedings in negligence for the defendant to prove that the plaintiff fully comprehended the risk of injury that materialised and freely chose to accept it. This defence of 'voluntary assumption of risk' corresponds to the plea of 'consent' in actions for intended harm. Both are expressions of the same philosophy of individualism, that no wrong is done to one who consents: volenti non fit injuria".
In the event that I am wrong, and there was a breach of duty by the defendant in delaying the cholecystectomy and failing to take precautions to stop the plaintiff falling from his hospital bed, some allowance should be made for contributory negligence. Importantly, the cholecystectomy operation was scheduled for 12 March 2007, but the plaintiff decided to discharge himself against medical advice on 9 March 2007. Ultimately, the operation was performed four days after it was originally scheduled. On 9 March 2007, in between discharging against medical advice and the rescheduled operation, the plaintiff had a fall. Had he not discharged himself, he most likely would have been operated upon on 12 March 2007, and would not have had the fall in which he suffered a skull fracture. Also the plaintiff suffered no significant injury caused by the fall from the bed on 11 March 2007. As to the apportionment, I am unable to assess a percentage for contributory negligence. As a deduction would be made for contributory negligence, it would be unnecessary to make any further deductions for the plaintiff's failure to mitigate his loss and volenti non fit injuria as they arise out of the same circumstances.
To make it abundantly clear, I have decided that the plaintiff's claim fails on liability but in the event I am wrong, I have addressed the issue of damages.

Damages 
General principles
An assessment of damages is to be done in accordance with the provisions of [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/index.html#p2) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/). The burden upon the plaintiff to establish matters on the balance of probabilities is a reference to the legal onus of proof: see New South Wales versus Doherty <case> and Hirst versus Sydney South West Area Health Service <case>
Damages are awarded as compensation for the damage suffered. It is accepted, and clearly understood, that it is impossible to use money to restore to a condition of physical wholeness a person who has suffered great personal injury. Therefore, all the law can do is to restore the person who has suffered so far as money can do.
Damages cannot be perfect. In Lee Transport Co versus Watson <case>; [(1940) 64 CLR 1], Dixon J stated at 13-14: "No doubt it is right to remember that the purpose of damages for personal injuries is not to give a perfect compensation in money for physical suffering. Bodily injury and pain and suffering are not the subject of commercial dealing and cannot be calculated like some other forms of damage in terms of money."
Damages are not intended to insure the plaintiff against every possible eventuality, nor to compensate for every loss the plaintiff may possibly have sustained: see Pamment versus Pawelski <case>; [(1949) 79 CLR 406] at 676.

Statistical information
The plaintiff is approximately 52 years old. The medium life expectancy for a man of the plaintiff's age is approximately another 32.5 years.
The 5% multiplier for 32.5 years is approximately 850.
The plaintiff has approximately 14 years until the statutory retirement age.
The 5% multiplier on 14 years is 529.3.

Overview of my approach to calculating damages
The plaintiff has claimed damages that total $85,951,215.25. Some of the plaintiff's claims for damages can best be described as aspirational. The plaintiff has relied on presumptions and calculations set out in his experts' reports and other material. However, there are often gaps, and in some areas, there is no actual evidence at all. Some examples are the absence of any wage records, tax returns and proof of the plaintiff's obtaining of a university degree in China.
It is common ground that the plaintiff is disabled as a result of a peripheral neuropathy secondary to type 2 diabetes, diagnosed in May 2008. However, as previously stated, there is no medical evidence to support the proposition that any of the defendant's actions caused the plaintiff to develop that diabetic neuropathy. Also, as previously mentioned, any treatment of the plaintiff's diabetic condition in early 2007 would not have prevented its development and complications, and any damage to the nerves must have been slowly evolving over some years and was not clinically detectable.
The plaintiff's current condition is stable. His type 2 diabetes is controlled, and his secondary peripheral neuropathy only affects his legs (and to a limited extent). Professor Anthony was the plaintiff's treating neurologist from 2009 onwards. He prepared reports dated 2, 14 and 16 May 2008, 14 November 2008, 6 February 2009, 27 March 2009, 10 July 2009, 4 December 2009, 30 April 2010, 6 August 2010, 5 November 2010, 4 February 2011, 22 July 2011, 11 March 2011, 15 December 2011, 6 May 2012, 4 September 2012, 15 December 2012, 3 August 2013 and 22 December 2013 (Ex 3 pp 469-490). By 6 May 2012, Professor Anthony was of the opinion that the plaintiff's diabetes was under "excellent control". Professor Anthony's opinion was that the plaintiff's "only problem was his walking because of the Diabetic peripheral neuropathy" and that "the patient can walk around the house unaided by supporting himself with walls, but if he goes outside the house he needs the walking frame." (report 22/12/08).
Before I assess the plaintiff's specific claims for damages, it is convenient that I address two main issues that will impact on claims under various heads of damage. They are firstly, the plaintiff's psychiatric condition and need for care; and secondly, the interrelationship between the plaintiff and Ms Wang, and the effect that that relationship has had on the plaintiff's life and his independence. This overview is based on the assumption (which is not in accordance with my findings and has been rejected) that the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff caused him to develop diabetes that has been exacerbated by the development of peripheral neuropathy. To make it clear, as I have entered judgment in favour of the defendant, the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages at all.

The plaintiff's psychiatric condition and care
The plaintiff claims that his psychiatric illness was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The plaintiff relied upon the opinions of Dr Klaas Akkerman, psychiatrist (report dated 12 May 2009) (Ex A, p 120), Dr Stephen Buckley, rehabilitation physician, (report dated 12 January 2010) (Ex D, Tab R) and Ms Lauren Alach, occupational therapist (report dated 23 December 2013) (Ex D, Tab R). It should be noted that Dr Buckley's latest report dated 4 November 2011 was prepared some years ago. Ms Alach relied upon Dr Buckley's opinions. Dr Akkerman, Dr Buckley and Ms Alach did not give evidence, nor were they required for cross examination.
As mentioned at the beginning of this judgment, after judgment was reserved, the plaintiff, without leave of this Court, and without explanation, forwarded an occupational therapy assessment report of Ms Everett dated 12 August 2015. I directed the parties to provide written submissions as to whether this report should be tendered and admitted into evidence. The defendant objected to this course of action. The plaintiff submitted that "he has lost capacity to provide childcare for his stepson Su Fu Garana (born in 2003). In respect for caring of a child, he would have addressed but is unable to address because of his disabilities".
At the hearing, the plaintiff relied upon the report of Ms Alach. The defendant relied upon three reports of Ms Oates, occupational therapist, dated 14 February 2015 (part of Ex 3), 19 May 2015 (Ex 10) and 26 May 2015 (Ex 18). On 25 May 2015, the plaintiff closed his case (T274.6-12). Prior to closing his case, the plaintiff gave no indication that he intended to seek to rely upon further evidence. On 26 May 2015, Ms Oates gave evidence and was cross examined. Obviously, she was not cross examined in relation to the contents of Ms Everett's report.
The defendant objected to the report of Ms Everett being admitted into evidence for numerous reasons. They are that it would necessary to further cross examine the plaintiff, further cross examine Mrs Wang, further cross examine David Fan, cross examine Ms Everett, have the plaintiff reassessed by Ms Oates, recall Ms Oates; and consider whether any further evidence was required.
Counsel for the defendant submitted that in these circumstances it is clearly inappropriate for the plaintiff to be granted leave to reopen his case and to rely upon the report of Ms Everett.
Counsel for the defendant also submitted that to admit the report of Ms Everett into evidence would occasion significant delay and incur significant expense. The hearing, including oral and written submissions, has concluded. Both parties made tactical decisions during the course of the trial, relevant to the adducing of evidence and the extent of the cross examination of witnesses. Counsel for the defendant further submitted that it would be unfair to allow the plaintiff, post trial, to serve a report which was on its face unlikely to have been requested prior to the end of the trial.
During the hearing, had the plaintiff decided he needed to adduce further evidence, he could have requested the opportunity to obtain it on an urgent basis. He did not do so. The trial was conducted on the basis of the evidence that was before this Court. Witnesses and experts were asked questions and were cross examined on that evidence. Counsel for the defendant framed his questions on the basis of what was contained in the experts' reports that had been admitted into evidence. It would be prejudicial to the defendant to allow this report into evidence now. Hence, I disallow the tender of Ms Everett's report.
The defendant relied upon the evidence of Dr Patricia Jungfer, psychiatrist (report dated 6 May 2011) (Ex 2, p 268), Dr Lisa Brown, psychiatrist (report dated 23 September 2013) (Ex 2, p 221), Mr Dino Cipriani, clinical psychologist (report dated 8 June 2013) (Ex 2, p 284), Mr Jamie Berry, clinical neuropsychologist (report dated 23 January 2012) (Ex A, p 133), Mr Michael McMahon, psychologist, (reports dated 13 June 2007 and 14 October 2011) (Ex 3, p 364) and the three previously mentioned reports of Ms Oates. As indicated earlier, Ms Oates gave evidence and was cross examined. I found her to be an impressive witness and after reading her report and closely observing her cross examination, I accept her evidence.
The defendant submitted that it is now clear that the plaintiff's psychiatric condition at all times had a non-organic focus, and was not related to any physical injuries that could possibly be attributable to the care given by the hospital staff.
There was some partial support for the plaintiff's case that his gallstone issues contributed to his psychiatric condition. On 12 May 2009, Dr Akkerman reported: "His condition was caused equally by two issues. Firstly, it was caused by his genetic predisposition. His sister suffered from a similar illness.
Secondly it is related to the issues regarding his gallstones. Therefore, in my opinion his condition was caused equally by each cause. 
Therefore the gallstones issues were a contributing factor."
Other explanations have been proffered by Mr Berry and Mr Cipriani. Mr Berry concluded that the most reasonable explanation for any cognitive decline suffered by the plaintiff was that it related to medication. Mr Berry disregarded the plaintiff's head injuries as he considered that they were "relatively minor" and it would be highly unusual for such injuries to have caused the plaintiff's problems.
Mr Cipriani (in his report, Ex 2, p 310) concluded that there was no evidence that the plaintiff had cognitive impairment but that there was some evidence that the plaintiff had been encouraging the "sick role" which Ms Wang appeared to be reinforcing, in order to enhance their compensation case. It is Mr Cipriani's opinion that the plaintiff could benefit from psychological intervention to address his fear of falling, his excessive dependency on Ms Wang and the cost to him of "maintaining the sick role".
Mr Cipriani performed a clinical psychological and neuropsychological assessment of the plaintiff. He concluded that: "17.8.4 Mr Fan has made a full cognitive recovery from his repeated minor/mild head injuries and paranoid psychotic episodes. There has been no recurrence of psychosis since 2011 and he is functioning cognitively at his pre-injury level."
Dr Brown (in her report, Ex 2, p 221 and 247) was of the opinion that there was no aetiological link between the plaintiff's development of a major depressive disorder with psychotic features (psychotic depression) of moderate severity in or around June 2007 to any aspects of his treatment in the hospitals. Dr Brown also noted that the plaintiff's psychiatric disorder had progressively undergone resolution since late 2011. However, Dr Brown opined that it is not possible to exclude the consciously based motivator of compensation as also having complicated the plaintiff's clinical presentation.
Drs Brown and Jungfer, Messrs Berry and Cirpriani were all of the opinion that it was not possible to confirm that the plaintiff has developed organically based cognitive dysfunction, related either to traumatic brain injuries secondary to recurrent falls, or to any specific aspects of his physical health from January 2007 onwards. Rather, their opinion was that the more profound cognitive deficits, suggested a clinical presentation of dementia in the several years from 2007 onwards, that were likely to represent a psuedodementia presentation (Ex 2, pp 253-254).
Mr McMahon (Ex 3, p 364), conducted a cognitive assessment of the plaintiff, when he was an inpatient in the rehabilitation ward of St George hospital. Mr McMahon (in his 14 October report) stated that a good recovery was expected from the head injury, and that the plaintiff's later problems were unlikely to be caused by his head injury. Mr McMahon considered that the plaintiff's condition, when he saw him in 2011, might possibly have been organically based. Mr McMahon stated that: "The initial head injury is unlikely to be directly involved, as a natural course of blunt open head injuries is for the initial damage to be maximal with the cognitive sequelae either remaining static or improving over time."
Dr Buckley, in making his assessment, interviewed the plaintiff. Dr Buckley recorded that the plaintiff was suffering a psychological condition. He made reference to a diagnosis of schizophrenia in his opinion and set out requirements for care. Elsewhere he simply referred to "psychosis" or "psychotic illness". Dr Buckley gave a "history of incident" in his report that was provided by the plaintiff's then solicitors. It contains a number of factual inaccuracies, namely that in mid January 2007, the plaintiff was diagnosed with cholecystitis, when he had not been. Also, in February and March 2007, the plaintiff did not have substantial weight loss nor wasting.
Dr Buckley expressed the following views in relation to the plaintiff's psychiatric condition (report, Ex D, p 12): "In my opinion, Mr Fan's presentation in my office was more akin to that of a person of psychotic illness, rather than of a person with cognitive impairment arising from traumatic brain injury of the severity identified in the hospital notes and other files. 
I therefore believe that the principal diagnostic reason for a requirement for future care is a brain injury induced psychosis. 
I would note that in addition he does have severe peripheral neuropathy which adds to a general need for care, but which would probably not, in itself, result in Mr Fan being dependent upon others at the present time."
And in relation to care (report, Ex D, p 13): "In so far as he has complex medical management on a day to day basis as related to his diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia, he would require the supervision of a registered nurse. 
In my opinion, this would be 24 hours a day and could be provided by a
Registered Nurse who either lived with him (with weekend relief) or was employed on a shift work basis. 
The benefits of shift work are that it is easier to find an employee (or employees) but it is vastly more expensive. The main benefit of live in care is cheaper care, but is much harder to find someone to provide such care. 
Therefore, in my opinion the care should be apportioned 50% to each type of care, that is shift work and live in care, for the rest of his life."
On the basis of the plaintiff's psychiatric condition, Dr Buckley and Ms Alach assessed the plaintiff as requiring fulltime care (that is, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), with 50% attributable to diabetes and 50% to his psychiatric condition. However, the plaintiff's psychiatric condition has subsequently been diagnosed as being organic in nature and has over time resolved. That leaves only 50% of care being attributable to his diabetic neuropathy.
Ms Wang agreed that while the plaintiff had psychiatric problems in June 2007, they resolved in 2011, and since 2012 the plaintiff had not been on medication for any psychiatric condition. (T262.22-29).
When giving evidence, Ms Oates was asked whether there had been a significant shift in the care required by the plaintiff since the psychiatric condition dissipated. She replied "I think so" and that "it significantly alters the care predictions". (T283.30-35).
Ms Oates (report 14 February 2015) said that "there seems to be some consensus in the more recent evidence that cognitive impairment has ceased and psychiatric symptoms have resolved" and that "the proposition that the brain injury from the fall on 9 March 2007 caused permanent cognitive deficits requiring lifetime care as suggested by Dr Buckley (12 January 2010) and Ms Alach (23 December 2013) is negated by the resolution of symptoms by 2012". She concluded that "future care needs relate only to continuing motor impairment". (TB 2 p 319). Ms Oates gave the following evidence: "Q: You spoke about the psychiatric aspect of it. In your opinion, has there been a significant shift in the care required by Mr Wei Fan since the psychiatric condition dissipated?" 
A: I think so. And I think that, for example, Dr Buckley seems to have addressed a fair amount of care based on continuing psychosocial issues which appear to have been attributed to a traumatic brain injury but then we see subsequent evidence after his assessment in 2010 that shows a lot of these issues he was referring to of large to be resolved with the resolution of the psychiatric issues and so that then significantly alters the care predictions, and I think that, you know, that is another issue to do with the comparison of myself with Lauren Alach for example. I think that clinically a lot of findings were relatively consistent, but that Ms Alach relied on Dr Buckley's assessment of that continuing traumatic brain injury being a significant factor, whereas we see subsequent psychiatric assessment showing a lot of those issues have resolved with the psychiatric issues." (T283.30).
I prefer the views of Dr Brown, Messrs McMahon and Cipriani and Ms Oates that the plaintiff's psychiatric condition is not due to the head injury or gallstones. This view accords with Ms Wang's earlier evidence.
I also accept the view of Dr Brown, Messrs McMahon and Cipriani and Ms Oates that the entirety of the plaintiff's psychiatric condition has now resolved. The earlier debate among both treating practitioners and forensic psychiatric experts as to the cause of the plaintiff's psychiatric condition has become otiose due to the resolution of his condition. The current medical view is that the cause of his severe psychiatric problems throughout 2007 and onward could not have had an organic focus; if it did have an organic focus, those problems would not have resolved in the manner in which they have. Hence, the approach I will take in assessing the plaintiff's damages for both past and future is to disallow any portions of the plaintiff's claim for damages that relate to his psychiatric condition, as it was not caused by the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff.

Interrelationship between the plaintiff and Ms Wang
Ms Oates (in her 14 February 2015 report), commented on the overbearing nature of Ms Wang. She reported that when she attended the plaintiff's premises, and attempted to ask the plaintiff questions, Ms Wang repeatedly answered questions for him, interjected when she was not pleased with his responses and disregarded Ms Oates' requests to allow her husband to respond without interruption. Ms Oates stated that Ms Wang "seemed to reinforce Mr Fan's disability and incapacity and seemed convinced that he had a long term need for a high level of care".
When giving evidence, Ms Oates further explained "A. ...I felt that it was a difficult interview process in terms of the questioning and the response process. 
Q. Why was that? 
A. I found it very difficult to get Mr Fan to directly respond to questions without his wife dominating that process. Or, if he sometimes would respond to things, I found that that then would be negated or altered in response from his wife. And that makes it difficult to form a clear conclusion on some of the information being provided." (T278.28-38).
Ms Oates also drew this Court's attention to recent psychometric testing by Mr Cipriani, who suggested that this was potentially a situation of "Folie a Deux" (delusional symptoms in a partner of an individual with delusional disorder). I shall refer to other examples of Ms Wang's behaviour observed by Ms Oates when the plaintiff's future needs are further discussed.
Ms Oates' view of Ms Wang's controlling behaviour, and the effect it has upon the plaintiff, accords with my own. Not only does Ms Wang have a controlling nature, in so far as the plaintiff's personal life is concerned, she has attempted to create a picture of the plaintiff being far more disabled than he really is. Ms Wang's actions have also impacted on the plaintiff's own view of his capabilities, and have over time resulted in him lacking the confidence to attempt to assert an improved level of independence.

Non economic loss
The plaintiff claims $572,200.00 for non economic loss (sometimes known as general damages) which is 100% of a "most extreme case". The assessment of non economic loss is governed by the provisions of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/). The definition of a most extreme case pursuant to [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s16.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) was discussed in Matthews versus Dean [(1990) 11 MVR 455] at 433. The plaintiff submitted that his injuries are sufficient to qualify for a determination of a most extreme case.
The plaintiff submitted that his psychiatric and chronic physical disabilities qualify him for non economic loss at the very upper end of the range. The plaintiff relied upon the reports of Professor Anthony and Dr Brimage (mentioned earlier in this judgment). Professor Anthony reported that "whilst the EMG/Nerve Conduction Study demonstrates a moderately-severe widespread sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy". Dr Brimage was of the opinion that, "The abnormalities in the nerve conduction studies are consistent with a significant generalised sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy". However, as I have previously stated, it is common ground that the plaintiff is disabled as a result of type 2 diabetes with secondary neuropathy.
Non economic loss means any one or more of the following, pain and suffering; loss of amenities of life; loss or expectation of life; disfigurement: see Sutherland Shire Council versus Major [[2015] NSWCA 243.]
The plaintiff submitted that his non economic loss includes pain and suffering, substantial loss of the amenities of life, severe and significant ongoing disabilities and severe diminution of the quality of life. There is no medical evidence to suggest that there is any loss of expectation of life.
The defendant submitted that firstly, even if it were determined that the entirety of the plaintiff's current condition was caused by the negligence of the defendant, then such an assertion cannot be maintained; secondly, that no matter how one analyses the evidence, it is clear that any injury caused to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's alleged negligence was of short duration and would not lead to an assessment of non economic loss in an amount of or greater than 15%; and finally, if the totality of the plaintiff's current disability were to be said to be related to the negligence of the defendant, then an assessment of non economic loss in the order of 55% would be appropriate.
On the assumption that the plaintiff's current disability was related to the alleged negligence of the defendant, the defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff requires a degree of home help. On the same assumption, the defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff, subsequent to appropriate physiotherapy, physical rehabilitation and overcoming the "sick role presentation", is not able to carry on his life as he would have been able to before his current condition manifested.

The plaintiff's life pre and post accident
Prior to 2007, the plaintiff said that he was a strong and healthy person and was able to work full time. He gave evidence that his only hobby was photography. When he came to Australia from China in 2000, he studied English at the University of Wollongong for two years but failed that course. The plaintiff said that he also worked part time in a restaurant. For the next three years (2002 to 2005), the plaintiff said that he worked at Blue Pacific Seafood restaurant at Cronulla. The plaintiff said that during 2006, on a typical day at home, he and Ms Wang were learning sewing, as they were planning to open up a home business.
Prior to 20 January 2007, the plaintiff said that he contributed to the family by sometimes walking to Hurstville and back with a trolley that contained 20 kilograms of rice and Su Fu Garana, who was then three years old. When he arrived home, he said he would carry the 20 kilograms of rice by himself from the ground floor to his apartment on level three. He said that he would cook for his family throughout the day and contributed to all other household related work. He also said that he looked after and cared for Su Fu Garana.
The plaintiff contrasted his pre January 2007 life with his life post May 2007. He said that now he mainly stays at home and is unable to contribute to any household related work. He said that he can no longer prepare snacks or any meals. He now has to walk with a walking frame with assistance from either Ms Wang or David Fan. He said that he is unable to shower by himself and requires Ms Wang or David Fan to assist him in and out of the shower. He also said that he needs either Ms Wang or David Fan to put soap on him, rinse and wash and dry him. He said that he needs partial assistance to put his stockings and socks on.
Apparently, the plaintiff can no longer take medications from the refrigerator due to the risk of falling when he turns around. Due to his generalised weakness, he said he is unable to clean or tidy. He said that he is unable to enter or exit the balcony without the assistance of either Ms Wang or David Fan because he believes that there is a risk of falling when he turns around. He also said that he cannot go grocery shopping nor go out for leisure times by himself, because he needs assistance from both Ms Wang and David Fan.
In contrast with Ms Wang's evidence, the plaintiff gave evidence that he can be left alone at home for three hours. The plaintiff said that he uses a computer every day for five hours (T110.6-17), mainly accessing Mandarin news and movies, and watches television and reads the paper. I accept and prefer the plaintiff's evidence over that of Ms Wang. However, overall I do not accept that the plaintiff is as disabled as he makes out. I accept Ms Oates' opinion in relation to the plaintiff's capabilities and needs. They are set out throughout this judgment (under the appropriate heads of damage). I accept that prior to 2007, the plaintiff undertook work in a restaurant from time to time but with no wage records whatsoever, I am unable to say whether this work was on a full time, part time or casual basis. Nor can I say whether there were periods of total unemployment and if so, for how long. During 2006 and 2007, the plaintiff says that he was at home caring for Su Fu Garana, and not participating in any remunerative employment. I accept that post 2007, the plaintiff has had little or no residual earning capacity.
If the diabetes with secondary peripheral neuropathy was caused by the defendant's negligence, I would assess the plaintiff's general damages at 55% of a most extreme case. This equates to the sum of $314,710.

Past and future economic loss
The plaintiff claims $586,344.77 for past economic loss plus $404,585.92 interest, $64,497.92 for past superannuation benefit loss and $44,504.45 for interest on that superannuation benefit loss. He also claims $1,449,259.60 for future economic loss (loss of earning capacity) and $208,186.14 for future superannuation benefit loss. Interest on past economic loss and the determination of past and future superannuation are calculated from the assessment made in relation to past economic loss and future economic loss. The plaintiff claimed that after the medical treatment he received in 2007, he is totally incapacitated for work. The plaintiff is currently in receipt of a disability pension and Ms Wang receives a carer's pension.
The plaintiff bases his claims for past and future economic loss on average weekly earnings. The plaintiff included an extract from the Furzer Crestani Assessment Handbook dated October 2014, detailing Average Weekly Earnings of Total Employees, New South Wales, for the period February 2004 to May 2014.
The defendant submitted that no allowance should be made for past or future economic loss. While the defendant accepted that the plaintiff cannot do certain things, such as work full time in a fish and chip shop, it submitted that the plaintiff could obtain work if he generally sought to do so, and in so doing, could exercise the capacity and intellectual ability which he asserts.
In the alternative, the defendant submitted that if the court were to find that the plaintiff has suffered some damage as a result of a breach of duty by the defendant then given all of the inadequacies in the evidence and the difficulties of calculations, then the appropriate response would be to allow a cushion in respect of both past and future loss. The defendant submitted that such a cushion ought not exceed $50,000 for the past or exceed $100,000 for the future.
[Section 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s12.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) provides for damages for past or future economic loss. It reads: "12 Damages for past or future economic loss--maximum for loss of earnings etc 
This section applies to an award of damages: for past economic loss due to loss of earnings or the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity, or  for future economic loss due to the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity, or  for the loss of expectation of financial support.
 ... 
For the purposes of this section, the amount of average weekly earnings at the date of an award is: the amount per week comprising the amount estimated by the Australian
Statistician as the average weekly total earnings of all employees in New
South Wales for the most recent quarter occurring before the date of the award for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and that is, at that date, available to the court making the award, or ..."
The plaintiff claimed that pre 2000 (before arriving in Australia) he graduated from a university in China with a Bachelor of Statistics and worked for a fashion and garment corporation in a management role. Later, he says that he was employed by a government agency as a statistician on a fulltime basis.
As previously stated, post 2000 but pre 2007, the plaintiff's evidence was that for two years he was studying English at the University of Wollongong but did not pass the course. During those two years, the plaintiff said that he was also working part time in (an unnamed) restaurant. For the remaining three years, the plaintiff said that he worked at Blue Pacific Seafood restaurant in Cronulla in a full time capacity.
The plaintiff said that during 2006, he and Ms Wang were at home learning sewing with a view to opening up a home business. While the plaintiff did not attend a fashion course, Ms Wang said she attended a course on a part time basis. There is no evidence of her enrolment in this fashion course.
There is no independent verification of any of the plaintiff's working history nor earning capacity. There are no letters from his employers, no wage records and no tax returns to support his claim for past economic loss. There is no supporting documentation as to the identity of his employers and remuneration he received in China. Nor is there any evidence that the plaintiff obtained a university degree in China.
So far as the plaintiff's working life is concerned, from 2007 onwards, there is no business plan or evidence to demonstrate, if both he and Ms Wang followed their intention to set up a fashion business, how it would have been profitable and how income derived from that proposed business was to be distributed. However, this lack of information is not to the point because the plaintiff is claiming loss of earning capacity based upon average fulltime wages until his retirement at age 70. Also, as previously stated, in 2006 and up to January 2007, the plaintiff was not undertaking any form of remunerative employment.
In 2007, the plaintiff was 44 years old. If he worked until he was 67 (there was no evidence that he would have worked longer), he had 23 years of working life left. The plaintiff said that prior to 2007, he had the capacity to engage in fulltime restaurant work, which he said he demonstrated an ability to do. I accept that since 2007, the plaintiff retains little if any residual earning capacity.
It is an extremely difficult task to assess the plaintiff's past and future economic loss when there is no documentation whatsoever to establish that the plaintiff had periods of paid employment, and what his earnings were during those periods. If there was evidence of past economic loss through wage records and employment history, it may have been possible to assess what the plaintiff would have earned from 2007 onwards. At its highest, in the past the plaintiff said he worked for two years part time and three years full time in restaurants, but with no independent proof, I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this is correct.
At the time that the alleged negligence occurred in January 2007, the plaintiff was at home looking after Su Fu Garana, who was as previously mentioned, three years old at the time. It is not known for how many years into the future the plaintiff would have continued to look after his stepson, but it is likely that as Su Fu Garana grew up, the plaintiff would have been able to take on part time work and incrementally increase his working hours. Further, Ms Wang was also providing care for Su Fu Garana and would have continued to do so. It is my view that after 2007, the plaintiff would have had mainly part time or casual work, and on occasions, full time work. He would also have had periods of unemployment. The type of work he would have undertaken would have been in restaurants or within the hospitality industry generally.
In these circumstances the most appropriate way to assess economic loss, due to the plaintiff's uncertain work history, the complete lack of records and the unreliability of his evidence, is by way of a buffer for both the past and future economic loss.
Pollard versus Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd [(2008) 172 IR 453] concerns the award of a "buffer" or as it sometimes is known, "a cushion". Basten JA (with whom McColl and Macfarlan JJA agreed) stated at [84]: "[84] As to the future economic loss, it is appropriate to award damages by way of a buffer, including in a case such as this where damages are to be determined pursuant to the [Civil Liability
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/), when the impact of the injury upon the economic benefit from exercising earning capacity after injury is difficult to determine. In such a case, the Court still undertakes a comparison between the economic benefits the plaintiff derived from exercising earning capacity before injury and the economic benefit derived from exercising earning capacity after injury, although the difference cannot be determined otherwise than by the broad approach of a buffer: Penrith City Council versus Parks  <case> (at [3] - [5]) per Giles JA; applied K'mart Australia Ltd versus McCann <case> (at [62]) per Pearlman AJA (Handley and Ipp JJA agreeing); see also
Hornsby Shire Council versus King <case> (at [23]) per Ipp JA (Mason P and Brownie AJA agreeing); Leichhardt Municipal
Council versus Montgomery <case> (at [33]) per Hodgson JA (McColl JA agreeing). In the latter case Mason P (at [2]) opined that 'a buffer or cushion award is usually reserved to the situation where there is a smallish risk that otherwise secure employment prospects may come to an end, in consequence of the tort-related injury, at some distant time in the future', but, with respect, the accepted wisdom appears to be that a buffer can be deployed in circumstances such as the present."
Taking the above factors into account, I would assess the plaintiff's past economic loss for the past eight years at $83,200.

Future economic loss
Claims for future economic loss are governed by [s 13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s13.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/). It reads: "13 Future economic loss-claimant's prospects and adjustments 
A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant's most likely future circumstances but for the injury. 
When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages for future economic loss it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury. 
If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted." [Section 13(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s13.html) states that the Court cannot award damages "unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant's most likely future circumstances but for the injury."
As I stated earlier, the plaintiff's future work history for the next 15 years most likely would have involved periods of unemployment, casual, part time and occasional full time work. The type of work he would have undertaken would have included working in restaurants or within the hospitality industry generally. While the plaintiff would have had more opportunity to work longer hours as Su Fu Garana matured, whether or not he would have chosen to avail himself of this opportunity, I cannot say. Taking these factors into account and doing the best I can, I would assess the plaintiff's future economic loss at $117,000.
I have assessed both past and future economic loss as buffers. In these circumstances, it is not appropriate that I make any allowance for loss of past and future superannuation benefits. It follows that I would also not make any allowance for interest on past and future loss of superannuation benefits.

Out of pocket expenses
The plaintiff claims $71,424.59 for past out of pocket expenses and interest on those expenses. Past out of pocket expenses (excluding past loss of income) include "medical, surgical and nursing attention, physiotherapy, chiropractic, acupuncture, conveyance in an ambulance and hospital treatment. It must be shown that the service was necessarily or reasonably required in consequence of the plaintiff's injuries": see H Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death (4th Edition, LexisNexis) at [4.2.1].
Well after judgment was reserved, without leave of this Court and without any explanation, the plaintiff filed a folder including three bundles of documents. The bundles are entitled: 
Past out of pocket expenses dated 15 July 2015.

Hospital debts, undated; and 
Medibank Private statement of benefits paid, undated.
The plaintiff has also filed without leave two schedules: 
Wei Fan past out of pocket expenses dated 21 July 2015; and 
Wei Fan (medico legal) expenses dated 21 July 2015.
The plaintiff submitted that all of the above expenses are as a result of the defendant's negligence and breach of duty of care.
Rather than relist this matter before the Court to deal with this additional evidence, I decided that the most efficient and cost effective way was to deal with it by way of written submissions. The defendant provided written submissions and the plaintiff provided a short reply. Although the defendant's position was that it did not object to the documents "should the plaintiff seek to reopen his case and tender specified documents" it did not object to the amounts contained in specified documents (extracted from the plaintiff's bundle relating to past out of pocket expenses dated 15 July 2015), that it said reflect the entries in the schedule entitled "Wei Fan past out of pocket expenses" dated 21 July 2015. Hence, I decided to accept the plaintiff's additional evidence without the need to relist these proceedings.
The defendant did not object to items that amounted to slightly more than $15,000. The defendant submitted that this Court is entitled to take a broad brush approach to the assessment of past out of pocket expenses, and accepted that the court would be entitled to assess past out of pocket expenses in an amount in the order of $5,000.
The defendant objected to the balance of the documents and schedules on the basis that they are not relevant, because it is not negligent. As stated numerous times, I am giving my reasons in relation to damages should they need to be assessed if I am wrong in finding that the defendant was not negligent.
The defendant submitted that medico-legal expenses are not properly claimable as part of the plaintiff's damages. The defendant also objected to the documents attached to the document entitled "Hospital Debts", once again upon the basis that the plaintiff has not sought to establish that those expenses were occasioned by any alleged negligence of the defendant.
While it is an unusual and time consuming approach, in the light of the defendant's objections, I have perused the schedules and the corresponding documents that it objected to.
So far as the additional out of pocket expenses are concerned, I am limited in my approach as I do not know what, if any, particular finding or findings may be made as to the breach of duty of care. Out of pocket expenses and medical expenses would be allowed, provided they were reasonable and necessary and causally related to the breach or breaches of duty of care. The amount of interest could only be calculated after determination of the amount of out of pocket expenses.
The plaintiff claims out of pocket expenses for HP printer ink cartridges (coloured and black), photocopying fees, Avery tubeclip files (red and buff) and the like. These claims fall outside the scope of what is reasonable and no matter what breach of duty of care is found, they would be disallowed. The costs of obtaining medico-legal reports, interpreter fees for attendances upon practitioners and Supreme Court filing fees are claimed. The claims for these items would more appropriately be made in the bill of costs, provided there was a judgment and subsequent costs orders made in favour of the plaintiff. There is not.

Future medication expenses
The plaintiff claims $54,909.72 for future medication expenses based upon the report of Dr Buckley. However, Dr Buckley (report, p 5) said, "They gave me a list of his medications" and then listed those medications. Dr Buckley did not make any comment as to whether they are necessary, nor the identity of the prescribing medical practitioners.
The plaintiff stated that post 20 January 2007, he takes special medications to meet his needs, as a result of his medical complications and moderately/severe widespread sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy and diabetes (Ex E [30]). The plaintiff listed the costs of his medications as follows.

DESCRIPTION

YEARS $3,274.20  
GRAND TOTAL $54,909.72  
Professor Anthony (report dated 22 December 2013) (Ex 3 p 490) noted that the plaintiff's diabetes was under good control through the use of Glucovane, Actos, Januvia and Dionil. He recommended that the plaintiff continue on that regime, together with Ostelin and Caltrate as well as Oroxine. On 6 May 2012, Professor Anthony suggested that the plaintiff also continue to take Vitamin D and Mega B vitamins.
The defendant submitted that firstly, the plaintiff's actual medication needs are unclear and in particular it is not clear if the plaintiff requires any pain medication; and secondly, the plaintiff has not adduced evidence from current treating doctors as to any need for medication. The defendant also asserted that the plaintiff is a "concession patient" for the purposes of accessing the safety net provisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ("PBS"). As such, once he expends $366 on eligible items, all further PBS items are supplied free of charge for the remainder of the current year. The same applies in following years: see [Part VII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/index.html#p7), Division 1A and Division 2, of the [National Health Act 1953](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/nha1953147/) (Cth); State Government Insurance Commission versus Hitchcock (Supreme Court of Western Australia, Full Court, 11 March 1997, unreported) and Hunter Area Health Service versus Marchlewski <case>; [(2000) 51 NSWLR 268] from 278-279. The defendant submitted that the safety net remains applicable even where a person is otherwise regarded as compensable.
I accept that the plaintiff needs medication for his diabetes and that there are a number of drugs for this condition claimed above. I would make an allowance for these items. An additional allowance should be made, on the basis of Professor Anthony's recommendation, for Vitamin D and Mega B vitamins. In assessing the quantum of future medications, the safety net provisions of the PBS should be taken into account.

Future training and professional services
The plaintiff makes a claim for future training and professional services, some of which appears to be based upon the reports of Dr Buckley and Ms Alach. The plaintiff claims a total of $4,910,031.18. The defendant submitted that based upon both the independent evidence of, for example Professor Anthony and Ms Oates, the plaintiff does not need this type of care.
The plaintiff says that he will require the following (Ex E [29]): 
A case manager, for any significant arrangements that are to be made; physiotherapy; an occupational therapist to assist him with the provision of special equipment for his future and additional assessment and training; assessment and training done for a scooter; psychological support; taxi services to and from locations where parking is difficult; car wash expenses; and general practitioner and specialists' expenses.
Some of these claims have been dealt with under more appropriate headings, such as physiotherapy and psychological support. The plaintiff does not need a car so he has no need for car wash expenses. Based on the reports of Ms Oates, I do not think that the plaintiff needs a mobility scooter and therefore he does not need the related training.
Ms Oates has recommended a period of in patient rehabilitation and review to address the plaintiff's medication regimen, his mobility and falls strategy, to provide additional training in autonomy for activities of daily living and to assess the suitability of his home environment and his best options of future care to optimise his autonomy. Ms Oates also recommended the appointment of a registered nurse for case management in the community to monitor the plaintiff's medication regimen and liaise with all treating practitioners regarding his care and treatment (Ex 3, p 340, para 6.1).
I would allow for the above amounts recommended by Ms Oates. They are reasonable and necessary due to the plaintiff's disabilities arising from his type 2 diabetes and secondary neuropathy.

Past and future care
The plaintiff makes a claim for damages for past care totalling in excess of $4,000,000 and for future care that totals in excess of $48,000,000. The need for such care is based upon the reports of Dr Buckley and Ms Alach.
An award of damages for gratuitous attendant care services is governed by [s 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s15.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/). It reads: "15 Damages for gratuitous attendant care services: general 
In this section:  "attendant care services" means any of the following: services of a domestic nature,  services relating to nursing,  services that aim to alleviate the consequences of an injury.
 "gratuitous attendant care services" means attendant care services: that have been or are to be provided by another person to a claimant, and  for which the claimant has not paid or is not liable to pay.

No damages may be awarded to a claimant for gratuitous attendant care services unless the court is satisfied that: there is (or was) a reasonable need for the services to be provided, and  the need has arisen (or arose) solely because of the injury to which the damages relate, and  the services would not be (or would not have been) provided to the claimant but for the injury.

Further, no damages may be awarded to a claimant for gratuitous attendant care services unless the services are provided (or to be provided): for at least 6 hours per week, and  for a period of at least 6 consecutive months.

If the services are provided or are to be provided for not less than 40 hours per week, the amount of damages that may be awarded for gratuitous attendant care services must not exceed: the amount per week comprising the amount estimated by the Australian
Statistician as the average weekly total earnings of all employees in New
South Wales for:  in respect of the whole or any part of a quarter occurring between the date of the injury in relation to which the award is made and the date of the award, being a quarter for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and is, at the date of the award, available to the court making the award that quarter, or  in respect of the whole or any part of any other quarter-the most recent quarter occurring before the date of the award for which such an amount has been estimated by the Australian Statistician and is, at that date, available to the court making the award, or  ...

If the services are provided or are to be provided for less than 40 hours per week, the amount of those damages must not exceed the amount calculated at an hourly rate of one-fortieth of the amount determined in accordance with subsection (4)(a) or (b), as the case requires. 
Except as provided by this section, nothing in this section affects any other law relating to the value of attendant care services."
I will summarise the plaintiff's evidence based upon the opinions of Ms Alach (probably in too much detail), but deductions have to be made as the plaintiff's psychiatric condition is not caused by any actions of the defendant. I will focus on what care was and will be required as a result of the plaintiff developing type 2 diabetes with secondary peripheral neuropathy.
Ms Alach reported (23 December 2013 report, Ex D, Tab R) that because of the plaintiff's complex medical history, it was difficult to determine his "injury related" care needs prior to June 2007. Ms Alach said that prior to June 2007, the plaintiff was assessed by a neuropsychologist who concluded that the plaintiff performed within the normal range on most tests and that there appeared to be no frontal or parietal lobe dysfunction on the tests administered. Based on this she assessed the past gratuitous care that the plaintiff required from June 2007.
Ms Alach's assessment of the plaintiff's care needs for the period 31 December 2011 to the date of her assessment on 10 December 2013 was that the plaintiff required assistance to attend regular, but infrequent, medical appointments and a few physiotherapy appointments. She did not take into account his visits to his general practitioner because they would have been required for diabetes management. This part is at odds with my approach as the plaintiff would be required to attend his general practitioner for diabetes management.
For the period 1 July 2007 to 31 December 2011, Ms Alach assessed that the plaintiff had received more than 40 hours per week of care and support from his family for daily tasks and general supervision until his cognitive and psychological condition improved.
For the period 31 December 2011 to 10 December 2013, Ms Alach reported that there had been an improvement in the plaintiff's cognitive and psychological functioning. She made an assessment of 4,715.1 total projected hours (Ex D, Tab R, p 51).
For 10 December 2013 onwards, Ms Alach's recommendations for future care are based on her assessment of the plaintiff's need for care related to his physical condition at the time of her assessment, regardless of who he lives with in the future. She said that the plaintiff will require personal care, domestic assistance, community access, garden maintenance (if he lives in a house), home maintenance and holiday care totalling $75,223.32 per annum (Ex D, Tab R, p 53).
The defendant submitted that those reports cannot be used as a logical basis for the determination of the plaintiff's current needs and said that while the evidentiary basis of this claim is somewhat obscure, it appears that the plaintiff is asserting that he needs full time nursing care, and in addition to that, further domestic assistance. Further, the defendant submitted even if one were to assume that the totality of the plaintiff's condition was attributable to the defendant's negligence, then his assertion that he is in need of care is still fundamentally flawed.
Finally, the defendant submitted that if the plaintiff was entitled to damages as a result of his physical disabilities, then the court ought to accept the analysis conducted by Ms Oates as to his past and current needs. That is the approach I have adopted.
As previously set out, the plaintiff said that pre injury, he was a completely strong and healthy person. He stayed mainly at home and contributed to house related work. He could prepare snacks and meals. He did not require a walking frame and could shower, wash, dry and dress himself. He was able to get his medications from the refrigerator. He could clean and tidy, enter and exit the balcony and turn around. He went grocery shopping and had leisure times by himself. He did not require assistance during the night if he needed to go to the bathroom, get a drink of water or have a snack if he was hungry. He did not fall on the ground and require medical attention overnight. (Ex E [31]).
While the plaintiff has disabilities caused by his type 2 diabetes and secondary peripheral neuropathy, he is not as disabled as he and Ms Wang make out. On his own evidence, he can be left alone for at least three hours per day. He can got to the toilet, get a drink of water and have a snack if he puts in place the methods he was shown by Ms Oates. He does not require full time nursing care during the day and certainly not at night.
In so far as the plaintiff's claims relating to his mobility and need for care are concerned, I accept Ms Oates' opinion. At times, the plaintiff's opinion of his capabilities in relation to mobility and requirement of care differ to that of Ms Wang. I accept the plaintiff's evidence as it is more realistic.
Ms Oates assessed the plaintiff's mobility and need for care. In relation to the plaintiff's mobility, Ms Oates', opinion was (Ex 3, p 344): "Mr Fan was able to rise and descend from sitting without assistance while using the chair arms to push up and lean on in transfers. He was able to negotiate the stairs and lift his legs to place his feet safely on each step and could hold the banister but his wife was firmly holding his arm and he would not attempt the stairs without her support although I was not convinced that he needed it. Mr Fan spends the vast volume of his day at rest and so it is difficult to comment on the extent to which his gait is impaired by inactivity as compared to peripheral neuropathy."
Ms Oates observed that the plaintiff got up to go to the toilet and went unaided. When she pointed this out to Ms Wang, Ms Wang "quickly jumped up and went to the bathroom indicating that he needed assistance because he could not use the rollator frame in the bathroom". Ms Oates also said that Ms Wang insisted on assisting the plaintiff up and down the stairs. Ms Oates remarked about this (Ex 3, p 336): "I asked if he would attempt to do the task on his own but the request was declined as Ms Wang indicated he would fall. I was not convinced that the level of difficulty reported by Mr Fan and observed during the negotiation of the stairs was consistent with actual function. He demonstrated the ability to lift both legs and place his feet on the stairs without significant difficulty and hold the rail for support. His wife holding onto his arm and pulling him down and up the stairs did not appear to be of much practical assistance in terms of her technique and seemed more a hindrance to his mobility than a support. There was no obvious impairment of balance... particularly when using the rollator frame. I would consider the protective head gear to be fairly redundant at this stage of his recovery."
There was confusion about whether or not the plaintiff was able to be left alone. Ms Oates said (Ex 3, p 335): "Ms Wang indicated that someone needs to be with Mr Fan 24 hours a day but had previously indicated that she could leave him for three hours when she went to collect her younger son from school. When I queried this inconsistency through the interpreter Ms Wang insisted that her husband could not be left unless she or their older son was at home. Mr Fan interjected at that point and indicated he could be left alone for several hours."
Ms Oates was asked in examination in chief whether she had a discussion with Ms Wang about whether or not the plaintiff could be left alone for a period of time. She said: "Q. Do you remember who was present when that discussion took place? 
A. Mr Wei Fan and the interpreter, and myself and Ms Wang. 
Q. Are you able to recount what happened in that conversation to her
Honour? 
A. To the best of my ability and I would report it in my report, I did ask how long Mr Fan could be left alone, and Mrs Fan and Ms Wang said that he needed to have someone with me all the time. When I asked how she managed to retrieve her younger son from school when her oldest son was at university she said that her older son needed to be at home with Mr Wei Fan in order to do that and at that point you know, there was some conjecture at that point, and
Mr Fan interrupted and said he could be left alone for three to four hours at a time, so he didn't agree with his wife that he needed constant supervision." (T281.35):
Ms Oates then stated that she did not believe that the plaintiff needs constant supervision (T282.4).
In cross examination, Ms Wang said she did not tell Ms Oates that the plaintiff was able to be left alone for three hours: "Q. Mr Wei Fan believes he is able to be left alone for several hours, doesn't he? 
A. Somebody got to accompany him because sometimes - 
Q. ...Yes or no? 
A. No. 
Q. When Joanne Oates was there, do you deny that Mr Wei Fan said that he could be left alone for several hours? 
A. No, he can't.  ... 
Q. You told Ms Oates that you used to leave Wei Fan alone for up to three hours when you went to collect your child from school, didn't you? 
A. Sometimes my big son is here, sometimes my big son wasn't there, but of course I pick up my child, yes or no but I haven't had more than three hours.  ... 
Q. You told Ms Oates that you could leave Mr Wei Fan for three hours when you went to collect your younger son from school. You told that to Ms Oates didn't you, yes or no?  ... 
A. No." (T265-266).
However, the plaintiff confirmed that the conversation with Ms Oates concerning supervision did take place: "Q. ...You told Ms Oates that you were able to be left alone for several hours? 
A. I was referring to when my wife has to pick up a young child and my son was in school. I have to lie in bed. 
Q. Your wife told Ms Oates that she could leave you for three hours when she went to collect your youngest son from school, but you said you could be left alone for several hours, that's true isn't it? 
A. Three hours is a few hours isn't it?  ... 
Q. When Ms Oates was talking to you and your wife you corrected your wife when she said you could only be left alone for three hours, that's right isn't it? 
A. Yes." (T108.47-50; 109.1-4; 113.44-46).
Ms Oates noted that there "were a number of illogical factors identified at assessment that appear to further compound Mr Fan's limitations in his activities of daily living". For example, she found it was unusual that the Fans had moved to a unit that required the plaintiff to negotiate several flights of stairs from street level to access the property. She said that "the rationale for moving to the current rental property was not clear apart from wanting to be closer to the shops and transport but it is a poor choice if Mr Fan is using a rollator frame" although she also said that Ms Wang said that the stairs would be "good exercise" for the plaintiff. She added also that "it seems unusual to have stored items stacked at the front door when a wheeled mobility device is required to access the unit" (Ex 3, pp 338-339, 346).
The only reference to any possible household duties carried out by the plaintiff was in Ms Wang's evidence. In cross examination, she said: "Q. Prior to January 2007 you used to do some cooking at home? 
A. Myself and Wei Fan share the housework, this housework.  ... 
Q. You didn't do any household cleaning before January 2007? 
A. No, I didn't do it.  ... 
A. Before prior to year 2007 Wei Fan would do all the cleaning in the house. 
Q. That is a lie isn't it? 
A. It is unnecessarily for me to cheat you, it was the man who has to do this work.  ... 
Q. Wei Fan prior to January 2007 only sometimes did things like general cleaning didn't he? 
A. Heavy housework like cleaning, the ceiling and the blind and windows these all his job.  ... 
A. We share cleaning the bathroom together, we share it.  ... 
Q. You did a lot of the housework prior to January 2007 didn't you? 
A. Wei Fan did more. 
Q. That's not true is it? 
A. In year 2006 I was fulltime studying in TAFE and he has to do all the housework, look after the three years older child and also carrying - 20 kilo rice upstairs, all these housework, all of them by Wei Fan.  ... 
Q. When did you start to live with Mr Wei Fan in 2005, in what month? 
A. End of that year.  ... 
Q. How many hours a week in the second half of the year? 
A. It seems the same, about 15 hours or so, because the first half I had three subjects and all together, add it up, 15 hours or so. The second half of that year, I did one subject, so 15 hours a week in one subject." (T267.7)
Ms Oates observed that the plaintiff's attempts to improve his physical strength and re-engage in the community were being hampered by his family. Ms Oates noted that the plaintiff "does appear to have some reduced peripheral strength and dexterity but the functional significance could be largely compensated for with the use of adaptive equipment", but that "rather than adapting tasks and equipment to suit his function Mr Fan has just ceased participating in tasks". Ms Oates gave the following evidence: "A. I don't think Mr Fan is functioning at an optimal level. I think that he has not been necessarily encouraged to participate in a lot of activity, and in addition to whatever disabilities he has, he has a low level of activity that then compounds muscle weakness and frailty and stability further, so no I don't think he was maximising his potential. I also don't necessarily believe that he was asked to do a lot of activities, a lot of things were being done for him that he could potentially do for himself." (T278.40).
Ms Oates noted that "Ms Wang, and to a lesser extent, Mr Fan, were very focused on his incapacity and there was little encouragement of his autonomy in the primary carer relationship". She indicated that Mr Cipriani had recommended psychological intervention to address the plaintiff's "excess dependency on his wife and the costs to him of maintaining the sick role ... . Mr Fan's main complaints currently relate to weakness and disability for which I have not seen an adequate medical explanation" (Ex 3, p 336-337).
Ms Oates gave evidence that she believed the plaintiff is "quite isolated or quite dependent because of where he lives". She said that constant care and attention such as that given to the plaintiff by Ms Wang and David Fan: "...can lead to a condition that we call learned helplessness, where a person who's not asked to participate over a long period of time, and then loses their confidence in their ability to participate, and strongly believes they can no longer participate, and it's a downward spiral".
In order to recover damages for gratuitous attendant care services, a plaintiff must establish that the services were required for six hours or more per week and for a period of six consecutive months or more. That is, both thresholds contained within [s 15(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s15.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) must be met. Once the six month consecutive period threshold has been satisfied, damages can be awarded for other closed periods (whether before or after the satisfaction of the threshold requirement), provided more than six hours per week of care is required. So where the need for additional services is as a result of an injury, then damages are recoverable under [s 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s15.html), provided there is a need for an additional six hours per week for at least six consecutive months.
If I consider that only the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities caused by type 2 diabetes with secondary peripheral neuropathy have caused the need for care, it is necessary to analyse each relevant period based upon, for example, the report of Ms Oates so as to determine whether care due to a breach by the defendant was causative of a need for more than six hours care per week. The same applies to the future in so far as the claim is for gratuitous care.
I accept that David Fan, who is currently in his last year of his law degree, will most likely obtain a full time job and ultimately move out to his own residence for independence and to be proximate to the location of his employment. This means he will not be in a position to assist the plaintiff with care in the future. On the other hand, Ms Wang did not give any evidence to the effect that she would not continue to provide care to her husband. The plaintiff's stepson, Su Fu Garana, is now 12 years old. He may provide care for the plaintiff in the future but no evidence was elicited on that topic. I would come to the conclusion that the plaintiff has overcome the threshold for both past care and future care.
The actual amount that can be awarded for gratuitous care is capped in accordance with the provisions of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/). The relevant rates for such care are set out in the report of Ms Oates. An up to date table is contained in Ex 18. The figures in the two appendices as set out in the body of the report constitute the outer limit of the plaintiff's claim for past gratuitous services. The amounts calculated are: * Value of past care exclusive of psychiatric care - $234,197.91 * Value of past care inclusive of psychiatric care - $321,880.88 (report, 26 May 2015).
I accept the view of Ms Oates and I would assess the sum of $234,197.91 for past gratuitous care. Interest is not payable on damages for past gratuitous services: see [s 18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s18.html) [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/).
This is calculated on the basis that all care should be valued at commercial rates as follows (Ex 3, p 340): 
Self Care 
Domestic 
Community 
Total  ---|---  
Occasional assistance with fetch and carry and some aspects of mobility @ 0.5 hours per day = 3.5 hours per week 
Assistance with heavy domestic, property and some meals as well as most shopping and all laundry hours per week \+ 15 hours one off for assistance with moving residence 
Some medical, transport and administrative assistance hours per week .5 hours per week @ $39.70/hour = $416.85/week \+ 15 hours one off @ $39.70 = $595.50 one off 
Ms Oates' costs of the plaintiff's needs for future care, on a commercial basis equipment and therapy case management as follows: * Future care $416.85 per week + $595.50 one off; * Equipment $3.60 per week + $2,256.60 one off; * Therapy/case management $16.11 per week + $1,800 one off.
The total of one off recommendations is $4,651.60. I would allow this amount as reasonable and necessary.
The weekly total for future care, equipment and therapy/case management is assessed at the commercial rate at approximately $450 per week. An allowance of $450 per week at 5% for 32.5 years equates to $382,500.
While I would accept Ms Oates' opinion, it is with some reluctance. It seems to me that future care should be assessed on a gratuitous basis, given that Ms Wang has been undertaking these tasks from 2007 to date. Ms Wang did not give any evidence that she would not continue to do so and there was no evidence to suggest that firstly, prior to 2007, she had been employed and secondly, that she was physically unable to continue to do so in the future. For now Ms Wang is also assisted by David Fan. There is no evidence as to any assistance that Su Fu Garanai may provide in the future.

Handyman expenses
The plaintiff claims an amount of $309,728.57 for handyman maintenance expenses based upon the reports of Dr Buckley and Ms Alach. Dr Buckley said that the plaintiff would require three hours per week for handyman assistance for outdoor domestic maintenance, should he choose to live in an average size suburban cottage.
Ms Wang gave some evidence about the household duties the plaintiff performed from 2005 to January 2007 (referred to earlier). Neither Ms Wang nor the plaintiff gave any evidence as to the actual handyman work the plaintiff performed prior to 2007. The plaintiff, Ms Wang and their children reside in a unit. They do not have responsibility for any outdoor domestic maintenance. The evidence of Ms Oates does not support the need for the plaintiff to move into a residential house.
The plaintiff stated that prior to the injury, he had pots on the balcony and could water them. However, he submitted that he now requires a green garden because of his disability as he has difficulty accessing the very small balcony of his unit (Ex E [32]).
It appears that Ms Oates has allowed five hours per week for domestic care and that includes assistance with heavy domestic work and property tasks. A proper allowance has been made under the heading past and future care.

Landscaping and architectural needs and hydrotherapy pool
The plaintiff claims damages in excess of $6,193,159.93 in relation to landscaping and architectural needs and a hydrotherapy pool. He relies on the landscaping report by Mr Peter Glass dated 29 January 2014, building reports of Mr Barry Morris dated 8 November 2013 and 17 December 2013, Mr Michael Hesse dated 9 March 2015 and Mr Ken Whyte dated March 2015 and the report of Dr Buckley dated 12 January 2010.
The plaintiff is currently living in a residential unit. While the current accommodation is reasonably suitable for him, the unit is located on the third floor I agree that it is not appropriate that he has to walk up six flights of stairs. From the evidence of Ms Oates, the plaintiff otherwise is able to cope quite well with his home unit accommodation (Ex 3, p 335).
The defendant submitted that the plaintiff has not in any way established that he needs a "special" residence and it would appear that no attempts have been made to find more appropriate accommodation since the current premises were obtained. The defendant submitted that if the plaintiff could have established that an appropriate unit was available but would cost more than the current unit, then a small allowance could be made. However, it says that there is simply no evidence sufficient to enable the court to make a determination that appropriate accommodation cannot be found at the same cost as that currently being paid by the plaintiff.
Further, the defendant submitted that even if it were to be accepted that the plaintiff needed to be provided with a house, the costs of the additional requirements to suit the plaintiff could not be more than those set out in the supplementary report of Mr Hesse. Mr Hesse calculates the additional costs of modifying a new building at approximately $192,000, but as the report is based upon the need for the plaintiff to be in a wheelchair, this is not correct. There is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff needs the additional items detailed, such as a ceiling hoist and so on.
It is my view that some allowance should be made for self care equipment including a stable shower chair, long handled equipment, an electric razor and specialised cutlery. On this topic, I would allow the items set out in Ms Oates' recommendations at Appendix 3.2 (Ex 3, p 351).
It would also be appropriate to make an allowance for the plaintiff to relocate to a ground floor unit with a larger bathroom. That may involve the difference between the weekly rent currently being paid and the additional weekly amount to secure a unit on the ground floor with a larger bathroom. I would make an allowance for the possibility of a differential in rent. It is my view that there is no persuasive evidence to suggest that the plaintiff needs a hydrotherapy pool.

Additional future home maintenance and running costs
The plaintiff claims $741,672 for additional maintenance and running costs based upon the maintenance report by Mr Craig of Sydney Building dated 4 March 2014 (not provided). The defendant submitted that this claim is unclear.
I have already decided that the plaintiff does not need a special residence, but some allowance should be made for the difference in rent between his current unit and one in the same area on the ground floor with a larger bathroom. This does not mean that additional maintenance and running costs will be incurred with this change in residence. I disallow this amount.

Additional travel costs
The claim for additional travel expenses is based upon the report of Mr Ronald J Cook dated 12 July 2013 (Ex D) and the report of Dr Buckley. Mr Cook has calculated the costs of airflights, both domestic and international, the costs of disabled accommodation, meals (including carers) and costs of sightseeing. David Fan has calculated the costs of the additional carers. His calculations are as follows. Domestic travel to Perth $1,224,576, Darwin $746,130 and international travel $963,984, totalling $2,934,696. Dr Buckley does not refer to holidays in his report.
The plaintiff was last in China in July 2000 (T69.29). The plaintiff claims travel costs including two yearly domestic holidays to Perth and Darwin (flying Qantas business class) and one European holiday every four years (flying Qantas first class).
The defendant submitted that no allowance should be made in relation to travel expenditure.
The plaintiff submitted that he requires additional travel costs as he needs to go to Europe and travel domestically. He says that he will require two carers and company to assist him at all times with luggage due to his disabilities and the risk of falling (Ex E [33(a) & (b)]). Ms Alach supported the view that the plaintiff needs three weeks per annum for holiday travel (Ex D p 47).
However, Ms Oates considered it unlikely that the plaintiff would have travelled on holidays for three weeks per annum, particularly overseas, given he was not working in 2007. She also said that if the plaintiff does go on holidays, she would not anticipate that his care needs would vary and that care support would be purchased from a care agency in his holiday destination locale and that this allowance for care has been included under the heading future care (Ex 3, p 341).
The plaintiff gave no evidence of going on holidays between 2000 and 2007. He had limited funds to do so. He had not travelled overseas or visited family in China. I do accept that he would have gone on holidays both in Australia and overseas from time to time, but not with such regularity as set out by David Fan. The plaintiff could travel with Ms Wang who is able to support him. I would make an allowance of a modest sum to compensate the plaintiff as there are some holiday activities he is no longer able to undertake and it would be necessary for him to have accessible accommodation as he uses a rollator frame. He does not require business class or first class flights. He does not require carers to assist him. He would not have travelled to Europe every four years, but he may have travelled a few times over the next 32 years. Based on the past, there is no evidence to suggest that he would take two domestic holidays per year.
I would make a small allowance for the additional costs where standard accommodation is not accessible for him.

Special equipment costs
The plaintiff claims $8,476,063.66 in special equipment costs based on the report of Ms Alach (Ex D, p 54-55). I have already made an allowance as recommended by Ms Oates for special equipment. No further allowance should be made.

Assistive technology
The plaintiff claims $522,496.00 for assistive technology based upon the report of Dr Graeme Smith dated 25 July 2013 (Ex D). The plaintiff stated that before 20 January 2007, he was a healthy and strong person but now requires special assistive technology to meet his needs as a result of his medical complications and moderately severe widespread sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (Ex E, p 9).
The plaintiff currently has a computer. He can use the internet for five hours per day (T110.10-17).
The defendant submitted that it is possible that the plaintiff may need an iPad. The cost of an iPad is approximately $600. The plaintiff's claim for assistive technology totalling in excess of $522,000 should be rejected. Counsel for the defendant argued that there is simply no basis upon which it could possibly be asserted that the plaintiff is in need of the type of assistive technology set out in his experts' reports. The defendant submitted that Dr Buckley had formed the view as to the entire or total disability of the plaintiff as a result of his psychiatric condition, and as that condition has entirely disappeared, there is simply no basis for the plaintiff needing assistive technology, other than for the cost of the iPad.
Ms Oates (report, 19 March [2015, Ex 10)] said: "... I do not understand why Dr Smith thinks a desktop computer and a tablet are necessary for Mr Fan and he has not made it entirely clear why a new computer is required at all given one was purchased for Mr Fan in 2011 and he only uses very basic functions. 
I would not support software licences for Office and related products as these are not recreational in nature and are mainstream need, unrelated to the current claim. 
I do not support training from a computer buddy or continuing maintenance or other training as a functional necessity. I find recommendations for technician, training and services to be excessive and unwarranted. 
I do not support environmental control technology because Mr Fan and his family live in rented accommodation and so extensive modification is not reasonable or necessary. Mr Fan is mobile and able to transfer and should be encouraged, not discouraged, to get up and move around. 
I do support iPad due to peripheral neuropathy and better access using touch screen technology. I have valued this item at $549.00 as a one off purchase. On screen training is available and a one off additional charge of $50.00 for some suitable Apps is supported. Total costs supported = $599.00 one off."
The iPad (or its later version) would need to be replaced from time to time over the next 32 years. I would allow $5,000 for assistive technology.

Provision of suitable motor vehicle
The plaintiff claims $764,222.40 for the provision of a suitable motor vehicle, based upon a report by mechanical automotive engineer Mr Ali Akbarian (report, 14 February 201, Ex D, p 6) and the reports of Dr Buckley and Ms Alach.
The plaintiff gave evidence that before 20 January 2007, he had obtained a green P driver's licence but, as a result of his medical complications and moderately severe widespread sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, he now needs the provision of a suitable motor vehicle and car maintenance (Ex E [37(a) & (b)]). The plaintiff's green P licence expired in 2009.
The only evidence on this topic was given by Ms Wang. She said that when they were separated, he came and picked her up in a car: "Q. He has never had a car, has he? 
A. He has a car. He has NRMA Insurance. Also has a licence, P Plate, means a provisional licence. 
Q. You told her Honour that he had a car and he had a licence. It was a lie that he had a car wasn't it? 
A. He has a car. He hasn't got a car. He has a car. When you ask whether he has a car or he hasn't got a car, I said that he has a car. 
Q. That was not true was it? 
A. Yes, he has a car. 
Q. When did he have a car? 
A. Because at a certain stage we were separated, the exact year, which year he has a car I didn't ask him. 
Q. You don't know if he had a car or not during that period of time do you? 
A. Yeah, sometimes I was sitting in his car. 
Q. That's just a lie isn't it? 
A. No. 
Q. You're willing to say anything that you think will help this case aren't you? 
A. Yes, he has a car." (T271.4-27).
Even if I accepted Ms Wang's evidence, then at best, the plaintiff had a car sometime before 2007 for a short while.
The defendant submitted that the plaintiff does not need a suitable motor vehicle because the plaintiff is able to use public transport and an ordinary taxi. The defendant considered that at worst, the plaintiff might need to use a disabled taxi.
Ms Oates' (report, 14 February [2015, Ex 3], p 314) opinion was that while Ms Alach has made recommendations for a motor vehicle the plaintiff has not had a vehicle in the past and Ms Wang does not drive. According to Ms Oates, the plaintiff seems to be able to negotiate community living using public transport. Ms Oates anticipated that he could do so safely in his local area following a period of inpatient rehabilitation. She recommended some assistance for travel outside the local area.
It is my view that the evidence to the effect that the plaintiff needs a special vehicle was entirely unpersuasive and based upon the notion that sometimes there might be shopping. Evidence on this topic was given by Ms Wang where she says: "Q. Why can't he use an ordinary taxi? 
A. Small taxi, sometimes the space can't put the walking frame in the back.
Also can't put the walking frame in and sometimes he has luggage, so the taxi got to be a big one. 
Q. What sort of luggage does he have? 
A. Shopping like this time, lots of cases, and sometimes the shopping bags, and also the walking frame. He needs a taxi for disabled person." (T270.7).
I do not accept Ms Wang's evidence that the plaintiff had a car. Her evidence is vague and even if the plaintiff had a car for a while, it has not been established that he owned it. I do accept that he had a green P plate licence prior to 2007. Ms Wang did not give evidence that she had a drivers licence or a car. It is possible that the plaintiff may have acquired a motor vehicle in the future but I accept that since 2007 it is extremely unlikely that he would be able to hold a drivers licence and drive a car. I would make an allowance for taxi hire from time to time including the occasional need for a disabled taxi.

Exercise (membership of club or gymnasium with membership for his carer)
The plaintiff claims $104,832.00 for membership of a club or gymnasium for him and his carer based upon Dr Buckley's report (dated 12 January 2010, pp 2, 15).
Dr Buckley opined that the plaintiff's brain injury and executive dysfunction is likely to cause considerable difficulty in identifying exercise options which the plaintiff is likely to maintain. Therefore, the plaintiff would require a wide range of exercise options, such as those available in a club or gymnasium, in order to assist his carer to help the plaintiff to maintain an appropriate cardiovascular and strengthening exercise program. In addition, the activities coordinator should have membership of the club or gymnasium, because the plaintiff is unlikely to maintain his exercise program without the direct involvement of his activities coordinator (Buckley report, Ex D, p 15).
The defendant submitted that there is no evidence that the plaintiff would intend, in any way or to any extent, to utilise a gymnasium membership nor is there any basis upon which it could possibly be asserted that the plaintiff requires such a need.
It is my view that Dr Buckley reached his opinion based on the wrong premise, namely the plaintiff's brain injury. I would not make an allowance of $104,832 for membership of a club or gymnasium for the plaintiff and a carer.

Future medical interpreter fees
The plaintiff claims $198,000 for future medical interpreter fees. He says that he needs to claim these costs due to his disabilities (Ex E, p 10). This seems to be based largely on the plaintiff's assumption that he needs in home physiotherapy intervention three times per week for 36 years, occupational therapy and scooter training.
The calculation is made as follows. Physiotherapy in home intervention interpreter fee, $250 x 3 per week = $750, $39,107.14 per year for a total of 36 years = $1,407.857.04; occupational therapist prescription for equipment interpreter fee $250 x 12 hours = $3,000; occupational therapist assess and training to "max person care IADL" interpreter fee $250 x 18 hours = $4,500; and occupational therapist for scooter assessment and training interpreter fee $250 x 8 hours = $2,000.
The defendant considered that if the plaintiff required specialist medical intervention as a result of a disability caused by a breach of duty by the defendant, then it would follow that he would be entitled to an allowance for damages for future medical interpreter fees, but it is by no means clear how frequently the need would arise. However, the defendant submitted no allowance should be made.
I agree that some allowance should be made for an interpreter to assist past and future medico-legal appointments and for his initial visit to a physiotherapist and home visit by an occupational therapist.

Childcare past and future
The plaintiff claims $685,955.51 for past childcare for Su Fu Garana and $370,526.63 for future care. This claim is made on the basis that because of his disabilities, the plaintiff says, he can no longer reach or achieve the standard of responsibilities as a father for Su Fu Garana.
Such claims for childcare are governed by [s 15(B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s15.html) of the [Civil Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/). [Section 15(B)(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s15.html) provides: "(2) When damages may be awarded 
Damages may be awarded to a claimant for any loss of the claimant's capacity to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant's dependents, but only if the court is satisfied that:  in the case of any dependents of the claimant of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of "dependents" in subsection (1) the claimant provided the services to those dependents before the time that the liability in respect of which the claim is made arose, and  the claimant's dependents were not (or will not be) capable of performing the services themselves by reason of their age or physical or mental incapacity, and  there is a reasonable expectation that, but for the injury to which the damages relate, the claimant would have provided the services to the claimant's dependents: for at least 6 hours per week, and  for a period of at least 6 consecutive months, and there will be a need for the services to be provided for those hours per week and that consecutive period of time and that need is reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Note: [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s18.html) provides that a court cannot order the payment of interest on damages awarded for any loss of capacity of a claimant to provide gratuitous domestic services to the claimant's dependents."
The defendant submitted that no evidence has been provided which would enable the court to determine how the plaintiff intended to provide childcare, and that this is particularly important given that a claim is also made for past and future economic loss. Counsel for the defendant pointed out that the plaintiff has not provided any evidence as to how he would provide significant childcare when he alleges that he would also have been working full time. In addition, the defendant said there is simply no evidence to support the contention that the plaintiff is unable to provide childcare. The defendant also said that the plaintiff is mobile, although with restrictions, and that no evidence was adduced that indicated that he was unsafe to be left with his child.
According to the defendant, there is a significant degree of confusion in relation to the domestic relationships between the plaintiff, Ms Wang, David Fan and Su Fu Garana. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff now claims that but for disabilities caused by the negligence of the defendant, he would have been engaged in a significant amount of childcare. The defendant questioned how the plaintiff would have been able to attend to such childcare simultaneously with full or part time work, and that this has not been made clear.
The defendant submitted that it is not clear how the plaintiff's current disabilities would prevent him from performing childcare tasks. The defendant submitted that it is clear that the plaintiff is of perfect intellectual capacity; is able to mobilise with the use of his walking frame; and is not totally disabled. The defendant also submitted that it is unclear how any aspect of the plaintiff's disabilities have been caused by an unspecified breach by the defendant, which would impact on his ability to look after Su Fu Garana, and how allowance should be made.
Finally, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff has not established, but for the injury, how he could have a reasonable expectation that he would have provided childcare for at least six hours per week.
The plaintiff and Ms Wang gave some evidence on this topic (Ex E, p 41; Ex G, p 3). In 2006 and 2007, neither the plaintiff nor Ms Wang were working on a full or part time basis. Ms Wang and the plaintiff were sharing the responsibility for caring for Su Fu Garana. In 2007, David Fan also assisted with this care. I accept that while Su Fu Garana was a baby and toddler, the plaintiff would not have been able to physically carry him, change his nappy, bathe him and undertake tasks like that. The plaintiff would not have been able to play physical games with him, such as hid and seek. As Su Fu Garana has grown up (he is now 12 years old), he can look after his physical needs. However, I accept that there are some activities that the plaintiff would like to, but cannot do with his stepson due to his disabilities. For example, the plaintiff cannot participate in physical activities such as playing soccer or some other sport with Su Fu Garana and cannot take him to theme parks and the like.
While I would make some allowance for past and future childcare, I am unable to assess a precise amount as there is no specific evidence from the plaintiff or Ms Wang as to the type of physical tasks the plaintiff would have undertaken, or as to what level of supervision and amount of the hours of childcare were provided to Su Fu Garana. Nor were there any costings.

Court and legal expenses
The plaintiff claims reimbursement of the legal fees of $19,779.34 paid to Lamrocks solicitors. An order for costs will made after this judgment has been delivered. It is not appropriate to deal with a claim for legal expenses and court costs in this judgment, because they are matters to be taken into account if the plaintiff had a judgment entered in his favour and a subsequent costs order made in his favour. He has not. No allowance for these costs are made in an assessment of damages.

Wei Fan's hospital debts and Medibank Private statement of benefits paid
The plaintiff claims $9,380.10 for hospital debts owing to St George, Prince of Wales and Sutherland hospitals and $96,371 for reimbursements of Medicare Private fees which have been paid by him. He was treated in hospital between January and March 2007 on the basis of that he did not have Medicare Private insurance at that time. It is not clear what these expenses relate to. Further, it appears that the hospital debts or Medicare private expenses have been claimed earlier. No allowance should be made for these items here.

Conclusion
The plaintiff's claim fails. I enter judgment in favour of the defendant.
Costs are reserved.
