AB(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) - at trial - against NEM it was submitted that worker was last employed by respondent company "in an employment to the nature of which the"[mesothelioma] "was due" during the period which NEM had insured the employer company - against the appellant it was submitted that it was the last employer of the worker in his employment in respect of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) on the basis: (1) the trial judge should accept the construction given to "employment" in [s
AB(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) in Cinzano versus Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Workers Compensation) Limited <case>; [(1992) 8 NSWCCR 158] - that "employment" should be interpreted as the employment of a worker by an employer and not particular employment duties at particular times, and (2) that even if the Cinzano construction were not accepted, the appellant would still be the liable insurer - the trial judge accepted the Cinzano construction and on basis (1) held CIC was the liable insurer - also, trial judge said if he was wrong on basis (1) he would hold against CIC on basis .

APPEAL - the appellant succeeded in overturning basis (1) - the earlier and incorrect construction of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in CIC Workers Compensation
Ltd versus Alcan Australia Ltd [(1994) 35 NSWLR 169] - NEM accepted the CIC versus Alcan construction but asserted CIC still liable on basis of what trial judge had said about basis (2) - CIC argued that [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) required examination of actual circumstances of worker's employment from time to time and not conditions generally of employment in employee's work place -
NEM submitted the relevant question for determination in the appeal concerned the date the worker was last exposed to the risk in his employment - CIC also submitted in answer to the alternative argument accepted by the judge: (1) the statements made by the trial judge in his decision in the worker's claim were inconsistent with what he said in his second decision, and (2) there was no evidence to support the trial judge's findings in the proceedings between the insurers.

Held: (1) On the construction of [s 151AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) and meaning of "employment" for the purposes of the section, in light of the decision in CIC versus Alcan, the construction advanced by NEM was the preferable one; this embraces not only the actual work tasks performed by the employee, but also those of the employee's movements through the employer's premises in the course of the employment which exposed the employee to risk. (2) The later reasons given by the trial judge on the basis (2) submission can be read together with the earlier reasons. (3) There was sufficient evidence before the judge to justify his conclusion.

ORDERS 
Appeal dismissed; parties to make submissions concerning costs within fourteen days of the delivery of these reasons.

JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: This case was heard at first instance by his Honour Judge
Johns of the Dust Diseases Tribunal in May 1992. The aspect of it with which this appeal is concerned is the application of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) as it stood at that time.
 "The plaintiff's exposure continued until sometime in 1984 when the re- lagging of lines began to be replaced with a new synthetic material. This however was only done when lines had for one reason or another to be re- lagged. Exhibit N details the extent of asbestos that currently remains on the defendant's premises. From then onwards the plaintiff appears not to have been required to work upon asbestos lined machinery or piping." 
At the beginning of the hearing of the cross claims all the insurers admitted that policies of insurance existed as alleged in the cross claim against each and that indemnity under those policies was sought by Kellogg and refused by each insurer. It was then agreed between all the parties to the cross claims that the evidence adduced at the hearing of the worker's negligence claim viva voce and by way of tender was to be evidence for the purposes of the cross claims.

On that evidentiary bases the parties to the cross claims made their submissions.

Of the various cross defendants the two on whom attention was particularly focused were Insurers Guarantee Fund National Employers Mutual General
Insurance Association Limited (In liquidation) (NEM) who had insured Kellogg from 1 April 1977 to 30 June 1985 and CIC Workers' Compensation Limited who had insured Kellogg from 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1992. Against NEM it was submitted by various parties that the worker was last employed by Kellogg "in an employment to the nature of which the" [mesothelioma] "was due" in the 1977-1985 period during which that insurer had insured Kellogg. This was on the footing that as Johns J had found in the passage from his reasons set out above that the worker appeared not to have been required to work upon asbestos lined machinery or piping from some time in 1984 then the nature of his employment had ceased at that time to be one to which his mesothelioma was due.

Against CIC it was contended by various parties that it was the last employer of the worker in his employment and that this made the time when Kellogg's liability was to be taken to have arisen to the worker for purposes of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) the time during which CIC was insuring Kellogg.

Those asserting CIC was liable had two arguments. The first was that Johns J should accept the construction given to "employment" in [s
AB(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) by O'Meally J in Cinzano versus Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Workers Compensation)
Limited <case>; [(1992) 8 NSWCCR 158.] His Honour had held that "employment" should be taken as meaning the employment of a worker by an employer and not particular employment duties at particular times. The second argument was that even on the Cinzano construction, CIC should, on the evidence, be the liable insurer.

Johns J accepted the Cinzano construction and on that basis held that CIC was the insurer liable under the section. However, he also considered the second argument against CIC. In doing so he first described the construction which he had rejected: "The essence of this argument seems to me to involve a consideration of the evidence that looks at the incidence, character and nature of the employment during the separate periods the insurers were on risk and to determine whether the employment environment during those periods was of such a kind as to involve a risk to the employee of contracting malignant mesothelioma. It follows that in this case it was contended by the third cross defendant that the fourth cross defendant was the insurer at the time the plaintiff was last employed by it at an employment to the nature of which the disease was due." 
He then proceeded to consider what conclusion he would have reached had he accepted that view of "employment".
 "It has been pointed out by the other cross defendants that exhibit N, which details the results of an investigation by an industrial hygienist corporation, Noel Arnold and Assoc Pty Ltd dated May 1991, disclosed major locations within the defendant's premises in which asbestos materials were still observed. Such investigations revealed that the steam-lines, condensate lines and various other kinds of pipes were asbestos lagged and in addition, a great deal of asbestos material was contained in other equipment still used by the defendant. Similar evidence was given by the plaintiff (at page nine of the transcript) and in addition answers to interrogatories by the defendant admitted the existence of asbestos material still present on its premises. The character, nature and incidence of the plaintiff's employment make it clear to me that his employment to the present time is of such a kind as to involve a risk of contracting the disease or is capable of causing. As I have previously indicated it is unnecessary to show that it was the cause of injury, but rather was apt to produce it. There if it is necessary to address the question of examining the incidence, character and nature of the employment during the separate periods particular insurers were on risk then the third cross defendant" [CIC] "would in any event be liable to indemnify the cross claimant for the damages awarded to the plaintiff because such exposure was capable of causing mesothelioma." 
In Wellcome Aust Limited versus Australian Eagle Insurance Co Limited [(1993) 34
NSWLR 269] Rolfe J, not agreeing withthe Cinzano construction, decided that the concluding words of [s
AB(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) required that attention be directed not to the contract of employment but to the kind of work being done by the employee at various times.

This court considered the same question in CIC versus Alcan in 1994. Gleeson CJ, with whom Mahoney and Meagher JJA concurred, agreed with Rolfe J's construction, saying: "The employment referred to is not a contractual relationship ... but the engagement in a form of activity which exposed [the employee] to a risk of a disease of such a nature as to be contracted by a gradual process." (at 177) 
Gleeson CJ then applied what he had just said to the facts of the case in a way that made his view of the meaning and operation of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) unmistakable. The employment of the worker in the case had been from October until November 1987. Until 1985 the worker worked in surroundings in which he was exposed to asbestos. Because of a programme of removal of asbestos by the employer that exposure ended in October 1985 and there was after that no relevant exposure to asbestos.

Gleeson CJ, after stating his own opinion in the sentence reproduced above, went on to say: "Such employment, on the findings of fact made by Judge O'Meally, continued up until 4 October 1985 and then came to an end. On that basis, it was
American Home Assurance, not CIC, that was liable under [s
AB.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html)" (at 177) 
In the present case, CIC's grounds of appeal were at first directed primarily to the question of construction which had been held against it by Johns J.
This court's subsequent decision in CIC versus Alcan meant that ground of appeal must succeed. This was recognised by NEM, one of the only two respondents (at that stage) to the appeal, the other being Kellogg. It was apparently assumed by CIC that if it succeeded in its appeal NEM would necessarily become the insurer liable to indemnify Kellogg.

NEM agreed that it was bound by the decision in the CIC versus Alcan and did not seek to submit that case was incorrectly decided. NEM then argued however that, accepting the CIC versus Alcan construction, CIC still remained liable on the basis of the facts set out by Johns J (see p 6 above) when he was considering the alternative argument against CIC. This stance on the part of
NEM produced the issues in the appeal.

CIC argued that the construction in CIC versus Alcan required an examination of the actual circumstances of a worker's employment from time to time and not the conditions generally of employment in the employee's work place. On this view, a worker employed in a factory in parts of which asbestos was present, whose actual working place was not in those areas, would not be "in an employment to the nature of which the disease was due". On this basis, on his
Honour's findings of fact set out above it was submitted that the worker would not after 1984 have been in the necessary employment.

For NEM however it was submitted that this submission involved an incorrect view of the facts and also too narrow a view of "employment"; its submission on the construction point eventually became that an employee was within the requirements of the subsection if in the course of carrying out the employment the employee was in fact exposed to risk because of the employment, employment for this purpose embracing not only the actual work tasks performed by the employee, but also those of the employee's movements through the employer's premises in the course of employment which exposed the employee to risk of inhalation of asbestos particles.

In my opinion the latter construction is either required by CIC versus Alcan or, if not actually required by that decision, fits with it much more readily than the alternative construction proposed. In my opinion it is the construction which should be adopted in this case.

Once that position is reached the issue between CIC and NEM in the present case becomes the date when the worker was last exposed to such a risk in his employment. Although in Johns J's reasons for judgment of 8 May 1992 he made findings indicating that that latest date was some time in 1984, (which would make NEM the last insurer for the purposes of [s
AB(1))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html), the passage already quoted from the reasons for judgment of 12 May 1992 (on the cross claims) indicated that the latest exposure stretched into the period when CIC was on risk.

Thus, once CIC succeeded in the present appeal in overturning the first basis (the earlier and incorrect construction) upon which Johns J had decided liability against CIC, CIC then had to meet the argument that on the proper construction it was still liable for the alternative reasons given by Johns J on 12 May 1992.

CIC sought to meet this position in two ways. First, it said that the relevant statements made by Johns J on 12 May 1992 were inconsistent with what he had said on 8 May 1992 (see p 5 above), and, not being essential to his decision of 12 May 1992, should be disregarded.

I do not agree with this. I think the two sets of findings can be read consistently with one another. What the judge was dealing with on 8 May 1992 was the worker's claim. For the worker's case it was sufficient to establish exposure at any time in the employment. That having been done it was of no concern in his case, or to the judge in deciding it, that the latest date for exposure should be fixed. That question became of critical relevance, in the second proceedings, for the alternative argument; in considering that argument
Johns J was bound to consider what further evidence there might be of later exposure, which he had not needed to consider before.

I also think that it is fair to read what he said on the matter in question in his second set of reasons as constituting alternative findings, guarding against the event that a construction like the alternative one of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) might, as happened, later be held to be correct.

CIC's second answer was that there was no evidence to support the relevant findings made by Johns J on 12 May 1992. NEM contended that there was such evidence, and in its turn then made an alternative submission. This was that if the evidence did not support exposure lasting until the time when CIC was on risk, there was nevertheless evidence justifying a finding that exposure lasted at least until a time in 1985 when not NEM but FAI Traders Prudent
Insurance Co Limited (FAI Traders) was on risk. (Its period of cover had been from 1 July 1985 to 30 June 1987.) 
These varying submissions concerning the factual and evidentiary situation were explored at some length.

The court then reserved its decision, but not before pointing out that FAI
Traders had not been made a party to the appeal and since NEM was now making an alternative submission that it should bear the liability, the court might consider that the appeal should not be allowed to go further without FAI
Traders being made a party and having full opportunity, if it chose, to contest the appeal.

Subsequently the court came to the view that FAI Traders must be made a party.
The court thought it prudent also that the other cross defendants should be joined. Orders were made accordingly. All the insurers thus had an opportunity to make submissions to the court. Whether a particular insurer chose to run the risk of incurring further costs in regard to the appeal was left to the parties to determine individually.

The addition of the parties led to a further day of hearing. All the insurers attended. They had all been supplied with the written submissions and transcripts of the argument put by CIC and NEM in their absence and were agreeable to the appeal proceeding as if they had been present throughout.

Having now reviewed the evidence which was canvassed before us as being relevant to the findings of fact implicit in what Johns J said in his second judgment of 12 May 1992 relevant to the present point, it seems to me that there was sufficient evidence before the judge to justify the conclusion that during the period when CIC was the employer's insurer, the worker, in the course of his employment, in fact was exposed, in various parts of the employer's factory premises to asbestos particles in the atmosphere. The evidence is not strong as to the details of this in the period relevant to
CIC, but it seems to me, as I have said, to have been sufficient, particularly in light of the way the relevant evidence was tendered, and dealt with, at the trial. Various matters, challenged by CIC in the appeal, were not on my reading of the materials before us, significantly in issue at the trial, and the evidence has to be assessed in that light.

I would therefore not interfere with the factual findings made by Johns J.

My opinion therefore is that although CIC succeeds in this appeal in displacing the first basis of the finding made against it by Johns J, when the matter is looked at on the footing of what seems to me to be the appropriate construction of [s
AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151ab.html) as it stood at the relevant time, the alternative basis indicated by Johns J for arriving at the same result in any event, should not be disturbed.

I therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed.

At the end of the argument in the appeal, the possibility of complications in costs orders was mentioned and the court indicated that if conclusions were reached that made it seem appropriate for the parties to be given an opportunity to make submissions concerning costs, then that opportunity would be given. I think in the circumstances it would be appropriate for that to be done, and accordingly I propose an order be made that any party wishing to make submissions as to costs orders should file a written note of its arguments with my associate within fourteen days of the delivery of these reasons.
 
MEAGHER JA: I agree with Priestley JA.
 
BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Priestley JA.
