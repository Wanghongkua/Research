Lolly Pops (Harbourside) Pty Ltd versus Werncog Pty Ltd Matter No 1830/98 [1998] NSWSC 294 (28 July 1998) 
Last Updated: 28 August 1998 `LOLLY POPS (HARBOURSIDE) PTY LTD versus WERNCOG PTY LTD` `1830/98` `28 July 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The proceedings were heard by me over some days earlier this year and I gave an extensive judgment on 1 July. Today the matter is in the list to deal with the short minutes that flow from that judgment and to deal with costs and associated issues. Both parties have presented short minutes and I will not spend time saying why I prefer those of the defendant to those of the plaintiff, but I will base my orders on that draft. 
The main issue that I have to decide is whether the defendant should pay the whole of the plaintiff's costs or some lesser amount. The plaintiff says that it won the litigation and although there were multiple issues, they were not so clearly separated and differentiated that it would be proper to make a proportionate order for costs. I think that is right up to a point.

The issues on which the plaintiff lost involved the matter of the Trade
Practices Act 1994, the rent issue, but most importantly the [Retail Leases
Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/) point. What does concern me is that the interlocutory hearing, the costs of which were reserved, had proceeded to day three when the [Retail Leases
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/) point was argued for the first time. I think Mr Robinson, for the defendant, is correct to say that once that argument came into the ring any defence to interlocutory relief had to be abandoned. Accordingly, for that reason, if not others, those three days were in effect lost. If the point had been raised earlier, it would not have been necessary for that long interlocutory hearing.

Ordinarily where costs of an interlocutory proceeding are reserved the ultimately successful party obtains them, but that is not a universal rule and one has got to consider all the relevant circumstances. Doing the best I can,
I think the defendant should pay ninety percent of the plaintiff's costs to take that matter into account.

Accordingly, the orders I make are as follows, and I will read them out in full so they can be recorded on the transcript, but it should be noted that orders 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are basically in accordance with the defendant's short minutes.
I declare that the plaintiff on or about 14 January 1997 validly exercised an option for the renewal of lease U708851Y dated 15 September 1994.
I declare that the said lease and any option under it are not subject to the provisions of the [Retail Leases Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/).
I order that the defendant specifically perform and carry into effect the provisions of the lease and the option exercised under it.
I reserve liberty to apply in relation to the orders required for working out of the above order.
I order that upon the plaintiff paying to the defendant the sum of $40,177.60, and upon the execution by the plaintiff of a new lease, the defendant grant possession of the premises at Shop 283 Festival Markets
Darling Harbour to the plaintiff.
I grant liberty to the plaintiff, within 28 days of today or 28 days of the stay in order 10 being lifted, whichever is the later, to file a notice of motion seeking an enquiry into damages suffered by it in consequence of the breaches of clause 15.1 of the lease. Such notice of motion is to contain with specificity the breaches and damages alleged to flow from each such breach.
I order that the defendant pay ninety percent of the plaintiff's costs to date: I reserve further costs.
I reserve further consideration generally, and in particular what if any adjustment in rent should be made in consequence of the plaintiff being out of possession since 15 April 1998.
I order that the sum of $6,064 presently held by the solicitor for the plaintiff pursuant to consent orders of 9 April 1998 be paid to the defendant in partial satisfaction of the amount to be paid under order 5.
I stay orders 3, 5, 6 and 7 until further order, or until 30 September , whichever first occurs, on the following conditions: that the defendant will promptly file a notice of appeal and diligently prosecute that appeal including promptly applying for expedition of the hearing of the appeal; and that on or before 19 August 1998 the defendant will tender to the plaintiff a form of lease that should be executed under orders 3 and 5 together with a nomination of the appropriate rent.
