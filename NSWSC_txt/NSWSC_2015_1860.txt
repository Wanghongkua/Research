JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE - REVISED) 
Introduction
The plaintiff applies for a writ of restitution in respect of certain land known as 59 Lawson Road, Panuara in the State of New South Wales.

The background
The first and second defendants are registered proprietors of the Property. On 14 July 2015 judgment for possession was entered in favour of the plaintiff against the first and second defendants in respect of the Property. The plaintiff's rights depend on a mortgage granted by the defendants to secure a debt which remains due and payable.
On 27 July 2015 a writ of possession was issued in respect of the Property. On 11 August 2015 the Sheriff of New South Wales issued a Notice to Vacate and scheduled an eviction for 9 October 2015.
Ultimately, the eviction did not proceed on that day because of the Sheriff's apprehension that there may be violence and that the police should accompany the Sheriff when enforcing the writ of possession.
The eviction was rescheduled for 30 October 2015, on which day the Sheriff executed the writ of possession and placed the plaintiff into possession of the Property. At the time of the eviction, the plaintiff made arrangements for a locksmith to change the locks at the Property.
It was necessary for the plaintiff to have works conducted at the Property with a view to preparing it for sale. The plaintiff instructed that any contractor should be accompanied by a security guard when attending the Property because of its apprehension of violence on the part of the defendants.
Accordingly when a pool contractor attended the Property on 16 November 2015 he was accompanied by Mr Peter Walker of CTM Protective Services. On that occasion, Mr Walker noticed that he was unable to unlock the entrance gates as the keys which had been provided to him by the plaintiff did not fit the locks. The locks appeared to have been changed on each of the entrance gates since the time of the eviction. A folder of documents was placed at the entrance gate. Assertions were made in various of the documents that the defendants had a continued right to possession of the Property. Some of the documents appeared to be authentic, although they were at odds with the established facts. I infer that their appearance was designed to give verisimilitude to the defendants' claim for possession. Mr Walker also noticed the presence of animals on the Property and inferred that the animals, which had been relocated from the Property at the time of the eviction, had been returned to the Property by the defendants.

Consideration 
The plaintiff's notice of motion
The matter first came before me in the Duty List on 2 December 2015, at which point I abridged the time for service of the plaintiff's notice of motion for a writ of restitution, together with affidavits in support of Richard Lewin, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff. The matter was made returnable before me this afternoon at 2pm.
In the interim, the defendant has provided an affidavit affirmed on 3 December 2015. It appears from that affidavit that the defendant, Daniel Maksacheff, has been properly served. He is the partner of the second defendant. In his recent affidavit, Mr Maksacheff sets out various assertions in which he denies the plaintiff's claim to the property and objects to the plaintiff's application being heard today.
In the course of the hearing on 4 December 2015 the court officer, at my request, rang the mobile number provided for Mr Maksacheff, since he had apparently made some request that that occur. However, there was no answer at the time of the call, which was made very close to the time at which the matter was listed before me today. In all the circumstances, I am not disposed to defer determination of the notice of motion until Mr Maksacheff makes himself available to the court.

The defendants' conduct since the writ of possession was executed
In my view the only reasonable available inference is that the defendants have re-entered the Property to take up residence there and have taken steps to subvert the writ of possession and the plaintiff's access and proprietary rights with respect to the Property.
In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appropriate remedy is to issue a writ of restitution to restore the plaintiff's possession of the land on the Property.

Conclusion
As I see it, the defendants have taken action, which was either designed to, or, in any event, had the effect of thwarting the writ of possession which was issued by the court in respect of the Property. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that a writ of restitution issue.
