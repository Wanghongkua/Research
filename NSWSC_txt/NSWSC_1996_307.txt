Coshott versus Madgwick [1996] NSWSC 307 (29 July 1996) 
Robert Gilbert COSHOTT versus Warren Walter MADGWICK - T/as MADGWICK PARTNERS
SOLICITORS & ORS /96 
MONDAY 29 July 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ABADEE J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In this matter the plaintiff seeks relief as set forth in the amended summons which has been filed in court today. The first order that is sought is that the plaintiff have leave to apply, pursuant to <case> of the [Legal Profession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/), for an assessment of the costs of the defendants in respect of bills of costs dated 3 November 1993, 29 November 1993, 31 January 1994, 28 February 1994, 12 April 1994 and 5 May 1994. Somewhat curiously, the defendants have adopted the position in respect of this order sought and indeed in respect of the other order in the amended summons, that they neither consent nor oppose the making of such orders.

In respect of the first order, there is a jurisdictional question that appears on the basis of the materials that have been presented to the court by Mr
Vardas for the plaintiff. The question that arises in relation to the orders sought in order number one of the amended summons is whether I can extend time for the purpose of making the order, that is sought. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/s199.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) is the relevant provision operative in relation to the first order that is sought. It is common ground that that is the applicable statutory provision.
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the Act provides that a client who is given a bill of costs may apply to the proper officer of the court for the assessment of the whole or any part of those costs. The section further provides that the application relating to a bill of costs may be made even if the costs have been wholly or partly paid.
[Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) provides that, in the event of the costs having been wholly or partly paid, the application is to be made within the period prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of sub s(2) of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s25.html) of the [Legal Profession
Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/lpr288/) provides a limitation period for applications by clients for an assessment of costs where the bill has been paid or partly paid. It provides that the prescribed period for making an application for an assessment of a bill of costs is a period of twelve months after the bill was given to the client. It is also conceded by Mr Vardas that each of the bills referred to in order one sought in the amended summons have been, in fact, fully paid.

Despite this fact, it appears that proceedings were instituted in this Court which initially came before the Master in April 1996. The matter came before the Master upon the basis of seeking an extension of time to tax bills of costs to which I have referred which have already been paid. It appears that the Master took the position that he had no jurisdiction to make an extension of time order. It is by no means clear how the matter came before me in the light of this fact. However, the application is that I should extend time under <case> of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/). It is submitted that I have an inherent power to extend the time that is prescribed under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) and [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s25.html) of the Legal Profession Regulations 1994.

It seems to me that the prescribed period is quite clearly stated as being a period of twelve months after the bill was given to the client. There is no provision in <case> nor is there any provision in the Regulations which permits the court to extend the period of twelve months for the purposes of making an order under <case>. It also seems to me that <case> and Regulation 25 is directed to imposing a specific time limitation for applications by clients of costs assessments where bills have been paid or partly paid. One can well understand why, in circumstances such as these where bills have been paid or partly paid, firstly, why there is a prescribed period and secondly, why there is no provision for that prescribed period to be extended. It seems to me, as a matter of ordinary statutory construction, I do not have jurisdiction to extend the time for an application for costs assessment of the bills referred to in the first order sought in the summons.

As I have said it has been submitted that I have an inherent jurisdiction to make the order extending time. No authority has been referred suggesting that
I have such jurisdiction to extend time in the face of a specific statutory provision which specifically states what the prescribed period is. Thus I do not believe that I have the inherent jurisdiction that has been urged upon me to extend the time referred to in the Act. However, alternatively even if I did have the power I would not in the circumstances extend time pursuant to any inherent power. In any event, it seems to me that the real problem that confronts the plaintiff in respect of the bills of costs referred to in order number one of the amended summons is the problem that arises by reason of s and Regulation 25.

I have said enough to indicate that I would not make the orders sought in paragraph one of the amended summons. That leaves me to deal with the orders sought in the rest of the summons.

It seems to me that in the circumstances of this case nevertheless I should make the orders sought in numbers two and three of the amended summons. I am reinforced in reaching such a conclusion by the fact that the defendants neither consent nor oppose the making of both of those orders. Therefore, the orders of the court are as follows: I make orders in accordance with numbers two and three of the amended summons, but I refuse to make the order sought in order number one of the amended summons.

The orders are as stated.
