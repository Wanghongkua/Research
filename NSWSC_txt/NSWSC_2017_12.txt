JUDGMENT
The Applicant seeks a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of an unexplained wealth assessment under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) requires the Court to make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer setting out the matters in subs (5) and stating the ground on which the suspicion referred to therein is based if the Court is satisfied that the suspicion is reasonably held.
The present application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 18 January 2017 who is an authorised officer of the Plaintiff. She suspects that the Defendant has engaged in serious crime related activity by committing the offence of dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193c.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) involving money laundering. The offence against [s 193C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193c.html) is an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more and is therefore a serious criminal offence pursuant to [s 6(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne bases her suspicion on reading the statement of police facts prepared after the arrest of the Defendant and a co-offender. She sought to ascertain by email from the police officer who prepared those facts that he was the officer who drafted the facts sheets, that to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief the contents of the facts sheet were true, and that the facts sheet had been prepared based on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. The officer who drafted the facts replied in the affirmative to each of those questions.
I have read the facts sheet and I am satisfied that the suspicion that Ms Bourne has is a suspicion reasonably held that the offence has been committed.
The Plaintiff seeks that the order be made without prior notice being given to the Defendant. That application is made on the basis of what Ms Bourne says in paragraph 8 of her affidavit, that she is aware that in the absence of a restraining order it is possible for people to enter into unregistered mortgages of real estate very quickly, that motor vehicles can be disposed of or forms relating to their disposition backdated, and that funds in bank accounts can be disposed of very quickly.
I am satisfied, in all the circumstances, that it is appropriate to make the orders without prior notice to the Defendant. The Defendant has the rights available to him under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review of the orders.
