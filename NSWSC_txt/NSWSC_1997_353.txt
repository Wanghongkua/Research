AMP Workers' Compensation Services Ltd` `v Pathlab Diagnostic Services Pty Ltd` ` 2736/97` `1 September 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /97 AMP WORKERS' COMPENSATION SERVICES LTD versus PATHLAB DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application by a Receiver for leave to carry on the business of a company, which is now in liquidation. 
The material before the court suggests that there is going to be no monies available for the unsecured creditors. There is no money available to pay the liquidator. So that for all practical and commercial reasons, the unsecured creditors and the liquidator have little concern as to whether the company should trade or not.

The Receiver supported by the secured creditors, wish the company to continue to trade. It would seem, accordingly, that in the circumstances, the appropriate order should be made.

The court approves Schon Gregory Condon, the Receiver of the defendant company, carrying on that company's business generally until further order.
