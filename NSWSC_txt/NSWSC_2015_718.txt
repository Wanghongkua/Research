EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: On 2 April 2015 I made a number of orders on the application of the New South Wales Commissioner of Police ordering suppression and non-publication in relation to a number of details which emerged in the evidence in the trial of Mr Tony James Simmons (see non-publication orders in R versus Simmons (No 5) <case> at paragraph 44). That judgment annexed two different versions of judgments previously delivered in the criminal trial of Mr Simmons in two different forms. One of the forms simply anonymised the police officers who were referred to by their assumed names and that judgment is available, according to the orders made on 2 April 2015, as a restricted judgment on the Judicial Commission's website. The other version of the judgments annexed to R versus Simmons (No 5) were redacted to take out the detailed references to the nature of the police operation by which Mr Simmons was tricked into making a confession.
Since the publication of R versus Simmons (No 5), the trial continued and came to a conclusion on 20 May 2015 when Mr Simmons was acquitted. I published a lengthy judgment that day and invited submissions from the Commissioner as to the appropriate form in which it could subsequently be published, and that judgment is known as R versus Simmons (No 7) [[2015] NSW SC 574.]
The Commissioner, represented by Mr Bhalla of counsel and the New South Wales Crown Solicitor's Office, has provided me with a version of the judgment in which various redactions are proposed and they are highlighted in yellow. The matter has been mentioned a couple of times in the court and I have been persuaded that the judgment should be redacted in the manner proposed by the Commissioner. I do not propose to give further reasons for that. I make the orders in accordance with both the [Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/) and the [Law Enforcement and National Security (Assumed Identities) Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/leansia2010546/) and for the reasons disclosed in R versus Simmons (No 5). The orders are, in my opinion, necessary to maintain the integrity of various operations, the details of which I ought not to go into, but which are detailed in various confidential exhibits which are before me.
In the course of that process Mr Bhalla identified two words of the judgment in R versus Simmons (No 2) <case> which ought to have been redacted but which were not, and I propose to make the redactions, or order the redactions be made on the version of the document published on Case Law. It is to paragraph 50, the two words following the words "he had been paid following the" will be redacted.
In relation to the judgment which became R versus Simmons (No 8) <case>, a matter was drawn to my attention which is, if one put all the pieces together from the proceedings and the seven judgments previously published, may have disclosed part of the police modus operandi. On being notified of that I arranged for a redaction to paragraph 17. That redaction will remain in place.
The orders that I made in R versus Simmons (No 5) remain in force and I confirm them. Pursuant to [section 9(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s9.html) of the [Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/), the following further exceptions will apply to order number 9 made on 2 April 2015: 
The judgment known as R versus Simmons (No 7) [[2015] NSWSC 574], may be published as a restricted judgment by the Judicial Information Research System in the form approved by this Court and may be accessed for use in legal proceedings by members of the judiciary, their staff and legal practitioners in accordance with the protocols established by the Judicial Commission of New
South Wales.

The judgment known as R versus Simmons (No 7) [[2015] NSWSC 574], may be published in a redacted form as approved by this Court.
The original unredacted judgment known as R versus Simmons (No 7) [[2015] NSWSC 574], is to be kept on the court file in a sealed envelope marked "not to be opened except by order of a judge of this Court or a higher court".
