SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DIVISION 
TEMBY, AJ 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings the respective plaintiffs claim declarations and orders with respect to ten search warrants, five in relation to the plaintiff Warner, issued as to three on 21 June 1996 and two on 23 June, two in relation to the plaintiff Ventura, both issued on 21 June, and three in relation to the plaintiff O'Connor, of which two were issued on 21 June and one on 23 June. The search warrants were issued variously in relation to premises and motor vehicles. They were issued variously by the defendants Wendy Elder, Lies Donovan and Ross Lawton, all of whom have entered submitting appearances. The proceedings were defended by the other defendants, who are officers of the Royal Commission into the N.S.W. Police Service, and who procured the issue of the warrants. They are referred to in this judgment as "the defendants".

The warrants are identical or practically so. The schedule to this judgment contains the terms of the first issued relative to premises occupied by the plaintiff Warner. The First Schedule to it contained 55 names. The attachment was a copy of the Letters Patent issued to the Hon. James Wood (a Justice of this Court) appointing him as "sole Commissioner to make inquiry into the operations of the New South Wales Police Service, with particular reference to;" (inter alia) 
The nature and extent of corruption within the Police Service, particularly of any entrenched or systemic kind.

The system of promotion in the Police Service.

The impartiality of the Police Service and other agencies in investigating and/or pursuing prosecutions including, but not limited to, paedophile activity.

The efficacy of the internal informers policy.

Any other matter appertaining to the aforesaid matters concerning possible criminal activity, neglect or violation of duty, the inquiry into which you consider to be in the public interest.

The terms of reference can be described fairly as very wide.

In relation to each warrant the orders sought are that it is void and of no effect, that it be quashed, and that the issuing of a certificate pursuant to cl.10 of the Search Warrants Regulation 1994 is void and of no effect.
Warner seeks orders that the defendants deliver up to him the property seized.

The evidence before me in each matter comprises an affidavit sworn by the solicitor for the plaintiffs attaching the search warrants relating to that plaintiff, and property seizure records. Mr R. Bonnici of counsel for the plaintiffs sought to read further affidavits as to the mode of execution of the search warrants, and as to the solicitor's inability to obtain a hearing before a Magistrate to have the certificates revoked pursuant to cl.10(4) of the Search Warrants Regulation. I rejected those affidavits, basically because they were outside particulars provided in October last, and irrelevant to the relief sought in the Summonses. Lest there be doubt about it, I should make clear that jurisdiction is conferred upon any authorised Justice by cl.10(4) to revoke a confidentiality certificate, and no consent of this Court is needed to obtain a listing in a Local Court for that purpose.

The following provisions of the [Royal Commission (Police Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) are of relevance.
 [s.15.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s15.html)
An authorised justice to whom an application is made under subsection (4) may issue a search warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so.

An authorised person may apply to an authorised justice or the
Commissioner for a search warrant if the person has reasonable grounds for believing that: there is in or on any premises a document or other thing connected with any matter that is the subject of the Commission's inquiry or that such a document or other thing may, within the next following 72 hours, be brought into or onto the premises; and the matter involves any conduct of a person that constitutes or involves or may constitute or involve a criminal offence.
 [s.16.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s16.html)
A search warrant authorises any police officer, or any other person, named in the warrant: to enter the premises; and to search the premises for documents or other things connected with any matter that is the subject of the Commission's inquiry; and to seize any such documents or other things found in or on the premises and deliver them to the Commission.
 [s.17.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s17.html)
A person executing a search warrant must produce the warrant for inspection by an occupier of the premises if requested to do so by that occupier.
 [s.18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s18.html)
A person authorised to enter premises under a search warrant may use such force as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of entering the premises.
 [s.22.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s22.html)
If, in the course of searching, in accordance with the terms of a search warrant, for documents or other things: the person executing the warrant finds a document or other thing that the person believes on reasonable grounds to be evidence that would be admissible in the prosecution of a person for an indictable offence against the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and the first-mentioned person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to seize the document or other thing in order to prevent its concealment, loss, mutilation or destruction, or its use in committing such an offence, that person may seize the document or other thing and, if it is so seized, it is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been seized pursuant to the warrant.
 [s.23.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s23.html) [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/index.html#p3) of the [Search Warrants Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/) (other than [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s16.html)-[20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s20.html)) applies to a search warrant issued under this Act.

Mr P. Lakatos of counsel for the defendants relied upon [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s14.html) of the [Search Warrants Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/), which provides that such a warrant "shall be in or to the effect of the prescribed form". By [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s11.html) of that Act, an application for a search warrant must be in writing in the form prescribed by the regulations, and must be made by the applicant in person. Further formalities are laid down by [s.12A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s12a.html)
An authorised Justice who issues a search warrant must, by [s.15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s15.html), prepare and furnish an occupier's notice which must be in or to the effect of the prescribed form, contain stipulated information, and must be served at the time of execution of the warrant. In this case the occupier's notices were not put in evidence before me. There must be a report to the authorised Justice who issued the warrant after its execution: [s.21.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s21.html)
Finally by [s.23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s23.html) a search warrant "is not invalidated by any defect, other than a defect which affects the substance of the warrant in a material particular".

Clearly the warrants have been executed and property seized. It is common ground that a certificate issued pursuant to cl.9 of the Search Warrants
Regulation, so that the application for a warrant is not available for perusal. There is no material before me which supports an attack on the decisions to issue those certificates. Nor does the case have anything to do with the issue of the warrants or the manner of their execution. If the plaintiffs are to obtain relief it must be on the basis that the warrants are bad on their face.

The starting point for such an exercise is the enabling legislation. A warrant may be widely expressed and yet survive challenge: Karina Fisheries Pty Ltd -v- Mitson [(1990) 49 A.Crim.R. 153] at 173.
Powers of search and seizure are conferred in various ways, to various extents, and subject to various conditions precedent and subsequent, according to Parliamentary will defined by the terms of legislation passed. See Ryan and Raven -v- Tran Nominees Pty Ltd [(1986) 22 A.Crim.R. 274] at 277.

The approach of the Courts to any such legislation is well known. The common law attaches much significance to the privacy of premises and papers. Neither the Crown nor another can force entry upon the premises of a citizen, or seize their papers, without statutory warrant for doing so. The terms of legislation which seek to disturb the common law position are scrutinised carefully and the Courts have shown a propensity to read them down where it is practicable and proper so to do. Indeed protection from arbitrary search and seizure by
State functionaries has long been seen as characteristic of a free society.
The elder Pitt, Earl of Chatham, said this in a speech in about March 1763: 
The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the
Crown. It may be frail -- its roof may shake -- the wind may blow through it -- the storm may enter -- the rain may enter -- but the King of England cannot enter -- all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenament.

See Chic Fashions (West Wales) Ltd -v- Jones <case>; [[1968] Q.B. 299] at 307.

An entry upon premises, or seizure of papers or things, which is not authorised by law, constitutes a trespass.

The first submission for the plaintiffs is that the warrants are too widely expressed as to what can be seized. On the face of it each warrant authorises those executing it to enter particular premises, or a described motor vehicle, to search and to seize anything. Some items on the list of matters are particular, as for example drug paraphernalia, video production equipment, safety deposit box keys, post office box keys, diaries, personal organisers and telephone indexes. Others are broad, as for example, banking and financial records. But it is the concluding words which compel the conclusion that each warrant on its face justifies the seizure of anything in the place to which it relates. If the searching officers can seize not just the other items specified, whether particular or not, but also "any other documentation or things found in or about" the premises, there is no limitation upon them.
There is also great breadth inherent in some of the earlier items, namely documents, correspondence and photographs. Indeed the last item is worth dwelling upon briefly. Any residential premises are likely to have within them family photographs which could ordinarily be of no interest at all to law enforcement authorities, or in this case to a Royal Commission. Of course there might be other photographs which almost establish an offence has been committed, or which are of evidentiary value because they demonstrate an association. These warrants do not distinguish between these possibilities. On the face of it the searching officers could seize every photograph, including one showing the occupant when a toddler and others of his late grandmother.
Reverting to the concluding words of the seizure paragraph, they can in my view be read in no other way than that the warrants authorise seizure of anything whether documentary or not.

In answer the defendants point to s.16(1) of the [Royal Commission (Police
Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) which it is said takes the case outside the accepted rule stated in Trimboli -v-
Onley (No. 1) [(1981) 56 F.L.R. 304] at 314. In that case Powell J. said that, in the absence of a precise power in the enabling statute, the issue of a general warrant is not authorised. In their written submissions the defendants went on to submit that the warrants under consideration "are qualified by their connection with a matter, the subject of the Commission's inquiry and provided the matter may involve a criminal offence, that is all that the Act requires".

The true position is that an authorised person may apply for a search warrant if that person has reasonable grounds for believing certain matters: [s.15(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s15.html)
The first is that there is in or on premises a document or other thing connected with any matter that is the subject of the Commission's inquiry. The second is that such matter involves any conduct of a person that constitutes or involves, or may constitute or involve, a criminal offence. The authorised
Justice to whom application is made may issue a search warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so: [s.15(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s15.html)
Such grounds would not exist unless the Justice was satisfied that the person making application had the reasonable grounds already dealt with. If so satisfied the Justice may issue the search warrant if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so. Unless these requirements are met no valid search warrant can issue. If a valid search warrant issues, then it authorises entry upon premises, search of them for documents or other things connected with any matter that is the subject of the Commission's inquiry -- and note the close correspondence between those words in [s.16(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s16.html) and what is contained in [s.15(4)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s15.html) -- and seizure of "any such documents or other things found" and delivery of them to the Commission. It is not the case that [s.16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s16.html) permits a search for documents or other things without qualification. The Act does not permit the issue of a general warrant. The rule stated in Entick -v- Carrington (1765) 19 St.Tr. 1029 has not been negated.

In my opinion these warrants are bad on the face of them because they are impermissibly broad. In my view that cannot be remedied by excision. In any event, the very breadth of the warrants justifies the conclusion that the
Justices who issued them misapprehended their functions.

The defendants have pointed to Parker -v- Churchill <case>; [(1986) 9 F.C.R. 334] at 338. They say in that case a warrant was held invalid but "not due to any lack of particularity in the description of the things sought". However when that warrant is compared with those under challenge in this case, it is found to be far more narrow. In particular there is no entitlement to seize "other documentation or things".

The defendants have also submitted that the fact searchers may rely upon information within their knowledge and accordingly are left with some degree of discretion "is not necessarily fatal to a warrant" -- Horowitz -v-
Condie [(1989) 41 A.Crim.R. 285] at 289.
That however serves to raise another arguable ground of invalidity.

Cases decided in relation to criminal search warrants, and accordingly arising under different legislation, make clear that there is no presumption of regularity when a warrant is issued by a Justice -- Patten -v- Justices of the Peace, Redfern [(1986) 22 A.Crim.R. 94] -- and that the warrant must show on its face that all statutory conditions precedent to its issue have been met. I note that in the former respect, and perhaps in the latter, the position is otherwise when a Judge is the issuing officer:
Karina Fisheries Pty Ltd -v- Mitson [(1990) 49 A.Crim.R. 193], but see also <case>; [(1990) 50 A.Crim.R. 98] at 113.
These warrants show no more than that the issuing Justices were satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for their issue. Nothing is stated as to the grounds. In particular nothing is stated as to the connection between the document or other thing sought to be seized on the one hand, and the matter the subject of the Commissioner's inquiry on the other. Nor do these warrants show how the matter that is the subject of the Commissioner's inquiry may involve conduct of a possible criminal nature. Accordingly the warrant gave the searchers no guidance as to what they were searching for. It is important to stress that by s.16(1)(b) the warrant entitles search only for documents connected with a matter the subject of the Commissioner's inquiry, and by (c) only such documents or other things may be seized. What matter the subject of the Commissioner's inquiry was the warrant issued in aid of? The possibilities include, but are not limited to, police corruption, paedophile activity, and related matters concerning possible criminal activity, neglect or violation of duty the inquiry into which the learned Commissioner considered to be in the public interest. Any of these could involve criminal activity. There are others which could hardly do so, for example the promotions system in the police service, and the efficacy of the internal informers policy.

On the face of the warrants the documents and things that may be seized are not qualified by connection with a matter or matters under Royal Commission inquiry, or a matter involving conduct that constitutes or involves, or may constitute or involve, a criminal offence. There is accordingly nothing upon which the contended for discretion of police officers could operate. The question is not whether they executed the warrants in a manner which was restrained, bearing in mind the limited purposes for which warrants may be sought and the qualifications contained in s.15(4), but rather whether the warrants could have on the faces of them led to a wider search and seizure than is legally permissible. In my view that depends upon the close examination of certain statutory and regulatory provisions, and the position is not improved by the succinct description in the warrants of what the Royal
Commission is investigating, namely "the corrupt activities of current and former New South Wales police officers", or attachment to the warrants of the terms of reference. I should add that the material before me does not enable any conclusion to be drawn as to whether the warrants were sought in aid of all matters the subject of inquiry, which seems unlikely because some are manifestly of an administrative and non-criminal nature, or which matter or matters under which term or terms of reference.

In relation to common search warrants, for example issued under s.5 of the [Search Warrants
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/) enabling seizure of things with a view to proving offences, the Courts have required that the warrants demonstrate on their face that conditions precedent to their issue have been met, and also the possible offences with respect to which search and seizure have been sanctioned. This is seen as desirable both so that the occupier of the premises in question is well appraised of the circumstances, and also that the executing officers have as much proper information available to them as is practicable.

That is not the case here. Neither the persons executing the warrants, nor the occupier, know from the warrants what is to be searched for, in relation to what matter. Purpose is therefore unclear. The defendants say it does not matter because the warrants comply with the requirement in [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s14.html) of the [Search Warrants
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/), that is to say they are in or to the effect of the prescribed form. Another reason that might be urged is that the purpose of providing information to occupiers is now met by the occupier's notice.

By [s.15(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s15.html) such a notice shall be in or to the effect of the prescribed form, and by (3) a person executing a search warrant shall serve the occupier's notice on an adult person upon entering into or on to the premises, or as soon as practicable after. The regulation already mentioned by cl.6 prescribes Form 6 for such a notice, and part of it reads in this way: 
Basis for the issue of the warrant 
The warrant was granted on the basis that the authorised justice found that there were reasonable grounds for the issue of the warrant and, in particular, that the applicant had reasonable grounds to believe (5) 
Various blank lines follow, and a footnote to the form reads: 
Here insert in summary form the grounds on which the search warrant was issued.

By cl.5 the form of search warrant prescribed is Form 4. That form says nothing as to grounds or purpose. The argument is therefore available that under the statutory regime now in force all that is necessary is for the
Justice to issue a warrant containing the bare information called for in the prescribed form, with more being required in the occupier's notice which does serve the purpose of giving the occupier information as to grounds and accordingly, at least ordinarily, purpose. As mentioned earlier, the notices to occupiers issued relative to these warrants are not in evidence before me.

It may be of significance that by [s.16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s16.html) a person executing a search warrant is required to produce it for inspection by the occupier of the premises only if requested to do so.

I am satisfied that the law as to what a warrant must contain has not been changed by the combination of [ss.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s14.html), [15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s15.html) and [16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/s16.html) of the Act, cll.5 and 6 and Forms 5 and 6. I say that because the source of authority for entry search and seizure is the warrant itself, all involved will be or at least should be aware of its terms and just what it authorises, and in the nature of things any lack of information will not be supplied by the occupier's notice simply because not all need be aware of what it contains. The present cases are very much in point. A large number of officers were authorised to assist in the execution of the warrants. If a particular warrant was executed by two or more individuals, each of them must be told by it and accordingly know what he or she can do. The warrant must provide that information. One only person is needed to effect service of the occupier's notice. It is easy to visualise a briefing session before execution in which the terms of the warrants were made known but not the terms of the occupier's notices.

In my opinion it is essential under the legislation being considered that the warrant on its face provides full information to those executing it as to purpose, that is to say what they are seeking in relation to what matter of inquiry. That is manifestly lacking here. In my opinion these warrants are bad for that reason also.

The challenge to each warrant has succeeded, and each plaintiff is entitled to quashing orders as sought. That would seem to render it unnecessary that orders by way of declaration be made. For that reasons that have been stated, the challenges to the reg.10 certificates have failed, but that hardly matters. The plaintiff Warner is, in my view, entitled to an order for the return to him of the articles seized. And the plaintiffs are, it would appear, entitled to their costs. I will hear counsel as to the precise form of orders to be made.
