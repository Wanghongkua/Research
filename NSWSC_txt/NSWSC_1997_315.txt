Ivymere Pty Ltd (Receiver & Manager Appointed) versus Cooloombla Pty Ltd` ` 3315/97` `18 August 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the Receiver and Manager of a mortgagor company for an order for possession of property against the second mortgagee. The Receiver was appointed by the first mortgagee. 
There is little doubt that, had an application been brought by the first mortgagee, the second mortgagee would have been in great difficulty defending its position. Further, despite warning on 8 August 1997 that the wrong plaintiff had brought these proceedings, the plaintiff persisted in saying that there were special circumstances enabling the Receiver, as agent for the mortgagor, to succeed in proceedings for possession against the second mortgagee.

With great respect to those who put that argument, it is completely misconceived. There is nothing in the main authority relied on,Lake Eerie
Pty Ltd versus Flair Realty Pty Ltd [[1992] ANZ ConvR 627], to support it. It is clear that the Receiver of a mortgagor, in the mortgagor's name even though appointed by the first mortgagee, can get possession against a person claiming under the mortgagor, but a second mortgagee is clearly not a person claiming under the mortgagor.

Accordingly, the proceedings are misconceived and must be dismissed with costs, and, as the point was brought to the notice of the plaintiff, costs must be on the indemnity basis. The exhibits should be retained.
