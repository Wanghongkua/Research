TOTAL $526,536.19  In these circumstances the orders which I make are as follows: 
Verdict for the plaintiff as against the first and third defendants in the sum of $526,536.19. 
Verdict for the second defendant as against the plaintiff. 
Verdict for the fourth defendant as against the plaintiff. 
That the second defendant's cross claim as concerns the fourth defendant is dismissed with no order as to costs. 
That the fourth defendant's cross claim as against the second defendant is dismissed with no order as to costs. 
With respect to the second defendant's cross claim as against the first and third defendants, that there be a verdict in favour of the second defendant in respect of its cross claim as against the first and third defendants. 
That the cross claims of the first, third and fourth defendants as against the second defendant are dismissed. 
With respect to the issue of costs: 
The plaintiff is to pay the second defendant's costs of the proceedings as agreed or assessed, save that, with respect to each of the cross claims between (a) the first and third defendants and (b) the second defendant the first and third defendants are to pay the second defendant's costs of those cross claims; 
That the fourth defendant is to pay its own costs except to the extent that it separately incurred costs that were not incurred in common with the costs of the first and third defendant; and 
Otherwise, the first and third defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.  When I published my primary reasons in this matter I indicated that I had made some corrections to the reasons which I had previously published. It was necessary for me to make corrections because the transcript of part of the judgment I delivered ex tempore was in some respects significantly different to the reasons I delivered in court.  In some respects I was able to verify this by reason of the typed notes from which I read in open court. Apparently in part of the reasons where I had not previously made significant notes the transcript which was delivered omitted a significant section. The parties were able to verify this from the notes they made. I accept that the published reasons should include that matter and accordingly I have included an amended para [65] in my primary reasons. Other amendments have also been made.  In the circumstances it is appropriate that I withdraw the reasons previously published and now publish my reasons in relation to both liability and damages.
