Revised 11 August 2009  /06 Michael Wilson & Partners versus Robert Colin Nicholls & Ors  
JUDGMENT 
The alleged abuse of process of this Court and ancillary considerations In previous judgments the Court has made clear that there are being heard together: i. these proceedings brought by Michael Wilson and Partners Ltd; ii. the defendants' contention that the proceedings constitute an abuse of process.
 
The notice to produce Towards the conclusion of the cross examination of Mr Michael Wilson by Mr
Lindsay SC, an issue arose following the defendants having served a notice to produce particular documents. The notice to produce had been dated 7 July 2009 [and became MFI P 17]. It required the plaintiff to produce all documents recording, referring or relating to any proposed or actual criminal complaint made in Switzerland in the period from 20 December 2006 to date against a number of entities and persons including Mr Emmett and Mr Risby.
 The plaintiff in its formal response stated as follows: i. that in respect of documents sought under sub paragraphs (a), (b), , (f) and (g), the plaintiff had no knowledge information or belief as to whether any such documents existed; ii. that in relation to those documents not produced by the plaintiff under sub- paragraphs (d) and (e), those documents constituted communications between the plaintiff and its Swiss and other legal advisers and were subject to legal professional privilege.
 A fairly extensive segment of the transcript of 29 July 2009 identifies the respective cross contentions of the parties in relation to the matter. It is inappropriate to revisit those sections of the transcript save to observe that: i. Mr Lindsay identified the perceived relevance of having a full and proper answer to the notice to produce as going to the defendants' abuse of process case . As I understood the contention it was to be: a) that the plaintiff secured from this Court, leave to use documents within the control of this Court for a complaint to the Swiss authorities.
 b) that in fact that complaint when made was based upon a false representation to the Swiss authorities of the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and Mr Emmett by the plaintiff.
 c) that these matters were not disclosed to the Court on the occasion when an ex parte application for relief was made.
 d) that the alleged abuse of the process of this Court was that the plaintiff had failed to fully disclose to this Court matters which would have been germane to its decision as to whether or not to exceed to the ex parte application, and principally had not disclosed any proposed wrongdoing in and about its suggested intent to manufacture a case that might be presented to the Swiss authorities as management fraud.
 ii. The issue first surfaced late in Mr Lindsay's cross examination in terms of his seeking to elicit from Mr Wilson certain matters which had apparently also been put to him in the United Kingdom arbitration.
 iii. Centrally the defendant sought to ascertain the precise genealogy said to have involved Mr Wilson in terms of the process taken prior to the complaints being forwarded to the Swiss authorities.
 iv. The court was informed that an issue concerns the identification of the very first English translation seen by Mr Wilson, and a requirement to examine the German translations or iterations thereof.
 v. Mr Wilson gave evidence in these present proceedings that prior to his having signed the German version of the complaint, he had had a form of that version in English to examine. Whilst it is difficult to explain in short fashion why the issue may have been important, it suffices to make clear that the defendant's contention is that in broad terms the allegations made against
Mr Emmett in Switzerland were or included an allegation that he had been guilty of management fraud so as to enliven powers to engage Swiss laws.
 Orders had been made on 15 July 2009 one of which was that subject to further order, the claims for relief made under the heading "abuse of process" in the notice of motion filed by the defendants on 13 July 2009 be heard together with the trial of the proceedings. The defendant's case relevantly in this regard had formulated the abuse of process claims now under consideration qua the Switzerland complaint as follows: i. the plaintiff has, without notice to the defendant or Mr Emmott used the processes of this Court in aid of a criminal complaint against Mr Emmott , in a foreign jurisdiction, designed to expose Mr Emmott and the defendants to criminal investigation.
 ii. In or about March, April, June and October 2007, the plaintiff obtained ex parte confidential orders from the Court to facilitate the making of a Criminal Complaint overseas without disclosing to the Court that the terms of the Complaint proposed to be made, (and made) falsely asserted that
Mr Emmott was the managing director of the plaintiff in Kazakhstan and misrepresented the terms of [particular causes of the December 2001 agreement between Mr Emmett and the plaintiff on are then referred]... The plaintiff induced the Court to maintain the confidentiality of orders made ex parte without disclosing to the Court the terms of the complaint as made or discrepancies between those terms and the agreement dated 7 December 2001. At no time since the complaint was filed with the Swiss prosecutor has the plaintiff brought that discrepancy to the attention of the court or admitted it.
 
The plaintiff waives privilege to a particular document In any event on 29 July Mr Walton [transcript 751] indicated that he had instructions to waive any privilege that might exist in respect of a 32 page document described as the third draft of 10 April 2007 written in English.
That document became MFI P 18.
 Mr Walton had earlier in further answer to the notice to produce indicated that he had five volumes of material in court which documents were said to be subject to a claim to legal professional privilege.
 
The application of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to matters ancillary to proceedings before the Court I do not understand the following propositions to be exceptional: i. A question which vexed various first instance judges and intermediate appellate courts was the precise reach of the provisions of the Act. In terms, the Act applies only to proceedings in court: [s4(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s4.html)
However, the notion - which may be traced back to the decisions of McLelland
CJ in Eq in Telstra Corporation versus Australis Media Holdings ([No 1) [(1997) NSWLR 277] and Branson J in Trade Practices Commission versus Port Adelaide
Wool [(1995) 60 FCR 366] - that the Act had an indirect or flow on effect to pre-trial proceedings, such as the issuing of a subpoena, or notice to produce, the answering of interrogatories, or the discovery of documents, obtained the approval of the NSW Court of Appeal in Akins versus Abigroup Ltd <case>; [(1998) 43 NSWLR 539], and of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd versus Spalvins <case>; [(1998) 81 FCR 360.] The latter decision was, however, overruled by a majority of a five member Full Court of the Federal Court in Esso Australia Resources Ltd versus Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1998) 83 FCR 511.] ii. The question whether the Act has an application by analogy to matters ancillary to proceedings in Court was resolved in the negative by the
High Court in three decisions. Northern Territory versus GPAO (1999) 196 CLR 553,
Mann versus Carnell <case>; <case>; [(1999) 74 ALJR 339.] iii. The effect in New South Wales of changes to the rules [originally the Supreme Court Rules (Part 23, Rule 1 (c), and later as transported into the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/)] extend to the pre-trial inspection of documents including notices to produce. The effect of the rules is that notwithstanding the decisions of the High Court of
Australia referred to above, when it comes to the application of legal professional privilege in most instances in connection of litigation - both in
Court and in matters ancillary to it - it is to the Act that one must now look. <case> at 15] <case> [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131a.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)] [See also [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p34)
UCPR].
 Nor do I see that there is any substantive difference between the relevant provisions of the Act and their Common Law analogues.
 
Legal professional privilege as a substantive right Legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law and not merely a rule of evidence: Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd versus Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission <case>; [(2002) 213 CLR 543] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Gaudron and Hayne JJ at 552 [9]-[10].
It is not merely a rule of substantive law, "it is an important common law right or, perhaps more accurately, an important common law immunity": at [11].
 McHugh J described legal professional privilege in the same case at 563 [44] as "a fundamental right or immunity". Kirby J at 575-576 [85] referred to it as "a basic doctrine of the law" and a "practical guarantee of fundamental rights".
 Accordingly, as a substantive common law right or immunity, legal professional privilege is not something the Court can simply abrogate as a matter of judicial discretion.
 
Legal professional privilege applies to the advice of foreign lawyers Allsop in Kennedy versus Wallace <case>; [[2004] 142 FCR 185] at 220-223 <case>- <case> (with whom Black CJ and Emmett J at [62] agreed) stated that because legal professional privilege is a fundamental right and because members of the community may well need to seek the assistance of foreign lawyers this entailed the extension of the privilege to foreign lawyers. As his Honour noted at [210] this position is in conformity with the authorities, in particular the decision of McLelland J in Ritz Hotel Ltd versus Charles of the
Ritz Ltd (No 4) [(1987) 14 NSWLR 100], at 102, and the decision of the Full Federal Court in Grofam Pty Ltd versus ANZ Banking
Group <case>; [(1993) 45 FCR 445], at 455.
 
Legal professional privilege may be determined following inspection of documents by the Tribunal without a waiver of privilege [Rule .8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s1.8.html) of the UCPR provides: "The court may determine any question arising under these rules (including any question of privilege) and, for that purpose: may inspect any document in relation to which such a question arises, and if the document is not before the court, may order that the document be produced to the court for inspection." The exercise of a court's power to determine claims for privilege was condoned, even encouraged, in Grant versus Downs <case>; [(1976) 135 CLR 674] at 689, per Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ.
 It is a common practice for courts throughout Australia to exercise this power. A discussion of the rule, its history and practice is set out in the judgment of Debelle J in Harris Scarfe Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (in liq) versus Ernst & Young (No 10) <case>; [(2006) 204 FLR 165] at 173-179 <case>- <case>. The discussion of the authorities in that judgment makes it clear that inspection should only take place where it is necessary to the determination of the question of privilege.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s133.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) contains an equivalent rule. It reads: "If a question arises under this Part relating to a document, the court may order that the document be produced to it and may inspect the document for the purpose of determining the question." In Bailey versus Department of Land and Water Conservation <case> the Court of Appeal clearly stated that [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s133.html) permitted judicial inspection of the documents to determine a claim for privilege: see per Tobias JA at [57]-[61]; also per Allsop P at [2]; and per
Hodgson JA at [6].
 In Esso Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ observed at 70 [52] that a court should not be hesitant to exercise its power to examine documents.
 
Onus for assertion of legal professional privilege It is accepted that the party claiming privilege bears the onus of establishing the basis of the claim: Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v
Victorian WorkCover Authority <case>; [(2002) 4 VR 332] at 337; In the matter of Bauhaus Pyrmont Pty Ltd (in liq) <case> at <case>), and that the party claiming privilege must establish the facts from which the court can determine that the privilege is capable of being asserted: National
Crime Authority versus S [(1991) 100 ALR 151] at 159.
 It is to be noted that"lawyer" for the purpose of [s.118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) includes under [s.117](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html) "a natural person who, under the law of a foreign country, is permitted to engage in legal practice in that country".
 
The evidence given by Mr Radosavljevic Mr Radosavljevic, a lawyer in the employ of the plaintiff, has deposed as follows: . One task in which I was involved between about January 2007 and
May 2009 related to MWP obtaining the assistance of the law firm Baer &
Karrer in Zurich, Switzerland, in connection with MWP filing a criminal complaint against Mr Emmott and Mr Risbey in Switzerland (the Baer &
Karrer Period).
 . I worked with Mr Wilson during the Baer & Karrer Period in connection with the obtaining of Baer & Karrer's legal advice in relation to: potentially making a criminal complaint in Switzerland, the preparation of the complaint and the subsequent developments in connection with the complaint; and a civil claim for losses that could run in parallel with the criminal proceedings.
 . A complaint was in fact filed on about 13 April 2007. A copy of the complaint, which was in German, together with a copy of the final English draft is annexed hereto and marked "A". A civil claim for losses suffered by
MWP related to the subject matter of the complaint was filed on 16 May 2007, a copy of which is annexed hereto and marked "B".
 . I have had numerous discussions, meetings and telephone conversations with Mr Wilson during the Baer & Karrer Period about various aspects of the investigations which MWP was undertaking and the steps which MWP wanted
Baer & Karrer to take in connection with the complaint. I was also involved in numerous telephone conferences with lawyers at Baer & Karrer.

MWP Staff involved in obtaining advice from Baer & Karrer . The following persons employed by MWP during the whole of or part of the Baer & Karrer Period included: 
Michael Wilson (director and principal lawyer); 
Christopher LaHatte (lawyer); 
Paul Mallon (litigation assistant); 
Aida Zhumyrova (secretary); 
Amitava Bhattacharya (litigation assistant /accountant); 
Andrew Paul Sherry (accountant); and myself.
 . Ms Aida Zhumyrova, was employed by MWP as Mr Wilson's secretary during the Baer & Karrer Period. Mr Wilson would sometimes have her send out from her own email address emails which he had prepared. Some of the documents which I have reviewed for the purpose of this Affidavit were emails sent by or to Ms Zhumyrova with Mr Wilson's authority.

Personnel at Baer & Karrer and other lawyers engaged by MWP . During the Baer & Karrer Period, the personnel at Baer &
Karrer with whom MWP corresponded regarding to the legal services which Baer & Karrer were providing to MWP included: 
Tina Wuestemann (principal lawyer); 
Barbara Lautenschlager (lawyer); 
Paula Alonso (lawyer); 
Flavia Bieri (lawyer); 
Sandra Hunziker; and 
Silvia Marcaccini.

I do not know what positions were held by Sandra Hunziker and Silvia
Marcaccini.
 . In addition to obtaining advice from and communicating with Baer & Karrer during the Baer & Karrer Period, MWP also sought advice from, and communicated with, other lawyers and law firms (many of whom were in other jurisdictions) regarding matters which were related to or ancillary to MWP's investigations into the conduct of Mr Emmott and Mr Risbey and the making by
MWP of a criminal complaint against them in Switzerland. The personnel at those other law firms included: 
Sid Wang (partner), Kate Dixon, David Sim and Kate Evans (formerly
Donohoe) (all lawyers) of Clayton Utz, Sydney; 
Mathew Walton SC, Barrister, Sydney; 
Lawrence Cohen QC, Barrister, London; 
Dr Martin Neese, Special Counsel, Switzerland;

Phillip Kite (partner) and Andrew Thorp (lawyer) of Harney, Westwood & Riegels, British Virgin Islands; and 
Jo Vinsen (lawyer) of Fox Williams, London.

In this affidavit where I use the expression "Swiss Lawyers" I am referring to Baer & Karrer and Dr Martin Neese.

 Mr Radosavljevic has also deposed as follows: 
Because of my involvement in the above matter I can say that all of the documents listed above constitute communications between MWP and its lawyers or records of such communications which were and are kept confidential and created for the sole purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice in connection with the criminal complaint and associated civil claim for compensation brought in Switzerland.
 
The weighing exercise There is no doubt but that there is an important weighing exercise whenever questions of legal professional privilege or waiver thereof arise in a litigious setting. The matter was carefully treated with in Esso Australia
Resources versus Commissioner of Taxation [1999] 201 CLR 49, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummon JJ restating the rationale for legal professional privilege at -65 [35]: "Legal professional privilege (or client legal privilege) protects the confidentiality of certain communications made in connection with giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in proceedings in a court. In the ordinary course of events, citizens engage in many confidential communications, including communications with professional advisers, which are not protected from compulsory disclosure. The rationale of the privilege has been explained in a number of cases, including Baker versus Campbell, and Grant versus Downs itself. The privilege exists to serve the public interest in the administration of justice by encouraging full and frank disclosure by clients to their lawyers. In
Waterford versus The Commonwealth, Mason and Wilson JJ explained that legal professional privilege is itself the product of a balancing exercise between competing public interests and that, given the application of the privilege, no further balancing exercise is required. As Deane J expressed it in Baker v
Campbell, a person should be entitled to seek and obtain legal advice in the conduct of his or her affairs, and legal assistance in and for the purposes of the conduct of actual or anticipated litigation, without the apprehension of being prejudiced by subsequent disclosure of the communication. The obvious tension between this policy and the desirability, in the interests of justice, of obtaining the fullest possible access to the facts relevant to the issues in a case lies at the heart of the problem of the scope of the privilege.
Where the privilege applies, it inhibits or prevents access to potentially relevant information. The party denied access might be an opposing litigant, a prosecutor, an accused in a criminal trial, or an investigating authority. For the law, in the interests of the administration of justice, to deny access to relevant information, involves a balancing of competing considerations.
 
Decision The plaintiff has made good its proposition that subject to any question of waiver, the categories of documents referred to by Mr Radosavljevic, prima facie establish legal professional privilege. The seminal question concerns whether, if so to what extent and in respect of what documents, the plaintiff has waived that privilege.
 As I see it that question can only be answered in terms of the defendant's abuse of process case earlier explained in relation to the suggestion of a deliberate intent [undisclosed to this Court] to mislead the Swiss authorities by passing to them a doctored set of relevant materials.
 Importantly to be noted is the fact that the alleged abuse of process is put as an abuse of the process of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
 In these circumstances it is clear that the plaintiff has waived privilege to the following classes of document: i. any documents in the possession, power and control of the plaintiffs which reveal the terms of the first initial complaint. However my understanding is that the plaintiffs have already discharged that obligation with the production of MFI P 18; ii. the documents described in categories (a), (b), and (c) in the above described schedule of so-called privileged on documents. That is to say the documents described as items 1 to 18,19 to 42, and 43 to 54; iii. the documents together with any attachments described: in box 66 at page 77 of annexure C to the 30 July affidavit; in box 134 at page 81 of annexure C to the 30 July affidavit; in box 162 at page 83 of annexure C to the 30 July affidavit.
 Whether or not the plaintiff has waived privilege in respect of the numerous other documents summarised in the above described affidavit will be made clear if and when the court directs that the other documents summarised above are to be made available to the court for its private inspection. At this stage of these proceedings counsel for the defendant to my understanding has objected to the court inspecting those further documents, my principal understanding currently being that that objection is based on the proposition that the defendants should first have a proper opportunity to inspect the documents in respect of which I have indicated there has been a clear waiver of privilege. As I have understood Mr Lindsay in particular, he contends that it may be that following the defendant's inspection of the documents which I have indicated in respect of waiver having occurred, the defendants may not pursue with the Court any intent that they should have access to the additional documents. In which case, as I have understood Mr Lindsay, it would be otiose for me presently to be reading five volumes of material arguably to no end.
