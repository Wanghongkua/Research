JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Admissibility - collateral facts - T8185) HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff proposes to call a Mr Dunks, to whom reference was made in the evidence of Mr Marsden at T6789.5, in relation to an incident involving Mr Elomari outside a Vietnamese restaurant in Campbelltown.
 This proposed evidence, in my view, does not fall within [s (c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s106.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) , as no prior inconsistent statement can be readily identified, if at all. Nor does it fall within [s (a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s106.html)
Evidence admissible under that subsection was taken from Mr Avzarradel, and ruled upon as admissible on 7 July 2000 (NSWSC 169: DLJT 188).
 The proposed evidence, in my view, fairly can be characterised as itself collateral evidence to evidence which, but for the operation of [s (a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s106.html), would itself be inadmissible under the collateral facts rule. I decline to admit it.
