NSWSC 586 (18 November 1998) 
Last Updated: 8 December 1998 `HELP DESK INSTITUTE PTY LTD versus PETER JOHN ADAMS & ANOR` `3496/98` `18 November 1998` `Young J` 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Once upon a time the plaintiff was controlled by two shareholders Peter Simmonds and Marlene Rae. They fell into argument and Federal Court proceedings were commenced between them, as a result of which it was agreed that Ms Rae would sell her shares for a certain amount of money. 
The first defendant, Peter Adams, was a solicitor who acted for the Rae interests and perhaps others. In the event, it would seem that an agreement was entered into between various people, but not including Mr Adams, whereby
Ms Rae's shares were sold to a third party. That agreement contained a clause dealing with legal costs.

Mr Adams claimed that part of those costs were not paid, and on 21 July 1998 dated a statutory demand under the Corporations Law against the plaintiff. His claim was that the plaintiff had agreed under that sale of shares agreement to be responsible for those costs or the most part of those costs and there was a supplemental agreement for the balance. On the same day Ms Rae dated a statutory demand claiming moneys due under the share sale agreement citing two invoices. Mr Adams acted as her solicitor. Both demands were served on 23
July.

On 11 August 1998 the plaintiff company issued a summons, prayers 1 to 3 of which were as follows: "1. An order that the Statutory Demand dated 21 July, 1998 served by the First
Defendant on the Plaintiff be set aside.
An order that the Statutory Demand dated 21 July, 1998 served by the
Second Defendant on the Plaintiff be set aside.
An order that the Second Defendant deliver up to the Plaintiff within seven (7) days the documents set forth in the Schedule to this Summons." 
Today Mr Warren of counsel appeared for the plaintiff and Mr Chippindall of counsel appeared for the defendants, Mr Adams and Ms Rae. Mr Chippindall took a series of preliminary points and these were argued before any other aspects of the application were considered.

The points were (1) that under <case> of the Corporations Law a summons to set aside a statutory demand had to deal with one demand and one demand only; (2) that it was not possible to amend the summons which originally had claimed more than setting aside the one demand; and (3) that the supporting affidavit under <case> had to deal with the demand being set aside and that matter only.

When these submissions were made I must confess my initial reaction was that they were ingenious, inspired, technical and wrong. However, the more I considered them the more I was persuaded by them, and in the end I hold they are correct. The reason for my initial disinclination flows from provisions such as <case> of the Corporations Law, which make it clear that strict compliance with form is not required, and then, constantly through the statute, there are provisions such as 459J(2), that mere defects are not to affect the result. Furthermore, the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/), [s (b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s23.html) (which by virtue of <case> of the Corporations Act, 1990 applies to the
Corporation Law) makes it clear that, unless the context otherwise provides, the singular includes the plural and vice versa.

However, these general thoughts must be read in the light of the way in which the legislature has expressed itself in the statute, the aims of the statute and the construction of the statute adopted by the High Court in David Grant & Co Pty Ltd versus Westpac Banking Corp <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 265.] 
Section 459G is as follows.
 " 459G(1) [Application to set aside statutory demand] A company may apply to the Court for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on the company.

G(2) [Time limit on application] An application may only be made within 21 days after the demand is so served. 
G(3) [Requirement for effective application] An application is made in accordance with this section only if, within those 21 days; an affidavit supporting the application is filed with the Court; and a copy of the application, and a copy of the supporting affidavit, are served on the person who served the demand on the company." 
It will be noted that subs (1) does refer to an application for an order setting aside a statutory demand. If there were not more then the [Interpretation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ia191/) would allow the court to read that in the plural.

An interesting comparison can be made with <case> of the Corporations Law which seems to go out of its way to differentiate between a single debt and two or more debts. Furthermore, <case> seems to contemplate that each statutory demand gives rise to a separate liability on the company to be wound up under [Pt .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ia191/index.html#p5.4) if that demand is not dealt with. However, there does not appear to be any case on the Corporations Law raising the present point nor, in the brief look that I have had of cases to set aside a bankruptcy notice, does there appear to be any case where the court has ever entertained a case to set aside two or more bankruptcy notices in the one proceedings.

But the real difficulty comes from subs (2)of <case>. The legislature has made it clear, and the High Court in Grant's case (supra) has underscored this, that the section itself limits the way in which applications can be made and the section talks about a strict time limit "after the demand is so served".

If more than one demand was contemplated, one would have expected the legislature to have said "after the demand is so served, or if more than one demand is served, by 21 days after the first of such demands is so served".

In the instant case both demands were in fact served on the one day, but it does not seem to me that that fact would affect the construction of the section, which is to cover all cases. Furthermore, the regime set up by [Pt .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ia191/index.html#p5.4) of the Law is that, essentially without litigation, a person can make a demand on a company, the company then has a definite period to apply under <case>, the demand must be accompanied by supporting verification, as must the application and a Judge or Master in a summary way then considers those matters and either sets aside the demand or does not. It is only in exceptional cases that the court will grant leave under <case> to allow matters to be raised on the final hearing of the winding up summons if the statutory procedure has not been followed.

The court was not expected to have to deal with supporting affidavits which included a whole lot of extraneous matters. In the instant case, for instance, the affidavits deal with matters of detinue and also cross-allegations of stealing and forgery against the shareholders and miscellaneous matters. The authorities show that is not the sort of affidavit that is required under s
G(3). The supporting affidavit required by this section need merely deal with why the statutory demand should be summarily set aside or varied. I do not mean to say that any extraneous material in such an affidavit will nullify its effect for the purposes of <case>. However an affidavit in which roughly three paragraphs are devoted to the statutory demand does not qualify.
I believe this follows from the main authorities in this area of the law, though in some respects it is their corollary; see Graywinter Properties Pty
Ltd versus Gas & Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund <case>; [(1996) 21 ACSR 581]; Zenaust Imports Pty Ltd versus Alembic Chemical Works Co Ltd [(1998) 28 ACSR 465] and Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd versus KWA Design Group Pty Ltd (Austin J - 23 October 1998, unreported).

It seems to me that when one adds all those matters together a contrary indication is given in the statute, that is, there can be only one summons dealing with one demand. In the instant case the two demands deal with similar disputes which might have been joined under Pt 8 of the Supreme Court Rules.
The case is really one of joinder of causes of action rather than joinder of parties, but it would fit within Pt 8 r 5 of the Supreme Court Rules. However, despite Mr Warren's submissions that the rules have not been displaced by s
G of the Corporations Law, it seems to me that the approach taken by the
High Court in Grant's case (supra) is that the statute has set up a very closely knit regime and that regime does displace many of the ordinary provisions of the Corporations Law and the Supreme Court Rules.

In accordance with the usual policy I have in fact read the affidavits which are going to be relied on, subject to all just objections, in chambers.
However, none of the affidavits have been formally read before me, save that I was taken through the affidavit of Peter John Simmonds of 10 August 1998. That affidavit deals with matters other than the statutory demands.

It follows from what I have said that that cannot be a supporting affidavit within the meaning of <case> and accordingly, there has been no filing of a supporting affidavit within the time limits prescribed by the Corporations
Law, so it is now not possible for the summons to succeed. For that reason, and for others, which it is unnecessary to express, I do not believe that I can just strike out, say, prayers 2 and 3 of the summons and let prayer 1 proceed.

Thus, the present summons is not an application within the meaning of <case> and the court cannot give any relief.

I think that it follows that the summons must simply be dismissed with costs.
However, there may be benefit in adjourning for twenty minutes after I have made a few remarks because the company may wish to make an application under s
S and costs may be saved if that was made today. On the other hand, the company may wish to think about the matter a bit further and see what further evidence it wants to put on.

There are some obvious difficulties for both sides in this case. It would appear to be an attempt to sue on a contract by a person who is not a party and there are problems raised according to the principles laid down in
Bartex Fabrics Pty Ltd versus Philips Fox [(1994) 13 ACSR 667.] Further, it seems strange that a company whose shares were sold recently for a six figure sum could seriously be said to be insolvent. However, none of those matters need be dealt with today because the summons has to be dismissed with costs.
