JUDGMENT 
Pluim Construction Pty Ltd ("Pluim") is a builder. Tuggerah Business Park Pty
Ltd ("Business Park") is the owner of a parcel of land at Tuggerah on which it desired to erect a commercial building which was to comprise a bulky goods store complex, car park and restaurant. The contract for that building was awarded to Pluim. It is in the form of General Conditions of Contract
AS2124-1992. Pluim was notified that it would get the contract by a letter of May 1995. The contract document, though executed by both parties, is not dated. The contract price was $14,926,860.

The second defendant, Vincent Trad ("Trad") is alleged to have been appointed as the Superintendent "in or about 6 July 1996".

The third defendant Wilde & Woollard Building Economists Pty Ltd ("Wilde & Woollard") was the quantity surveyor appointed by Business Park.

I need not identify the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants as the plaintiff's claim against each of them was discontinued in October 1997.

The present proceedings were commenced by a statement of claim filed in the
Defamation List on 23 April 1997. With annexures it consists of 162 pages.

The first claim (paras 12-20) in it is for $500,000 for breach of contract, namely failure to appoint a superintendent! Clause 23 of AS2124-1992 obliges the principal to "ensure that at all times there is a superintendent". The copy contract in evidence contains in Part A "The Superintendent- Saunders
Design" (an abbreviated reference to a proprietary company).

The second claim, paras 21-23, asserts breach by Business Park in failing to provide certifications of progress payments. This claim is for $5,600,949.11 plus interest of $389,206.64. That is the 16th and last of the progress claims in schedule 3 to this pleading.

The third claim (paras 24-25) is for "failure to respond to requests for further information". The claim is for $100,000, "damages and interest".

The fourth claim (paras 26-27) is for damages of $200,000 for failing to issue accurate plans drawings designs and specifications.

The fifth claim (paras 28-29) is for failure to "secure relevant approvals from relevant authorities or to submit such approvals within a reasonable time". This claim is for $100,000 damages.

The sixth claim (paras 30-33) asserts failure to give necessary directions to a nominated subcontractor. $50,000 damages is claimed.

The seventh claim (paras 34-41) is failure to timely approve variations to the contract. The claim is for $1,792,721.47.

The eighth claims (paras 42-44) is simply described as "Acceleration".
$554,652 is claimed as Pluim's "cost of accelerating the works".

The ninth claim (para 47) is for an extension of time for completion of 17 weeks. I have not been enlightened as to the source of this Court's power to effect that extension if the superintendent who is empowered so to do does not.

The tenth claim (paras 48-53) is failure to provide the site (semble access to it) on time and to pay delay and disruption costs of $682,987 plus interest thereon of $162219.31.

Those claims total $10,132,735.58, an additional 67.88% of the contract price.

The eleventh claim (paras 54-57) asserts that the damages of $1,492,791.86 imposed for late completion were not validly imposed. Alternatively it asserts that the amount imposed is too high.

The twelfth claim (paras 58-102) is for damages of $2m for libel and slander.
The claims in those paragraphs remain in the Defamation List. The remainder of the proceedings were transferred to the Construction List by order of Levine J of 24 May 1997. I return to the remaining 101 pages of this statement of claim.

Paras 103-105 assert estoppel as to the identity of the superintendent.

Paras 106-108 assert that either there were no schedule of rates, or if there was, it was misapplied.

Paras 109-111 assert that Business Park has waived compliance with conditions precedent to payment and is estopped from denying entitlement.

Paras 112-114 seek damages for repudiation in failing to appoint a superintendent. Damages of $50,000 are claimed.

Paras 115-118 claim a total remuneration for the building work done of $17,859,000 on a quantum meruit basis. The contract price was $14,926,860. The composition of the additional $2,932,140 is not revealed, but despite what simple arithmetic reveals, the amount actually claimed is $3,113,529 (paras -8) which is difficult to reconcile with the $10,132,735.52, the addition of claims 1-10.

Paras 119-124 claim damages of $3,113,529 for deceiving Pluim as to the existence and identity of a superintendent under the contract. That appears to be in addition to the $50,000 claimed in paras 12-20.

Paras 125-6 assert unlawful interference by the defendant with the plaintiff's trade and business but make no monetary claim in respect of that interference.

Paras 127-9 assert actionable misrepresentation as to the nature and extent of the works in the tender documentation, but do not claim any monetary compensation 
Paras 130-3 assert a claim for damages for breach of contract causing loss of profits which para 132 quantifies at $889,499, but the claim is only for $500,000! 
Paras 134-143 (18 pages) assert breaches of the Trade Practices Act and the
Fair Trading Act. Nineteen misrepresentations are pleaded, including para 135 "that the formal Instrument of Contract, as prepared by (Business Park) and as executed by (Pluim) accurately reflected the agreement reached between the parties"!! 
Paras 144-9 contain allegations against the second defendant, Trad, said to be "the current superintendent of the Supa Centa Tuggerah who was employed throughout the construction phase of the Supa Centa as an architect with
Saunders Design Pty Ltd, the Superintendent named in the contract documents provided by Business Park". The charge is that Trad in concert with one or more of the third, fourth and fifth defendants unlawfully interfered with
Pluim's business and trade relations". The basis of that allegation is that he had been a member of a design team whose remuneration is, was, or may be effected by a superintendent's decision, so that he lacked impartiality and should not have accepted employment with Business Park as superintendent. He is by para 149 accused of being a "mere puppet" of Business Park.

Paras 150-7 propound a claim in negligence against Trad as superintendent.
Seven separate allegations of negligence follow. Substantially these complaints accept the efficacy of Trad's certificates and assert that he should not have given them.

Paras 158-169 propound a claim in negligence and under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act against the third defendant, Wilde & Woollard, who had assessed the project costs at $18.8m, thus misleading Pluim, it asserts, as to what the work would cost. How that can be reconciled with Pluim's having signed a contract with a price $3.87m less than this assessment has not been explained (nor could it be).

Paras 170-4 propounds Pluim's charge against the fourth defendant J S Nominees
Pty Ltd. It is said to be the parent company of Business Park. The charge is one of unlawfully interfering with Pluim's "trade and business relations".
Damages of $500,000 are claimed.

Paras 175-9 propound the charge against the fifth defendant Lanlex No.117 Pty
Ltd. The charge against it is that it induced Business Park to breach its contract with Pluim. It is said wholly to own Business Park and to have induced that breach in order to secure better financial terms from lenders! and in order to obtain a s102 application (sic) from Wyong Shire Council.
Damages of $500,000 are claimed.

Paras 180-194 propound the claim against the sixth defendant Sika Australia
Pty Ltd. It supplied some of the roofing material. The claim is that the goods were not of merchantable quality, and not fit for the purpose which Pluim made known to the vendor. This claim is for $121,285.

That some of these claims have been propounded at all throws doubt on the competence of the plaintiff's advisers and on the reliability of the plaintiff's executives on whose instruction these claims have been propounded.

What has followed is worse. I will record it chronologically.

On 16 May 1997 Business Park filed a notice of motion to have struck out those parts of the statement of claim which did not plead defamation. It was pursuant to that notice of motion that so much of the statement of claim as did not deal with the defamation claim was transferred to the Construction
List.

On 19 May the sixth defendant Sika Australia Pty Ltd filed a notice of motion seeking the order that the claim against it (paras 179-193) be struck out or repleaded.

On 26 May 1997 the first defendant, Business Park, filed a notice of motion seeking orders that the statement of claim be struck out pursuant to Pt 15, r26 of the Supreme Court Rules (authorising the Court to strike out the whole or any part of a pleading which discloses no reasonable cause of action or which has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings or which is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court) or alternatively that paras 1-57 and 103-194 be struck out .

On the same day, 26 May 1997, the second defendant Trad filed a notice of motion seeking that all paragraphs in the statement of claim pleading a cause of action against him be struck out or alternatively that they be transferred to the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court.

At a directions hearing on 30 May 1997 Pluim was given leave to file an amended statement of claim. It filed it on 16 June 1997.

This amended statement of claim is confined to the defamation relied upon by
Pluim. I am not concerned with that claim.

On 24 June 1997 the first, fourth and fifth defendants filed a notice of motion applying for security for costs in the sum of $558,250 "or such other sum as the Court sees fit".

On the same day the plaintiff applied to have subpoenas issued by the first, fourth and fifth defendants set aside. There were ten such subpoenas. They are addressed to bodies corporate whose names include "Pluim", to the managing director of the plaintiff, to his wife and to another body corporate which I am unable to identify apart from recording that its name was GB & ML
Holdings Pty Ltd. That application was disposed of by an inter-party agreement.

On 26 June 1997 the second defendant Trade filed a notice of motion seeking an order for security for his costs in the sum of "$186,000 or such other amount as the Court thinks fit".

On 27 June 1997 the third defendant Wilde & Woollard filed a notice of motion seeking security for its costs. On 15 July 1997 Pluim filed a further amended Statement of Claim. It also comprises 136 pages. The amendments, if any, are not indicated in the customary way.

On 21 July the third defendant, Wilde & Woollard filed a notice of motion seeking that the amended statement of claim pleaded in so far as it is against it (paras 160-202) be struck out or repleaded. These paragraphs assert that in
November 1994 Wilde & Woollard assessed the costs of the project at $18,800,000, that this assessment was provided to Business Park prior to its calling for tenders; that Wilde & Woollard prepared the bills of quantities which "placed" the cost of the works at approximately $14.7m, that it should have known that this assessment and those bills of quantities would be relied upon by the plaintiff and that Pluim did so rely and in consequence suffered loss and damage. There were a series of other allegations of negligence by Wilde & Woollard in its estimating, particularly when
Business Park revised its budget for the project from $18.8m down to $14.7m.

On 25 July 1997 Rolfe J made, by consent, orders adjourning these notices of motion until 22 August 1997, directing any further motions for the striking out of the amended statement of claim be filed by 8 August 1997 returnable on August 1997, that all submissions in support of notices of motion be served and filed on or before 15 August 1997 and submissions in reply be filed and served by 20 August 1997. There was also an order that Pluim have leave to file a motion for summary judgment on paragraphs 36-38 of its amended statement of claim, also to be returnable 22 August 1997.

Para 36 of the amended statement of claim of 15 July 1997 asserts that Pluim delivered claims for payment in accordance with clause 42 of the contract on 8
April 1996, on 16 May 1996, on 20 June 1996 for amounts totalling $3,316,904 (figures subsequently corrected to $3,491,519.08).

I interpolate that no defence had as yet been filed to the original statement of claim or to any amended statement of claim.

Pluim's application for summary judgment was said to be based "upon the grounds set forth in the affidavit of Mr Graham Bryce Allan sworn 4 August in support of the motion. Mr Allan was the chief executive of Pluim.

Allan's affidavit of 4 August 1997 asserts that Pluim's progress payment claim was posted to Business Park's address for service noted on the contract on or about 8 April 1996 and that progress claim 12 was posted to Business Park's address for service on or around 16 May 1996. The document marked "B" to that affidavit is asserted to be progress claim 11. It is dated 8 April 1996. It claims $1,144,136.72. The progress claim dated 16 May 1996, No.12, is for $1,165,244.18 which includes the amount in progress claim 11. Progress claim is dated 20 June 1996. It is for $1,182,238.18 which includes the amounts in progress claim 12 (and therefore progress claim 11). Progress claim 11 according to Mr Allan was posted to Business Park's address for service on 8
April 1996. Claim 12 he said was posted to Business Park's address for service on 16 May 1996 and claim 13 was posted to Business Park's address on 20 June
No payments as claimed in any of those claims had been received to that date of his affidavit.

On 21 July 1997 Wilde & Woollard filed a notice of motion seeking that the claim against it (paras 160-202) of the amended statement of claim be struck out. Wilde & Woollard was the quantity surveyor for this job (by contract with Business Park). It is alleged to have been negligent in its preparation of the bills of quantities made available to prospective tenderers, specifically to Pluim and that it did know or should have known that a copy would be provided to Pluim. Pluim was unable, it asserted, to quantify or particularise its losses attributable to this negligence at the time of this pleading.

On 24 July 1997 the 6th defendant, Sika Australia Pty Ltd ("Sika") filed a notice of motion seeking security for its costs in the sum of $179,500.

On 5 August 1997 Pluim filed a notice of motion seeking summary judgment against Business Park in respect of its claims in paras 36-8 of its amended statement of claim of 15 July 1997 (claims as at 8 April 1996 of $1,144,136.72, as at 16 May 1996 of $1,165,244.18, and at 20 June 1996 of $118,2138.18 (which includes the earlier claims). There can be no dispute that those were the sums mentioned in those claims. By that date more than 28 days had elapsed since the claims were submitted. Pluim contends that clause .1 of AS2124-1992 entitles it to payment of these amounts.

On 7 August 1997 the second defendant Trad filed a notice of motion seeking to have the amended statement of claim (semble against him) struck out pursuant to Pt15 r26 of the Rules on the grounds "(i) on its face it discloses no reasonable cause of action the manner in which it is pleaded has a tendency to cause embarrassment or delay in the proceedings the action as pleaded is an abuse of process" 
On 8 August 1997 the third defendant Wilde & Woollard applied to set aside a notice to produce dated 5 August 1997 served on it by Pluim.

On 12 August 1997 the defendant Business Park applied to have struck out from the plaintiff's amended statement of claim paras 12-27 and 31-34, 45-48; 50, , 54, 55, 58, 59, 64, 70, 71, 74, 76-9, 81-104, 106-110, 113-121, 123-127, -8, 139(a), 140, 142, 203-19. I will return to some of these paragraphs later. But at the moment I simply observe that a number relate to issues of fact in dispute between the parties.

On 22 August 1997 the second defendant Trad filed an amended notice of motion.
It was to have struck out the allegations in paras 143-159 of the amended statement of claim asserting that those parts of the statement of claim on its face disclose no reasonable cause of action, that the manner in which it is pleaded has a tendency to cause embarrassment or delay in the proceedings and that the action as pleaded is an abuse of the Court's process. Paras 143-159 accuse Trad of negligence in the performance of his duties as superintendent under the contract. AS2124-1992 confers quite extensive powers and authorities on the superintendent. The complains are that he did not exercise his powers fairly and impartially or in accordance with the standards applicable to a registered architect (which he was) in the practise of his profession and eleven separate categories of departure from those standards are particularised.

On 25 August 1997 Business Park filed a further notice of motion. It sought the supply of the particulars as sought in a letter attached to the notice of motion and an order that various paragraphs of the amended statement of claim struck out. The first of those sought to be struck out was para 6. It asserts that Business Park provided information on which the plaintiff relied in preparing its tender bid. As Business Park was the developer it must have provided information at the tender stage and the tenderer must have relied on it. I am unable to understand how any competent lawyer could expect these allegations to be struck out. Perhaps the explanation is to be found in order (b) sought in the notice of motion. It is that para 4(g) in the amended statement of claim be struck out. There is no para 4(g) in the amended statement of claim. By way of alternative it sought that para 6(k) of the amended statement of claim be struck out. That also asks an impossibility: there is no para 6(k) either. I don't propose to recount any more of the claims in this notice of motion at this stage of my reasons save to record that some of them are simply requests for particulars.

On 1 September 1997 Business Park filed a cross claim seeking to recover $1,730,376.13 from Pluim. This cross claim proceeds by the following steps 
Trad was superintendent at the relevant time (para 3); on 30 October Pluim's solicitors purported to serve progress claim 14 (semble on the superintendent) (para 4); progress claim 14 was not delivered to the superintendent (apparently it was sent to his solicitors) (para 5); progress claim 14 did not conform to the requirements of clause 42 in three asserted respects (para 5); in the absence of a conforming claim for payment by Pluim the superintendent was entitled to issue a payment certificate (para 6); on 2 April the superintendent certified that $1,730,376.13 was due from
Pluim to Business Park (para 7).

By notice of motion of same date Business Park applied for summary judgment in the sum of $1,730,376.13.

On 5 September 1997 the second defendant Trad filed an amended notice of motion seeking to have paragraphs 143-59 of the amended statement of claim struck out. These are the paragraphs which accuse Trad of negligence "in accepting the appointment" "in the exercise of his powers" and in the manner in which he performed his duties.

On 26 September 1997 Pluim filed a further amended statement of claim.
Conformably with past practice it occupies 136 pages. Again the amendments are not noticed in the usual way by underlining. The only amendments effected by the further amended statement of claim of 26 September 1997 to the amended statement of claim of 15 July 1997 that I have been able to discover are the addition of two lines of typing to the particulars of para 163, the deletion of paras 170, 171 and 172 and the addition of three lines of typescript to the particulars of para 199.

On 3 October 1997 Pluim filed a second further amended statement of claim. It also occupies 136 pages. This time the amendments are highlighted in the usual way by underlining. There are two. The first adds a new paragraph 146A of four lines of typescript. It asserts that if Trad was not validly appointed superintendent by Business Park "he was negligent (a) in purporting to accept such an appointment; and/or (b) in holding himself as validly appointed superintendent". The second change is the addition of four lines to the particulars to clause 158(j) which alleges that the purported deduction by the superintendent of $1,492,791.86 for liquidated damages, defects and rectification costs in his final certificate was "careless and without proper enquiry, investigation or examination".

On 8 October 1997 Pluim discontinued against 4th, 5th and 6th defendants and filed a third further amended statement of claim (125 pages). The amendments are extensive, but do not alter the general thrust of Pluim's case. However, from clause 4 onwards the numbering differs so that a reference in these reasons to a clause by number in the third further amended statement of claim cannot apply to clauses bearing that number in any of the preceding four versions of the statement of claim.

The various applications which remain alive are
Business Park's applications of 16 May 1997, 26 May 1997, 12 August 1997, August 1997 and 1 September 1997 to strike out the claim against it, its application of 25 August for particulars and its application of 24 June 1997 for security for its costs.
Trad's applications of 26 May 1997, 5 September 1997, 7 August 1997, 22
August 1997 and 5 September 1997 to strike out the claims against it - in other words for summary judgment.
Wilde & Woollard's application of 27 June 1997 for security for costs and its application of 21 July 1997 to strike out the claim against it.
Pluim's application of 5 August 1997 for summary judgment in accordance with paras 36-38 of its amended statement of claim of 15 July 1997. This claims payments pursuant to clause 42 of three sums totalling (as amended) $3,491,519.08. These are now paras 44-46 of the third further amended statement of claim.

The parties elected to rely on affidavit evidence, which of course included documentation. No deponent was cross examined, so that there are no questions of credibility and no arguments as to what was said or done which cannot be resolved on the affidavits and the documentary material. Had the matter been dealt with as an ordinary building case it would have been referred for report under Part 72 of the Rules to an experienced engineer and a report would have been received long ago. A plaintiff who does not take advantage of procedures designed to expedite the determination of building disputes, but instead asserts a variety of esoteric claims (three of which it subsequently abandons) deserves no priority over other litigants awaiting adjudication of their claims. There are many of them.

I have been the beneficiary of 209 pages of written submissions beginning on May 1997 and concluding on 14 November 1997. In addition there has been oral argument beginning on 30 May 1997, again on 3 June 1997, on 29 September through to 2 October, on 7, 8 October and on 17 October, recorded in 293 pages of transcript.

I have already identified the form of contract adopted. There were deletions but I do not need to identify them. The date for practical completion was 15
November 1995. Liquidated damages for failure to achieve practical completion by the date for practical completion was $15,000 per calendar day and the lump sum price was $14,926,860. The batting for the money claims was opened by Mr
Allan, but not until 4 August 1997, three and a half months after commencement of the proceedings. His affidavit of that date exhibited copies or progress claims 11, 12 and 13 collectively for $1,182,138.18, and asserted that each had been served, that more than 28 days had elapsed and that the amount of those claims was payable. Those claims were #11 for $1,144,136.72, #12 for $1,165,244.18 (which includes #11), and #13 for $1,182,138.18 (which includes #12). #11 and #12 are signed by Allan. #13 is not signed at all, but it is on
Pluim's letterhead. These documents cannot found a contractual entitlement to the sums of money mentioned in them. Those claims are all addressed to "Tuggerah Business Park Pty Ltd, Attention Mr Patrick Houlahan". Clause 42.1 requires that contractors' claims for payment are to be delivered to the superintendent. Who, if anyone, was then "superintendent" is doubtful, but it was not Tuggerah Business Park Pty Ltd.

The next affidavit to be filed was that of Patrick Houlahan sworn 29 August
He asserted he was "an independent project management consultant retained by (Business Park)". In that affidavit he describes in detail what occurred at various stages, from tender (paras 5-12), appointment of superintendent (paras 13-25), payment of progress claim procedures (paras -40), procedures for variation approvals (paras 41-43), a "dispute regarding superintendent" (paras 44-73), progress claims #11 and #2 (paras 74-86) and "progress claims 14 and 15/issue of final certificate" (paras 87-94). His conclusion in para 94 was that as practical completion was required by 15
November 1995 (the contract plainly so provided) but not achieved until 6
February 1996 liquidated damages payable were $1,245,000 ($15,000 x 83 days).
Houlahan asserted that he performed the functions of superintendent, "Saunders
Design" being left in the document by mistake. He also stated that he rejected
Pluim's application for one extension of time (a function of the superintendent). The effect of his unchallenged evidence (at this stage) is that the AS2124-1992 procedures for progress payments was replaced by the system which he described in this affidavit. A consequence would be that his intimation to Pluim that practical completion was effected at 6 February 1996 (not earlier) is to be regarded as a superintendent's decision. He then dealt with the final certificate. He said that six volumes of documents were "served on" Trad's solicitor by Pluim's solicitors but that they failed to claim any final amount. Later, but inconsistently, he says that Trad issued a final certificate on 2 April 1997 (which asserts an overpayment of $1,730,376.13 including liquidated damages for late completion of 91,245,000, being 83 days at $15,000 per day).

Allan's affidavit in response runs to 48 pages plus many annexures. He says
Houlahan told him that he was project manager for the Supa Centa project (with which Houlahan agrees). And he contradicts much of what Houlahan says. There not having been any cross examination on these competing views I am not prepared to decide between them for the purposes of the present applications, save to assert that I do not regard any of them not the subject of executed documentation as proved. That is not a criticism of either Houlahan or Allan.
Neither would have decided what his affidavit should have dealt with.

On 24 September Allan swore a further affidavit, of 48 pages plus 60 annexures. He says that Houlahan claimed to him, Allan, to have been project manager. Most of this affidavit is either irrelevant or inadmissible were objection taken to it. None was (probably in recognition of its irrelevance to a summary judgment application (some may well be relevant to the Trade
Practices Act claim).

I turn now to the written submissions. I will deal with them in the order in which they were furnished. They begin with those on behalf of Business Park which are dated 15 August 1997. They must therefore deal with the amended statement of claim filed on 15 July 1997.

Clause 12 is first attacked. It asserts "It was an express term of the contract that (Business Park) make available to (Pluim) a fully prepared site on or about 15 May 1995". The criticism is that this is not what the contract provides, which is "The principal shall on or before the time stated in the annexure (15 May 1995) give to the contractor possession of the site...". That is the smallest nit I have ever seen picked until I read the next criticism.

The next criticism was of para 13. The pleading is "(Business Park) wrongfully and in breach of contract refused, failed and/or neglected to make available access to the whole of the site until four weeks after the agreed date, whereas as para 12 had asserted an obligation to make available a "fully prepared site". That may be a departure in the technical sense of the now abandoned common law pleading requirements, but it is one to be measured in millimetres. The attack on paras 31-3 differs but does not improve. Those paras assert and rely upon an implied term. The criticism is that it can't or shouldn't be implied. That may turn out to be correct, but it is not a defective pleading.

Another criticism advanced is that some of the allegations are of unidentified terms of the contract. If that is a problem it is to be cured by seeking particulars, not by striking out the pleading.

There are 39 pages of criticisms of these sorts. The power to strike out a pleading is, relevantly, that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or has a tendency to cause prejudice embarrassment or delay in the proceedings (Pt15 r26). None of those attacked in this submission fall into that category.
I should not like it to be thought that I regard this amended statement of claim as a well drawn pleading. It isn't - not by a long way, but that of itself is not a ground to strike it out.

The next submission is that of 15 August 1997 for Pluim. It seeks summary judgment in respect of the three amounts specified in para 36 of the amended statement of claim of 15 July 1997. This paragraph asserts claims under clause of the contract (certificates and payments) for three amounts accruing more than 28 days since "they were delivered to the offices of the principal at the address PO Box 109 Double Bay".

The procedure for progress claims is clearly stated in clause 42 of
AS2124-1992. The steps are:
At the times for payment claims stated in the annexure (by the 28th day of any month).
The contractor is to deliver to the superintendent claims for payment supported by evidence of the amount due to the contractor.
Within 14 days after receipt of a claim for payment the superintendent shall issue to the principal and to the contractor a payment certificate stating the amount of the payment which in the opinion of the superintendent is to be made by the principal to the contractor.
... within 28 days after receipt by the superintendent of a claim for payment or within 14 days of issue by the superintendent of the superintendent's payment certificate, whichever is the earlier, the principal shall pay to the contractor ... an amount not less than the amount shown in the certificate as due to the contractor ... or if no payment certificate has been issued the principal shall pay the amount of the contractor's claim.

The superintendent named in the contract is Saunders Design (Pty Ltd).

Patrick Houlahan who describes himself as a building consultant and who claims to be Business Park's project manager for this job says he originally intended
Saunders Design would be the superintendent, but he changed his mind, but not the contract, and he asserts that he carried out the superintendent's role.
Nonetheless until by agreement someone other than Saunders Design Pty Ltd became superintendent it was the entity to whom progress claims were to be delivered to found a claim under clause 42 of AS2124-1992.

Not to be outdone in incompetence Pluim sent its progress claims to Business
Park if indeed its address is PO Box 109 Double Bay, of which there is no evidence at all, which, so far as the evidence reveals simply filed them.

Had the contract procedures been followed and the superintendent not dealt with them within 28 days after their receipt, Pluim would be entitled to summary judgment for the amounts claimed (Algons Engineerng pty Ltd v
Abigroup Contractors Pty Ltd Rolfe J, 1 August 1997, unreported).

I add that the three amounts claimed are not in fact cumulative entitlements.
The first is included in the second and the second is included in the third.

This claim for summary judgment fails.

The next set of written submissions, also dated 15 August 1997, was that on behalf of Business Park (and the then 4th and 5th defendants, whose application need no longer be considered) in support of its application for security for costs. I have assumed that this application (filed 24 June 1997) relates only to that part of the proceedings which remains in the construction list, though the costs which Pluim is likely to incur if it proceeds with its defamation proceedings will impact on its total remaining assets. Its first problem is that the only estimate of those costs was one of the total costs of the three defendants on whose behalf it was made. I have no evidence of the likely costs simply of Business Park, except that I can infer that if the proceedings continue to be conducted as they have so far, those costs will be quite large.

I have on this issue five affidavits containing collectively 265 pages (a figure which includes annexures).

The first, second and third of these are filed on behalf of Business Park and the deponent of each is Claude Arthur Jugmans a partner of Horwaths Sydney
Partners. The first, sworn 26 June 1997, does no more than record that the accuracy of the financial statements of Pluim depends on the accuracy of its recording of transactions with eight other companies, seven of whose names begin with "Pluim", on the ability of a Mr & Mrs Allan to repay loans to them totalling $278,578, on the financial position of the Allan No. 1 Family
Trust, on the accuracy of the recording in the accounts of Pluim of the value of its plant and equipment, and on who received management fees paid by Pluim, all of which is obvious. Jugmans wanted in effect to do an audit of the consolidated assets and liabilities of Pluim its shareholders and its associates.

The information which he sought must have been made available to him because his next affidavit (16 July 1997) produced what he described as a report on the ability of Pluim to meet an order for security for costs which he assumed would be $1,674,500 (which includes costs of the defamation proceedings). his conclusion was that Pluim had the ability to fund legal costs of approximately $366,000 from loans due to Pluim by associated entities "that appear to have cash reserves available". He also expressed the opinion that Pluim's "properties" with an estimated value of $1,580,000 and its loans to associated entities of $1,542,252 were among assets charged to National
Australia Bank to secure "facilities" (semble drawn or undrawn) of $3,200,000.

On 24 July 1997 Margaret Coleman a chartered accountant, a partner in Madge
Coleman Chartered Accountants, the firm which had undertaken Pluim's financial, accounting and taxation advising (and the preparation of its annual accounts) verified a report which she had prepared. It takes into account
Jugman's affidavits of 26 June and 16 July 1997, and on material obtained by her from NAB.

Coleman's opinion was that the Pluim Group (14 entities, two of which were trusts and all under the direct control of Mr Graham Allan) had the ability to meet a costs order up to $1.6m. She pointed out also that, of the ANZ facility of $3.222m, $1.8m was a NAB guarantee which had not been called, so NAB's security over tangible assets actually secured only $1.42m. Her report annexes a balance sheet (at directors valuations) as at 30 June 1996 which shows the groups assets to have a value of $2,868,882 or $1,898,980 if loans to entities outside the group are eliminated (they amounted to $969,902).

Jugman's responded with a further report attached to his affidavit of 27
August 1997. He began by pointing out the obvious that an order for costs against Pluim can only be enforced against Pluim. He then went on to criticise a number of Coleman's assumptions and conclusion. The differences between them is that Jugman is being ultra conservative - he looks for certainty, while
Coleman looks to what she considers more probable than not.

There is another matter dealt with in Jugman's report attached to his 27
August 1997 affidavit. Coleman's report (para 3.5(h) includes among Pluim's assets as trustee of the Gemsted Unit Trust a loan to Gemsted Pty Ltd of $504,965. Its underlying asset was said to be property at a cost of $1,119,767 considered by the directors to be worth $1.3m (rental of $130,000pa capitalised at 10%).

Jugman had been given access to documents produced on subpoena "recently" he said and he sets out what he thought they revealed. He devotes two pages of his report to this asset - para 4.16.

Jugman notes that the property is held on a 15 year special lease commencing 1
October 1989 and that there was a proposal in August 1989 to develop a restaurant and office block on the property. There then follows a remarkable (from a chartered accountant) assertion. "Gemsted does not own any "property".
Gemsted holds a lease over a parcel of land". He seems plainly to be wearing the Tuggerah Business Park jersey - he makes a number of assumptions (some of which I would describe as guesses) and ultimately concludes that the $504,965 owing according to Coleman from Gemsted to Pluim is an extremely doubtful asset.

Pluim obtained a further report, this one in an affidavit of Warwick Richard
Finney of 3 September 1997. He is a chartered accountant of 27 years experience, the first 24 of them as a partner in what is now known as Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu.

He records 
Two properties previously valued at $242,678 and $380,000 ($622,678) have been revalued at $150,000 and $318,000 ($468,000).

Intercompany debts (of Pluim) totalling $1,633,971 have been deferred by deed.

That he considers that Pluim should be valued on a going concern basis rather than on a liquidation basis as Jugmans had done.

That the debt by the trust to Pluim has been secured by a floating charge over the assets of the trust.

The book value of Pluim's assets is $4,473,000 and its realisable value is $3,778,000.

As at 30 June 1997 Pluim's current liabilities were $1,836,000 and its non-current liabilities $1,633,000, a total of $3,469,000.

Pluim's net worth was therefore $309,000. The above is followed by a detailed explanation of the ability of other Pluim companies to pay what each owes to Pluim and conclude that the net available assets of these companies totals $3,778,000 and their current liabilities total $1,836,000 leaving $1,942,000 of assets available to meet current commitments.

ANZ Bank has a security of an asset of Pluim Properties which it values at $1.9m. It has lent $525,000 on that security and would consider increasing its loan on that security to $710,000.

His final conclusion is that the Pluim Group and Mr & Mrs Allan have net assets of 
Pluim Group $3,596,919 
GB & ML Allan $1,524,130 
G B Allan $1,737,610 
M L Allan $12,624 $6,871,304 
I prefer and accept Finney's analysis. First because it addresses the right questions and deals with them appropriately; secondly because so much of what
Jugmans and Coleman have recorded in their respective reports is based on information which is now out of date because the affairs of Pluim and Mr &
Mrs Allan have been reorganised to put Pluim in a better position to meet an order for costs than it previously had been; thirdly because many of the arguments about the position prior to the reorganisation could have been cleared up (by a short cross examination by Counsel understanding what was being asserted), but it was not.

The onus in the applications for security for costs is on the applicants for that security. They have not discharged it. The applications are dismissed and
Business Park is ordered to pay Pluim's costs of these applications.

The next set of submissions deal with Wilde & Woollard's application for security for costs filed 27 June 1997, its application to strike out the amended statement paras 160-202 of claim against it filed 21 July 1997 and its application filed 8 August 1997 to set aside a notice to produce documents relating to any insurance cover it may have for its costs of defending this action.

Wilde & Woollard's application for security for costs in the notice of motion filed 27 June 1997 is refused, for the same reasons as is Business
Park's similar application. Its application has not put Pluim to expense beyond what Business Park's application caused it to expend, so I make no costs order.

The claim against Wilde & Woollard was propounded in paras 158-169 (pp99-105) of the statement of claim filed 23 April 1997. It is a claim that
Wilde & Woollard was the quantity surveyor appointed by Business Park to advise, inter alia "a person in the capacity of the plaintiff" in respect of the cost, construct ability (sic) and methodologies to be employed in the works in quantifying works", and that it was negligent in its assessing the cost of the project as $18.8m, the true cost being alleged to be much more, because it did or should have known that Pluim would rely on its assessment (in contracting to build the project for $14,926,860).

The claim against Wilde & Woollard is slightly differently pleaded in the latest (currently the amended statement of claim filed on 8 October 1997) version of the plaintiff's case. I propose to treat the notice of motion filed on 21 July 1997 as seeking to strike out paras 180-218 (which includes in paras 202-18 a claim under the Trade Practices Act of actionable misrepresentation) of the 8 October 1997 pleading.

Paras 202-18 assert pre tender misrepresentations (including but not confined to a representation which is asserted to be a misrepresentation, that Wilde & Woollard's role would be that of quantity surveyor for the Supa Centa project which para 182 asserts it was). Plainly I cannot strike out those paragraphs (they alleging a mixed question of fact and law) no matter how certain of their outcome I might be.

Paras 180-201 propound a case of common law negligence in that Wilde &
Woollard assessed the costs of the Super Centa project for Business Park at $18,071,000, that it prepared bills of quantities for issue to tenderers "which placed the cost of the works at approximately $14.7m" and which it ought to have known a tenderer would rely upon, and that these figures were inaccurate, misleading and carelessly assembled, thereby occasioning loss to
Pluim.

This assumes that the Tuggerah Supa Centa Project is co-extensive with the work for which Pluim tendered. Documents annexed to the signed contract indicate that the two are not co-extensive, but that does not justify striking out this part of the statement of claim.

Wilde & Woollard's third application was to set aside a notice to produce served on it by Pluim to produce the records relating to any insurance cover
Wilde & Woollard to pay for its costs of defending this action". Whether or not a defendant has insurance which will cover his defence costs is irrelevant to any issue in the proceedings and equally irrelevant to whether or not that defendant itself, or its insurers through it, is entitled to an order for security for costs, as any competent practitioner should know. This application succeeds. I declare that Wilde & Woollard are not required to produce the documents called for it this notice and that Pluim must pay the costs of this application.

There remains Trad's notice of motion filed 7 August 1997 seeking to have the "plaintiff's amended statement of claim struck out pursuant to Pt15 r26 of the
Rules". I have difficulty in comprehending how any legal practitioner who knew even a little about what he was endeavouring to do could file a notice of motion seeking that relief. The most recent statement of claim on the file on August 1997 was that entitled amended statement of claim which had been filed on 15 July 1997. To save revisiting this dispute I will treat Trad's application as one to strike out paragraphs 159-179 of the third further amended statement of claim filed 8 October 1997, that being the claim currently asserted against Trad.

The allegations against Trad in that third further amended statement of claim (so far as they seem to me to have any relevance to the relief sought against him) are
He was appointed superintendent on or about 6 July 1996.
If he wasn't validly so appointed he was negligent "in purporting to accept such appointment" and/or in holding himself out as a validly appointed superintendent. I assume part one of that proposition is intended to assert that he was negligent in purporting to have accepted such appointment.
As superintendent he was under a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in performing his role as superintendent.
That included a duty to prepare and furnish to Business Park and to Pluim "interpretations and clarifications of the meaning and intent of the contract document consolidating the whole of the agreement between the parties (novelty is not necessarily a reason for rejection) and to identify where legal opinion should be sought and to promptly act to ensure Business Park provided access to qualified and expert legal advisers".
There followed assertions that it was Trad's duty to do a number of things which ordinarily, and in this case, were the obligations of superintendent appointed under a contract such as AS2124-1992, including a duty to act reasonably, fairly and impartially.
The allegation is that he failed so to act, including by letting Houlahan usurp his function. (Houlahan asserted that he performed the superintendent's duties instead of "Saunders Design"). There are other allegations of departure from what Pluim asserts were Trad's duties.

There are issues of fact involved in this application. They include whether or not Trad ever became or acted as superintendent and if so, what did he do (or in some cases not do what he should have done). I would not decide such questions on an interlocutory application, even if there were evidence enabling me so to do, which there is not.

Trad's application is one that cannot succeed. It is dismissed and Trad is ordered to pay Pluim's costs of that application.

Wherever in the course of these reasons I have declined relief sought in a notice of motion without dealing expressly with the costs of that application,
I order that the applicant pay the costs of the respondent or respondents.
