BARRETT J  
TUESDAY 6 JULY 2010  /152992 ST GEORGE BANK - A DIVISION OF WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION v ACTIVE PROPERTY INVESTMENT PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT The plaintiff has filed an originating process dated 18 June 2010 by which it seeks the following orders:  "1. That this Originating Process be returnable and heard instanter in the absence of the Defendant.
 . That the requirement on the Plaintiff to serve this originating process on the Defendant before the date fixed for hearing be dispensed with, pursuant to [rule .8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s1.8.html) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) .
 . That, pursuant to [rule .14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s10.14.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) and sub-section 109X(6)(b) of the Act, the Plaintiff's Creditor's Statutory
Demand and Accompanying Affidavit sworn by Rodney David Lawless on 18 June and this Originating Process and its supporting affidavit/s be served on the Defendant by: a) delivering those documents marked to the attention of 'Mr Shanmuganathan
Gnanasothy (aka Mr Sam Sothy)'; the sole director of the Defendant, to the offices of Banket Quin Investments Pty Ltd ACN 132 426 834 (Banket Quin) at Level 46, Governor Phillip Tower, 1 Farrer Place, Sydney NSW 2000; b) posting a copy of those documents marked to the attention of 'Mr
Shanmuganathan Gnanasothy (aka Mr Sam Sothy)' by pre-paid post to PO Box 303,
Bondi Junction NSW 1355; and c) sending a private message to Sam Sothy (aka Shanmuganathan Gnanasothy) via computer to his Facebook page informing him that the Plaintiff has issued the
Creditor's Statutory Demand against the Defendant and that a copy of the documents above were delivered to the offices of Banket Quin at Level 46,
Governor Phillip Tower, 1 Farrer Place, Sydney NSW 2000 and also posted to PO
Box 303, Bondi Junction NSW 1355.
 . That, the Plaintiff's Creditor's Demand and Accompanying Affidavit be deemed to have been served upon the Defendant under sub-sections 109X(1)(a) and/or (b) upon the expiry of 2 business days after the day upon which the
Plaintiff has complied with orders 3(a) to (c) above.
 . An order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff's costs of the
Originating Process.
 . Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court sees fit in the circumstances." The proposition advanced by the plaintiff is thus that the court can (and should) make an order for substituted service of a statutory demand intended to be served by it under [s
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth).  The originating process identifies three provisions under which the application is made: [s
X(6)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [rule .14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s10.14.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) and [rule .8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s1.8.html) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/).  The requirement that a statutory demand be "served" comes from [s
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) which enables a person to "serve on a company" a demand as there described. Related provisions concerned with failure to comply with a statutory demand [(s
F)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459f.html) and the making of an application for an order setting aside a statutory demand [(s
G)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) pay attention to the time when the demand was "served".  [Section
X(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) sets out various ways in which, for the purposes of any law, "a document may be served on a company". [Section
X(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) then says: "This section does not affect: any other provision of this Act, or any provision of another law, that permits; or the power of a court to authorise; a document to be served in a different way." This provision does not give the court power to prescribe a manner of service. It merely preserves any separately existing power of the court to authorise a manner of service on a company differing from those in [s
X(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) [Section
X(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) is thus not a source of jurisdiction to make an order prescribing some method of service different from those the Act itself allows. In this respect, [s
X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) is quite different from, for example, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s170.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) (see [s (1)(d)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s170.html) The plaintiff relies, in the alternative, on the court's power under [rule .14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s10.14.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/): "If a document that is required or permitted to be served on a person in connection with any proceedings: cannot practicably be served on the person, or cannot practicably be served on the person in the manner provided by law, the court may, by order, direct that, instead of service, such steps be taken as are specified in the order for the purpose of bringing the document to the notice of the person concerned".
 The difficulty for the plaintiff here is that the court's power to prescribe some manner notification "instead of service" extends only to a document "that is required or permitted to be served on a person in connection with any proceedings". The reference to "proceedings" is, clearly enough, a reference to proceedings in a court to which the [Uniform Civil Procedure
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) apply.
 It cannot be argued that a statutory demand is such a "proceeding".
Statutory demands, of their nature, are created and served (and take effect) without resort to any process of a court: Clarke & Walker Pty Ltd versus Thew <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 465.] It is generally only when service of a statutory demand gives rise to an application by the company served for an order setting aside the demand or when a winding up application founded on non-compliance with the demand is made by the serving party that the statutory demand comes to play a part in any proceeding before the court.
 The plaintiff says, however, that by filing the originating process dated June 2010 it has created a proceeding in which the order for substituted service it seeks may be made. On the view the plaintiff takes, that proceeding may now serve as the vehicle for the filing of any <case> application that the defendant in due course chooses to make and for any winding up application based on non-compliance with the statutory demand that may be made by the plaintiff. Either such application - or, if circumstances permit, both - may, it is said, be advanced under [rule .2(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s2.2.html) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) by interlocutory process "in a proceeding already commenced in the Court", being the proceeding commenced by the originating process of 18 June 2010.
 The problem with this analysis is that the claim for an order allowing an alternative method of notification of the statutory demand, looked at in its own right divorced from any claim for substantive relief, cannot sensibly be made and is not, in terms of [rule .2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s2.2.html) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations)
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/), "an application required or permitted by the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to be made to the Court". There is the added and similar point that, under [rule .3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1.3.html), the [Supreme Court (Corporations)
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) apply to "a proceeding in the Court under the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), or the
ASIC Act". The stand-alone application for an order dispensing with service and sanctioning a substitute does not satisfy either description.
 If, as here, a proceeding is ostensibly commenced for the specific and sole purpose of obtaining an order sanctioning some substitute for service in respect of a document that otherwise plays no part in the proceeding so commenced, it is impossible to say that that document is one required or permitted to be served "in connection with" that proceeding. [Rule .14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s10.14.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) is addressed to the various provisions of those rules that deal with service of documents brought into existence to commence or to prosecute or to take some step in proceedings in the court, that is, documents by means of which such proceedings are conducted.
 The plaintiff's resort to [rule .8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s1.8.html) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations)
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) does not advance matters. That rule is in the following terms: "The Court may give directions in relation to the practice and procedure to be followed in a proceeding if it is satisfied, in the circumstances of the proceeding, that: the provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), the ASIC
Act, or the rules of this Court do not adequately provide for the practice and procedure to be followed in the proceeding, or a difficulty arises, or doubt exists, in relation to the practice and procedure to be followed in the proceeding." Again, there must be some proceeding to which the [Supreme Court 
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) apply; and the situation must be such that there is some lacuna, doubt or difficulty in relation to the "practice and procedure to be followed" in or in relation to that proceeding. For reasons already given, a statutory demand is not a "proceeding" in the relevant sense and this present proceeding is not one to which [rule .3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s1.3.html) causes the [Supreme Court (Corporations)
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) to apply.
 If and when it becomes necessary to address the question whether a statutory demand was "served" on the defendant by the plaintiff, that question will be answered solely by reference to the provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the general law concepts relevant to them. The "service" that may ultimately ground a submission of non-compliance with the statutory demand will be what the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) regards as "service", not what might, under rules of court, be allowed by the court to be regarded as a substitute for service in relation to a document connected with a proceeding in the court.
 The plaintiff has shown no basis on which it is open to the court to make an order for substituted service in respect of a statutory demand. Since that conclusion leaves no undetermined claim for relief in these proceedings, the proceedings must be dismissed and thereby brought to an end. The court cannot allow the fully determined originating process to survive indefinitely in a state of hibernation against the possibility that, as the plaintiff suggests, this present proceeding may at some future time prove useful as a vehicle for any [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application that the defendant may choose to bring or any [s
P](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459p.html) application that the plaintiff itself may wish to initiate. If either of those courses eventuates, it can only be by way of a new proceeding initiated by originating process.
 The originating process is dismissed.
