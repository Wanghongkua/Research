Michael Grove J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law 
Division /94 - GARYTH WILLIAMS versus MARK STEPHEN TRACEY & ANOR 
JUDGMENT (on admissibility of affidavit) 
HIS HONOUR: I am presently hearing an appeal from a judgment delivered by Master Malpass on 19 April 1996. On the first day of hearing on Wednesday 23 November 1994 a bundle of documents apparently containing medical material was tendered by counsel then appearing for the appellant. The Master indicated that he would reject the entirety of that bundle with the exception of one specified report. Upon that announcement the tender was withdrawn. The second day of hearing was 10 April 1996. As I have indicated judgment was given on 19 April 1996. 
In his reasons for judgment the learned Master made some remarks about the material presented by the plaintiff. He introduced his observations by saying: "It may be that there has been a selective presentation of material by the plaintiff" and later he said: "Any expert material obtained by the plaintiff prior to November 1994 has not been placed before the Court".

The precise way in which those observations have had some effect in the
Master's ultimate judgment is not entirely clear. However, there has been filed in Court an affidavit sworn by the appellant's solicitor Thomas Julius
Goudkamp of 23 May 1996. Objection is taken to the reading of that affidavit.
Attention was drawn to the inhibition upon the receipt of further evidence as specified in <case> A of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). For the appellant I was also referred to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p60) [Rule 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s15.html) and the case noted thereto in the Practice thereto.

The basis upon which the appellant seeks to read this affidavit is to demonstrate that for whatever use was made of the observations by the Master it cannot be said justifiably that there has been any sinister or indeed relevant withholding of information in the possession of the appellant for the purpose of gaining forensic advantage or indeed for any other purpose.

In my view the balance of justice clearly would demonstrate that the appellant is entitled to have this material before this Court bearing in mind the absence of any opportunity to meet any criticism which is at least implied by the remarks in the judgment which I have recited.

Leave to read the affidavit is granted.

At the conclusion of giving my reasons for ruling my attention had been drawn to the circumstance that the title on the transcript of 10 April 1996 which is "SECOND DAY" is inaccurate. The first day of hearing was Wednesday 23 November
The transcript of that day seems to expire on page 22 and on page 23 the date notation on the bottom left hand corner would indicate that there was a resumed hearing leading to the production of five pages of transcript on 5
December 1994. It therefore follows that 10 April 1996 was in fact the third day of hearing rather than, as I specified, the second day of hearing. That circumstance does not cause me to alter the ruling that I have given.
