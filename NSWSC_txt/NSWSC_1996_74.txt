IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Before me this morning are three notices of motion each filed in winding up proceedings in respect of the first defendant: one by the plaintiff, one by the company and the liquidator (although I am not sure why the company is an applicant in that notice of motion), and one by the second and third defendants.

I have raised with the representatives of the parties this morning a question as to whether the notice of motion filed on behalf of the second and third defendants on 27 November 1995 seeks relief which can or should be dealt with within the winding up proceedings, as opposed to by separate substantive proceedings. After the discussion I think it is generally accepted by the representatives of the parties that the correct procedural course is for separate substantive proceedings to be commenced by the second and third defendants against the plaintiff. I wish to avoid a situation where this notice of motion of 27 November 1995 remains pending and expected to be dealt with as part of the winding up proceedings, and accordingly, for procedural reasons which I have explained I think that it should today be dismissed. That course is agreed to by the parties but of course that dismissal would be on procedural grounds only and would not prevent any subsequent substantive proceedings being commenced for equivalent relief.

Accordingly, I order that the notice of motion of the second and third defendants filed on 27 November 1995 be dismissed.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The first question for determination is whether the liquidator is entitled to claim from the second and third defendants the whole or some and, if so, what part of the legal costs incurred and paid by the company other than the plaintiff's costs in connection with these proceedings. The amounts identified by the liquidator as having been, in fact, paid from the assets of the company for legal costs in connection with these proceedings seem to amount to $46,883.48 less $10,785.00 - the latter amount relating to an audit.

There is no doubt that some costs were payable out of the assets of the first defendant that are not recoverable from the second and third defendants in relation to the proceedings, because that was what Powell J ordered on 21 May
Furthermore, it is clear from Powell J's reasons for judgment that he contemplated that the costs of all parties up to that time should at least to some extent be paid out of the assets of the company, by analogy to the costs of a partnership suit.

The available material does not permit the inference that the legal costs listed by the liquidator forming part of the amount referred to in schedule D to his affidavit of 10 March 1996 are in excess of the costs which would have been properly payable by the first defendant, and there is a suggestion in a document which is part of an annexure to Mr McLennan's affidavit of 9 November at page 76 that substantial further costs were incurred in relation to these proceedings. I think in these circumstances that the liquidator would be justified in acting on the basis that the amounts identified by him as paid out of the assets of the company, should not be claimed from the second and third defendants, and I would give a direction accordingly.
 [Counsel addressed] 
The next question which arises under a challenge to paragraph 4 of the liquidator's determination is whether the interest on the principal amount of $200,000.00, which forms part of the third defendant's loan account with the company, should for the purposes of the winding up be regarded as terminating on the date of the winding up order, that is 31 July 1992.

Mr Watts for the second and third defendant has submitted that it should not extend past that point by virtue of the matters which are sought to be raised by the cross-claim referred to in their notice of motion filed 13 March 1996.
I propose to defer consideration of that element in the matter, but subject to whatever may arise from that, I am of the view that the interest should be regarded as continuing to run until the time of distribution, the reason being that since it is common ground that that debt attracted interest at 18% per annum, there is no principle of law or equity which in the circumstances of this case would cause the liability to terminate at the date of the winding up.

Subject again to the matters raised in the proposed cross-claim, there is no liability available to be set off which, even if insolvency principles relating to mutual debts were applied, would give rise to any reduction in the principal amount or any termination of the interest liability. So that I contingently would rule that the interest should not terminate at 31 July , the contingency being my deferred consideration of the matters relating to the proposed cross-claim.
 [Counsel addressed] 
I do not think there is sufficient evidence to draw any inference about an agreement, expressed or implied, concerning the payment of interest on loan accounts, apart from the $200,000 already referred to. Nor do I perceive, in the circumstances, the existence of any equity which would require interest to be paid on those loan accounts. There is no evidence that the drawings on the loan accounts were improper or any other basis in equity to charge interest thereon. I therefore would answer the question accordingly.
 [Counsel addressed] 
In relation to item 6 of the liquidator's summary, it seems to me that the evidence suggests that to the extent of $23,972.15 the payments were made out of money which belonged to the company and to that extent the liquidator's allowance in favour of Mr Dalenogari should be removed.
 [Counsel addressed] 
In relation to the defendants' claim for $87,000.00, I think on balance these amounts totalling $87,684.29 should be allowed as a credit to the loan account of Mr Dalenogari. I am not satisfied that so far as these amounts represent receipts from hiring a truck that they should be regarded properly as income of the company itself, rather than of Mr Dalenogari. I think it is not inconsistent that he hires out a truck yet works full-time for the company.
 [Counsel addressed] 
So far as item 8 on the liquidator's list is concerned, I am not satisfied that the liquidator's assessment of the wages properly payable is wrong and I therefore am not prepared to direct the liquidator otherwise than in accordance with that assessment. I do not think that the statement in the referee's report, which is expressed in fairly vague and qualified terms, should be considered as overriding the liquidator's assessment of the proper wages payable.

So far as the cross-claim is concerned, I will consider the evidence out of
Court and I will then invite submissions.

Monday, 1 April 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The remaining matter of substance for determination relates to an allegation by the third defendant that she is entitled to recover from the plaintiff the whole, or at least a substantial part, of an amount of $200,000.00 which was paid to the plaintiff on her behalf on 3 October 1988 pursuant to the terms of an agreement of that date to which she and the plaintiff were parties, whereby the plaintiff granted to her an option to purchase the plaintiff's shares in the defendant company.

The third defendant seeks leave to file in the winding up proceedings a cross- claim whereby she seeks to establish and enforce that entitlement and also to have any distribution by the liquidator of assets to shareholders in the winding up deferred until the resolution of that cross-claim.

In support of the contention that the subject matter of the cross-claim should be litigated in the winding up proceedings, the second and third defendants draw attention to the circumstance that the $200,000.00, which was used to make the payment to the plaintiff, had been borrowed from the defendant company and, together with interest, forms a substantial part of the third defendant's loan account with the company.

The question in substance that I am to determine is whether the proposed cross-claim should be litigated in the winding up proceedings, as opposed to being litigated in separate proceedings to be commenced for that purpose. It is necessary to refer to the grounds on which the proposed cross-claim is based. In substance they are two: The first is that the loan by the company to the third defendant of the $200,000.00 was made in contravention of s.129(1)(a) of the Companies Code and that the option agreement was a related transaction. The proposed cross-claim asserts a right in the third defendant to avoid the option agreement by virtue of that contravention and that she has exercised that right by rescinding the option agreement. This ground appears to me to be untenable. A contravention of s.129(1)(a) of the Companies Code does not affect the validity of a contract or transaction, except as provided in s.130 (see subs.(1) of that section). Section 130 confers a right of avoidance of a contract or transaction made in breach of s.129(1)(a) on the company, but not on any other party to the transaction, except pursuant to the leave of the Court in the name of the company. No such right of avoidance has been exercised. It has been submitted that the liquidator should have exercised such a right of avoidance in the name of the company, but it is certainly not obvious to me that he should have done so. In any event, he did not do so and the transaction remains unavoided.

The second ground on which the proposed cross-claim is based is that the $200,000.00 paid to the plaintiff was a penalty, in respect of which the third defendant is entitled to recover the amount by way of relief against forfeiture. On the contentions advanced by the third defendant, reflected in the terms of the proposed cross-claim, this seems to me to be an arguable basis for the claim. I do not for present purposes need to go into questions of limitation and the like. On the assumption that the third defendant's proposed claim has merit, the circumstance remains that it is a claim which preceded and is independent of the winding up of the company and does not in any legal sense affect any distribution to be made by the liquidator in the winding up. In my opinion it would be wrong and contrary to principle to permit that claim to be litigated in the winding up proceedings. If it is to be litigated, then that should be done in separate proceedings independent of the winding up, commenced for that purpose.

In dismissing the application for leave to file the cross-claim I should also draw attention to the circumstance that when the winding up proceedings were before Young J on 11 February 1992, a proposed cross-claim was produced to his
Honour which was in substantially identical terms to the cross-claim now proposed to be filed and on that occasion his Honour directed that if any application was to be made to file any cross-claim, then it should be done within a limited time specified by his Honour for that purpose. It is common ground that that application was not pursued at that time and indeed, was not the subject of any further application to the Court until the proceedings were reactivated late last year.

Accordingly, the notice of motion filed by the second and third defendants, so far as its seeks relief of the kind I have described in this judgment, is refused. That determination will, I think, conclude all the matters which were propounded for decision in the various notices of motion before the Court and it will be necessary for the liquidator to formulate orders designed to give effect to the various decisions that I have made today and on the previous occasion on which the matter was heard.

I will deal with the question of costs on 22 April 1996.
