OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
WINDEYER J  
THURSDAY 20 JUNE 2002  /01 ADAM BISITS & ORS versus REGISTRAR GENERAL OF NEW SOUTH WALES  
JUDGMENT  The question for decision is whether a plan lodged by the plaintiffs with the Registrar General for registration, which he has refused to register, is a plan of identification or a plan of sub-division within the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). If the former, the Registrar General is bound to register it; if the latter he is not bound, because it does not have a sub-division certificate endorsed upon it.  
Facts  The plaintiffs are registered proprietors of the land in Folio Identifiers /826655 and 2/826655 being respectively Lot 1 and Lot 2 in Deposited Plan
The land is at Tilba on the south coast. Lot 1 comprises 2.04 hectares and Lot 2 16.78 hectares.  The land in question comprises Portion 178 Parish of Noorooma (now Narooma) excluding the area of a road passing through the portion. The land was purchased from the Crown by conditional purchase 1895/38 Moruya and Land Grant
Vol 4335 Folio 207 issued in 1929. A copy of the relevant plan catalogued in the Lands Department D3270-18 appears below.  [ IMAGE ] Most of the plan is represented in the diagram on the land grant. The words within the lines showing the road where it passes through Portion 178 are "Res
Road 100 wide". 100 is 100 links. On the northwest the road separates Portion from Portion 178 and is not within the portion. On part of the south side the road separates Portion 178 and the ten acres shown as PR 4363.  In 1992 the plaintiffs as registered proprietors, registered a plan of sub- division of Portion 178. A copy of the relevant part of their plan appears below. The plan was registered as Deposited Plan 826655 on 3 December 1992 and it was as a result of this that the current Folio Identifiers issued.  [ IMAGE ] In 2000 the plaintiffs lodged with the Registrar-General for registration a plan described as "a plan of division of Lot 2 in DP 826655". A copy of this appears below. The plan was allocated number DP 1015451 upon lodgement. The
Registrar-General has refused to register this plan in the absence of a sub- division certificate. The plaintiffs contend no such certificate is required as the plan is an identification plan. If the plan were registered new folios would issue for each of the lots shown as 21 and 22 on that plan.  [ IMAGE ] 
Legislation  [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)  Definitions  ...  "Crown plan" means a plan (such as a county or parish map, a town or village map or a portion plan) that has been prepared by or on behalf of the Crown and is held by the Surveyor-General, and includes a registered plan that has been lodged for registration at the office of the Registrar-General by or on behalf of the Crown.  ...  "Existing lot" means:  a lot whose boundaries are shown in a current plan, or  in relation to land that is not included in a current plan, any distinct lot or portion of land whose current boundaries are identified in the document or documents that evidence current legal interests in the land,  whether comprising the whole of a parcel, or 2 or more parts of a parcel separated by land reserved or acquired for a road, railway or other like purpose.  ...  "Registered plan" means any of the following:  a plan of subdivision, a plan of consolidation or a plan of identification (each within the meaning of [section )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s195.html) that is registered in accordance with Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p23),  ...  
A. Current plan  
In this Act, "current plan" means a Crown plan or a registered plan, but does not include so much of a Crown plan or registered plan as is taken not to form part of a current plan because of subsection (2), (3) or (4).  
So much of a Crown plan or registered plan as merely identifies:  land that is proposed to be acquired, by agreement or compulsory process, under a provision of an Act (including a Commonwealth Act) that authorises the acquisition of the land by compulsory process, or  the residue of land of which part is proposed to be so acquired,  is taken not to form part of a current plan until such time as the land is so acquired.  
So much of a Crown plan or registered plan as merely identifies:  land that is, or is proposed to be, leased (otherwise than for a period that, including the period of any option to renew, exceeds 5 years), or  land the subject of a plan of subdivision for lease purposes (within the meaning of Division 3B or 3C of Part 2),  is taken not to form part of a current plan.  
So much of a Crown plan or registered plan as relates to land the subject of a later current plan (that is, a current plan that was filed or lodged at the office of the Registrar-General after the Crown plan or registered plan was so lodged) is taken not to form part of a current plan.

Regulations, 1961 (under which the relevant plan may have been prepared):  
Part IV - Plans  
Division 1 - Plans Intended to be Registered as Deposited Plans  ... 
Every plan which contains more than four lots and which is intended to be lodged for registration as a deposited plan shall be a plan of survey.  Every plan containing less than Five lots shall, if the Registrar-General so requires, be a plan of survey.  ...

Every plan (not being a plan of survey) intended to be lodged for registration as a deposited plan shall contain the following particulars:-  ...  the area and the bearings and lengths of boundaries of every parcel comprised in the plan.  ...  
Question - Is the plan a plan redefining the boundaries of an existing lot?  
Discussion  The commencing point of the plaintiffs' claim is the decision in
Registrar-General versus Lee [(1990) 19 NSWLR 240.] The effect of that decision was to confirm that insofar as a portion of land was severed by a road opened or dedicated as a public road prior to 1920, such crossing or division created separate lots on either side of that road. In other words the resumption of an area of a portion subject to conditional purchase or lease or grant for the purpose of a road, or its reservation for and dedication, out of a Crown land portion as a road, operated as a sub- division with the land on either side of the road being treated as separate lots so that a plan lodged for registration as a deposited plan showing such areas as separate lots would be registered without the requirement for council consent. This was the position whether or not the area was in fact in use as a road: Rapley versus Martin [[1865] 4 SCR 173]  The evidence is deficient, as often is the case in land matters, in that it does not establish whether Portion 178 ever existed in a form encompassing the area later excluded from it by the road. Nor does the evidence establish the road area has ever been dedicated as a public road. It may have been, and probably was, reserved pursuant to s5 of the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1861 and it may have been dedicated in accordance with that section. The original land grant by its description appears to accept the existence of a dedicated road. Lee does not necessarily establish a sub-division prior to 1920 just because a road crosses a portion. I will however proceed on the basis that the road is a public road properly dedicated as such and that it affected a sub-division which the Registrar-General was bound to recognize or at least would have been bound to recognize prior to 1998.  The plaintiffs accept that DP 826655 is the current plan within the definition under [s7A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s7a.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). That is because it is a registered plan and the latest registered plan relating to the land in question, this being the definition requirement provided by the somewhat difficult wording of s7A(1) and (4) of the Act. They contend that DP is a plan of identification because it is a plan redefining the boundaries of an existing lot being a lot whose boundaries are shown in a current plan, namely DP826655.  This argument proceeded upon the basis that Lot 2 in DP 826655 is not only that one lot but also two separate lots, namely the area or parcels of land generally to the east and west of the road shown on DP 1015451 as Lots 21 and and that redefinition takes place by defining by more precise statement the boundary measurements and bearings.  I consider that the part of the definition of plan of identification relied upon, namely "a plan redefining the boundaries of an existing lot" would encompass a plan redefining the boundaries of more than one lot: [s8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s8.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/).  The argument of the plaintiffs would require the court to find that whatever the sub-division of Portion 178, any areas of land separated by the road were separate lots - for instance a division by extending the line BC on the portion plan in a westerly direction would have had the effect of creating four lots. This, according to the argument of counsel for the plaintiffs is because the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) contains no definition of "lot", that a lot is a distinct portion of land, and that the portions of Lot 2 on either side of the roadway are lots whose boundaries are shown in a current plan.  Counsel for the defendant placed considerable reliance upon the words in the definition of "existing lot" namely, "whether comprising the whole of a parcel, or two or more parts of the parcel separated by land reserved or acquired for a road, railway or other like purpose". This reliance was to some extent founded on a statement in Hallmann's Legal Aspects of Boundary
Surveying as Apply in New South Wales 2nd edition, E.K. Ticehurst, paragraph .28, which is repeated by the same author in Baalman and Wells Land Titles
Office Practice 5th Edition para 131.200 that this part of the definition "in referring to a parcel separated by a road (or like feature) is part of the scheme to overcome the decision in Registrar-General versus Lee [(1990) 19 NSWLR ]
that the opening of a road through a parcel before 1 July 1920 created a lawful division of the land". If that were the intent, the wording may not achieve the required result. If the division by roadway opened prior to 1920 exists it is by no means clear that the division is undone by the definition, as the Registrar-General appears to think. It is not necessary to decide whether Portion 178, before the registration of DP 826655, would have comprised 1 or 2 Lots.  The case is, I consider, not determined by that part of the definition just discussed, but by the following reasoning:  
Deposited Plan 826655 is the current plan;  
It is a plan of sub-division;  
It is a plan of sub-division because it is either a division of an existing lot, namely Portion 178 into two new lots, or it is a consolidation of two existing lots and their re-subdivision along new boundaries into two new lots;  
It is not a plan of sub-division of two lots into three lots, nor of one lot into three lots. This is quite apparent from the lot numbering and from the areas, both stated in accordance with the relevant Regulation. As is made clear by the definition of existing lot, it can be two parcels of land separated by a roadway, which in this case is what Lot 2 is. What one existing lot created by modern sub-division cannot be is two lots, unidentified as such, lacking statements of areas and not depicting boundaries showing bearings and lengths as required. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the legislative intention, as shown in the definitions of sub-division plan and existing lot and by the regulation.  The summons should be dismissed with costs.
