J Preston versus Mitrofanis D Nikolaidis [1996] NSWSC 297 (25 July 1996) 
JOHN PRESTON versus MITROFANIS D NIKOLAIDIS /93 
THURSDAY 25 JULY 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a squabble between solicitor and client as to costs. It is really absurd that it should have taken the amount of paper that has been created and the amount of delay that has occurred. However, the court can really only deal with the matter from now onwards.

As I understand it, there are orders for costs both ways. The costs which are due to Mr Preston or his enterprises are finalised and are either a judgment of the court or about to be a judgment of the court. The costs that may be payable the other way are still to be determined. Because of delay, and it would seem principally the delay of the solicitors, the bill was not in such a form that an application was made before 1 July 1995 for taxation.

Regulation 80 under the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/) probably operates to amend the order that was made by Hulme J before 1 July 1994 as to taxation, so that under [regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/s80.html) (3) the costs are to be assessed in accordance with the new [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/index.html#p11) of the Act, but the former taxation principles apply.

Mr Sirtes, for the plaintiff client, says that that causes injustice unless "principles" are defined as including procedures. Mr Sirtes argued for that construction but, with great respect, it is an almost impossible argument.

Principles of taxation are well understood and they do not include the method of hearing, or the procedures involved. It refers to the matters of law and substantive practice which have been applied by taxation experts and are set out in Mr Saddington's book and other places.

Mr Sirtes then says that if [regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/s80.html) (3) applies his client will suffer additional expense because the new procedures are far more expensive than the ones under the previous legislation. If that is so, and it may well be, then that is a result of a deliberate decision of the legislators and the executive government, rather than anybody else's fault.

However, Mr Sirtes says that the delays were principally, if not entirely, the fault of the solicitors so, he asks rhetorically, why should his client be penalised? The answer is that unless there is some cause of action at law or in Equity and the law is changed, then the loss falls where it lies.

I cannot think of any cause of action at law or in Equity that is created by mere delay. One of the reasons for this is that it is always competent for people to come back to the court if the other party is delaying, and if they do not do so well then that is the end of the matter.

The next matter is what should happen about the costs which are now due and payable. The ordinary rule is that where there are costs owing and payable by two parties, even in different pieces of litigation, that there is a set off, unless there are strong reasons to the contrary. This has been the law for centuries. See Reid versus Cupper [[1915] 2 KB 147]; Re a
Debtor [[1951] Ch 612]; Kostka versus Addison [[1986] 1 Qd R 416] and
Bridge versus Hooper (Young J 20 July 1995).

Mr Sirtes puts that it would be unfair in the instant case not to have the solicitors pay Mr Preston the $13,000 that is owing under the tax bill because his client has not been guilty of delay at all: his client is a man of substance, who can repay any balance shown to be due on the other side. I do not think this is sufficient to displace the ordinary rule.

Mr Sirtes then says the rules as to set off of costs are different to the rules about staying orders. There is a difference, but I do not think that it is a difference that affects the result.

Accordingly, I will stay the enforcement of the order for taxation of the respondent's bill of costs, with liberty to apply to lift the stay should the ongoing process break down.

The other bills of costs now have to be considered by the appropriate official. They will need to be dealt with by assessment and the assessor will apply the principles of taxation.

There is an issue between the parties not that the solicitors were retained by the client, but as to the terms of the retainer. It seems sensible to isolate that issue and refer it to the decision of the same person who makes the assessment of costs.

Each party should pay their own costs, except that the defendant should pay the costs of preparing and filing the plaintiff's notice of motion of 25 June
Otherwise I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order initialled by me, dated and placed with the papers.
