Atlantis Corporation Ltd & Anor versus Schindler & Ors /94 
Tuesday, 25 June 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The affidavit of Mr Niven sworn 17 June 1996 was served on the plaintiffs either on the date it was sworn or the day after, that is, on 17 or 18 June 1996, for use during this hearing which commenced on 24 June for a period of five days. At a pre-trial directions hearing on 4 March 1996 a direction was given to the effect that any further affidavits intended to be relied on by the cross-claimant be filed and served by 25 March 1996, and it was on that occasion that the five day fixture commencing 24 June was established.

I am informed that in or about early June what appears to have been a draft of an affidavit of Mr Niven bearing date April 1996 was sent to the plaintiff's solicitors. The sworn affidavit of 17 June is in several significant respects different from the earlier draft. It is not entirely clear to me what significance the matters deposed to by Mr Niven have in the proceedings. That affidavit contains fairly generalised assertions as to events between 1979 and , involving products said to have been made in accordance with the Mascaro patent, which is in evidence in these proceedings as exhibit EX2, and alleged dealings between Mr Niven and Mr Urriola in relation to those products and generalised statements as to the commercial arrangements entered into by Mr
Niven in connection with the patents rights.

I have reached the conclusion that in the circumstances I should not permit this affidavit to be read. Among the matters which I have considered in reaching that conclusion are: the history of these proceedings, which were commenced in February 1994, in which the pleadings were closed in about June 1995, in which an interlocutory injunction supported by an undertaking as to damages by the plaintiff was granted in March 1994, in which there was a substantial hearing on separate questions during 1995, and in which the preparations for trial have been the subject of close control by the Court at least since June 1995; the nature and width of the matters deposed to by Mr Niven and the manner in which they are dealt with in his affidavit; the absence of any explanation for the lateness of this affidavit and the very lengthy time which the cross-claimant has had to file the evidence on which it wished to rely; the potential prejudice to the plaintiffs if they were required to address evidentiary matters during this hearing arising from the assertions in
Mr Niven's affidavit; the substantial disruption which any adjournment would involve (which I should add would have to be for a substantial period of time), both in relation to the reasonable expectations of the parties (having regard among other things to the plaintiffs' continuing risk under their undertakings for damages) and to the very substantial accumulated costs of these proceedings; and the disruption which any such adjournment would involve to the orderly conduct by the Court of its business, to the prejudice of other litigants in other cases.

I am not persuaded that it would be in the interests of justice to accede to the application for leave to read this affidavit and I therefore refuse it.
