EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT RELATING TO ADMISSIBILITY OF DR ROBERTS REPORTS
There are two things; I was initially attracted to the Ramsay versus Watson <case>; [(1961) 108 CLR 642], rather than Ramsay versus Watson.
I think there is a question about whether a psychiatrist can give evidence about what a layperson ought to perceive about a situation, but I am not so persuaded of that to think that the evidence of the psychiatrist is irrelevant. 
There is a question, as I have said in the course of argument, about the standard of care and whether an expert psychiatrist's special knowledge is capable of informing the answer to the question about what a reasonable person in the position of the first defendant ought to have known for the purpose of determining the foreseeability question in the case.
It seems to me that one would not expect that a company like the first defendant would necessarily have, on hand, psychiatrists to advise it in the type of situation that arose on 15 March 2011.
On the other hand, I think I can infer that psychiatrists do have special knowledge about the workings of the human mind and to that extent what Dr Roberts says is capable of having some relevance to the liability question in the case.
I am not sure that I fully accept Mr Simpkins' argument that if a psychiatrist would not have thought anything of the behaviour of the assailant, why should Optus. But that is something that can be developed more fully when the evidence is in, and in due course.
I will admit the reports of John Albert Roberts as exhibits 1D-5(1) and 1D-6.
