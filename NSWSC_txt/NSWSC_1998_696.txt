The appellant held a sub-lease of a portion of hotel premises from the first respondent, who in turn held a lease of the entire hotel premises from the second respondent. The third respondent was the first respondent's solicitor, and advised the first respondent in respect of the sub-lease. The third respondent also explained the sub-lease to the appellant, although he did not do so pursuant to a formal retainer. The head lease was terminated in circumstances which were argued to be either forfeiture or surrender of the lease. The sub-lease was subsequently similarly terminated.

The appellant brought actions against all three respondents in first instance, but discontinued against the second respondent on appeal. At trial, the appellant had sued: the first respondent for: * breach of the terms of the sublease, in particular the covenant for quiet enjoyment; * negligent advice; and * misrepresentation; and the third respondent for negligent advice, alleging that he failed to advise her: * that the sub-lease could not be effective at law because it was not registrable, being of a longer term than the head lease; * that the sub-lease was void for illegality, because the Liquor Administration Board's consent to the sub-lease was not obtained; and * of her rights in the event of surrender or forfeiture of the head lease. 
On appeal, the appellant maintained her claim against the third respondent and pressed only the first issue against the first respondent.

HELD, dismissing the appeal: 
The head lease was terminated by surrender by operation of law when the first respondent accepted that he was being forced from the premises.

Surrender extinguishes the lease, but the sub-lessee's interest in the land is preserved irrespective of the fact that the head lessor may have been unaware of the existence of the sub-lease and of the fact that the grant of the sub-lease was an act which would have given the head lessor the right to forfeit the head lease.

The surrender of the head lease by the first respondent therefore did not cause the termination of the appellant's sub-lease and accordingly the first respondent did not breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
The appellant's sub-lease was also terminated by surrender by operation of law when she acquiesced in the termination of her sub-lease rather than asserting her rights under it.
The third respondent was engaged by the appellant under an implied retainer and accordingly owed her a duty of care in relation to the subject matter of the implied retainer.

FLEETON versus FITZGERALD & ORS 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: I agree with Beazley JA. 
MEAGHER JA: I agree with Beazley JA. 
BEAZLEY JA: The appellant appeals against the decision of Keating ADCJ in which his Honour dismissed her claim for damages against the first respondent from whom she held a sub-lease in respect of a portion of premises known as the Port o' Call Hotel, Bowral and her claim against the third respondent whom she alleged acted as her solicitor in respect of her entry into the sub-lease. The appeal against the second respondent, the head lessor, was discontinued. 
Background 
The first respondent was the lessee and licensee of the Port o' Call Hotel.
The second respondent was the lessor. The lease was for a period of five years commencing on 1 July 1989, with an option of renewal for three years. There was a prohibition on sub-letting any part of the hotel premises. However, a sub-lease of the kitchen and dining room was permissible with the prior written consent of the lessor, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such consent could not be unreasonably withheld: [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s133b.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) .

In late 1987, the appellant, who had been employed in the dining room of the
Hotel, commenced to run the dining room as a business on her own account.
Initially, there was no formal arrangement between the appellant and the first respondent in relation to the conduct of the dining room business. In June , the appellant left the Hotel on short notice. Several months later, the first respondent asked her to return. There were discussions between the appellant and the first and second respondents as to the terms upon which she would do so. Central to these discussions was the first and second respondents' concern that the appellant not be able to "walk out" on the operation of the dining room business without notice, as she had done previously. The first respondent informed the appellant that if she returned to operate the dining room he required her to enter into a sub-lease of the kitchen and dining room.

Entry into the Sub-lease 
The first respondent retained the third respondent to act for him on the sub- lease. The sub-lease was prepared by October 1989. On 31 October, the third respondent wrote to the appellant enclosing the sub-lease for approval and signature and also enclosing his memorandum of fees, including stamp duty. The appellant's obligation to pay these amounts arose under cl 23 of the sub- lease.

The appellant was tardy in attending to execution of the sub-lease. When the first respondent questioned her about this she said she did not have a solicitor. The first respondent suggested that she use his solicitor, the third respondent. The appellant agreed to do so and, in early December, they attended upon him together. The appellant said that during this meeting, the third respondent read out each of the terms of the lease and "went through each of those conditions, [to] make sure I understood them". She said he asked if she was happy with the special conditions and they then signed the document.

The appellant said she also had a discussion with the first respondent about the payment of money. She said that when she questioned the first respondent as to whether she had to pay he said "I had to pay mine, so you have to pay yours". The appellant paid the legal fees on preparation of the sub-lease before she left the solicitor's office.

The sub-lease of the kitchen and dining room was for a five year term commencing on 1 December 1989. However, the first respondent had not obtained the prior written consent of the second respondent to the sub-lease, as was required by the terms of his lease. Nor had the consent of the Liquor
Administration Board been obtained as required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/s101.html) of the [Liquor Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/la1982107/) .

Shortly after the appellant entered into the sub-lease, the first respondent moved his residence out of the Hotel to his own home, which was approximately five hundred yards from the Hotel. This constituted a breach of his lease which provided that he be resident on the Hotel premises. In December 1989, the second respondent served the first respondent with a notice requiring him to quit the Hotel premises. The circumstances of the giving of this notice and the first respondent's response to it is a matter of some importance in the resolution of the issues raised on the appeal.

The notice was not in evidence. However, the first respondent said he became aware of the notice on a Sunday, it apparently having been left for him on the bar of the Hotel, probably on the previous Friday, at a time when he was not in attendance. The only evidence as to the contents of the notice and what occurred when he became aware of it was that given by the first respondent himself. He said: "... it was a Sunday ... I was contacted by phone that [the landlord] had - I was being evicted, being replaced by - .
 ...

I had in fact - in breach - my leasing agreements regarding moving out of the hotel into my house which was about 500 yards up the road. I had received a letter on the Friday afternoon from [the landlord's] solicitor, Mr Bilinsky, where I was in Sydney for the day, I returned to find the letter that was sitting on the bar. I was extremely irate about the manner in which the letter had been sent to me. It was left on the bar.
 ...

I ... then went down on the Sunday straight away where [the new lessees] were already in the premises. I walked in the door, and I just said to - I asked [the landlord] ... - you know - "you can't do this." He said, "I have the right to do it. I've got the right to break and enter. I don't want to discuss it." And that was the end of it. I then had to see a solicitor later on, which - regarding the signing over the licence - the liquor - to - so [the new licensee] could make application." 
Shortly thereafter, the appellant also left the Hotel, having been refused a new sub-lease by the incoming lessees. The incoming lessees did offer to employ the appellant to run the kitchen and dining room at a salary of $1,000 per week. The appellant refused that offer and obtained similar work elsewhere, but not at the same salary. As will become apparent, the appellant's actions in quitting the dining room are also of importance to the outcome of the appeal.

Claim Against the First Respondent: 
At first instance the appellant's claim against the first respondent was pleaded on three bases: (i) breach of the terms of the sub-lease, in particular the covenant for quiet enjoyment for the term of the sub-lease; negligent advice; and (iii) misrepresentation. However, on the appeal, the only claim pursued was breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. The determination of that claim raises the question whether the first respondent's lease had been forfeited or surrendered.

The trial judge held that the first respondent had surrendered the lease. The appellant contended that this was wrong and that the legal consequence of the first respondent permanently quitting the Hotel was that there had been a forfeiture of his lease.

Forfeiture and surrender are both means whereby a lease is terminated prior to the expiry of the term of the lease. Forfeiture occurs where a lessee has committed a breach of the terms of the lease and has failed to remedy the breach in accordance with a properly constituted notice. The lessor may then terminate the lease. Forfeiture must be effected pursuant to a forfeiture clause in the lease and in conformity with the statutory requirements prescribed by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s129.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). A tenant may apply to the court for relief against forfeiture: [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s129.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). See generally Bradbrook et al, Australian Real Property Law, pp 385 ff.

If the lease is terminated by forfeiture because the lessee fails to remedy the breach as required, the sub-lease is also terminated: May versus Bloom [[1949] 66 WN 209] at 210. However, sub-tenants are afforded statutory protection from the termination of the head lease: [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) , [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s130.html)
That section provides that where a lessor is proceeding to enforce a right of re-entry, a sub-lessee may apply to the court and the court may make orders including vesting the property subject of the lease or any part of it in the sub-tenant.

There was no dispute between the parties that whatever be the precise content of the notice given by the second respondent to the first respondent, it was not a valid notice of forfeiture. At the very least it did not give him adequate notice to remedy any alleged breach of the lease, as required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s129.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). The appellant contended however that, notwithstanding the inadequate notice, the first respondent had accepted the forfeiture.

However, in my opinion, the first respondent's conduct resulted in a surrender of the lease. Surrender occurs where a lessee gives up the leasehold interest to the immediate lessor and the lessor accepts the surrender. Surrender may occur by operation of law as well as by express act of the lessee, and is therefore not subject to notice requirements. For there to be a surrender by operation of law there must be unequivocal conduct by both parties which is inconsistent with the continuance of the tenancy: see Chamberlaine versus Scally [[1992] EGCS 90.] Surrender by operation of law occurs where the parties do some act showing an intention to terminate the lease and it would be inequitable for them to rely upon a formal deed of surrender, or where the tenant gives up possession of the premises and the landlord accepts that to have occurred: see Oastler versus Henderson [(1877) 2 QBD 575]; Helmore,
The Law of Real Property in New South Wales, 2nd Edition (1966) at 107.
Likewise, there will be a surrender by operation of law where the tenant abandons the premises and the landlord re-enters: see Buchanan versus Byrnes <case>; [(1906) 3 CLR 704]; Robinson versus Kingmill [(1954) 71 WN 127.] 
In this case there was, of course, no true consensual or voluntary surrender.
The first respondent was, in effect, presented with a fait accompli.
However, that being the case, the first appellant accepted that he was being forced from the premises and he left. He also took the necessary steps to permit the incoming lessees to apply for a liquor license. He did not seek to assert his rights under the lease, as he was entitled to do. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the lease was impliedly surrendered.

The legal effect of surrender is to merge the lease in the landlord's reversionary interest and thereby extinguish the lease. However, a sub- lessee's interest in the land is preserved. This is so even if the rights of the sub-tenant are unknown to the head lessee and even though the grant of the sub-lease was an act which would have given to the head lessor the right to forfeit the lease: see Parker versus Jones [[1910] 2 KB 32]; Smith v
Great Western Railway Company [(1877) 3 App Cas 165]; E S Schwab & Co Ltd versus McCarthy [(1976) 31 P & CR 196];
Wilson versus Jolly <case>; [(1948) 48 SR 460] at 465 - 466. The consequence in this case is that, at the point that the lease was surrendered, the appellant's interest as sub-tenant remained.
Accordingly, the surrender of the lease by the first respondent and its consequent termination did not constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment of the sub-lease. It follows that the appeal against the first respondent must fail.

It is convenient at this point to consider another question relating to surrender, although strictly it is a question which is relevant to the claim against the third respondent. The principles relating to surrender and forfeiture apply to sub-leases as they do to leases. Here, the appellant, in effect, followed a similar pattern of conduct to that engaged in by
Fitzgerald. The incoming lessees did not recognise her rights as sub-tenant and refused to grant her a new sub-lease. She did not, of course, need a new sub-lease from them. She had existing rights as a sub-tenant. However, she chose not to pursue those rights and abandoned her sub-tenancy. The legal effect of that abandonment was to assign the sub-lease to the head lessor (as surrender operates only in relation to the immediate lessor: see Megarry's
Manual of the Law of Real Property, 7th edition p 332).

Claim Against the Third Respondent 
The claim against the third respondent essentially raised three issues: whether the third respondent was retained by the appellant as her solicitor; if so, whether he was negligent; and if he was negligent, whether that negligence caused the appellant's loss. The third respondent contended that he had never acted as the appellant's solicitor. He also denied that he had advised the appellant as to the terms of the lease as she had alleged. The trial judge found against the third respondent on the latter issue. There is no challenge to that finding: see Abalos versus Australian Postal Commission <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 167]; Devries v Australian National Railways Commission <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 472.] 
The appellant accepted that she had not expressly retained the third respondent. Rather, her case was that an implied retainer arose when the third respondent assumed the obligation of explaining the sub-lease to her. An implied retainer has long been recognised at law. In Blyth versus Fladgate [[1891] 1 Ch 337], Stirling J said at 355: "The main question raised by the pleadings is, whether the relation of solicitor and client subsisted between the Plaintiff, Mr Morgan, and the firm of Messrs. Fladgate, Smith & Fladgate. It is quite plain that no formal or express retainer was ever given by him to them; but that was not necessary, for although no such express retainer has been given, the relation may subsist, and its existence may be inferred from the acts of the parties. If any authority for that proposition be required, it will be sufficient to refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Bean versus Wade [2 Times LR ]." 
Day versus Mead <case>; [[1987] 2 NZLR 443] provides a more recent example. There, a solicitor advised a client to invest in a company in which the solicitor had an interest, without recommending that the client obtain independent advice. The client subsequently made a further investment in the company. The solicitor ostensibly did not act for the client in the second transaction, and did not render an account for professional services, although the client did attend the solicitor's office for the purpose of discussing the transaction and the solicitor did attend to all legal matters associated with the transaction. In considering the circumstances in which a fiduciary duty arises, Somers J noted, at 458, that: "[s]uch a duty will arise if the relationship is such that one party is shown to repose substantial trust or confidence in the other - McKenzie versus McDonald <case>; <case>; [[1977] 2
NZLR 225...] or if one undertakes to act for another in a particular transaction whether or not asked to do so: Phipps versus Boardman <case>; [[1967] 2 AC .] The foundation of the obligation lies in the trust or confidence reposed by one and accepted by the other or the assumption to act for the one by that other." 
After considering the solicitor's involvement with the transaction (which included arranging a temporary mortgage to secure a loan for the investment and accepting money for that purpose through his trust account) and the previous professional relationship of the parties, Somers J concluded at 459 that "although there was no formal or express retainer nevertheless the existence of a retainer in relation to the investment of further moneys and the subscription for increases in capital is to be inferred." See also
Fitzpatrick versus Waterstreet (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 17
December 1998, per Mason P at 28).

I have already set out the circumstances of the appellant's meeting with the third respondent. The question which arises is whether those circumstances gave rise to an implied retainer. In my opinion, that question can be asked in terms of a direct duty relationship, i.e. did the third respondent owe the appellant a duty of care? Factors which have been considered relevant, although not essential, to a finding that a duty of care exists are assumption of responsibility or reliance or both: see Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman <case>; [(1985) 157 CLR 424]; Hawkins versus Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539, per Deane J at 578; and Bryan versus Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609.

In my opinion, the third respondent's conduct in explaining the terms of the lease to the appellant, and asking whether she understood the terms went beyond the provision of casual assistance. The third respondent undertook the role of acting as a solicitor in explaining the terms of the sub-lease, thereby giving rise to an implied retainer. In my opinion, this is so even though no question arose as to any separate payment of fees by the appellant.
I should add that the appellant's belief that she had paid the third respondent was, in my view, her misunderstanding that she was liable for the legal fees under the terms of the sub-lease.

As her solicitor, the third respondent owed the appellant a duty of care to exercise reasonable skill and care in relation to the subject matter of the implied retainer: see Sykes versus Midland Bank Executor & Trustee Co Limited [[1971] 1 QB 113.] The duty owed to the appellant was the same as that owed to the first respondent: see G R Mansell, Professional Negligence of Lawyers,
Accountants, Bankers & Brokers, 2nd edition at 106. The appellant contended that the proper performance of that duty required that the third respondent ensure that the sub-lease she was entering into was a valid and effectual sub-lease. In the circumstances of this case, that required that: there be conformity between the term of the lease and the sub-lease so that the sub-lease could be registered; (ii) she be advised that the written consent to the sub-lease of the head lessor first be obtained; (iii) the consent of the Liquor Administration Board should also be obtained; and (iv) she be advised of her rights in relation to forfeiture and surrender of the head lease or the sub-lease.

I am prepared to assume at this stage that the third respondent was negligent in the performance of his duty to the appellant. However, the existence and breach of a duty of care is not determinative of the claim against the third respondent. Proof of breach of duty only sounds in damages if the negligent conduct was causative of the appellant's loss or damage: March versus E & MH
Stramare Pty Limited <case>; [(1991) 171 CLR 506]; Bennett versus Minister of Community Welfare <case>; [(1992) 176 CLR 408]; and Medlin versus State Government Insurance Commission <case>; [(1995) 182 CLR 1.] 
In my opinion, the appellant has failed to prove causation. The appellant's loss was caused by her "assigning" her sub-lease back to the second respondent, the head lessor, an event which took place by operation of law when the appellant accepted that the new lessees had terminated her sub-lease.
That was an independent act unrelated to the third appellant's negligence. For that reason I am of the opinion that the appellant failed to prove that the third respondent's negligence was causative of the loss.

The appellant having failed to prove that either of the respondents caused her loss, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
