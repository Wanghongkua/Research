JUDGMENT - ex tempore  March 2002 (revised 9 April 2002)  
OBSERVATIONS  Following the handing down of my judgment dated 14 March 2002 and as foreshadowed in that judgment, it is necessary that I make declarations giving effect to that judgment broadly in the manner foreshadowed at para 775 thereof.  The declarations in question are made pursuant to s1317E(2) of the
Corporations Act, which I quote as follows:  "(2) A declaration of contravention must specify the following:  the court that made the declaration;  the civil penalty provision that was contravened;  the person who contravened the provision;  the conduct that constituted the contravention;  the corporation or registered scheme to which the conduct related."  The effect of such a declaration of contravention is that it is "conclusive evidence" of the matters referred to in s1317E(2); see s1317F.  Such a declaration is thus an essential condition, though not the only condition, for a court to order a pecuniary penalty; see s1317G of the
Corporations Act.  The history of s1317E is that it finds its recent origin in the discrete civil penalty regime introduced by the Corporations Law Reform Act 1992 , in turn further refined by the 1999 CLERP reforms. I quote from the summation of that history conveniently set out by A Black, T Bostock, G
Golding and D Healey in "CLERP and the New Corporations Law" 2nd ed (Butterworths, 2000) at 174:  "The civil penalty regime was introduced by the [Corporate Law Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/clra1992225/) (Cth) which adopted recommendations made by the Senate Standing committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that breaches of the duties of care, diligence and good faith should be subject to civil penalties, if no dishonesty or intent to deceive existed. The CLERP Act amends Pt 9.4B, which sets out that regime. The provisions in former Pt 9.4B apply to a contravention of a civil penalty provision which occurred prior to the commencement of the CLERP Act. The new civil penalty provisions, introduced by the CLERP Act, apply to a contravention of the civil penalty provisions which occurred after the commencement of the CLERP Act: s1473.  
Certain provisions are designated as civil penalty provisions for the purposes of Pt 9.4B, following the commencement of the CLERP Act: s1317E. Sections (1), 181(1)-(2), 183(1)-(2), which deal with duties owed by directors and officers to a company, are civil penalty provisions. Section 209(2) (related parties rules), ss254L(2), 256D(3), 259F(2) and 260D(2) (share capital transactions), s344(1) (requirements for financial reports), s588G(2) (insolvent trading), and ss601FC(1), 601FD(1), 601FE(1), 601FG and 601JD(1) (duties of responsible entity in respect of a managed investment scheme) are also civil penalty provisions."  Under the later 1999 CLERP reforms, the current version of s1317E(2) was introduced by the [Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/clerpa1999375/). It replaced the 1992 formulation to be found in s1317EA(2) which read as follows:  "(2) The Court is to declare that the person has, by a specified act or omission, contravened that provision in relation to a specified corporation, but need not so declare if such a declaration is already in force under
Division 4."  Thus the current drafting, which is repeated in the Commonwealth
Corporations Act without any particular explanation that I have been able to find, differs principally by substituting the word "conduct" for the previous "a specified act or omission". Specification of that "conduct" is however still required. Other matters for specification are also set out in s1317E(2), as sub-clauses (a) through (e).  Ford's "Principles of Corporations Law" anticipates the difficulty for courts in drafting such declarations with the appropriate level of particularity when [at 3.400] it is stated that  "A difficulty for the courts will be to specify the conduct that constituted the contravention with sufficient but not too much particularity. Presumably the legislature had in mind a statement of fact rather than a statement applying the law to facts."  However, in answering the question, what degree of specification or particularity is required, it is important to bear in mind that the judicial act is still a "declaration". That imports well settled principles applicable to declarations of right, though now in the present statutory context. Thus in
Tannous versus Mercantile Mutual Insurance Co Ltd [[1978] 2 NSWLR 331] Reynolds
JA (with whom Hutley JA agreed) stated (at 335E) that precision is essential in granting declaratory relief. He also stated that:  "...a declaration of right should be self-contained and intelligible. A declaration which attributes legal consequences to "events occurring" at a certain place on a certain date is wholly unintelligible without reference to other material, and even then is of little or no value."  To put that statement in context, in that case, the claimants had sought a declaration that an insurer was or might become liable under a policy of insurance to indemnify them in relation to events occurring on 23 June 1974 at their premises. The claimants were being sued for damages for alleged personal injury in the nature of burns suffered by a child whilst on their premises on that date.  Tannous is cited at [1932] in Meagher RP, Gummow WMC, Lehane JRF, "Equity
Doctrines & Remedies" 3rd ed. (Butterworths, 1992). So far as my researches have gone there is however no discussion of the issue of degree of particularity in other textbooks such as Young PW, "Declaratory Orders" 2nd ed. (Butterworths, 1984); Zamir I, "The Declaratory Judgment" (Sweet &
Maxwell, 1962); Tilbury MJ, "Civil Remedies" (Butterworths, 1990).  Thus research has yielded no decided case resolving the difficulty of the degree of particularity required. The approach I would adopt recognises that the declaration must still perform its traditional function of being self- contained and intelligible and avoid attributing legal consequences to "events occurring", without specific delineation. That said, fairness to the
Defendants, as well as the mandatory direction given by s1317E(2), requires a reasonable degree of specification of the relevant conduct, based upon the facts found and conclusions reached.  In searching for guidance as to what is reasonable, I have reviewed a number of examples of declarations made under predecessor provisions to s1317E. These are appended to this judgment as a convenient reference point.
They illustrate that the current judicial practice is to identify in fairly concise terms the substantive conduct which constitutes the relevant contravention and also the civil penalty provision contravened. The way in which I have framed the relevant declarations has been in accord with that approach, in setting out the relevant conduct. I have however included in that statement, in response to the Defendants' request for greater particularity, express reference to "the facts and matters under 'the Conclusion'" contained in the specified paragraph (or occasionally paragraphs) of the judgment. But I do so only insofar as the quoted conclusion(s) from the judgment set out at a level of generality the facts and matters "pertaining to" the relevant defendant's "involvement" in the specified conduct.  I shall, for illustration purposes quote the first of these declarations in relation to Mr Adler but without repeating the relevant appended conclusions:  "As against the First Defendant: 
A declaration, pursuant to [section
E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317e.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), that the
First Defendant, Rodney Stephen Adler, whilst being a director of HIH
Insurance Ltd and an officer of HIH Casualty and General Insurance Limited, contravened [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s209.html) of the Corporations Law by reason of conduct in so far as described in the facts and matters referred to under "the Conclusion" in paragraphs (3) and (8) of the Recapitulation of Conclusions of the Court, commencing at page 278 of the Reasons for Judgment, dated 14 March 2002 attached hereto ("the
Conclusions"), pertaining to Mr Adler's involvement in having instigated and caused the payment of $10 million by HIH Casualty and General Insurance
Limited to Pacific Eagle Equities Pty Limited on or about 15 June 2000, in circumstances where such payment involved contraventions by HIH Insurance Ltd and HIH Casualty and General Insurance Limited of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s208.html) of the Corporations Law."  I was invited by the First and Fourth Defendants to go even further and have those appended conclusions also incorporate reference to all of the detailed paragraphs of the judgment which underpin the conclusions. However, that course would have the fundamental difficulty that one would then confuse specification of conduct in broad terms, with the detailed evidence and legal analysis. Neither is appropriate for a declaration. There is nothing in the statutory context which would justify such a course. Fairness to the
Defendants is already achieved through a reasonable level of particularity, by the course I have adopted.  It might be said that the level of articulation of conduct in a well drawn set of particularised pleadings provides some analogy. That is broadly correct, though that specification of conduct may sometimes need additional articulation, if only to give greater specificity to the findings.  A copy of the declarations presently made is to be found in the file. I have however appended the declarations made in other cases on earlier versions of [s1317E(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317e.html)

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Alfa Computers Pty Ltd and Also
Technology Pty Ltd, when a reasonable person in the third respondent's position would have been aware that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the first respondent was insolvent; and  by procuring the diversion to the second respondent of the amount of $80,158.67 out of funds provided by Advance Leasing Ltd for the sale to
