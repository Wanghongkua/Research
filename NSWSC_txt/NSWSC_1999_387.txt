JUDGMENT: 
THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
PROTECTIVE LIST 
YOUNG, J 
Monday 19 April 1999 
G910/97 - RE P (OH) AND THE [PROTECTED ESTATES ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/) 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR : On 10 October 1997 this Court granted probate in the estate of Mrs P's husband to Mrs P. On 3 December 1997 an order was made by the
Guardianship Board under <case> of the [Protected Estates Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/) whereby the management of Mrs P's estate was committed to the Protective Commissioner.
At the time that order was made the estate of P was not fully administered.
 In about November 1997 one of P's children commenced proceedings under the [Family Provision Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) in respect of P's estate.
 The Protective Commissioner wishes to delegate to the Public Trustee Mrs P's executorship pursuant to <case> of the Wills [Probate and Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/). The matter has been referred to me as the Judge administering this List to approve that practice.
 It would seem in England that when an executor becomes incapacitated and there has been the appointment of a person generally to administer the estate that a fresh grant of administration is made to that person for the use of the incapable person as long as she remains incapable, though the first grant is not impounded: Re Cooke [[1895] P 68], 69.
 The same procedure has been applied in New South Wales; see Geddes Rowland & Studdert Wills Probate and Administration Law in NSW (LBC, Sydney, ) p 798.
 However, <case> of the Wills [Probate and Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/) appears to provide a simpler and less expensive method of proceeding. [Section
A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/s75a.html) permits an executor who has obtained probate whether or not he or she has acted in the administration of the estate, by deed to appoint the Public
Trustee to be executor in that person's stead.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s38.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), requires deeds to be signed. However, although the section does not explicitly say so, it is quite clear that the pre-existing law that a deed may be signed by a duly authorised attorney continues to apply. This is made clear by sections such as 159 and 163 of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). In England a committee may execute a deed on behalf of a mentally incapable person and the signature of the committee acting on behalf of the incapable person is deemed to be the signature of the incapable person; see Lawrie versus Lees [(1881) 7 App Cas 19], 28.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s24.html) of the [Protected Estates Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/) provides that in respect of the estate of a protected person which has been committed to the Protective Commissioner, the Commissioner may exercise all functions necessary and incidental to its management and care and such other functions as the Court may authorise the Protective Commissioner to have or exercise. In [subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s2.html) a list of 16 particular powers is set out, but this is clearly stated to be without limiting the generality of [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s24.html)
None of the specific powers, however, relates to situations where the protected person is an executor. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s71.html) deals with the case where a power is vested in a protected person as a trustee or guardian, but I agree with the tentative view of the Protective
Commissioner that this does not extend to the situations where the incapable person is an executor of an unadministered estate.
 Although the contemplated deed requires the Protective Commissioner to act not so much in connection with the estate, but rather in connection with property over which the incapable person has control as executor, in my view [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s24.html) of the [Protected Estates
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/) is sufficiently wide to give the Court power to authorise the Protective
Commissioner to have the powers to execute the deed required under <case> of the Wills [Probate and Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/).
 Accordingly, I authorise the Protective Commissioner to execute the proposed deed appointing the Public Trustee as executor of the estate of P in lieu of the incapable person.
 As, unless an order is made in the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) proceedings, Mrs P is the sole beneficiary, there does not appear to be any need to comply with <case> of the Wills [Probate and Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/).
