M Egan versus M W and Anor [1996] NSWSC 246 (2 July 1996) 
MICHAEL EGAN versus MAX WILLIS & ANOR /96 
TUESDAY 2 JULY 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES ADMIN LAW DIVISION 
DUNFORD J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: These proceedings arise out of the removal of the Government Leader in the Legislative Council and Treasurer of New South Wales from the Legislative Council Chamber by the Usher of the Black Rod at the direction of the President of that Council following a resolution of the Council that he be suspended from the services of the House following the Government's failure to produce certain documents ordered to be produced by the House.

In my opinion, the case raises important questions of constitutional law involving the relationship between Parliament and the Executive Government including the inherent or implied power of a House of Parliament to call for the production of documents from the Government and/or Minsters, and the proper construction of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)
Act 1902 and the [Parliamentary Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pea1901220/), and, in addition, unwritten principles of constitutional law. I am informed that all the relevant authorities are decisions of the Privy Council and/or Full Court of this Court or more recently the Court of Appeal.

By notice of motion the defendants, who are the President of the Legislative
Council and the Usher of the Black Rod, have sought an order that the proceedings be removed into the Court of Appeal pursuant to SCR [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pea1901220/index.html#p12) r 2(1).

Mr Walker SC, who appears for the defendants, has indicated that he wishes to cross-examine the plaintiff regarding the existence of and/or his access to certain documents but submits that this can just as easily be done in a collegiate court as before a single judge as the area of questioning will be restricted and no issues of credit will arise.

The order for removal is opposed by the Solicitor General on behalf of the plaintiff on the grounds that until any cross examination is concluded the evidence, and therefore the factual issues, are not resolved and it is inappropriate to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal until that has been done.

During submissions I did raise the issue whether the relevant questions could be posed by the administration of interrogatories, but it may be difficult in this case as succeeding questions may depend to a degree to preceding answers.

Also, it seems to me that the relevance, and therefore the admissibility, of the type of question intended to be asked may involve the same issues as the substantive matter of the litigation; and accordingly that there is little point in the matter proceeding before a single judge to permit such cross- examination if it is envisaged that the matter will ultimately be referred to the Court of Appeal.

In my opinion, having regard to the nature of the issues involved I am satisfied that special circumstances exist which will render it desirable to make an order under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pea1901220/index.html#p12) r 2 and I am satisfied that the questions to be decided or determined are those set out in the two sets of questions which the parties have prepared and which I have initialled and placed with the papers.

There is a limited amount of overlap in those questions. I am not satisfied that this creates any problems.

I am satisfied that the questions to be decided are those set out in the two documents initialled by me and placed with the papers.

I order the proceedings be removed into the Court of Appeal pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pea1901220/index.html#p12) r 2.

I grant leave to the parties to apply to the President for further directions.

Costs of the proceedings to date are to be costs in the cause.
