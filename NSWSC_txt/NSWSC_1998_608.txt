RAYMOND RICHARD COLLINS versus STARWAY ELECTRIC (SMITHFIELD) PTY LIMITED /95 October 1998 
David Kirby J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
ORDERS 
HIS HONOUR: On 25 September 1998 I gave judgment in respect of the claim of Mr Collins reserving three issues: 
The appropriate award for superannuation.
The interest payable on the verdict, if any.
The question of costs; although on the last of these questions I foreshadowed that I would award costs to the plaintiff, he having succeeded in his claim.

The matter was mentioned today to deal with these issues. The appropriate superannuation payment has been agreed at $23,612. That sum will be included in the plaintiff's verdict.

The issue of interest is more complex. It is governed by [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s73.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/). I have been provided by the plaintiff with an affidavit of Belinda Neil of 9 October , as well as a copy of a "without prejudice offer" made by the defendant at the end of the first days proceedings. The impression of the fax machine on the "without prejudice offer" is for 8.52am on 2 September 1998 which, in fact, is the morning of the second day. The offer was in the sum of $400,000, inclusive of costs. It was the only offer made by the defendant since the proceedings began.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s73.html) relevantly provides as follows: "73(4) The following provisions apply to damages, other than damages to which [subsections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s2.html) or [3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) applies".
 [Subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s2.html) deals with domestic services and nursing and attendance services and [subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) with non economic loss.
 "73(4)(a) Interest is not payable (and a court cannot order the payment of interest) on such damages unless: ......

The defendant has made an offer of settlement, the amount of all damages of any kind awarded by the court (without the addition of an interest) is more than twenty percent higher than the highest amount offered by the defendant, and the highest amount is unreasonable having regard to the information available to the defendant when the offer was made".

I should also refer to [s73(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s73.html) which is in these terms: "The highest amount offered by the defendant is not unreasonable if, when the offer was made, the defendant was not able to make a reasonable assessment of the plaintiff's full entitlement to all damages of any kind." 
The defendant made an offer of settlement which brings into operation the section which I have identified. The section does not deal with the question of timing. It appears not to matter when the offer was made, subject to one aspect to which I will refer shortly. The award of the court without interest is, in this case, more than twenty percent greater than the offer. However, before interest may be awarded, the court must determine that the highest offer of the defendant was unreasonable, having regard to the information available to the defendant when the offer was made. It is in this context that the timing of the offer is important.

Here the defendant was in possession of all medical reports when the offer was made. It had also seen the plaintiff give evidence, including under cross examination. Mrs Collins had likewise given evidence describing the daily routine which she pursued.

Mr Morris of counsel, when analysing the differences between the assessment by his client and the assessment by the court, has identified, I think accurately, that the major point of departure from the assessment which is embodied in the figures placed before the court on behalf of the defendant and those which were ultimately awarded, is in the area of the plaintiff's need for care, both past and future. No real allowance was made within the assessment by the defendant on this aspect.

I believe, on the information available to the defendant long before the hearing, and certainly by the hearing, that the amount was unreasonable by reason of the omission of this item, or any allowance for this item. I therefore believe it is appropriate to award interest. The agreed sum is $14,069.23.

Adding the superannuation entitlement and the interest, which I have now awarded, in the sum which has been agreed, the total verdict for the plaintiff amounts to $837,995.18. I also award costs to the plaintiff, and there will be judgment accordingly.

I also order that the costs should include the plaintiff's costs of the arbitration. I am prepared to grant a stay on the terms which have been suggested, that is, on condition that the defendants file an appeal within twenty eight days of today, today being the date on which judgment has been entered.

Secondly, the defendant within that period shall pay the plaintiff the sum of $400,000.

Thirdly, that there be liberty on the part of the plaintiff to assess costs immediately or pursue taxation, as the case may be.
