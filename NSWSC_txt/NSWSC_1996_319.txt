JUDGE1
HODGSON J In these proceedings commenced on 8th February 1996, the plaintiff seeks an order that she be released as a involuntary patient held at Rozelle
Hospital pursuant to [s.285](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s285.html) of the [Mental Health Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/). That section is in the following terms: (1) If the Court receives information on oath or the Court has reason or cause to suspect: that a person who is not a mentally ill person or a mentally disordered person is detained in a hospital; or that other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available to a mentally ill person or a mentally disordered person detained in a hospital; or that a forensic patient is wrongly detained in a hospital, the Court must order the medical superintendent to bring the person before the Court for examination at a time specified in the order.

If, on examination of a person (other than a forensic patient) under this section, the medical superintendent is unable to prove on the balance of probabilities: that a person is a mentally ill person or a mentally disordered person; or if the person is a mentally ill person or a mentally disordered person, that no other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available to the person, the Court must order that the person be immediately discharged from the hospital in which the person is detained.

If, on the examination of a forensic patient under this section, the medical superintendent is unable to prove that the patient is not wrongly detained in the hospital, the Court must order that the person be immediately transferred to a prison.
The plaintiff is now aged 42. She has been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia since her teenage years. She began using heroin at 22, and has been on a methadone programme since about 1980. She married in 1980, and has two children: one son aged 15, and another son born on 12th January 1996.
The plaintiff has been taking medication for psychosis for many years. On about twelve occasions, she has been admitted to hospital apparently because she has not maintained medication. The most recent admission, before the current one, was in September 1995. On 1st November 1995, she was placed on a community treatment order supervised by the Marrickville Crisis Team. This team attended at her home twice daily to administer oral medication.
On 10th January 1996, when her pregnancy was in the ninth month, she attended at King George V Hospital. Because of problems associated with high blood pressure, the baby was delivered by Caesarean section on 12th January .
Dr. Large, a staff specialist psychiatrist, has given evidence that on l1th January 1996, he became concerned about the plaintiff's potential for suicide. On 19th January 1996, Dr. Large completed a Schedule 2 notice under the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/) in respect of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was transferred to Rozelle Hospital. On 2nd February 1996, the plaintiff was brought before a magistrate pursuant to [s.38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s38.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/). The matter was adjourned for hearing to 7th February 1996. On that day, the matter was further adjourned to 20th February 1996, apparently because the Magistrate considered an alternative of a community treatment order should be considered.
The notes made by
Magistrate on that day were to the effect that applications would be considered, both by the hospital and by the husband, and there then appear in brackets the words "private CTO".
The plaintiff's claim in these proceedings is that the defendant, that is, the Medical Superintendent of Rozelle Hospital, has not proved on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff is a mentally ill person; and that if the defendant has proved that, the defendant has not proved that no other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available. Accordingly, it is submitted that, in terms of [s.285](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s285.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/), the Court must order that the plaintiff be discharged from the hospital in which she is being detained, that is, from Rozelle Hospital.
Looking at the first question, whether the defendant has proved that the plaintiff is a mentally ill person, that expression is defined in [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/), which is in the following terms. (1) A person is a mentally ill person if the person is suffering from mental illness and, owing to that illness, there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary; for the person's own protection from serious physical harm; or for the protection of others from serious physical harm, and a person is also a mentally ill person if the person is suffering from mental illness which is characterised by the presence in the person of the symptom of a severe disturbance of mood or the symptom of sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of that symptom and, owing to that illness, there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary for the person's own protection from serious financial harm or serious damage to the person's reputation.

In considering whether a person is a mentally ill person, the continuing condition of the person is to be taken into account.

In this section, "damage to the person's reputation" includes damage to the person's reputation among those with whom the person has important personal relationships, where the damage is likely to cause lasting or irreparable harm to any such relationship.
Miss Kluss for the plaintiff submitted that over many admissions to hospital, there is no suggestion in the notes that the plaintiff has ever attempted suicide. The plaintiff in her evidence in
Court presented as stable.
The plaintiff's husband has given evidence that he has no concern that there is any danger of the plaintiff injuring herself or her new baby.
Miss Kluss emphasised the present tense in [s.9(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html), namely that it had to be shown that there were reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control is necessary. Having regard to the present condition of the plaintiff, and the absence of any history of attempted suicide, Miss Kluss submitted that it had not been shown, on the balance of probabilities, that there were reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control is, at present, necessary.
In my opinion, although the present tense is used in [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html), it does not carry the implication that it has to be shown that there are reasonable grounds for believing that unless care, treatment or control is undertaken and carried out on this very day, there is danger of serious physical harm. In my opinion, the care, treatment or control which is referred to in [s.9(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html) can be an on-going programme of care, treatment or control; and a person may be a mentally ill person where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the non-continuance of that programme would, within a reasonable time, bring about a situation where there is real danger of serious physical harm. In my opinion, that is confirmed by the provisions of [s.9(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html)
In the present case, I have to say that I was impressed by the evidence of the plaintiff's husband, and I consider that he has shown himself to have very great care and concern about the plaintiff, and, of course, he has come to know her and her difficulties very well over the 15 years of their marriage.
However, against this, all the expert witnesses who have given evidence in this case, including Dr. Clark who gave evidence for the plaintiff, were in agreement that the plaintiff was a mentally ill person within the definition of [s.9.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html) Case history notes from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, of which the
King George V Hospital is an adjunct, record that on 10th January , the plaintiff said words to the effect that she was distressed by voices, and that those voices were swearing at her, threatening at her, and wanted her to kill people and kill herself; and that she said she did not have on-going intentions to kill herself, but she might one day. Dr. Large gave evidence to the effect that on l1th January 1996, the plaintiff told him twice that she wished she was dead, and said she would not tell him any more for fear of being sent to a psychiatric hospital or him taking steps to prevent her from killing herself.
I consider those notes taken on 10th January 1996, and Dr. Large's evidence, to be reliable; and in my opinion, it is appropriate that statements such as those be taken seriously. In those circumstances, and having regard to the evidence of all the medical experts, in my opinion the defendant has shown, on the balance of probabilities, that the plaintiff is a mentally ill person. I might add that there is no contest that the other aspect of [s.9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s9.html) is satisfied, namely that the plaintiff is suffering from mental illness.
The other question in the case is whether the defendant has proved, on the balance of probabilities, that no other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available.
On this matter, two broad submissions were put. First, it was submitted that, at worst, a community treatment order with oral medication is care of a less restrictive kind which is appropriate and reasonably available. The second submission was that if that care is considered as not presently available, then care of the plaintiff by her husband, who has taken some months leave from his employment and is available to give her full-time care and to ensure that she take the medication, is appropriate and reasonably available.
On the first matter, there is evidence on behalf of the defendant to the effect that the only community treatment order which would presently be appropriate is one involving depot medication, that is long lasting medication by injection, rather than oral medication. That view is opposed by Dr. Clark, who has given evidence for the plaintiff, whose opinion is that a community treatment order with oral medication is appropriate. The importance of the difference is that the plaintiff is very much opposed to depot medication, which she says causes far greater side effects than oral medication.
Even if I were to come to the view that I should prefer the evidence of
Dr. Clark, it seems to me that the possibility of a community treatment order involving oral medication acceptable to the plaintiff cannot, at present, be regarded as care which is appropriate and reasonably available.
 .
In my opinion, I have no power under [s.285](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s285.html), or any other provision of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/), to make a community treatment order in these proceedings.
The Magistrate dealing with the enquiry under [s.38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s38.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/) does have that power; and in this case, the Magistrate has indicated that he will consider making such an order. If there is an appeal from the Magistrate to the Tribunal, and ultimately an appeal from the Tribunal to this Court, then under [s.284](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s284.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/), this Court would have power to make a community treatment order. However, as I have indicated, I do not believe that this Court has such a power in these proceedings. If I were now to immediately discharge the plaintiff from hospital when there is no community treatment order in place, and in circumstances where I cannot make such an order, I do not believe that that situation can be regarded as care which is presently both appropriate and reasonably available.
In response to those propositions, Miss Kluss has submitted that this puts her client in an impossible situation. Miss Kluss pointed out that the plaintiff has been detained in hospital in effect since the birth of her baby; was for some days denied contact with her baby; and since then, has only had limited contact.
The hospital authorities who have carriage of the matter before the Magistrate have indicated that they are only prepared to propose and promote before the Magistrate a community treatment order involving depot medication, which is unacceptable to the plaintiff.
In those circumstances, the question of whether depot medication or oral medication is appropriate will never properly come up for determination, and the hospital authorities will be in the position of forcing the plaintiff to accept medication which she is strongly opposed to, so that she can be reunited with her baby.
In my opinion, there is force in those contentions. It is particularly sad in this case that the plaintiff has had so limited contact with her baby, and it is unfortunate that a satisfactory determination of the appropriate regime will not take place until 20th February 1996 at the earliest.
In my opinion, in a case such as this, the scheme of the Act does make it incumbent on persons with the carriage of a [s.38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s38.html) enquiry before the Magistrate to put up to the Magistrate reasonable alternatives, so that there is available for choice by the Magistrate a regime which can truly be considered the least restrictive. In this case, where there is a genuine and reasonable issue as to whether a regime with depot medication or oral medication would be appropriate, and the plaintiff is very much opposed to depot medication,
I think the hospital authorities should put before the Magistrate the alternatives of treatment plans involving these two methods of treatment. Of course, the hospital authorities can contend strongly to the Magistrate that the depot medication is the appropriate one; but it should be open to the plaintiff to contend that oral medication is appropriate, so that the
Magistrate then has the opportunity of making a decision. Without wishing to be critical of the hospital authorities, who have a very difficult task in cases such as this, I do think it is unfortunate that it will only be on 20th
February next that the matter will come for decision before a magistrate; and
I do urge that everything possible be done to ensure that the matter can be brought to a final conclusion on that day.
 .
I turn to the second submission made for the plaintiff, namely that care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available, namely the release into the care of her husband without the existence of a community treatment order.
I have already said that I am very impressed with the concern and care for the plaintiff shown by her husband; and in my opinion, his willingness and ability to give full-time attention to the plaintiff and the baby for a period of some months is a very important factor in this matter. To digress for the moment from the present submission, in my opinion that is a very important factor to be taken into account in any assessment of the viability of oral medication for the time being.
However, again I am faced with a situation where all the medical experts, including Dr. Clark, have expressed the view that the least restrictive kind of care appropriate at present is a community treatment order, with its sanction of hospitalisation for non-compliance with medication requirements.
In my opinion, that evidence does justify a finding that it has been proved, on the balance of probabilities, that at present no other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate.
I think this is particularly so where there are in train proceedings which can give rise to a community treatment order, and which should be determined no later than next Tuesday. If for any reason it should turn out that the making of a community treatment order is impossible or cannot be achieved on or shortly after 20th February, then this
Court could consider whether some other care of a less restrictive kind was appropriate in those changed circumstances. What I am holding is that, in circumstances where all the medical opinion supports a community treatment order, and there are in progress proceedings which may result in such an order within a week, I do not think it can be said that there is at present some care of a less restrictive kind which is appropriate.
Miss Kluss has submitted that I should make an order which in effect allows the reuniting of this family for the few days before the hearing before the Magistrate. Undertakings would be offered by the plaintiff and her husband to ensure that medication would be taken in the meantime.
I accept that it is very important for this family to be reunited as soon as possible, and very important that everything be done to ensure that there is an appropriate bonding process between the plaintiff and her child.
However, I do not think the section authorises the Court to make some temporary order of that kind, pending the consideration by the Magistrate of a community treatment order. In my opinion, the section poses the question whether other care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available; and if the Court finds that it is not proved that no other such care is available, then the Court must order unconditional discharge. If the
Court finds that it is proved, on the balance of probabilities, that no care of a less restrictive kind is appropriate and reasonably available, the section does not authorise any other order, and I do not think it appropriate to make any other order.
For those reasons, I would at present not make any order for the discharge of the plaintiff. However, I would reserve leave for a limited period, which I would propose to set at four weeks, for the plaintiff to apply in these proceedings if it is considered that the regular procedures have gone so awry that it is necessary to come back to this Court. (Submissions regarding costs)
The defendant makes no application for costs.
Miss Kluss for the plaintiff has submitted that, in the particular circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that an order for costs be made in the plaintiff's favour. Miss Kluss pointed to the important question of civil liberties and the application and working of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/), which were raised by these proceedings, and which, to some extent, have been advanced through the medium of these proceedings even if the plaintiff has not been successful in obtaining the order which she sought. It was also submitted that the proceedings were made necessary by the conduct of the hospital in not acting appropriately in relation to the bonding of the plaintiff and her child, in not obtaining a prompt determination under [s.38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/s38.html) of the [Mental Health
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mha1990128/), and in not proposing for determination by the Magistrate an alternative community treatment order with oral medication.
In my opinion, I should not, as a result of the hearing yesterday and today, make any order which is dependent on a finding of unreasonable conduct of the defendant that has not been an issue which has been explicitly contested, and I do not think it would be fair to draw inferences against the defendant on those matters in those circumstances. The fact that this matter involved wider questions, including questions of civil liberties, is significant; and in my opinion, this would have justified refusing any application by the defendant that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs.
However, while I do understand the submissions concerning the great expense these proceedings involve to persons of limited means, I do not think that, on its own, coupled with the civil liberties aspect, justifies making an order for costs against the defendant. However, there is some slight possibility that the matter may be the subject of a further application, and in that event, there may be some point in reserving leave to the plaintiff to apply for costs on the basis of evidence suggesting unreasonable conduct by the defendant, and I will reserve that leave. I appreciate that may be of little value to the plaintiff, who, not unnaturally, would not wish to incur further expense simply seeking an order for costs. However, it may be of some value if there needs to be some other application.
I make the following orders. 
I decline, at this stage, to make order 1 in the summons. 
I reserve leave to the plaintiff to apply within 28 days in these proceedings for further consideration of that order in the event that the plaintiff alleges that there are serious problems concerning the hearing before the Magistrate which cannot properly be dealt with by the normal procedures. 
At this stage, I make no order as to costs, but I reserve leave for the plaintiff to apply within the same period for an order for costs if the plaintiff produces evidence of unreasonable conduct by the defendant. 
In the absence of any such application within the time limit, the summons is dismissed. 
I direct that the filing fee for the summons be waived. 
I direct that there be no publication concerning pregnancies of the plaintiff which did not come to fruition.
