ARNDALE TOWING SERVICE PTY LIMITED versus GILLESPIES CRANES NOMINEES PTY LIMITED /96 
MONDAY 6 MAY 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ABADEE J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a case stated from a decision of a magistrate given on 27 March 1996 in civil proceedings between the plaintiff and the defendant. On 1 September 1995 the magistrate made a determination that the plaintiff's application for referral for assessment of costs to a cost assessor pursuant to <case> of the [Legal Profession Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) be refused, that the plaintiff's application for adjournment of the proceedings be refused, and that costs be assessed in the sum of $3,800.00 together with interest.

It appears that on 30 April 1993 by liquidated claim the plaintiff sued the defendant for costs and fees incurred in the delivery of certain forklift vehicles at the request of the defendant. On 25 May 1993 grounds of defence set off by a cross-claim were filed by the defendant on 8 November 1993. Nine grounds of defence to the cross-claim were filed by the plaintiff/cross- defendant. The matter was set down for hearing on 7 July 1994. The plaintiff's claim was for $15,155.00 and the defendant's cross-claim for $18,875.83.

On 7 July 1994 there was a judgment entered for the plaintiff on its claim for $17,618.00, including interest. It appears that the hearing the cross-claim was unresolved, and this hearing continued in September 1994. Subsequently, on July 1995 an application was made on behalf of the plaintiff for an adjournment which the defendant resisted. The learned magistrate reluctantly adjourned proceedings to 10 am on 18 July 1995. On 18 July 1995 a further application for adjournment was made on behalf of the plaintiff and was refused. Subsequently, there was further argument and submissions and, ultimately, on 18 July 1995 the learned magistrate made certain orders by consent of the plaintiff. These included orders in relation to judgment as well as an order in the following terms: - "(c) The defendant to pay the plaintiff/cross-defendant's costs of the proceedings (being claim and cross-claim) as assessed." 
According to the facts found in the case stated, on 22 August 1995 a letter was sent to the magistrate and to the solicitors for the defendant by the plaintiff's solicitors containing certain submissions. One such submission was that the learned magistrate had no further function to perform other than to entertain an application for referral pursuant to the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s202.html) of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/). This request related to the matter of the costs.

The matter was subsequently re-listed at the request of the defendant before the learned magistrate on 1 September 1995. On that date she refused to accede to the plaintiff's application for a referral of costs for assessment pursuant to the provisions of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/). She invited further submissions.

According to the facts found by the learned magistrate and after hearing from both parties, she then made an order that costs be assessed in the sum of $3,800.00 with interest. The learned magistrate in the facts found revealed the basis for the calculation of this sum.

Returning to the case stated, the learned magistrate made the following finding which I regard as being a most significant one: - "3(a) It was clearly stated by both of the parties on 18 July that I was requested to assess costs and that orders were made in terms of settlement as filed with the exception of the quantum of costs." 
If there be any doubt about that finding one should also have regard to the further finding set forth in 3(g) which commences: "Because it was, in my view, clearly agreed between the parties on 18 July 1995 that I would determine costs..." 
Before the learned magistrate the plaintiff submitted that her determination was erroneous in point of law upon the following grounds: that her order assessing costs in the sum of $3,800.00 was without power; and that she failed to properly exercise the principles of law governing the exercise of her discretion conferred by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s202.html) of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) in a number of respects. A challenge is also made in relation to the amount of costs that were, in fact, awarded.

Before me it has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the proper construction of what the magistrate was asked to do was that she was not asked to assess costs, and that to the contrary it was asserted that the parties intended to enable the question of costs to be resolved or otherwise dealt with in accordance with what was described as a new regime, namely, the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).
That submission should be rejected. It stands in the face of the magistrate's findings as to what was clearly stated by both parties on 18 July in relation to which I have already made the appropriate references.

Mr McQuillan, on behalf of the plaintiff, submitted that what the magistrate said in 3(a) and 3(g) of the case stated misconceives of what was, in fact, agreed between the parties and misstates it. I do not agree. The learned magistrate's reference to clear statement(s) would suggest otherwise.

Mr McQuillan submitted that the learned magistrate, after having been asked to make an unspecified order for costs in favour of the plaintiff, had no discretion remaining to exercise pursuant to [s
I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208i.html) of the Legal Professional Act. He submitted that the only available option was for the plaintiff to apply to the Supreme Court for an assessment (see <case> of the Legal Professional Act and Pt 31A r 6 of the [Local
Court Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/lcr180/)). He also submitted that the amount assessed was an erroneous one.

Dealing with the last matter, it seems to me that having referred to the matters as found in the case stated there is no basis for my concluding that there was any error committed in fixing the amount for determination. Next it seems to me that the findings 3(a) and (g) left it to the magistrate's discretion to determine the costs and amounts thereof pursuant to the consent terms of the agreement set out on p 3 of the case stated and to which I have already made reference.

It would seem to me that such a conclusion would dispose of this case. Further or alternatively, were it necessary for me to decide I would not in the circumstances conclude that the jurisdiction which the magistrate said had been conferred upon her was ousted by the introduction of the [Legal
Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) [s
I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208i.html) and that that section, also preserved the jurisdiction of the Local Court to determine its own costs and quantum thereof particularly in the circumstances of this case as has been disclosed in the case stated.

In aid of [s
I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208i.html), one also has regard to the Local Court Civil Claims r 198 [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p31a) which apparently were introduced and gazetted on 22 July 1994 some 22 days after promulgation of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/). It seems to me that even leaving aside the specific matters as duly found by the magistrate and her clear understanding of the agreement between the parties, in any event, despite the provision of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s202.html) the magistrate probably had jurisdiction under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s34.html) of the Local Court (Civil Claims) Act and that such jurisdiction was not removed by <case> of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).

However, it is not necessary for me to specifically determine this last question and I do not do so. I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case the findings 3(a) and 3 (g) are not open to be challenged in the circumstances and really do make it extremely difficult for the plaintiff/appellant to succeed in showing that the determination of the magistrate was erroneous. I say nothing more in relation to the fixing of the amount. It is a matter I have already dealt with.

In my view questions and answers stated for decision in the stated case should be as follows: - 
In relation to orders made on 1 September 1995 none of determinations were erroneous in point of law.

My formal decision is that the determinations made by the magistrate were thus not erroneous in point of law. I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the case stated.
