JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Access to "police" documents - T4114) HIS HONOUR: In relation to the police documents, referred to before lunch, I have photocopied four pages as indicated, one of which has been edited.
 The documents, when handed down, of course, will probably make little sense without the legal advisers having access to the original material from which each is produced. That can be cured by the legal advisers.
 The restricted access documents will be handed down. The copied documents are available for inspection by the legal advisers and their clients.
