JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Various documentary tenders by defendant) The first bundle of documents is comprised of message book entries kept by
Mrs Kirk in relation to Mr Stringer. They date from the period 17 June 1996 to late 1998. They were tendered on the basis of laying the foundation for a
Jones versus Dunkel submission. On that basis I would not admit them. They were also tendered as being relevant to, as I understand it, the continuity of acquaintance between the plaintiff and Mr Stringer going back to the 1970s when it is said Mr Stringer was a client of the plaintiff's. This is relevant to the issue raised in the course of the trial as to whether the plaintiff ever went to Costellos, with which it appears Mr Stringer was associated and whether or not he had even heard of the establishment. On that basis I will admit the bundle of documents as Exhibit 265.
 The second bundle of documents are message book entries in relation to Mr
Herbert Field. I will admit this bundle as Exhibit 266 on the same basis.
 The next tender document is MFI 161, a memorandum from Mark Bailey to Keith
Rainey dated 25 August 1999.
 The evidence at T6449.35 decisively lays the groundwork for the admission of this memorandum. It will be Exhibit 267.
 The next category of documents is constituted by MFI 232 being records of court appearances by Stacey Fenton and a message book entry previously marked for identification 261, noting the funeral of that gentleman.
 I must say that the weight that ultimately could be attached to this material, at present, appears to be almost minimal. I am not persuaded however it is inadmissible by reason of irrelevance. It will be defendant's Exhibit .
 The defendant then tenders MFI 224. This is subpoena addressed to Dr Dent returnable in this Court on 10 November 1998, it having been issued on 26
October that year. The submissions in relation to the tender of this document were extensive and are recorded from T8376 and following. I cannot see any relevance of this tender. The service of this subpoena brought it about that documents were bought to the Court in respect of which a claim for privilege was made and in respect of which claim there has been no challenge. It is contended for the defendant that it was in no position to mount a challenge by reason of the opacity of the claim. There is an abundance of material in relation to Dr Dent. I do not see this document as having any probative value at all and it will remain MFI 224.
 The final document for consideration is MFI 154 being a letter from Mr Bates of the defendant's solicitors to Ms P A Bergin (as she then was), Counsel
Assisting the Royal Commission and dated 21 February 1995. Objection is taken to this letter on the grounds of relevance. It is said to be irrelevant because the letter pre-dates the exhibit to which it would otherwise relate, namely, Exhibit AO (the Stals drug allegation video tape). On this basis the tendered material is inadmissible and it will remain MFI 154.
 In summary therefore, the following rulings are made:
Message book entries dated 17.6.96, 14.5.96, 29.7.98, 2.12.98 & .10.98 will be defendant's Exhibit 265.
Message book entries dated 26.3.98, 5.5.98 & 17.12.98 will be defendant's Exhibit 266.
Memorandum from Mark Bailey to Keith Rainey dated 25 August 1999 (previously MFI 161) will be defendant's Exhibit 267.
Record of court appearances by Stacey Fenton (previously MFI 232) and message book entry (previously MFI 261) noting the funeral of Mr Fenton will be defendant's Exhibit 268.
The tender of MFI 224 is rejected and it will remain MFI 224.
The tender of MFI 154 is rejected and it will remain MFI 154.
