JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) (1990) NSW. That section enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application here pending for the making of a proceeds assessment order under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 19 January 2015. In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity, being the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) . That offence is a serious criminal offence as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
The grounds upon which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in para 5 of his affidavit. Mr Spark says that he has read a fact sheet apparently prepared by an officer of the New South Wales Police. He forwarded an email to the police officer concerned to ask him if he had prepared the fact sheet, whether the material contained in it was to the best of his knowledge and belief true, and if it was prepared based on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the fact sheet. He received affirmative answers to those questions.
Other evidence discloses the ownership by the defendant of the property described, namely, the motor vehicle.
Mr Spark also annexed evidence that demonstrates that the defendant has been charged with the offence referred to, in addition to some other offences associated with the same matter.
[Section 10(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. I have read the fact sheet and the other documents annexed to his affidavit and I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion is reasonably held.
I am further satisfied, as [s 10A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) requires, that the defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is situated in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to the defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. Mr Spark gives evidence in his affidavit of his awareness of how easy it is for people to attempt to dispose of motor vehicles in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act. I am satisfied that Mr Spark has the necessary knowledge and experience to express that opinion and I do not consider, in the light of that evidence, that the defendant should be given notice of this application before the order is made. The defendant has his rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act.
Leave to file in court the summons, the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 19 January 2015, together with the statement of facts and circumstances.
I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given by the solicitor for the plaintiff.
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the draft order.
I grant the leave and liberty in paragraphs 3 and 7.
These orders may be entered forthwith.
