The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT - (re tender of Professor Shearman's report - see page 207 of transcript) 
HIS HONOUR: Mr McInnes QC for the plaintiff has tendered a report of 3 March 1992 of Professor Rodney Shearman, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Sydney. This report was prepared for forensic purposes and it is not suggested that Professor Shearman ever personally dealt with the plaintiff. 
The real issue in this case is the adequacy of the anaesthesia during the course of the procedure which the plaintiff underwent. Professor Shearman, although of course well-known as most eminent in the field of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology, was not a specialist anaesthetist.

The report's relevance is confined to the comments he makes at pages 5-6 about the adequacy of the anaesthesia in the operation in question on the basis of the history which was supplied to him and the concluding part of the report questions the adequacy of the anaesthesia and, indeed, the adequacy of the training and experience of Doctor Levitt.

Those matters are very much in issue in these proceedings.

Professor Shearman is deceased, it would seem for quite some time: a fact which, it also seems, has been known for quite some time to the plaintiff's legal advisers.

The report, on the face of it, is admissible in the light of s63 of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) but is subject to a discretion to reject it, spelled out in [s135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) of the same Act.

In my approach to that discretion, I have been assisted by the unreported decision of McLelland CJ in Equity in Lane versus Jurd of 28 November 1995.

The opinions expressed by Professor Shearman in the report are broadly similar to those expressed in a report of Dr John Newlinds which has been admitted into evidence as Exhibit D. That report, of course, was admitted, as I understand it, on the basis that the doctor was available for cross- examination although it now appears there may be some difficulty about that and the parties, as I understand, are trying to resolve that difficulty between them. Dr Newlinds is, himself, a specialist gynaecologist.

There is some brief reference to the question of anaesthesia in the report of another gynaecologist, Dr Hinde, who did give oral evidence and was briefly cross-examined.

It appears to me that on balance my discretion should be exercised against admission of the report firstly because the matters raised by Professor
Shearman are dealt with in other evidence in the case; the matters raised by the Professor are contentious and if he had been available for cross- examination I have no doubt cross-examination would have been lengthy; he was not himself a specialist anaesthetist and there has already been in this case detailed evidence from one specialist anaesthetist and I would not be surprised if there is some more before the case is over. Further, there has been ample opportunity to consult another expert since the Professor's death.

It is for those reasons it appears to me it would be unfair to the defendants to admit the report without the opportunity of cross-examination of its author.

Within the terms of [s135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) I consider it would be unfairly prejudicial to that party to admit the report and for those reasons I reject it.
