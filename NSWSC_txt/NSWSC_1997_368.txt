Laurence GAFFNEY versus CAMDEN COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: Since 1964 the appellant has owned and occupied a two hectare property at 29 Tobruk Road, Narellan Vale. The land was originally the whole of the land in Lot 3 of Deposited Plan No 201326, and later became Lots 31, 32 and 33 of Deposited Plan No 826724. The shape of the land as subdivided is depicted in the judgment of Meagher JA. 
Lots 32 and 33 were resumed by Notice of Compulsory Acquisition of Land published in the Government Gazette on 17 September 1993. Pursuant to the
Local Government Act 1919 and the [Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation)
Act 1991](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) (the "Just Terms Act") the Council declared "with the approval of His
Excellency the Governor" that Lots 32 and 33 were acquired by compulsory process under the provisions of the Just Terms Act 1919 "for a purpose of the
Local Government Act 1919, namely extending a public road".

The validity of the compulsory acquisition was challenged unsuccessfully before Waddell AJ. It is important to note that the pleaded grounds of invalidity that were pressed were that the two enactments referred to did not authorise the Council to acquire more land than was required for the stated purpose (of road widening); and that the acquisition was ultra vires the powers of the Council. An earlier claim that the acquisition was made in bad faith was withdrawn at trial and replaced with the assertion that it was "beyond power". In its Points of Defence, the Council justified the acquisition on two alternative bases, namely (1) that it was for the purposes of exercising functions of the Council (presumably road widening) and (2) that the land was adjacent to or in the vicinity of land acquired by Council for those purposes.

Whether or not the appellant still presses his challenge to the acquisition of
Lot 33 is, to me, unclear. But that challenge was correctly dismissed by
Waddell AJ. Lot 33 traverses the very site of a road passing through the area which was vital to a housing subdivision which the Council supported.

The appellant's real attack relates to Lot 32. The appellant contends that the triangular shaped Lot 32 was not required for the road and that in consequence the resumption was ultra vires. He accepts that he bears the onus of establishing invalidity of the resumption, but relies upon the fact that
Council had created Lots 32 and 33 as separate lots before the resumption was effected.

On 17 March 1992 Council prepared a Development Control Plan (cf Environmental
Planning & Amendment Act 1979, s72). It disclosed an intention to permit the subdivision of a large tract of land at Narellan Vale for housing. The
Plan showed the location of proposed roads and proposed building allotments.
Relevantly, it showed the southern corner of the appellant's land as being intersected by an extension of Waterworth Drive. This road sliced off the southern most tip of the appellant's land and created the triangular block that became Lot 32.

There were lengthy negotiations in which the Council sought by agreement to acquire Lots 32 and 33 from the appellant. The appellant was contending that the road should have been located elsewhere. There was also disagreement about price. On 14 December 1992 the Council, after considering various objections by the appellant, resolved to resume what became Lots 32 and 33. It is clear that the Council did not wish to remain hostage to the appellant's negotiations and that it was prepared to commit itself, upon resumption, to a fair price being determined in accordance with the provisions of the Just
Terms Act.

On 23 December 1992 the Council registered a Plan of Subdivision (DP 826724), which showed the site of the road through the appellant's land as Lot 33 and the triangular tip of the south of the road as Lot 32. The area of Lot 32 is m&lt;=. The area of the balance of the appellant's land (Lot 31) is 1.722 ha.

At one stage in the 1992 negotiations, representatives of the Council put the appellant in touch with the developer (Monarch Investments). For a period it seemed possible that the developer would purchase Lots 32 and 33 from the appellant. However the appellant was maintaining his opposition to the idea of losing part of his land and, by the end of 1992, the Council set compulsory acquisition in train. As already indicated, there was no (legal) difficulty with this being done with reference to the portion needed for the road (Lot ). But the developer could not force the appellant to cede Lot 32. The
Council did (by the compulsory acquisition), and its power to do so is challenged.

Accepting that the appellant bears the onus of proof on the issue of ultra vires I still cannot accept the submission for the Council that Lot 32 may have been needed to locate equipment during the road construction, and that in consequence the triangular lot was needed for extending the road. Counsel for the respondent Council frankly conceded that there is no evidence to support such an intention, when pressed to point to it.

At times during the hearing of the appeal the appellant (who represented himself) argued that the Council's purpose and intent in resuming Lot 32 was to aid the developer by taking from the appellant land which the Council did not itself need and selling it to the developer. In my view this submission cannot be entertained within the confines of the case as pleaded, especially after the issue of bad faith was withdrawn. While bad faith and improper purpose are distinct concepts in administrative law, I do not see that issue was fairly joined below on a case that involved such a serious allegation as is touched upon in this paragraph.

Following Thompson versus Randwick Municipal Council <case>; [(1950) 81 CLR 87], the Local Government Act 1919 was amended in 1951 so as to widen the acquisition powers of councils. Relevantly, Section 532 was amended to read: "532 (1) Ö 
In addition to the powers conferred by subsection one of this section the council may acquire by lease, purchase, appropriation or resumption in accordance with this Part - any lands of which those proposed to be acquired for any purpose of this
Act form part; any land adjoining or in the vicinity of any land proposed to be acquired for any purpose of this Act;Ö 
Without limiting the generality of paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection two of this section the powers conferred by such paragraphs may be exercised notwithstanding that the land acquired thereunder - may or may not be acquired for or in connection with any purpose of this
Act; may be so acquired for sale or re-sale and applying the proceeds thereof in defraying in whole or in part the expenses incurred by the council in carrying out any work upon lands:- acquired for any purpose of this Act; and of which the lands acquired under paragraph (a) of subsection two of this section form part, or which adjoin or are in the vicinity of land acquired under paragraph (b) of that subsection." 
These provisions have been replicated (with minor changes) in the [Local
Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/), [ss186](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s186.html) and [188](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s188.html) and the [Roads Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/), [ss177](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/s177.html) and [179](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/s179.html).

In my view, the combination of s532(2)(b) and (3) provide legislative authority for the resumption of Lot 32, given its small size and its contiguity to Lot 33, which was acquired for purposes of the Act. See also
CC Auto Port Pty Ltd versus Minister for Works <case>; [(1985) 113 CLR 365]; Collins versus Willoughby Municipal Council [(1967) 14 LGRA ];
De Rous versus Burwood Municipal Council, Land and Environment Court,
Pearlman J, unreported, 5 March 1996. The appellant contends that Lot 32 was not needed for the road or roadworks. However, the fact that Lot 32 was itself excess to requirements for "extending[the] public road" is the very matter which engaged s532(2) and (3) in a proper case.

Whether, as Waddell AJ considered, the only safeguard against abuse of the powers given by s532(3) is scrutiny by the Department of Planning before approving a proposal for submission to the Governor in Council, is a point which I would reserve for a case where the link between what is removed and what is actually required for a council purpose is weaker than the present.
Here there is direct contiguity between Lots 32 and 33, and Lot 32 is a small piece of land isolated by the excision of Lot 33.

I agree with Meagher JA that (for the first reason he gives) the argument that the Minister or the Governor were deceived by a misrepresentation that both lots were required for road extension, and that their consent was thereby vitiated, is not open in the appeal. The point raised is, however, one of substance in a proper case. It is true that the repository of a power is not usually confined, when challenged, to justify its exercise by reference to grounds earlier stated: see Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning v
Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd <case>; [(1996) 91 LGERA 31] at 85-6. However it is significant that since 1991 a council may not give a proposed acquisition notice under the Just Terms Act "without the approval of the Minister" (Local Government Act 1919, s532(1A) as added by Schedule 1 of the Just Terms Act. See now [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/), [s187(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s187.html) and [Roads Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/), [s178(2).)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/s178.html)
The added step appears to be a counterpoise to the very width of s532 as it stood after 1951. I would require persuading that an acquisition based upon an approval obtained as the result of failure to inform the Minister of the true purpose of the acquisition, or alternatively to identify s532(2) or its counterparts as the basis for the acquisition, was a valid acquisition: cf
R versus City of Salisbury [(1981) 27 SASR 500.] However, the point does not properly arise here in the light of the way the case was conducted at trial.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

GAFFNEY versus CAMDEN COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT 
SMART AJA: I agree with Mason P. 
The council's need to obtain the Minister's approval prior to giving a notice of proposed acquisition is an important safeguard against unfair acquisitions.
A council, when seeking approval, should supply the Minister with full details including the areas to be resumed and the purpose or purposes of the resumption of each area to be resumed.

GAFFNEY versus CAMDEN COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT 
MEAGHER JA: The appellant, Dr Gaffney, appeals against an order of Waddell AJ in the Land and Environment Court declaring valid a resumption by the respondent Council of certain of the appellant's land. That land was originally the whole of the land in Lot 3 of Deposited Plan No.201326, and later became lots 31, 32 and 33 of Deposited Plan No. 826724. It is situated at the village of Narellan Vale, which is virtually a suburb of Camden. The three lots, together, form a five acre unit. A rough sketch of them is as follows: 
DEVELOPERS 33 32 RESIDENTIAL 
SUBDIVISION 
ROAD 
The land resumed was Lots 32 and 33. The resumption was duly notified in the
Government Gazette. It is clear enough that Lot 33 will be utilised as an extension of the road depicted in the above sketch. It will be a paved surface fit for traffic. In this appeal, no attack has been made on the Council's acquisition of Lot 33.

The argument has centred around the resumption of lot 32. Lot 33 has an area of 1560m, Lot 32 an area of 1300m.

The notification in the Gazette stated that both lots were being resumed "for the purpose of road extension". That is manifestly true of Lot 33; but it is hardly true of Lot 32. It is not proposed to build any road on Lot 32. What the Council proposes to do with Lot 32 the evidence simply does not disclose.
The Council might intend to use it as a park; it might intend to sell it, in order to defray the costs of the construction of the road on Lot 33. The issue was simply never explored in the proceedings before Waddell AJ.

Dr Gaffney, who conducted his own appeal, and did so with some vigour, argued that there was no power to resume Lot 32 if it was not going to be used as a road, and (2) even if there was power, the purported exercise of that power by the Council was vitiated by an improper purpose.

The first question is whether a Council, intending to resume certain land for a primary purpose, may also resume adjacent land for some ancillary purpose.
The answer must, obviously, depend upon the applicable legislation. In C. C.
Auto Pty Limited versus Minister for Works <case>; [(1985) 113 CLR 365] the High Court of Australia held that the West Australia legislation there in question did authorise the resumption of such adjacent land. In the present case, if the appropriate legislation is the [Local
Government Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) (as I think it is), there is express authority to resume adjacent land (see [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s321.html), [496](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s496.html), [518](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s518.html) and [532](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s532.html)), and for relevant purposes the provisions of this Act have been continued after the commencement of the 1993 Act: see Schedule 7 of the latter Act and the
Local Governments (Consequential Provisions) Act 1993 . If, on the other hand, the relevant Act is the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) , the same result obtains: see [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s186.html) of that Act. A third possibility is that the matter is governed by neither of the above Acts, but by the [Roads Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/) , in which event [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ra199373/s177.html) of that Act would lead to the same result. The first question must, therefore, be answered adversely to Dr Gaffney.

The second question is whether the Council's purported acquisition of Lot 32 is vitiated by mala fides or improper purpose. The suggested improper purpose is the assistance of the Monarch Investment Group, which was developing the land marked "Developers Residential Subdivision" in the above sketch. In my view, this argument must also fail, as there is simply no evidence to support it. The onus was on Dr Gaffney, and he did not even put the proposition to the Council's witnesses in cross-examination. There are some surrounding circumstances which might raise a suspicion, but there is nothing remotely resembling proof of such a serious charge.

Yet another argument arose in the course of argument. It was alleged that both the Minister and the Governor were deceived by a misrepresentation that both
Lots 32 and 33 were required for road extension. This argument cannot be accepted, and in my opinion for two reasons. The first is that it was not raised below and cannot now be raised here for the first time. The second is that I cannot see that any such misrepresentation exists. To say that "road extension" is the purpose of the acquisition of Lots 32 and 33 is perfectly true if one looks at the overall purpose of the total transaction.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
