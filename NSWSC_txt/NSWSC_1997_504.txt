Ramirez versus Sandor's Trustee (No 2) /95 October 1997 
Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /95 - RAMIREZ V SANDOR'S TRUSTEE (NO 2) 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: On 23 April 1997, I gave reasons for judgment as to why the plaintiff's claim that the bankrupt, Zoltan Sandor, held property at 23 Baltimore Road, Mortdale Heights on trust for her, succeeded. 
On 12 June 1997, I made orders, but reserved my decision on costs pending receipt of written submissions. These arrived on 11 and 17 September. 
Mr Tregenza, for the plaintiff submits that the general rule that costs should follow the event applies. He says that the plaintiff was forced to bring these proceedings to defend her interest in the land when the Trustee issued a notice of lapsing of caveat. However, he also submits that even though the defendant is named as "The Trustee of the property of Zoltan Sandor, a bankrupt" in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s161.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), there is no reason why costs recovered should be limited to the assets of the estate of the bankrupt. This is because, if the Trustee was not personally liable when using his or her official name under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s161.html), litigation could be commenced with impunity so far as costs were concerned, and that is not in accordance with public policy.

Mr Durston, for the Trustee, submits that there are special factors in the instant case as to why costs should not follow the event, or alternatively, that any costs order should only be against the bankrupt estate.

On the first submission, Mr Durston puts that the present litigation would not have come about apart from the wrongful conduct of the plaintiff, including arming the bankrupt with title; (b) assisting the bankrupt in preparing false documents to obtain the mortgage including false statutory declarations; and (c) placing moneys in the bankrupt's account so that he could represent to the lender that the moneys were his.

Mr Durston also submits, "Trustees have a public duty to discharge and do not come to any matter with firsthand knowledge of the facts. If a Trustee was to be made liable in the circumstances where the Plaintiff's own dishonesty gave rise to the bankrupt being on title and where the Plaintiff failed to keep any contemporaneous record setting forth the true nature of the transaction then it would deter Trustees from defending what may in other matters amount to egregious frauds on creditors.
 "It is the Plaintiff's own acts of dishonesty that have given rise to this litigation and this should not only dis-entitle her to costs but she should be ordered to meet the costs of the Trustee to whom she by her own actions has put to expense." 
As to the Trustee having a public duty, Mr Durston cites words of Vaughan
Williams, LJ in another connexion in Re Tyler; Ex parte Official
Receiver [[1907] 1 KB 865], that the Trustee is an officer of the Court with public duties. The force of any such argument is now considerably weakened because of the completely different regime that existed in England in 1907 to that which exists under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s19.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/). In any event, it is not true to say that a Trustee is an officer of this Court.

Mr Tregenza is certainly correct in that although costs are in the discretion of the Court, the ordinary rule is that a person who is successful in litigation gets her costs, and a person who is unsuccessful, pays them.
However, certainly Mr Durston is correct that there is misconduct on the part of the plaintiff which contributed to the Trustee considering that he should file a lapsing of caveat notice with the Registrar General and contest these proceedings.

In Trade Practices Commission versus Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd [(1979) 28
ALR 201](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%2028%20ALR%20201 "View LawCiteRecord" ), Fisher, J, in the Federal Court, analysed the consequences as to costs where a successful party had partly been the cause of the Commission proceeding against it because of untruths its employee had told. After referring to authority, his Honour held that he should only exercise a discretion to order a successful party to pay costs in the most exceptional circumstances. His Honour found that the untruth did not constitute sufficient material to order the unsuccessful plaintiff to obtain costs from the defendant. However, the conduct did contribute to bringing the proceedings, but it was not the only conduct relied on by the Commission; accordingly, it should pay half the relevant defendant's costs.

Putting aside the significance of the Trustee having to be sued in his or her official name under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s161.html) of the [Bankruptcy
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), there is no special rule as to the payment of costs to or by an Official Trustee or liquidator. Ordinarily, such people will not sue unless they either have sufficient funds to discharge their obligations in the litigation, or they have an indemnity as to costs from interested creditors. As a general rule, liquidators or Official Trustees who proceed without covering their costs in this way are at risk, see Ex parte Angerstein  <case>; [(1893) 14 LR B & P 77.] In that case, Owen, CJ in Eq dismissed a claim that a bill of sale was fraudulent, but without costs, as the Official Assignee had been misled by what had been said by the respondent at a public examination.
Although an appeal to the Full Court was dismissed, there was no appeal on the matter of costs.

In Re Walters <case>; [(1898) 19 LR B & P 1], there had been a public examination at which the evidence turned out as it had at the trial. Despite this, the Official Assignee sought to set aside a conveyance to Currie as a fraudulent conveyance. The Official
Assignee failed, but A H Simpson, J at p 5 said, "The whole transaction was very suspicious, and Currie, practically by his conduct, brought the litigation on himself ...". His Honour referred to Kevan versus Crawford  <case>; [(1926) 26 SR 351], the bankrupt changed the evidence that he had given at his public examination in the hearing of proceedings to recover property. The trial judge accepted the fresh account and dismissed the claim. The trial judge made an order for costs against the Official Assignee which was overturned by the Full Court on the basis that there was sufficient suspicion brought about by the bankrupt's own conduct.

Turning to the present case, there is some suspicion brought about by the plaintiff's conduct. However, her conduct, which was described by Mr Durston as "fraudulent", and by Mr Tregenza as "resourceful", was not aimed at misleading the Trustee but was rather aimed at getting over what the plaintiff thought were barriers of red tape against her obtaining a commercial result, namely, a home loan for a home in which she was investing the proceeds of her divorce settlement. Furthermore, the Trustee was not misled by any misstatements made by the plaintiff. As I said in my judgment of 23 April, the
Trustee's officers seemed to have poisoned their minds by accepting too readily statements made about the plaintiff and the bankrupt by creditors who were unsympathetic to them rather than being misled by the bankrupt or the plaintiff. I further said, in retrospect, perhaps rather kindly, that the
Trustee's officers had some misunderstanding as to what they were told by the plaintiff.

Although this case does get close to the line, it does not seem to me that the suspicious circumstances of the transaction in the light of all the material and in the light of my findings on 23 April, justifies me from departing from the ordinary rule.

Accordingly, the defendant should pay the plaintiff's costs.

The next matter is whether the defendant is limited to the assets in the bankrupt's estate or is personally liable. The rule that was enunciated in
Ex parte Angerstein supra, does not appear to me to be affected by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s161.html) permitting the Trustee to sue or by sued in his official name. It would appear that this section is really only directed to avoiding proceedings having to be amended if there is a change in the persona of trustees. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s161.html) makes no special provision as to costs, and this is to be contrasted with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s105.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) which specifically enacts that the Trustee is not to be liable for costs in appeals against rejections of proofs of debt. See also the notes to McDonald Henry & Meek, Australian Bankruptcy Law & Practice, 5th ed [134. 1.80] (update 7 1997).

Accordingly, in my view, the ordinary order for costs must be made. Thus the appropriate order is that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
