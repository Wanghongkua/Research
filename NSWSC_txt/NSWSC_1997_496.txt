Sacon Constructions Pty Ltd versus Kezarne Pty Ltd /97 October 1997 
Rolfe J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
Construction List /97 - SACON CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LTD versus KEZARNE PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In this matter I gave judgment on 10 October 1997 in which I stated that I proposed to order that the report of Mr Geoffrey Lumsdaine, dated 3 September 1997, be adopted. I stood the matter over until today to hear submissions from the parties on the judgment or judgments which should be entered, including any interest component and on costs. 
When the matter was called on today, Mr Gracie, of counsel, appeared on behalf of the defendant and handed to me a facsimile copy of a letter dated 16
October from the solicitors for the plaintiff to his instructing solicitors stating: "We refer to the above matter and your letter dated the 13 October 1997.

We advise that a copy of your letter has been forwarded to the client. The client is aware of the matter being before the Court on Friday 17 October 1997.

We advise that our firm is no longer instructed in this matter, and shall not be appearing tomorrow.

We shall be filing a Notice of Ceasing to Act as soon as possible." 
Although the letter indicated that a carbon copy was being forwarded to me, it had not arrived at the time I came on the Bench.

I had the plaintiff called three times outside court shortly after 9.30am and it did not appear.

The defendant seeks judgment in the sum of $96,710, being the amount the
Referee found to be owing, together with interest pursuant to s.94 which, calculated in accordance with the Supreme Court rates from 25 February 1997 to today's date, is $6,491.07. In my opinion there should be judgment for the defendant in that amount on its cross-claim.

The defendant also seeks an order for costs as from 8 April 1997 on an indemnity basis. It appears that on 7 April 1997 a letter was written by its solicitors to the solicitors for the plaintiff offering to settle the matter for $80,000 on the basis that each party pay its own costs. It was stated that that settlement would be the subject of a deed of release with appropriate releases and indemnities and that the offer would remain open until 4pm on 8
April 1997. The offer was not accepted and, on 30 April 1997, a counter offer was made. It is not suggested that the offer made in the letter of 7 April was an offer of compromise conformably with the Rules, but in a the nature of a Calderbank offer.

The counter offer made on 30 April 1997 sought verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $180,000, and for the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs as agreed or assessed. The award of costs is essentially a discretionary matter, and it is quite clear that the defendant has succeeded, not only to a greater extent than it offered, but also that the plaintiff failed to obtain anything like the amount set forth in the letter of 30 April 1997.

I am troubled, however, at the time for which the offer remained open and, notwithstanding the matters to which I have referred, I am not prepared, in the exercise of my discretion, to make a special order in respect of the costs as from 8 April 1997. If such offers are to be relied on I consider that a reasonable time should be given so that they can be evaluated.

I order that the report of Mr Geoffrey Lumsdaine dated 3 September 1997 be adopted.

I order judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff in the sum of $103,201.07.

I order the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings.

I order that the exhibits be returned.
