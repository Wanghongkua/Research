REGINA versus JON LESLIE BAARTMAN /93 October 1998 
Dunford J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Criminal Division 
JUDGMENT: - Re submissions on Notice of Motion - see p 13 of transcript. 
HIS HONOUR: The accused in this trial is charged with the murder of Leszic Betcher at Lugarno on 23 February 1993. The Crown case is that the deceased was shot in the abdomen by one Paul Crofts at the front door of his residence while this accused kept watch outside, so that the Crown case essentially is one of joint enterprise between this accused and Crofts. Crofts had apparently intended to shoot someone else in the leg but went to the wrong premises by mistake. 
The matter has had a long history. The accused was arrested approximately five and a half years ago. He was tried, convicted and sentenced in 1994 but subsequently that conviction was set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal, having regard to the evidence which had emerged in the Royal Commission into the Police Service in relation to some of the Crown witnesses, and he was re- tried earlier this year, at the end of which trial the jury was discharged when it was unable to agree.

A number of matters set out in a document entitled Notice of Motion have been argued before the empanelling of the jury. In relation to items 1 to 5 in that document, I indicated yesterday that I ruled against the submissions on behalf of the accused and would give my reasons later. Item 6 has been otherwise resolved and is not pressed.

Items 7.1 to 7.4 seek to exclude all evidence concerning a .32 Beretta pistol serial number 93390 alleged by the Crown to be the murder weapon taken from the flat at 18/10A Challis Avenue, Potts Point, on 24 March 1993, and all evidence consequentially derived therefrom, including the evidence of a number of witnesses relating to the seizure of the pistol, its chain of custody, ballistic examination, fingerprint evidence, verbal admissions relating to it and photographs of the accused taken on 24 March 1993 and subsequent identifications of him utilising those photographs.

The application is based on the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), on the ground that the pistol was illegally taken and that the other evidence was obtained in consequence of the impropriety in taking the pistol. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) is as follows:- 
Evidence that was obtained: improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been so obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

The circumstances alleged briefly are that on 24 March 1993 ambulance officers were called to the premises at 18/10A Challis Avenue, Potts Point, to answer a call that a man had overdosed. Two officers arrived and commenced treatment on the person concerned, who was the accused. As he began to regain consciousness one of the officers saw a pistol underneath a crib. She subsequently took the gun, put it on the window sill and another ambulance officer handed it to the police when they were called shortly afterwards.

The pistol was taken to the Kings Cross police station and it became the subject of an interrogation by the then Det Trevor Haken, an interrogation which the Crown does not intend to lead in evidence. Subsequently the pistol was subjected to ballistics examination and after the accused's first trial was destroyed, it is said, "by mistake". As a result of the ballistics examination and comparison with a spent cartridge found at the site of the shooting, the Crown alleges that this pistol was the murder weapon. The importance and relevance of the evidence is that by it the Crown seeks to prove that about a month after the shooting the accused is found in the flat in which the murder weapon is discovered and allegedly in possession of the said weapon.

The accused starts off with a dilemma, because to establish a taking he must first establish that the pistol was in his possession and that is not something which I anticipate he wishes to claim. Be that as it may, the situation arose where the ambulance officers became aware of a loaded and cocked pistol in premises where a baby was present and in circumstances which indicated it was possibly evidence in relation to a serious crime.

I was referred to a number of cases, including R versus Salem (unreported-
CCA-3 October 1997) and R versus Coulstock (unreported-CCA-10 March 1998). It is established by those cases that, unlike the former law, as explained in
Bunning versus Cross [(1978) 140 CLR 54], although the onus to establish the illegality or impropriety remains on the accused, once illegality or impropriety is established the evidence has to be excluded unless the Crown (which bears the onus) establishes that it should be admitted.

For example, in R versus Salem, Hidden J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Hunt CJ at
CL agreed, said: "By sub-s (1), the question to be determined is whether the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, given that it was obtained by the unlawful conduct of the police and their agent.
The onus was on the accused to establish that illegality but, it being established, it was for the Crown to satisfy his Honour that the evidence should be admitted. . . . With that qualification, the assessment of the competing public interests is relevantly similar to the exercise at common law described in The Queen versus Ireland <case>; <case>; <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 19."] 
In the present case I am not satisfied that the taking of the gun was illegal.
The offence of larceny requires a felonious intent to convert the goods taken to the taker's own use and to make them permanently his own property:
Croton versus the Queen  <case>; [(1967) 117 CLR 326] at 328. See also East's Pleas of the Crown (1803) vol 2 at 553. It must be fraudulent or dishonest and involve some moral obloquy:
R versus Freely [[1973] 1 QB 530], applied in
R versus Weatherstone (CCA-20 August 1987) 8 Petty Sessions Review 3729. Here there was on the part of the ambulance officers no fraudulent or felonious intent, no intent to make the pistol their own property and no moral obloquy.
Consequently their taking of the pistol did not constitute larceny or any other illegality.

The matter can be tested, as I suggested in argument, by inquiring whether the ambulance officers would have been entitled to take possession of a carving knife covered in blood, if they had seen that. Counsel for the accused was compelled to submit that such a taking would also be illegal. I do not agree.

However, in case I am wrong in this conclusion, and assuming for present purposes that the taking of the pistol was illegal, I am satisfied that a proper exercise of the discretion conferred by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html) requires that the evidence be admitted.

I have already referred to the passage in R versus Salem which indicates that the relevant considerations on the exercise of the discretion are those previously discussed in The Queen versus Ireland and Bunning versus Cross, and a similar passage occurs in R versus Coulstock supra on p 6. Moreover, sub-s (3) sets out a number of matters to be considered and I have taken those into account.

The probative value of the evidence is very high and it is of the utmost importance to the Crown case in relation to the offence charged which is a most serious offence, if not the most serious one in the criminal calendar. If there was any contravention or impropriety, it was of an extremely technical and non-deliberate nature, and there could have been considerable difficulty in obtaining the evidence without the impropriety or contravention because to wait until the police later arrived or a search warrant had been obtained, would have given anyone concerned with the pistol the opportunity to dispose of it.

Reference was also made to the other relevant factors concerning the destruction of the pistol and the part played by the former Det Trevor Haken in the continuity of the custody of the weapon. It appears that although the pistol was available for the first trial, the defence at no stage had any tests or ballistics examination done on it; and it is open to the defence to put to the jury that the pistol has been destroyed and get such, if any, benefit from that as the jury sees fit.

As to the part played by former Det Haken, whose reputation was grossly damaged by the Royal Commission into the Police Service, he played only a very minor part in the continuity of the weapon, its serial number having been recorded prior to it passing into his custody, and Mr Di Suvero concedes quite frankly and properly that he has no information or basis in fact for alleging in this case that that witness was involved in any switching of the weapons or conduct of that nature.

In my opinion, having regard to the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s138.html), the evidence is admissible as it was not improperly obtained. If it was, I would exercise my discretion to admit it.

The accused also relies on the discretions conferred by [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) and [137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to exclude this evidence. I see no reason to exclude it pursuant to either of those other sections. The evidence is part of the circumstantial case relied on by the
Crown against this accused.

Item 7.5 in the Notice of Motion is, pursuant to [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s86.html), [90](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s90.html), [135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html), [136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) and [137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) and the accused's right to counsel, to exclude the evidence of Dets Nott and
Smith where the accused is alleged to have said to them, "Look, you have got the gun. I'm not saying anything further." This arises in the following circumstances. It appears that the accused attended the Downing Centre Local
Court in relation to a charge of illegal possession of a firearm and it was expected that his solicitor would be in attendance.

In fact, the solicitor was not present. The matter was adjourned, and as the accused was leaving the building he was arrested and charged with the current charge. It is alleged by the police he was cautioned, whereupon it is alleged he made the remark referred to.

The law of this State does not provide for any absolute right of an accused person to counsel before making admissions, although questions of fairness might arise from time to time. If the police had known that the accused was being represented and waited until his legal representative left his company before approaching him, that may have given rise to serious questions under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s90.html), not as a matter of right but as a matter of discretion. In fact, as I have said, the solicitor was not present on that day, although he had been expected.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s86.html) is no longer relied on. [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html), [136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) and [137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) are, and it is submitted that the "verbal" was so feeble it should not be entertained. In my opinion, the real dispute is whether the conversation took place as alleged at all. That is essentially a jury question and a proper matter to be left to the jury subject to the appropriate warnings about evidence that may be unreliable referred to in [s 165.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
Section 424A [Crimes Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) does not apply as it was enacted after this matter occurred.

Item 7.6 seeks to exclude the evidence of the ambulance officers and a witness who will be known as "Miss Brown" that the accused overdosed on drugs on the evening of 24 March 1993, on the ground it is irrelevant and opens up the character of the accused. In the course of discussion the Crown agreed to limit the evidence by omitting the reference to overdose and heroin so that the evidence would be to the effect that the accused was in the flat apparently unconscious, as a result of which the ambulance officers were called. In that way, in my view, the relevant evidence is admitted, and there is no prejudice to the accused by way of suggestion of bad character.

Item 7.7 makes reference to another gun in the possession of the accused, as appears from the statement of Daniel John Rule. The gun was described as a big black gun with a wooden handle. As I understand the evidence, it is not alleged that this evidence relates to the night of the shooting or immediately afterwards. It is evidence that the accused had a gun, not that he had the gun used in the shooting. In my view, the prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighs its probative value and I exclude it pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Similarly, evidence of testing this other gun on one night at the end of
February is not evidence which appears to be directly related to this shooting. In a judgment on 24 March 1998 Grove J similarly excluded this evidence in the second trial. I agree with his Honour's reasons.

This ruling does not refer to evidence by Mr Bicanic of conversations about testing the Beretta pistol a couple of days prior to the shooting of the deceased. Such evidence falls into a different category and in my view is admissible. Similarly, I do not exclude evidence of two guns being present earlier on the evening of the shooting, if that was what appears in Mr
Bicanic's evidence.

Item 7.8 seeks to exclude evidence of an alleged association between Paul
Crofts and the accused after 23 February 1993, the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and it is submitted such evidence by itself does not prove anything. That is true, but the Crown case is a circumstantial case and it is the combination and totality of the circumstances that are relevant. Paul Crofts is alleged to have been the person who actually fired the gun and an association between the accused and Crofts either before or in the period shortly after the shooting is a circumstance which, together with other circumstances, may tend to prove the Crown case.

Item 7.9 seeks to exclude the evidence of ambulance officer Hardie that he observed the accused running a hand underneath the lounge and he was of the opinion that the accused was searching for something. This is at the time whilst he was treating the accused for the apparent heroin overdose and suggests that the accused was trying to locate or move the pistol from where it was under the lounge so that it would not be found. Clearly the evidence of the opinion of officer Hardie is not admissible on any basis. As to the evidence that he observed the accused running a hand underneath the lounge, which by itself could lead the jury to infer he was searching for something, I exclude such evidence in the exercise of my discretion under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) as, in my view (as was the view of Grove J in the second trial), it would be unfair to the accused to admit this evidence concerning his actions at a time when he was in the process of coming out of a state of unconsciousness.

Item 7.10 relates to evidence of the former Det Trevor Haken, to whom I have already referred. It is alleged that at one stage of the investigation he showed the Beretta pistol alleged to be the murder weapon to the accused and to which the accused said, "Yes". Then Haken asked the accused whether he would be prepared to take part in a video recorded interview, which the accused declined in somewhat colourful language. It is submitted that if he declines to be interviewed the evidence should not be admitted as it is not relevant: see [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) The showing of the gun could be relevant as indicating that the accused knew that the police had the weapon, but as I understand the position, there is other evidence to that effect. The word "Yes" in the context is ambiguous. It seems to really be the equivalent of "So what?" It is ambiguous and meaningless and
I exclude it.

I would not have excluded the invitation to take part in a recorded interview and the declining of that invitation because it could go to show the thoroughness and fairness of the police investigation, but the accused's counsel has given an undertaking that he will not allege that the accused was not given the opportunity to be interviewed on 24 March 1993, or that he ever subsequently sought to be interviewed. In those circumstances, it seems to me there is no need and no point in the Crown leading the evidence in the first place, and I exclude it. It may be that for other reasons the credit of Trevor
Haken will be attacked. If that attack takes the form of suggesting in any way, directly or indirectly, that he did not give the accused an opportunity to put forward his version, or to respond to allegations, then this ruling would be reversed.

Finally, item 7.10 seeks to exclude the evidence of Nicholas Bicanic of conversations attributed to Paul Crofts, either when not made in the presence of the accused or if made in the presence of the accused, when there is no alleged admission made by the accused.

I have been referred to the record of interview of Bicanic and also to his evidence at the first trial. It seems to me, as I understand it, at this stage to fall into two parts: firstly, conversations between the accused and Crofts at which Bicanic was present prior to the alleged shooting relating to testing the gun, what they were proposing to do and how they were proposing to do it.
Secondly, conversations between Crofts and Bicanic at which the accused was present after the shooting in which Crofts describes what happened. It is not clear either from his record of interview or from the parts of the evidence in the second trial that I have presently had the opportunity of reading, whether the accused is alleged to have actually said anything on that latter occasion, or merely been present.

In relation to the first category, that is the statements were made beforehand, I am satisfied that statements made by the accused or by Crofts in the presence of the accused are admissible. Those by the accused are admissible because they tend to implicate him directly in the actual shooting.
Those by Crofts appear to be part of a conversation with the accused, to which conversation the accused contributes. They are conversations, in my view, in furtherance of the common purpose and are admissible.

In relation to conversations after the shooting, where anything that Crofts told Bicanic at times when the accused was not present, are not admissible and
I refer in particular to answers 89 to 94 in the record of interview of 6 July
Answers 96 and following would be admissible in proper form. Answers 104 to 107 would not be admissible.

In relation to the transcript of the second trial, the conversation at pp 110 to 112 discussing the plans in advance when both were present are like the earlier answers in the record of interview, statements made in furtherance of the common purpose and are admissible.

The conversation related at pp 112 to 115, as I understand, was between Crofts and Bicanic and the accused was not present and that would not be admissible.
What appears on pp 115 and following, as I understand, is a conversation where
Crofts discusses various matters relating to the shooting in the presence of the accused, which includes reference to the accused's part and using the plural form "We did this". There does not appear to be any dissent from the accused. In my view, this evidence, although not admissible pursuant to [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s87.html), is admissible pursuant to [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s87.html) on the basis that it is reasonably open to the tribunal of fact to find that when the representation was made the person making the representation, Crofts, had an authority to make the representation on the part of the accused, that is, the accused being present and not dissenting in any way from what was said.

So I will admit the conversations before the shooting to which I have referred. I will not admit conversations after the shooting at which the accused was not present. Conversations after the shooting where the accused was present and either expressly assented or did not say anything and did not dissent, will also be admissible.

Items 7.12 and 8 in the Notice of Motion are not pressed.
