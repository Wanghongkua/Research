NEWCASTLE-LAKE MACQUARIE EX-SERVICES MEMORIAL 
CENTRE versus WILHELMINA ALLON 
CA 40691/98 September 1998 
Meagher JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In this application the plaintiff, a Mrs Wilhelmina Allon, sued her employer Newcastle-Lake Macquarie Ex-Services Memorial Centre for an accident she sustained on 21 November 1992 when she tripped. She eventually obtained a judgment from his Honour Judge Phegan in the District Court on 14 August 1998 in the sum of $27,478.71. 
The employer Newcastle-Lake Macquarie Ex-Services Memorial Centre now seeks an order that the proceedings in the District Court be stayed until at least there is disposed of an application for leave to appeal to this Court.

In my view no such order should be made and principally for the reasons referred to by Mr Locke. The only ground of any appeal would be a purely procedural ground. No matter of substance is in issue and all matters of substance have been found by his Honour in Mrs Allon's favour. There is no reason prima facie why that lady should not enjoy the fruits of litigation and there has not even been a suggestion that if leave is granted to appeal and if the appellant is successful in the appeal she will be unable to repay the moneys paid to her.

For those reasons I am of the view that the Notice of Motion should be dismissed with costs and show on the record accordingly.
