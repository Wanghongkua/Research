Judgment 
The proceedings 
This is a statutory derivative action brought by Denis Cassegrain on behalf of Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd ("GC & Co") against two defendants: Claude Cassegrain (who was, at all material times, a director of GC & Co) and Felicity Cassegrain, who is Claude Cassegrain's wife. Leave to sue on behalf of GC & Co was granted to Denis Cassegrain under [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) on 23 September 2008: Cassegrain versus Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2008) 68 ACSR 132 (Sackville] AJ). 
The derivative action was heard by me on 12, 13 and 15 April 2011. While I was considering my decision and preparing draft reasons before departing on long leave, the parties sought an order referring this dispute to mediation in conjunction with disputes in certain other proceedings. That order was made by consent on 8 June 2011 and I proceeded on leave. The mediation did not produce a resolution of the parties' differences. The task of preparing a judgment was taken up again when I returned on 5 September 2011. 
Parties and background 
Denis Cassegrain and Claude Cassegrain are two of the children of the late Gerard Cassegrain and his wife Francoise. John Cassegrain, Patrice Cassegrain (known as Patrick), Anne-Marie Cameron (nee Cassegrain) and Catherine Dunn (nee Cassegrain) are siblings of Denis Cassegrain and Claude Cassegrain. 
For ease of reference, I shall refer to members of the family by their first names only. 
The earliest of the events to which the proceedings relate happened in 1993. It is relevant to record the following: 
Gerard was a director of GC & Co until 29 December 1989 
Patrick was a director of GC & Co until 29 December 1989 
Francoise was a director of GC & Co until 25 September 1991 
John was a director of GC & Co until 12 April 1995 
Anne-Marie was a director of GC & Co until 25 September 1991 and then from April 1995 to 25 June 1998 
Anthony Sarks was a director of GC & Co from 22 October 1998 to 13 July 
Thomas Gerard Cassegrain has been a director of GC & Co since 13 July 2005 
Claude has been a director (and secretary) of GC & Co continuously since .
In each case in which no commencement date is stated, the person's tenure as a director began before 1990. 
The members of GC & Co are Claude, Patrick, Catherine, Anne-Marie, John, Denis and Felicity (who holds shares as a joint holder with Claude). All of those persons were members at the time of the events that gave rise to these proceedings, as were Gerard and Francoise (the former only until his death on 29 October 1993). 
The case in outline 
The case brought against Claude by GC & Co at the instigation of Denis concerns moneys paid by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ("CSIRO") in 1993 upon settlement of certain proceedings brought against CSIRO by GC & Co. CSIRO paid $9.5 million pursuant to a deed dated 27 September 1993 which, with certain other deeds, documented the settlement. Following receipt of this money, entries were made in the books of account of GC & Co to recognise a loan account of $4.25 million established on the footing that the settlement moneys received by GC & Co were, to that extent, received in such a way as to represent a debt owed by GC & Co to Claude. 
GC & Co contends that the division of the $9.5 million in such a way that $4.25 million was attributed to Claude was engineered by Claude and Gerard to bring about an apparent reduction in the proceeds accruing to GC & Co, since moneys received by the company would attract a liability to capital gains tax. GC & Co further says that Claude never had any legitimate claim to the $4.25 million and that he knew this. 
Claude later drew upon the funds of GC & Co and sums were debited to the loan account. It is the contention of GC & Co that Claude did so knowing that the $4.25 million was not in truth his but was the property of GC & Co. 
In 1996, Claude and Felicity acquired real property and business assets (referred to as "the Dairy Farm") from GC & Co. They took as joint tenants. The consideration for the transfer of the land was expressed to be $1 million (this was part of a larger total of $1.3 million for the totality of the assets). The asset was paid for by means of debit to Claude's loan account. Subsequently, in 2000, Claude transferred his interest in the Dairy Farm land to Felicity for an expressed consideration of $1.00. 
GC & Co, at the instigation of Denis, alleges fraud on the part of Claude. Paragraph 14 of the further amended statement of claim pleads: "Claude Cassegrain's assertion against the company that he was personally entitled to $4.25m of the CSIRO settlement moneys amounted to a fraudulent act entirely against the interests of the company. ('The first fraudulent act') 
Particulars i. Claude Cassegrain was aware at all times after 6 July 1993 that the $5.25m/$4.25m split had been devised for the sole purpose of seeking to minimise the company's capital gains tax liability.
 ii. Claude Cassegrain was aware at all times after 6 July 1993 that the $5.25m/$4.25m split did not impose any obligation on the company to pay him any part of the $4.25m.
 iii. Claude Cassegrain subsequently acquired the company's property and money by dishonestly asserting that the $5.25m/$4.25m split created an obligation on the part of the company to pay him $4.25m."
Paragraph 15 of the further amended statement of claim pleads: "Claude Cassegrain's use of his position of control within the company, including his position as a director, to cause the company to acknowledge that it had an actual liability to him of $4.25m amounted to a fraudulent act entirely against the interests of the company. ('The second fraudulent act') 
Particulars i. The plaintiff repeats particulars i and ii in the preceding paragraph.
 ii. Following Gerard's death, Claude caused the company to acknowledge that it owed him the $4.25m; iii. Claude caused the company to acknowledge its liability to him in circumstances where he well knew that the only other company officer, Anne-
Marie Cameron, was not privy to the deal he had made with Gerard in 1993; and iv. There was no intervening honest reason to depart from the position that the company did not owe Claude the $4.25."
GC & Co then pleads in the alternative that Claude committed these acts "in circumstances where any belief that he had that GC & Co and/or his father had agreed that GC & Co would pay him $4.25m of the CSIRO settlement moneys was reckless as to the truth". Particulars are pleaded to which it is not necessary to refer. 
The further amended statement of claim goes on to deal with the Dairy Farm. It is alleged that, on or about 14 September 1996, Claude caused the common seal of GC & Co to be affixed to a transfer (under the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)) of the Dairy Farm land by GC & Co as transferor to Claude and Felicity as transferees. They were expressed to take as joint tenants. It is then alleged in paragraph 18 (omitting particulars): "At all material times prior to and on 14 September 1996, Claude Cassegrain relied on the first and second fraudulent acts to create the false impression that, in exchange for transferring its legal interest in the real property, the company would receive the benefit of a reduction in an existing liability to Claude Cassegrain."
By paragraph 18A, it is pleaded in the alternative the Claude committed the acts in paragraph 18 "in circumstances where any belief that he had that GC & Co and/or his father had agreed that GC & Co would pay him $4.25m of the CSIRO settlement moneys was reckless as to the truth". 
In the circumstances thus pleaded, it is alleged that Claude "fraudulently obtained" the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) transfer from the previous registered proprietor; also that Claude and Felicity were subsequently registered as proprietors of the Dairy Farm land through fraud and that Claude was Felicity's agent for the purpose of registering Felicity as joint tenant of the Dairy Farm pursuant to that transfer. 
The further amended statement of claim then directs attention to a [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) transfer dated 24 March 2000 by which Claude transferred his interest in the Dairy Farm to Felicity. It is alleged that Felicity derived the remaining interest in the land from a person registered as proprietor through fraud and otherwise than as a transferee bona fide for valuable consideration, and that Claude was Felicity's agent for the purpose of registering Felicity as the sole registered proprietor. It is alleged in the alternative that Felicity derived her remaining interest in the land through the fraud of her agent, Claude. 
Breach of fiduciary duty claims are pleaded against Claude. It is said that he owed a fiduciary duty to GC & Co because he was a director and the secretary and that he breached that duty by: dishonestly (or with recklessness as to the truth) asserting against GC & Co that he was personally entitled to repayment of the $4.25 million or some of it; engaging in a dishonest course (or one that was reckless as to the truth) amounting to a conscious misuse of power, to ensure that GC & Co acknowledged the existence of a current liability to pay him $4.25 million; and relying on his non-existent entitlement to receive $4.25 million from GC & Co to obtain a transfer of the legal title to the Dairy Farm from GC & Co.
Point (c) has regard to the fact that Claude effectively drew down part of the "loan account" of $4.25 million to satisfy the consideration for the purchase of the Dairy Farm. 
Felicity is said to have acquired her interest in the Dairy Farm with imputed knowledge of Claude's breaches of fiduciary duty and to have taken her legal estate for nominal consideration subject to GC & Co's equitable claim. 
The relief sought 
GC & Co claims an order that Felicity execute a transfer of the Dairy Farm to GC & Co or, alternatively, a declaration that Felicity holds the Dairy Farm on trust for GC & Co absolutely. 
There is a claim for declaratory relief against Claude - specifically, that he beached his fiduciary duty to GC & Co: by asserting against GC & Co that he was personally entitled to repayment of the $4.25 million or any part of it; by ensuring that GC & Co acknowledged the existence of a corresponding current liability to pay him $4.25 million; and by relying on that acknowledgement by GC & Co to obtain legal title to the Dairy Farm and otherwise to draw against the loan account.
Also sought against Claude are: a permanent injunction restraining him from "repeating" any of these breaches of duty; an inquiry to determine the extent of his drawings against the loan account; and an order that he pay equitable compensation (including interest) to GC & Co.

The allegations of fraud 
Each of paragraphs 14 and 15 of the further amended statement of claim pleads a "fraudulent act" on the part of Claude. But fraud, of itself, does not constitute a cause of action. It is actionable only by reference to its effects. 
Thus, for example, a party induced by fraudulent misstatement to enter into a contract may rescind or, if he or she has suffered damage, sue for damages. More generally, a person induced by fraudulent misstatement to act to his or her detriment who thereby suffers damage has a cause of action in tort for deceit. On the other side of the coin, an action brought on a supposed contract shown to have arisen from fraud can be successfully resisted. 
GC & Co, by alleging fraudulent acts against Claude, therefore does not, merely by that pleading, seek to set up any right of recovery. Its aim seems to be threefold: first, to accentuate the seriousness of the breaches of fiduciary duty it pleads in relation to the creation of and resort to the loan account by Claude; second, to supply an element of critical importance to its claim to recover the Dairy Farm (the need to attract the "fraud exception" to the rule of indefeasibility of registered interests under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ); and, third, to cause any analogy with cases dealt with by the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) to be with a case attracting a twelve year limitation period. 
The Federal Court decision 
Certain of the factual matters pleaded against Claude received attention in a judgment of the Federal Court of Australia (Davies J) delivered on 15 July 1998: Cassegrain versus Cassegrain (unreported, FCA, BC9803240). GC & Co argues that estoppels arose against Claude by reason of the Federal Court judgment. Claude disputes this. He says that the only order of the Federal Court that could be regarded as being, in a relevant way, adverse to Claude was in terms that, first, were too uncertain to sustain any relevant issue estoppel, second, acknowledged expressly or by implication that Claude had an entitlement to the $4.25 million and, third, were qualified by dismissal of all other claims made by the applicants in the Federal Court proceedings. 
There is no dispute that the Federal Court made a declaration as follows: "The actions of the first respondent, Claude George Rene Cassegrain, in treating the $4.25m loan account with Gerard Cassegrain and Co Pty Ltd as his entitlement to be drawn down at his will, in drawing upon the loan account as he saw fit and in causing the passing of a resolution of directors allowing for the payment of retrospective interest thereon were actions which were oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the members of the company."
GC & Co says that the judgment of Davies J "necessarily decided" certain facts in a way that is adverse to Claude in relation to issues in the present case. Claude says, in response, that all that was decided by Davies J is what is embodied in the orders made, being the declaration set out above and, as to the balance of the proceedings, an order of dismissal. 
Beyond his reliance on the prior adjudication, Claude denies the allegations concerning misapplication of the $4.25 million and says that he was entitled to rely (and did rely) on the agreement of his father, Gerard, (the person who, with the acquiescence of all members, exercised control over the affairs of GC & Co) that he was personally entitled to the $4.25 million. 
Claude also contends that GC & Co has been guilty of laches. He and Felicity both invoke limitation defences and Felicity, as regards her present title to the Dairy Farm, relies on the indefeasibility provisions of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) (GC & Co, as I have said, maintains that the "fraud exception" to indefeasibility applies). 
Issues 
The issues for decision affecting Claude are, in essence, the following: 
Is Claude bound by issue estoppels alleged by GC & Co?
More generally, what are the effects, for present purposes, of the prior determination?
If the prior determination does not operate, as between GC & Co and
Claude, so as to preclude the present claims, did Claude fraudulently breach his fiduciary duty to GC & Co?
Has delay in bringing these proceedings worked to the detriment of GC & Co either by reference to the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) or having regard to equitable principles?
Additional issues arise in relation to Felicity and her acquisition of the Dairy Farm. The convenient course is to consider the case against Claude before addressing the separate issues concerning Felicity. 
Evidence 
The case is unusual in that no witness was called in either the plaintiff's case or the cases of the respective defendants. The evidence was wholly documentary. At the conclusion of the hearing, certain matters concerning evidence were outstanding. It is desirable that I digress to deal with them briefly. 
In relation to each of several documents tendered by Claude, my ruling was that the document is a "business record" within [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s69.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), so that previous representations in the document are not excluded by the hearsay rule; but I reserved my decision on GC & Co's application for an order under [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) limiting the use of the material so that it could be used only as evidence of the terms of representations made by one person to another and not as evidence of the truth of the representations. Such an order is said to be warranted because Claude did not give evidence or make himself available for cross-examination. 
That, to my mind, is not, in the particular circumstances of this case, a source of unfair prejudice within [s 136(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) (I did not understand it to be contended that [s 136(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) might apply). It is true that Claude was not a witness and could not be cross-examined. But no one gave evidence in GC & Co's case either and the denial of opportunity to cross-examine worked both ways. In those circumstances, I do not see any good reason to cut down, by reference to the notion of unfair prejudice, the force the evidence is given by [s 69:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s69.html) see Papakosmas versus The Queen  <case>; <case> per McHugh J. 
On that basis, I regard the previous representations in each of the following as not excluded by the hearsay rule and as not meriting any [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) order, so that the representations stand as evidence of not only the terms in which they were made but also the truth of their content:

There are also undetermined applications under [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) in respect of other documents, being written submissions of GC & Co in tax proceedings (tender bundle 1382), decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Federal Court in relation to tax (tender bundle 1486, 1569, 1618), an application for review lodged with the AAT (tender bundle 1595), and a statement of findings of fact by the AAT (tender bundle 1607). 
As to the court decisions, the evidentiary value is fixed by [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s91.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) : the content is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that was in issue in the proceeding. There is accordingly no need for any order under [s 136.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) The position in relation to the AAT decision is the same, given that it is within the definition of "Australian court": Epeabaka versus Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [(1997) 150 ALR 397.] As for the statement of findings of fact by the AAT, the document contains, in [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s91.html) terms, "evidence of ... a finding of fact" in the AAT proceedings so that [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s91.html) applies and there is again no need for any order under [s 136.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) The document containing submissions made in the tax litigation cannot, of its nature, be evidence of the truth of any facts stated and there will be an order under [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) limiting its use so that it is evidence only of the terms of submissions made and not of the truth of those submissions. 
The prior proceedings 
I proceed now to an important matter requiring attention at the outset. It concerns the effect on these present proceedings of the Federal Court determination of 15 July 1998. 
The applicants in the Federal Court proceedings were Patrick, Catherine, John and Denis. They sued Claude (first respondent), Anne-Marie, Francoise, Felicity (twentieth respondent), fifteen companies, including GC & Co (seventh respondent), and Catherine and Anne-Marie as trustees of a family trust. 
The relief sought by those applicants (as ultimately formulated in a further amended application dated February 1998) was as follows: "1. A Declaration that the affairs of ES [Expressway Spares Pty Ltd, the fourth respondent], GC & Co [Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd, the seventh respondent], their subsidiaries and CTK [CTK Engineering Pty Ltd, the seventeenth respondent] are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, the Applicants, or in a manner that is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole of those companies.

A Declaration that the acts or omissions, or the proposed acts or omissions which have been particularised by the Applicants, by or on behalf of ES, GC & Co, and their subsidiaries have been or would be oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminate against the Applicants, or have been or would be contrary to the interests of the members as a whole.
An order requiring Claude Cassegrain to sell of his shares in ES Pty
Limited to the Applicants.
An order authorising and requiring ES to institute proceedings against Mrs
F Cassegrain (including making any application it might be advised to lodge under Section 45D of the Real property Act 1900) in connection with and limited to, the company's occupation and tenure of part of the land described in Folio Identifiers 1/591340 and 2/591340 upon such terms and conditions as the Court may direct including the proceedings may be heard before an arbitrator, any participation by either John Cassegrain or Claude Cassegrain in the institution and conduct of the proceedings shall be limited to their roles as witnesses; and upon any such further terms and conditions as the Court directs.
An order pursuant to Section 260(2)(d) [of the Corporations Law , as then in force] that the following directions be given for the further conduct of the affairs of ES and its subsidiaries - 
ES be directed to enter into an employment contract with Patrick
Cassegrain in his capacity as Managing Director of the company and the
Expressway Spares' business for a term of not less than 5 years, 
Claude Cassegrain to cease to hold office as a director of ES and CV [Cassegrain Vineyards Pty Ltd, the fifth respondent], 
Claude Cassegrain be restrained from directly or indirectly participating in the management or the conduct of the affairs of ES and CV, whether in his own right, on behalf of any other person, or through a nominee who acts on his behalf, other than with the prior consent in writing of all of the shareholders in the company.
An order that GC & Co Pty Limited, its subsidiaries and Endwise
Holdings Pty Limited be wound up.
In the alternative to Order 6, an order restraining Claude Cassegrain from directly or indirectly participating in the management or the conduct of the affairs of GC & Co other than with the prior consent in writing of all the other shareholders in the company.
An order authorising and requiring GC & Co to institute proceedings against Claude Cassegrain in connection with GC & Co's alleged indebtedness to Claude Cassegrain in the amount of $4.25 Million, or any other sum, as a consequence of the treatment of the settlement monies from the
Cassiro litigation (including any transfer of property from GC & Co to
Claude Cassegrain or his nominee) upon terms that the Applicants have the conduct of the proceedings, and upon such other terms as the Court may direct.
An order restraining GC & Co from paying any monies to Claude
Cassegrain or any other person in purported satisfaction of the alleged indebtedness of GC & Co to Claude Cassegrain.
A declaration that the purported allotment of 40 'A' Class shares to
Claude and Felicity Cassegrain by a resolution of the directors of GC & Co made on 3 September 1987 was not made for any valid or proper purpose and is accordingly invalid.
Orders that the allotment referred to in the previous declaration be set aside and for rectification of the register in accordance with that declaration.
An order that CTK Engineering Pty Limited be wound up.
Such order as to costs, and the assets that shall bear the burden of costs, as the Court thinks fit.
Such further or other Orders as the Court thinks fit."
It can thus be seen that there was no claim for a declaration in respect of Claude of the kind that the court ultimately made (see paragraph [29] above). The matter of the moneys received from CSIRO and the establishment of Claude's $4.25 million loan account in the books of GC & Co were the subject of the claims in paragraphs 8 and 9 for an order authorising and compelling some form of derivative action by GC & Co against Claude and an order restraining GC & CO from making any payment in purported satisfaction of GC & Co's alleged indebtedness to Claude in respect of the loan account. Both those claims were dismissed. 
As for Felicity, the only claim in the Federal Court proceedings concerning her was the claim in paragraph 10 concerning the purported allotment of shares in GC & Co. That claim was also dismissed. 
Matters concerning GC & Co and the $9.5 million played only a small part in the Federal Court proceedings. The decision of the court in relation to them, as ultimately reflected in the declaration (see paragraph [29] above), emerges sufficiently from the following passage in the judgment of Davies J appearing after a reference to the litigation commenced by GC & Co against CSIRO (the paragraphs that follow are identified by numbers to assist future reference to them): "[1] On 5 May 1993, Claude wrote a "Without Prejudice" letter to the Chairman of CSIRO outlining the monetary value of the claims made, totalling a little over $56m. The claims included the following: '5 Damage to the name, reputation and standing of GC & Co, Cassegrain
Family name, Cassegrain Group of companies, and Claude Cassegrain and his family as a result of being publicly associated with a failed venture involving bitter litigation and disruption to the family and their associated companies' business activities. $5,000,000' (emphasis added) [2] In the middle of June 1993, a further amended statement of claim was drafted which, inter alia, would have added claims for damages for the loss of reputation of GC & Co by reason of false statements and abuse. However, the draft did not refer to Claude.
 [3] Claude was not a party to the litigation. According to his evidence, at about that time he instructed GC & Co's solicitors, Messrs Garrett &
Walmsley, to add him as a party. However, there is nothing in the documents before the Court which supports that allegation. Late in June 1993, there were settlement conferences. On 2 July 1993, it was agreed in principle that the proceedings and all other claims would be settled on the basis of a payment by
CSIRO of $9.5m, an amount which was just a little less than the amount which
GC & Co had invested in the project and its legal costs in the proceedings, which amounted to more than $2m. The mediator noted a settlement as follows: 'The mediation discussions culminated in a proposed settlement involving a payment of $9,500,000 by CSIRO to Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd. The proposal is subject to approval on both sides. Such approval will be recommended by the legal advisers of both sides.' [4] The lengthy and complex terms of settlement which were formally executed included Claude, who gave a release, as one of the parties. They provided for payment by CSIRO to GC & Co or at its direction of $9.5m. The cheque when paid was paid into the State Bank in reduction of the indebtedness of GC &
Co to that bank.
 [5] At the time when the settlement was reached, the [Income Tax Assessment
Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) had been amended so as to bring capital gains to tax as assessable income but at a reduced rate of tax. There were, however, some exemptions.
S160ZB of the Act provided: '160ZB(1) A capital gain shall not be taken to have accrued to a taxpayer by reason of the taxpayer having obtained a sum by way of compensation or damages for any wrong or injury suffered by the taxpayer to his or her person or in his or her profession or vocation and no such wrong or injury, or proceeding instituted or other act done or transaction entered into by the taxpayer in respect of such a wrong or injury, shall be taken to have resulted in the taxpayer having incurred a capital loss.' [6] Once settlement had been agreed, it was appreciated by GC & Co's advisers that the sum to be received from CSIRO would be likely to be an assessable capital gain in the hands of the company. Mr Claude Griffith, the accountant, considered there might be value if the sum was divided so that some of it was received by Claude in the nature of a payment for defamation.
The possibility of the amount being divided to avoid capital gains tax was noted in a memorandum by an officer of the State Bank on 5 July 1993. On 6
July, Mr Griffith wrote to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Chartered Accountants, seeking advice: 'The compensation has two components to it - Â* Compensation to the company for loss sustained by it on account of the defendants failure to discharge its duty of care to the company.
 Â* An amount payable to the person (director) for defaming the good name of the person.

Would you advise me of the CGT implications on each of the amounts agreed to.
The transactions which give rise to the receipt of the compensation are all post September 1985.' [7] No sums were mentioned. On 9 July 1993, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu advised that the payment would be taxable in the hands of GC & Co but that compensation or damages received by a person in respect of defamation was exempt under s160ZB(1).
 [8] In the meantime, Claude had apportioned the sum to his own satisfaction and had obtained Gerard's agreement. On 6 July 1993, Claude wrote to GC &
Co's solicitors, Garrett & Walmsley, to say: 'This is to advise you that I am prepared to accept in settlement of the proceedings $4.25m as personal damage. This has been discussed with the company at an extraordinary meeting held by the shareholders on Saturday 3
July 1993.

The company and myself will agree on the apportionment of the legal expenses.' [9] On the same day, a letter signed by Gerard and Patrick on 6 July 1993 to
Garrett & Walmsley stated: 'It was resolved at an extraordinary meeting held by the shareholders on
Saturday 3 July 1993 that the following offer in settlement of the dispute would be accepted by Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd - Â* $5.25m to Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd ($4.32 in respect of damages $.930m sale of GC & Co's share in Cassiro Pty Ltd).
 Â* $4.25m personal damages payable to Claude Cassegrain.

The legal costs will be apportioned in a manner that is yet to be discussed between the company and Claude Cassegrain.' [10] Both Gerard and Claude had a keen eye to the reduction of tax. It is probable that Gerard looked upon this split between the company and Claude as a tax reduction device. As the rate of capital gains tax was 30% or thereabouts, one can see that the split, if it was effective, would save GC & Co almost $1.5m in tax.
 [11] When Mr Griffith wrote to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on 6 July 1993, he was unaware of the split which Claude had arranged. It was not arranged with Mr
Griffith's approval. Subsequently, CSIRO refused to divide the payment as requested but it was ultimately agreed that payment of the $9.5m should be made to GC & Co or at its direction. After the $9.5m had been paid to the
State Bank, a loan account was created in the books of GC & Co which showed $4.25m of the settlement moneys as having been received on behalf of and lent to the company by Claude.
 [12] Claude has given evidence that he considered the $4.25m to be his fair share of the settlement and that he could not recall discussing any issue of capital gains tax with Claude Griffith or with his father. I reject Claude's evidence on these matters and also that of Mrs Cassegrain. I am satisfied that the split was agreed to between Claude and his father with a view to reducing the capital gains tax otherwise payable on the $9.5m. I am satisfied that
Gerard and Claude did not at the time regard the sum of $4.25m as Claude's money. In Gerard's lifetime, expenditure from loan accounts did not occur without his approval. Claude could not have drawn down the $4.25m unless his father had agreed to that course. And except as to legal expenses and perhaps other like matters, he did not do so during his father's lifetime. I am satisfied that the $9.5m was paid to GC & Co and received by it in settlement of its claim against CSIRO and that no attempt was ever made genuinely to estimate a sum for any personal claim by Claude including any claim falling within the terms of s160ZB(1).
 [13] Since Gerard's death, Claude has drawn upon the funds of GC & Co both by way of regular living expenses of $3,000 per month and for other personal expenses such as school fees. These sums have been debited to the loan account. These actions were wrong. The appropriate course for Claude to have taken was to arrange for a fair remuneration, not to apply the funds of the company as he chose. I should add in fairness to Claude, that it was originally at least an allegation of the applicants in these proceedings that the manager of a company was entitled to have access to the assets and income of the business when personal need arose. I assume that the family expected
Claude to provide for his living expenses from GC & Co's funds. The purchase of the home and dairy farm would have fallen into a different category where consultation was expected.
 [14] In like vein, Claude purchased a property from GC & Co which was a dairy farm and residence. The purchase price, which amounted to a total of $1.3m approx, was paid by debiting the $4.25m. This was not a transaction of which the approval of the shareholders was sought, Claude taking the view that the $4.25m was his and, furthermore, that he was entitled to receive a home as he has had to sell a home to support GC & Co during the time of its worst financial difficulties. More recently, Claude has had a swimming pool constructed at his home and has debited the cost to the loan account.
 [15] Furthermore, during the interregnum between two hearings of these proceedings, the directors of GC & Co, Claude and Anne-Marie, resolved in a minute, which I cannot presently locate among the voluminous evidence, that the $4.25m had been lent in 1993 on terms as to reasonable interest which
Claude was entitled to claim should he choose to do so. This resolution, of course, had no justification whatever. I am satisfied that there was never any agreement between Claude and GC & Co with respect to the payment of interest on the $4.25m. I am satisfied that neither Gerard nor Patrick, who signed the letter to Garrett & Walmsley of 6 July 1993, looked upon the $4.25m as Claude's money, nor had any conversation with Patrick with respect to interest.
 [16] Claude's actions in arranging for the purported division of the $9.5 into $5.25m for GC & Co and $4.25m for Claude, his drawing upon that sum at his will as if it were his entitlement to do so and his arranging for the passing of the resolution which made provision for the payment of retrospective interest was exemplary of oppressive behaviour. It is a very plain illustration of conduct by a person who, in practical control over the affairs of a company, has acted to benefit himself to the detriment of the other persons who are interested in the company. The mere purported division of the $9.5m may not, of itself, have amounted to oppressive conduct for it was a step taken to reduce the tax liability of the company. It was the subsequent use of the money by Claude as if it were his own and the pretence that there had been some agreement for the payment of interest thereon which constituted oppression of the other shareholders.
 [17] I do not say that, on a taking of accounts, a generous allowance should not be made to Claude for the time and effort spent by him on the CASSIRO project, on achieving the settlement and for participating in the settlement by giving his personal release. I assume that such an allowance would be made.
However, I do not consider it to be the function of the Court in these proceedings to enter into the taking of accounts as between Claude and GC & Co.
 [18] Counsel for Claude has submitted that I should not enter into the issue as to whether Claude's actions in relation to the $4.25m loan account amounted to oppressive conduct. Counsel submitted that the matter was not raised in any formal application which had been filed and that, if it had been raised, other witnesses such as the mediator and counsel may have been called. In my opinion, all counsel in these proceedings were ultimately content to proceed without arguing about amendments to the formal application and this particular issue was clearly raised and litigated. In my view, all appropriate witnesses were called and all relevant documents are before the Court.
 [19] In my opinion, the events which occurred in relation to the settlement moneys provide a clear instance of oppressive conduct and I shall make a declaration accordingly. However, I do not think that I should make any other order with respect to GC & Co. These proceedings were not instituted because of anything that was happening in GC & Co. It was Claude's conduct in relation to Expressway Spares and Cassegrain Vineyards which caused the applicants to institute these proceedings. If the applicants wish to claim that Claude should repay moneys to GC & Co, those proceedings can be taken and an order for the taking of accounts as between Claude and GC & Co can be sought. I do not think that these present proceedings are concerned with that. Indeed, shareholders' rights have never loomed large in family discussions or thought. That is probably why the applicants at one stage sought a declaration that Claude held his interest in the $4.25m loan account on trust for all the members of the family equally. There was, of course, no basis for that claim." 
Res judicata 
It can be said at once that the Federal Court proceedings did not produce any res judicata precluding these proceedings. Given the outcome and the fact that the only relief granted was the declaration set out at paragraph [29] above, this is not a case where "the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has in the former proceedings passed into judgment, so that it is merged and has no longer an independent existence": Blair versus Curran  <case>; [(1939) 62 CLR 464] at CLR 472: ""[I]f the directors exercise a power - albeit in good faith and for a purpose within the power - so as to impose a disadvantage, disability or burden on a member that, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness and fair dealing is unfair, the court may intervene under s. 320."
This passage emphasises a point of particular significance for this case: oppression may occur despite the absence of any transgression of the fiduciary requirements of good faith, proper purpose and subordination of personal interest. A director may act oppressively in the sense relevant to the operation of [s 232](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s232.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and its statutory predecessors yet not breach any fiduciary or other duty owed as a director. 
The distinction is, on my assessment, clearly reflected in the 15 July 1998 judgment of Davies J. He said that the proceedings before him were not instituted because of anything that was happening in GC & Co; and that, if the applicants before him (Patrick, Catherine, John and Denis) wished to claim that Claude should repay money to GC & Co, such proceedings could be taken - one infers that Davies J had in mind proceedings brought by GC & Co, whether or not by way of derivative action, since any claim for repayment could only be a claim of GC & Co. Davies J obviously did not intend to decide whether Claude had breached duties owed by him as a director of GC & Co. He proceeded only on the basis that Claude had "acted to benefit himself to the detriment of the other persons who are interested in the company". Those other persons, not the company itself, were identified as the victims of Claude's conduct held to be "oppressive". 
That those other persons should have been so identified is not surprising when regard is had to the way in which the Federal Court proceedings were framed. The further amended statement of claim, after pleading matters concerning the CSIRO litigation and the decision to settle it, continued: "43C The First Respondent herein [Claude] agreed to accept $4.25 million of the settlement proceeds as being damages for personal injury suffered by himself and further declared himself to hold that proportion of the sum which exceeded his entitlement to an equal share in the monies on trust, in equal shares, for all family members, including Gerard, the First to Fourth
Applicants [Patrice, Catherine, John and Denis] and the Second and Third
Respondents [Anne-Marie and Francoise].

D The First Respondent [Claude] has retained and/or applied the whole of the sum of $4.25 million for his own benefit in breach of the trust relationship between himself and the named beneficiaries referred to in paragraph 43C above and, in doing so, the First Respondent has acted unconscionably."
There was no suggestion of wrong done to GC & Co. 
I have referred at paragraph [43] above to the claim in the Federal Court proceedings for orders concerning the bringing of proceedings by GC & Co against Claude in relation to the alleged $4.25 million debt owed to Clause and the treatment of the CSIRO settlement moneys "(including any transfer of property from GC & Co to Claude Cassegrain or his nominee)". No such order was made and the question of GC & Co's right to recover moneys from Claude on the basis propounded in these proceedings was not addressed at all. 
Issue estoppel 
The next question concerning the 1998 Federal Court proceedings is whether those proceedings gave rise to issue estoppels binding as between GC & Co and Claude in such a way as to preclude re-litigation of the same matters in these proceedings. 
In that respect, the starting point must again be the judgment of Dixon J in Blair versus Curran (above) and, in particular the passage at CLR 531-532: "A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue, so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies. The estoppel covers only those matters which the prior judgment, decree or order necessarily established as the legal foundation or justification of its conclusion, whether that conclusion is that a money sum be recovered or that the doing of an act be commanded or be restrained or that rights be declared. The distinction between res judicata and issue estoppel is that in the first the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has in the former proceedings passed into judgment, so that it is merged and has no longer an independent existence, while in the second, for the purpose of some other claim or cause of action, a state of fact or law is alleged or denied the existence of which is a matter necessarily decided by the prior judgment, decree or order."
Dixon J went on (at 532) to say that only that which is "legally indispensable to the conclusion" is precluded; and that, in matters of fact, the issue estoppel is "confined to those ultimate facts which form the ingredients in the cause of action, that is, the title to the right established". 
Reference was also made in submissions to the formulation by Barwick CJ in Ramsay versus Pigram  <case>; [(1968) 118 CLR 271] at 276: "Long standing authorities, in my opinion, warrant the statement that, as a mechanism in the process of accumulating material for the determination of issues in a proceeding between parties, an estoppel is available to prevent the assertion in those proceedings of a matter of fact or of law in a sense contrary to that in which that precise matter has already been necessarily and directly decided by a competent tribunal in resolving rights or obligations between the same parties in the same respective interests or capacities, or between a privy of each, or between one of them and a privy of the other in each instance in the same interest or capacity. The issue thus determined, as distinct from the cause of action in relation to which it arose, must have been identical in each case. Of its nature such an estoppel must be available to and operative in respect of each party; or, as it is said, estoppels must be mutual."
GC & Co maintains that certain matters were "necessarily decided" as the foundation of or justification for the declaration against Claude ultimately made by the Federal Court (see paragraph [29] above). The matters "necessarily decided" are said to be: that the division of the $9.5 million settlement proceeds between Claude and GC & Co was agreed by Claude and Gerard for the sole purpose of reducing capital gains tax liability of GC & Co on those moneys; the $9.5 million was paid to GC & Co and received by it in settlement of its claim against CSIRO and no attempt was ever made genuinely to estimate a sum for any personal claim by Claude; when the purported division was agreed in July 1993, neither Gerard nor
Claude regarded the $4.25 million as Claude's money; and the purported division did not impose on GC & Co any obligation to pay
Claude any part of the $4.25 million.
The reasons for judgment published by Davies J may be examined in the search for what was "necessarily decided" by the Federal Court. This is made plain in the judgment of Walsh JA in Lombardo versus Stuart Bros Pty Ltd [(1967) 68 SR 159] at 162: "One can look at the reasons given by the Commission to elucidate what was decided and to ascertain what findings were indispensable bases of the decision."
The starting point, however, must always be "what was decided". Resort can be had to accompanying reasons only for the purpose of elucidation. In the present case, "what was decided" is contained within the four corners of the declaration (see paragraph [29] above). The terms of that declaration, looked at in isolation, make it clear that the court decided: that Claude treated the $4.25 million loan account with GC & Co as his entitlement to be drawn down at his will; that Claude drew upon the loan account as he saw fit; that Claude caused the passing of a resolution of directors of GC & Co allowing for the payment of retrospective interest on the loan account; and that the actions in the foregoing (a), (b) and (c) were "oppressive and unfairly prejudicial" to the members of" GC & Co.
The preoccupation here is with the loan account. The main elucidating parts of the reasons for judgment are paragraphs [12], [13] and [15] as set out at paragraph [46] above. Relevant findings in those paragraphs are that Claude and his father Gerard did not, at the time of the receipt of the CSIRO settlement proceeds, regard the sum of $4.25 million as Claude's money; that, in Gerard's lifetime, expenditure from loan accounts did not occur without his approval; that Claude could not have drawn down the $4.25 million without Gerard's agreement; that, except as to legal expenses and perhaps other like matters, Claude did not draw down on the loan account during Gerard's lifetime; that, after Gerard's death, Claude resorted to the GC & Co loan account for regular living expenses and other personal expenses; that the appropriate course for Claude to have taken was to arrange for a fair remuneration, not to apply the funds of the company as he chose; that Claude drew $1.3 million from the loan account for the purchase of the Dairy Farm and did so without seeking or obtaining the approval of the other shareholders of GC & Co; that Claude took the view at that time that the funds in the loan account were his and, in addition, that he had a moral claim to have GC & Co provide him with a home; and that the action of Claude and Anne-Marie, as directors of GC & Co, in resolving that the $4.25 million had been lent on terms as to reasonable interest that he could claim should he choose to do so had no justification. 
The oppression of which Claude was held guilty was, in effect, treating the loan account as his own to resort to as and when he saw fit, instead of maintaining, after Gerard's death, the practice of not drawing on the account without agreement - although with the requirement for agreement having become, after Gerard's death, a requirement for the agreement of the other GC & Co shareholders, instead of the agreement of Gerard. 
Necessarily implicit in these findings, however, is a further finding, namely, that the $4.25 million was not Claude's to deal with as he wished and, therefore, that the so-called loan account was not a loan account at all, in the ordinary sense of a reflection of the company's obligation to pay without question as and when payment was demanded. Had the situation been of that kind, there could and would have been no objection to Claude's making demands for payment and receiving payment. The finding that the $4.25 million was not Claude's to deal with as he wished is the product of three further findings: at paragraph [12] of the reasons: "I am satisfied that the split was agreed between Claude and his father with a view to reducing the capital gains tax otherwise payable on the $9.5m. I am satisfied that Gerard and Claude did not at the time regard the sum of $4.25m as Claude's money." also at paragraph [12]: "I am satisfied that the $9.5m was paid to GC & Co and received by it in settlement of its claim against CSIRO and that no attempt was ever made genuinely to estimate a sum for any personal claim by Claude including any claim falling within the terms of s160ZB(1)." at paragraph [15] of the reasons: "I am satisfied that neither Gerard nor Patrick, who signed the letter to
Garrett & Walmsley of 6 July 1993, looked upon the $4.25m as Claude's money . . ."
It follows that the contention of GC & Co at paragraph [58] above is correct and that GC & Co and Claude are, in these proceedings, bound by the findings (a) to (d) there set out. 
Events leading up to the CSIRO settlement 
The findings just mentioned are of central significance in the resolution of the present proceedings. They are not, however, dispositive and it is necessary to refer to essential matters of fact. 
In approaching the facts, I note the submission made on behalf of Claude that, where issue estoppels arise from findings in earlier proceedings, the party having the benefit of them must either make do with the findings thus made available or abandon them and seek to prove relevant matters afresh. I am not persuaded that this is so. Issue estoppels put established facts at the disposal of the parties and the court. They must accept and have regard to those facts even if some attempt to call them into question is made. But those facts do not constitute the whole of the available facts. It is open to the plaintiff to prove other facts in the ordinary way. 
I therefore turn to the evidence. 
In about 1987, representatives of GC & Co and representatives of CSIRO began discussions about possible application of certain soil improvement technology to land of GC & Co. On 10 July 1987, a written agreement was entered into between GC & Co and CSIRO. A joint venture company called "Cassiro Pty Ltd" was formed. Disputes later arose and, in 1992, GC & Co commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against CSIRO, Cassiro and a CSIRO-owned company (Sirotech Pty Ltd). Shortly afterwards, CSIRO filed proceedings in the Federal Court seeking winding up of GC & Co on the just and equitable ground. 
In the proceedings instituted by GC & Co, a draft pleading was prepared which referred to several matters that CSIRO and Sirotech had allegedly published to various Government persons which, it was said, were defamatory of GC & Co. There were also allegations of injurious falsehood perpetrated by CSIRO and Sirotech against GC & Co. 
Moves towards settlement were in due course made. Claude, as secretary of GC & Co, wrote to the chairman of CSIRO on 5 May 1993 providing "some numbers that support our demands" - apparently demands communicated at a meeting a few days earlier. Various items said to warrant compensation were then set out. They totalled more than $56 million. Among them was: "Damages to the name, reputation and standing of GC & Co, Cassegrain
Family name, Cassegrain Group of companies, and Claude Cassegrain and his family as a result of being publicly associated with a failed venture involving bitter litigation and disruption to the family and their associated business activities - $5,000,000."
The letter concluded by saying: "... we would accept a payment of $15,000,000 tax effective plus legal costs on an indemnity basis ...".
On 16 June 1993, CSIRO's solicitors (Blakes) wrote to GC & Co's solicitors (Garrett & Walmsley) offering to settle the proceedings on the basis of a payment of $7.25 million to GC & Co, subject to CSIRO obtaining Ministerial approval. That amount was said to represent $4.32 million in respect of damages claimed by GC & Co, $2 million for costs and $930,000 for transfer to CSIRO of GC & Co's interest in certain technology. Blakes' letter stated that comprehensive releases would be required from GC & Co and relevant associates, including Claude. 
This proposal was not accepted by GC & Co. The dispute went to mediation over three days. On the second of those days (29 June 1993), Garrett & Walmsley wrote to Blakes saying that they had instructions to seek leave to amend in the first proceeding by adding "counts in defamation and injurious falsehood in relation to communications between servants and agents of CSIRO and Sirotech on the one hand and the State Bank on the other". This was no doubt a reference to the draft pleading already mentioned. 
This letter from GC & Co's solicitors did not refer to any proposal to add Claude as a plaintiff. On the face of things, it was the existing plaintiff, GC & Co, which was the victim of the alleged defamation and injurious falsehood. The draft pleading (never in fact filed) did not refer to any defamation claim by Claude and he never became a party to the Federal Court litigation. 
The mediation resulted in an offer of $9.5 million by CSIRO to GC & Co. This was communicated on 2 July 1993. 
Four days later, on 6 July 1993, GC & Co, in a letter signed by Gerard and Patrick, informed Garrett & Walmsley: "It was resolved at an extraordinary general meeting held by the shareholders on Saturday 3 July 1993 that the following offer in settlement of the dispute would be accepted by Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd: $5.25m to Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd ($4.32 in respect of damages, $.930 sale of GC & Co's shares in Cassiro Pty Ltd).
 $4.25m in personal damages payable to Claude Cassegrain."
Claude himself wrote to Garrett & Walmsley on the same day saying that he was "prepared to accept in settlement of the proceedings $4.25m as personal damage". He added: "This has been discussed with the company at an extraordinary general meeting held by the shareholders on Saturday 3 July 1993."
The meeting thus referred to was apparently a discussion on 3 July 1993 involving Gerard, Francoise, Claude and Mr Walmsley, solicitor. Garrett & Walmsley were thus told by Gerard, Patrick and Claude himself that GC & Co had agreed that $4.25 million out of the negotiated $9.5 million was to pass to Claude. 
On 6 July 1993, Garrett & Walmsley sent a letter to Blakes proposing various matters to be included in the settlement documentation and said: "1. Payment of $9.5 million to occur on execution and exchange of settlement documentation and in accordance with the written authority of Gerard
Cassegrain and Co Pty Ltd ('GC').
In consideration of the personal releases etc by Claude Cassegrain the amount of $9.5 million be paid as follows: $5.25 million to Gerard Cassegrain and Co Pty Ltd ($4.32 million on account of damages and $930,000 consideration for share transfer); $4.25 million to Claude Cassegrain."
At that point, the $4.25 million proposed to be paid to Claude had not been characterised in any correspondence as damages for defamation or damage to reputation. It had not been tied to any entitlement or loss on Claude's part. 
On 7 July 1993, GC & Co's external accountant, Mr Griffith, wrote to Mr Farrell of Deloiotte Touche Tohmatsu. The letter is headed "Re Section 160ZB(1) CGT" and begins by referring to a conversation the previous day in relation to "the effects of [Part IIIA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p3a) on the receipt by taxpayers on compensation for damages". Mr Griffith then set out a request for written advice on capital gains tax. He described the position as follows: "The court proceedings have reached the position where mediation was completed last week and a total sum of money for compensation was agreed to between the parties.

The compensation has two components to it - 
Compensation to the company for loss sustained by it on account of the defendant's failure to discharge its duty of care to the company.

An amount payable to the person (director) for defaming the good name of the person.

Would you please advise me of the CGT implications of each of the amounts agreed to ..."
This advice was given by Mr Farrell in a letter dated 9 July 1993. It was to the effect that, under <case> of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), a capital gain is not to be taken to accrue to a taxpayer by reason of the obtaining of a sum by way of compensation or damages for wrong or injury suffered to his or her person or in his or her profession or vocation; and that there was "little doubt" that payment of compensation to the individual would not be treated as a capital gain. Mr Farrell also advised that it was unlikely that a company would merit this favourable treatment since a company could not suffer injury in relation to "his or her person". 
GC & Co, through its solicitors, then renewed requests to CSIRO's solicitors for part of the settlement sum to be payable to Claude and, for the first time, identified defamation as the basis. CSIRO resisted any such element of the settlement. It said that, even if Claude had been a party to the litigation and had pursued a defamation claim, he would not have recovered more than about $500,000. CSIRO also referred to its responsibilities as a Commonwealth instrumentality and said that it did not wish to be a party to a document that did not fully represent the true position. In short, CSIRO refused to countenance either an apportionment between GC & Co and Claude or any acknowledgement of any claim in defamation on Claude's part to which any part of the overall sum was attributable. It obviously thought that $4.25 million was a ridiculous sum for any defamation settlement. 
The relevant deed ("Deed of Settlement and Release") was executed on 27 September 1993, along with numerous other documents effecting the settlement. The parties to the deed were GC & Co, Claude, CSIRO, Sirotech and Cassiro. The operative provisions run to 54 pages and there are numerous schedules and annexures. For present purposes, the focus should be upon the provisions involving Claude. He is referred to in the deed as "Cassegrain". GC & Co and Claude together are designated "the Cassegrain Parties". Other relevant provisions are as follows: "Cassegrain Claim" is defined as "any present or future or future action, proceeding, claim or demand, which GC & Co, Cassegrain, Cassiro or any
Associate of GC & Co or of Cassegrain may bring against SCIRO or Sirotech or against any Associate of CSIRO or Sirotech, whether or not the action, proceeding, claim or demand is identified or known at the date of this Deed or at Completion with certainty or at all, and whether or not the action, proceeding, claim or demand also involves or may involve some other party, arising directly or indirectly in any way from or referable to" certain stated matters.
Clause 2.1 states that the deed does not become binding on the parties unless and until CSIRO has paid $9.5 million "to or at the direction of the
Cassegrain Parties".
Clause 2.2 states that the $9.5 million "will be referable to" certain specified matters as follows: $8,835,083 to discharge of all liabilities which "any party to this Deed" has to pay costs or damages to any other party to the deed (whether under the first proceedings or otherwise) and the benefit of the covenants and other promises of the Cassegrain Parties under the deed; $503,667 for the transfer of certain rights by GC & Co to "CSIRO or its nominee"; $155,000 for the transfer of certain machinery; and $6,250 for a specified "net difference" in the value of goods exchanged between GC & Co and CSIRO.
By clause 6.1, GC & Co, Cassiro and Claude accepted certain restraints on future activities.
Clause 7 provided for the parties to seek the making of certain orders by consent to put an end to the two Federal Court matters.
Clauses 8, 9, 10 and 11 recorded certain comprehensive releases and indemnities given by and to "GC & Co, Cassegrain and Cassiro".
The deed did not refer to any division of the $9.5 million between GC & Co and Claude or refer to any specific interest of anyone in any part of the proceeds. 
The $9.5 million was paid by CSIRO in accordance with a written direction given to it by GC & Co and Claude. They were the "Cassegrain Parties" and, as has been noted, clause 2.1 contemplated payment of the $9.5 million "to or at the direction of the Cassegrain Parties". The written direction required the following payments by CSIRO: $8,309,502 to State Bank of New South Wales $1,170,000 to Garrett & Walmsley $20,498 to Garrett & Walmsley "on account of income tax calculated for
Cassiro Pty Limited".
GC & Co was, at the time, heavily indebted to the State Bank. By letter to the bank dated 7 July 1993, Claude said that "the whole of the proceeds" of the CSIRO settlement were to go to the bank, after providing for legal costs amounting to $1,374,443.10 as at 30 June 1993. The sum of $8,309,502 received by the bank on settlement was applied in reduction of GC & Co's liability to the bank. Upon receipt of it, the bank released security it held over property to be transferred to CSIRO as part of the settlement. 
The bank had provided GC & Co with funding specifically for the CSIRO litigation. It had done so on the express condition that any proceeds would be applied in reducing GC & Co's debt to the bank. When settlement with CSIRO was imminent, Garrett & Walmsley wrote to the bank as follows by letter dated 27 August 1993: "The settlement sum is payable as damages to both GC & Co and Mr
Cassegrain. Clause 2.1 in its current form is a 'compromise' clause. The parties have decided (to date) not to express the apportionment of that sum between GC & Co and Mr Cassegrain. However, as we understand it, there is no disagreement that a significant sum is being paid to Mr Cassegrain in respect of his own claims identified in the recitals, his releases and the restraints of trade imposed upon him.

The Bank's security at present only covers the damages (net of costs) payable to GC & Co. Our clients intend to pay to the State Bank that amount of damages due to Mr Claude Cassegrain personally (after provision for costs). In this respect it might be desirable for him to execute a Deed of Assignment to the Bank in respect thereof, and we seek your advice accordingly.

The charge from GC & Co to the Bank, and Mr Cassegrain's proposed assignment, will cover all settlement proceeds after payment/provision of costs."
The essential message here was that, although part of the total receipt from CSIRO would be "damages due to Mr Claude Cassegrain personally", the whole (less legal costs) would be received by the bank in reduction of GC & Co's bank debt, with Claude perhaps executing "a deed of assignment" to the bank in respect of his part. 
On or about 31 October 1993, an entry was made in GC & Co's books of account crediting $4.25 million to a loan account in the name of Claude, which account, immediately before that point, reflected a balance of $178,095.16 in Claude's favour. 
Thereafter, Claude drew upon his loan account with GC & Co for personal expenses. Ledger entries relating to, for example, David Jones, St Joseph's College, Peters of Kensington and State Bank Visa bear this out. There are also entries concerning the transfer of the Dairy Farm. These will be examined in some detail presently. 
Subsequent taxation matters 
It is necessary to refer next to certain taxation litigation that began in or about 2000. 
The litigation arose from objections by GC & Co against its taxation assessment for the year ended 30 June 1994. The Commissioner of Taxation ("ATO") originally assessed GC & Co on the basis that the full $9.5 million from the CSIRO settlement should be included in GC & Co's assessable income. An objection was disallowed by the ATO and GC & Co appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Re Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd and Commissioner of Taxation  <case> There was then an appeal by GC & Co to the Federal Court (Lindgren J) on questions of law: Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd versus Commissioner of Taxation  <case>; [(2007) 66 ATR 198.] The determination eventually concerned the status, for tax purposes, of the $8,835,083 that formed the bulk of the apportionment under clause 2.2 of the settlement deed (see item 3(a) of paragraph [84] above). 
These taxation proceedings cannot, of course, be regarded as the source of facts or findings binding on the parties to the present proceedings. Nor, as I have said, can the decisions be called in aid as evidence of facts found in the proceedings: [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) , [s 91.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s91.html) GC & Co, however, places reliance on submissions made in the taxation proceedings. 
Reference is made, in particular, to written submissions filed by CG & Co with the AAT on 10 July 2009. At paragraph 93 of those submissions, GC & Co stated how the $8,835,083 should be apportioned: "The amount of $8,835,083 is to be apportioned by taking into account: allowance to Claude Cassegrain for compensation for foregone remuneration discounted to its NPV as at 27 September 1993: $9.722m (before tax); a deduction from paragraph (a) above for income actually earned by Claude
Cassegrain during the 19 year loss period allowed for by Mr Costello: ($1,220,765); payment to Claude Cassegrain for general reputation damages for his defamation claim: $500,000; payment to Claude Cassegrain for his legal costs: $200,000; payment to GC&Co for reimbursement of its legal costs in the Federal
Court proceedings of $2,503,449."
It was then stated in paragraph 94: 
The combined effect of those amounts is that, by the Deed, Claude Cassegrain disposed of assets valued as at 27 September 1993 at $9,201,235 (sub- paragraphs 103(a) + 103(c) + 103(d) - 103(c) above). GC&Co gave up assets valued at $2,503,449 (sub-paragraph 103(e) above). In consideration for the above they received the apportioned amount of $8,835,083 under cl. 2.2(a) of the Deed."
The references here to sub-paragraphs 103(a), 103(c) and 103(d) are confusing. It seems that the references should be to 93(a), 93(b) and 93(d); also that "103(a) \+ 103(c) + 103(d) - 103(c)" should read "93(a) + 93(c) + 93(d) - 93(b)". 
The proposition advanced by GC & Co was thus that, under the CSIRO settlement, GC & Co "disposed of" assets to the extent of $2,503,449 and Claude "disposed of" assets to the extent of $9,201,235, so that GC & Co's share of the $8,835,083 was the proportion that $2,503,449 bears to the aggregate of $2,503,449 and $9,201,235. 
Particularly noteworthy is the point that the element said to be attributable to Claude for "general reputation damages for his defamation claim" was only $500,000. 
However, the ATO's statement of findings produced in 2000 in consequence of CG & Co's appeal to the AAT contains the following under a heading "Taxpayer's Contentions": "Claude Cassegrain has contended that the $4,250,000 settlement payout was made by CSIRO to settle his defamation action against CSIRO" [original emphasis].
If one then moves to the decision of Lindgren J of 23 March 2007, one finds reference to the need for the applicants (relevantly, GC & Co - Claude was not a party) "to prove that Claude Cassegrain provided part of the consideration for the sum of $9.5 million". Then follows: "They did so, because they proved not only that he gave the surrender of all and any existing claims, but also that he gave contractual undertakings."
The documents concerning the taxation proceedings are of use in this case only to the extent that they record statements by GC & Co (or by its lawyers on its instructions) or recordings by the ATO, the AAT or the Federal Court of things so said by way of submission. It is clear that it was Claude who acted for CG & Co in these respects. 
The significant point is that, as is clear from paragraph [101] above, GC & Co initially took the line with the ATO that $4.25 million of the settlement moneys had gone to Claude to settle his own "defamation action against CSIRO" and that GC & Co subsequently changed tack. Once it had been held by Lindgren J (see paragraph [102] above) that GC & Co had succeeded in showing that Claude had provided part of the consideration for the $9.5 million by surrendering claims and giving contractual undertakings, GC & Co's focus shifted to attributing sums to a range of elements of the consideration so provided by Claude: see paragraph [96] above. The overwhelmingly predominant element then became foregone remuneration with only a relatively modest $500,000 for "general reputation damages for his defamation claim". 
The first Dairy Farm transfer and the consideration for it 
On 2 September 1996, Claude and Anne-Marie, as directors of GC & Co, resolved that the company transfer the Dairy Farm property to Claude and Felicity as joint tenants for a consideration of $1 million; and that there also be transferred to them, for the written down book value thereof, the cattle, milk quota, plant and equipment and other assets of the dairy business. 
A transfer under the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) between GC & Co as transferor and Claude and Felicity as transferees dated 14 September 1996 was executed under the common seal of GC & Co. The transfer was for an expressed consideration of $1 million and the meeting of GC & Co's directors that resolved that the company should undertake the transaction had before it a valuation of the Valuer-General supporting that consideration. There is no suggestion that the transaction was at an undervalue from GC & Co's perspective. 
The transfer was not signed personally by either Claude or Felicity as transferee. It was accepted by the solicitor for the transferees, Mr McCarron. The transfer was registered on 10 March 1997. 
The consideration for the transfer of the land and other property was debited to Claude's loan account, in the sense that the account was adjusted to reflect a reduction in the balance owing by CG & Co to Claude equal to the amount of the consideration. This was in accordance with a resolution passed by the directors at the meeting of 2 September 1996: "RESOLVED that the Company debit the loan account of Claude Cassegrain in the books of the Company for the amount of the consideration payable pursuant to resolutions 2, 4 and 5 hereof and that the debiting of the said loan account shall be full satisfaction of the amounts payable to the Company pursuant to resolutions 2, 4 and 5 hereof and that thereafter the Company shall relinquish all right title and interest in the property referred to in resolutions 1 and hereof."
Resolution 2 determined the consideration for the transfer of the Dairy Farm land at $1 million. Resolution 4 fixed the consideration for the plant, stock and other business assets as the written down value in the company's books as advised by the external accountants. Resolution 5 referred to Claude's reimbursing the company for improvements since 21 September 1995. 
GC & Co's balance sheet as at 30 June 1996 recorded, as a liability, shareholder loan accounts of $4,075,618. The corresponding figure at 30 June 1997 was $2,554,417. Most of the movement of $1,521,201 is accounted for by two journal entries of 30 June 1997 - one for $1 million designated "Sale dairy land to CC"; and the other for $228,922.07 designated "Tsfr Claude's loan a/c to one no". The latter debit entry corresponds in amount with a credit entry with the same designation in a separate ledger account which appears to cover a myriad of personal expenses of Claude. 
I infer from these books of account that, so far as the $1 million consideration for the Dairy Farm land was concerned, the debiting to Claude's loan account envisaged by the directors' resolution of 2 September 1996 was, as a matter of bookkeeping, effected on 30 June 1997. The fact that there was no actual movement of cash indicates that it was only at 30 June 1997 that the financial impact was recorded within (and suffered by) GC & Co. The directors' resolution of 2 September 1996 set out at paragraph [108] above makes clear two important points: first, that amounts were "payable to the Company" for the assets in question pursuant to the earlier resolutions 2, 4 and 5; and, second, that a debiting of Claude's loan account in the way envisaged by the resolution would, in the future, constitute "full satisfaction of the amounts payable to the Company". Pending that debiting and satisfaction, the situation was to be one of purchase moneys payable but unpaid. 
The overall effect was thus that, on 30 June 1997, GC & Co acted upon and gave effect to the directors' resolution of 2 September 1996 concerning debiting of Claude's loan account and thereby notionally paid the relevant amount to Claude (thereby reducing the debt that GC & Co owed to Claude) and that amount was paid by Claude to GC & Co to satisfy the consideration that had already become payable by Claude and Felicity in respect of the Dairy Farm land. It was thus on 30 June 1997 that value passed from GC & Co to Claude by way of debit to the loan account. 
The second Dairy Farm transfer 
A transfer dated 24 March 2000 was subsequently executed by Claude alone as transferor in favour of Felicity as transferee. Again, Mr McCarron accepted as solicitor for the transferee. This transfer was registered on 18 April 2000. The expressed consideration was $1.00. 
Conclusions concerning Claude 
From an early stage in the settlement negotiations with CSIRO, GC & Co, through Claude, made it clear that any settlement sum was to be received in a "tax effective" way. GC & Co was the only plaintiff in the proceedings settled by the documentation of 27 September 1993. There was a proposal or idea within the GC & Co camp (evidenced by a draft pleading) that GC & Co might expand the proceedings to include claims for defamation and injurious falsehood of which it, that is, GC & Co itself, had been the victim. But those claims were never communicated or activated. 
The proposal that the settlement moneys of $9.5 million might be - or, at least, appear to be - split between GC & Co and Claude originated with Claude and was agreed to by Gerard and Patrick (the signatories to the letter of 6 July 1993 to Garrett & Walmsley) and probably also by Francoise (who is said to have been party to the discussion on 3 July 1993). 
The proposal to CSIRO that $4.25 million out of the agreed $9.5 million be paid to Claude and the associated proposition that this was warranted by defamation of him went hand in hand with the obtaining of the Deloitte advice as to the impact of capital gains tax and the revelation that a payment of damages for defamation would very likely not be an assessable capital gain in the hands of the defamed person - provided, importantly, that the defamed person was an individual, not a company. 
Claude nevertheless intended - as no doubt did others within GC & Co - that the net settlement proceeds of $8,309,502 (after allowing for legal costs) should be received and applied in such a way that the whole was applied to reduce GC & Co's bank debt. 
The objective of avoiding capital gains tax was the driving force in the decision to represent that the $9.5 million was split between GC & Co and Claude. CSIRO did not wish to participate in or countenance any such split. Its purposes were sufficiently served by the provision that allowed "the Cassegrain parties" - GC & CO and Claude - to direct the way in which the settlement moneys were to be paid. In the event, GC & CO and Claude did not direct any payment by CSIRO to Claude. The $8,309,502 went to the State Bank to be applied in reduction of GC & Co's debt. The split between GC & Co and Claude was effected wholly within GC & Co in the sense that it never found expression, as a matter of established fact, otherwise than in the books of GC & Co. The request that it be recorded in the CSIRO settlement documents was rejected by CSIRO. The only apportionment in the settlement deed was that described at item 3 of paragraph [84] above. It said nothing about any separate sum for Claude. 
I have said that Claude is, in these proceedings, bound by the findings (a) to (d) at paragraph [58] above. Those findings are, in any event, fully supported by the evidence in this case. In particular, the manoeuvrings of GC & Co (at the instigation of Claude) in the tax proceedings as to the basis on which Claude was somehow entitled to $4.25 million of the CSIRO settlement proceeds show that the original pretext of compensation for damage to reputation was simply an invention by Claude. When it suited him at a later stage to do so, he made compensation for unpaid remuneration and lost income the predominant element of the justification for the allocation of $4.25 million to him. The element for compensation for damage to reputation was, at that later time, said by Claude to be a mere $500,000. It is beside the point that it was found in the tax proceedings that some part of the settlement moneys was attributable to Claude. He relied solely on the supposed entitlement to $4.25 million for defamation as justification for establishing the loan account. Once it is seen that that particular entitlement was illusory and non-existent, the justification is illusory and non-existent also. 
The basis put forward at the time of the CSIRO settlement for allocation of $4.25 million to Claude was simply an invention - an invention that was abandoned in the later tax proceedings. CSIRO did not at any time accept or acknowledge that any part of the moneys it paid to settle the litigation brought by GC & Co was for Claude, whether on account of defamation claims or on any other basis. 
It follows that the establishment of the $4.25 million loan account in the books of GC & Co did not represent the recording of genuine indebtedness of GC & Co to Claude in that (or any other) amount; that GC & Co was never in a position where it was bound to act upon and satisfy demands by Claude for repayments of "loan" out of the supposed loan account; and that, to the extent that Claude received payments from GC & Co upon that supposed pretext, he took moneys of GC & Co that it was not legally obliged to pay to him and which he, in turn, had no legal right to demand or receive from it. The loan account was a false loan account. 
I have also said that there has been no suggestion in these proceedings that the transfer of the Dairy Farm by GC & Co to Claude and Felicity was at an undervalue from GC & Co's perspective. It follows that, had that transfer taken place on a basis that saw Claude and Felicity pay GC & Co from their own pockets for the assets transferred, there might have been no attack on the transaction (I put to one side the self-dealing rule applicable to fiduciaries since, on the pleadings, no issue arises in that connection). The attack that GC & Co mounts in these proceedings is made because there was no actual payment and because Claude, with the concurrence of his co-director Anne-Marie, purported to pay GC & Co by recording a reduction in the balance owing and payable by GC & Co to him in respect of the false loan account. That was, in reality, no giving of valuable consideration in return for the transfer of the Dairy Farm to Claude and Felicity. 
The position is the same in relation to each other occasion on which GC & Co gave value to Claude (for example, by providing cash or paying a personal bill) and there was a corresponding debit to the supposed loan account. Because, as Claude well knew, he had no right to demand or receive money from GC & Co by reference to the loan account, the making and satisfaction of such demands entailed his misappropriating company funds. 
The establishment of the loan account - in the sense of the making of entries in GC & Co's books of account recording a liability to Claude - was improper in the sense that there was no legal basis for any such recognition of indebtedness of the company. But the establishment and recording of the loan account did not, of itself, cause harm to the company in any immediate way. Its asset base remained intact while matters remained at the level of the mere recording of non-existent indebtedness to Claude. It is not shown that any prejudice accrued to the company because of that mere recording. 
Appropriation by Claude occurred when drawings were made, either by actual outlay of funds by the company on the footing that Claude was entitled to them (with contemporaneous or subsequent book entry reflecting a reduction in the supposed debt to Claude) or, as in the case of the Dairy Farm, by recording a reduction in satisfaction of some genuine indebtedness owed to the company, again on the footing of some entitlement of Claude. Where there was an actual outlay of funds (whether to Claude or to a third party for his benefit), appropriation occurred at the time of outlay. In cases exemplified by the case of the Dairy Farm, where no payment as such was made, appropriation occurred upon recording in the books of a reduction in the company's indebtedness to Claude and satisfaction of the concomitant financial obligation to the company. 
As a director of GC & Co, Claude owed fiduciary duties to it (the question whether he also owed fiduciary duties because he was the secretary arises on the pleadings but, because he was a director at all material times, there is no need to address that question). Claude was therefore bound to protect GC & Co's interests and to subordinate his own. In fact, he acted against the company's interests and preferred his own by, first, becoming party to the creation of the false loan account in his favour in the company's books and, second, thereafter taking and receiving financial benefits in the form of payments by the company or reduction of his own liability to the company on the footing that the loan account represented genuine indebtedness of the company to him. 
Furthermore, the evidence shows that Claude acted dishonestly in this respect. He never had any genuine or objectively based belief that the settlement moneys included $4.25 million for him as compensation for defamation. He knew that CSIRO had not agreed to any such apportionment. The apportionment was adopted so as to create a false position from which to argue that GC & Co's assessable capital gain was $5.25 million rather than $9.5 million. In the subsequent tax proceedings, it was Claude who, with an eye to a different tax advantage, seized upon supposed allocations of the settlement moneys as a whole that were entirely at odds with the line he had taken in 1993. His subsequent adoption of those alternatives underscores his lack of genuine belief in the original story regarding compensation for defamation. 
Claude subscribed to the fiction that $4.25 million of the settlement moneys was received for him because that suited the capital gains tax argument that he wanted GC & Co to adopt at the time. He knew when the loan account was established that the reflection of $4.25 million as owing by GC & Co to him was false. His actions in relation to the creation of the loan account were therefore dishonest. When he later drew on the loan account (including in connection with the consideration for the first Dairy Farm transfer), he did so knowing that he had no proper claim upon the company by reference to the loan account. He therefore obtained the relevant money or value dishonestly. 
It follows that, on each occasion on which Claude obtained money or value from GC & Co which reflected in a reduction of the loan account balance, he acted not only in breach of fiduciary duty but also dishonestly. It is therefore correct to categorise his conduct as dishonest or fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty. It went beyond the pleaded alternative of recklessness. 
Consent by GC & Co? 
Implicit in the conclusions just stated is the proposition that GC & Co, as the beneficiary of the fiduciary duties owed by Claude, did not give its informed consent to his actions so as to excuse them in advance. The relevant principles are discussed in cases such as Hogg versus Cramphorn Ltd [[1967] Ch 254] . It is sufficient to quote from the headnote to the report of Winthrop Investments Ltd versus Winns Ltd : "A general meeting of the shareholders in a company, to whom a proper and full disclosure of all relevant facts has been made, may ratify an exercise of power by the directors of that company which constitutes a breach of their fiduciary duty to the company; and may give advance authority for an exercise of power which would otherwise involve such a breach."
Likewise, a general meeting of shareholders to whom a proper and full disclosure of all relevant facts has been made may give advance authority for the giving and receipt of financial benefits the taking of which by a director would otherwise entail breach of the director's fiduciary duty. Thus, although fiduciaries generally should act gratuitously, remuneration not provided for by the company's constitution may be paid and received if voted by the company in general meeting: Re George Newman & Co [[1895] 1 Ch 674.]
In this connection, Claude puts store by the letter of 6 July 1993 to Garrett & Walmsley, signed by Gerard and Patrick, set out at paragraph [76] above. 
That letter refers to "an extraordinary general meeting" of GC & Co on 3 July 1993 being, as I have said, a meeting (or, at least, discussion) involving Claude and his father and mother, Gerard and Francoise, together with the solicitor, Mr Walmsley. There is no evidence that a general meeting was formally convened by notice to all members. Nor have minutes of a meeting been put into evidence. Claude would no doubt have produced such minutes or chosen to give appropriate affidavit evidence had a general meeting been convened and held. 
The fact that Gerard subscribed to the decision of 3 July 1993 notified by the letter of 6 July 1993 is said by Claude to be of special significance. Article 66 of GC & Co's constitution states the voting rights of members at a general meeting. It is first stated that, on a show of hands, every member present in person (or, being a corporation, by representative) has one vote. Then follows this specification: "On a poll every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held by him and the holders of 'A' class shares shall not be entitled to vote on a poll provided always that so long as Gerrard [sic]
Rene Jean Francois Cassegrain is a shareholder in the Company at any meeting of the Company he shall be entitled to sufficient votes to carry or defeat any resolution whether ordinary extraordinary or special despite the fact that any or all other votes on such resolution may be cast contrary to those of the said Gerrard [sic] Rene Jean Francois Casssegrain."
Under article 61, a poll may be demanded by at least three members present in person or by proxy or by one or two members holding at least 15% of the paid up capital; also: "by the said Gerrard [sic] Rene Jean Francis [sic] Cassegrain."
Gerard was living in July 1993. Had a duly convened general meeting of GC & Co been held on 3 July 1993 at which a resolution in the terms notified by the letter of 6 July 1993 had been proposed, Gerard alone could have, first, demanded a poll to prevent the measure being finally decided by show of hands and, second, caused the resolution to be passed. It follows, according to Claude, that Gerard's participation on 3 July 1993 as notified by the letter of 6 July 1993 was tantamount to a resolution of a general meeting of GC & co and that any breach of duty by Claude in relation to the establishment of the $4.25 million loan account was thereby authorised by the company. 
It is, of course, established that the unanimous assent of a company's members to a particular proposition within the competence of a general meeting is as effectual and binding as a resolution duly passed at a general meeting embodying that proposition. The various views regarding the legal basis of this unanimous assent doctrine are discussed at paragraph 7.590 of R P Austin and I M Ramsay, "Ford's Principles of Corporations Law". 
There is no need here to examine the true meaning and rationale of the unanimous assent principle. This is because it has not been shown that there was unanimous assent of the members. The most that has been shown is concurrence by three members - Gerard, Francoise and Claude - who met on 3 July 1993 (and, perhaps, a separate assent by Patrick when, on 6 July 1993, he signed the letter to Garrett & Walmsley); and that one of the assenting members was the member to whom the constitution gave the special powers conferred by article 61 and article 66 as to demanding a poll and voting on a poll. 
Importantly, those special powers were exercisable only at a duly convened general meeting, that is, in a context where all members had been given notice of the meeting and where opportunities for discussion and debate were assured. The meeting or gathering of 3 July 1993 was not of that character. It has not been shown that any member beyond Gerard, Francoise and Claude was notified that a meeting of members was to take place on that day (or that any had waived notice). It has therefore not been established that a forum for discussion and debate had been created. 
One can easily imagine that a proposal that $4.25 million of a family company's funds be directed to one family shareholder to the exclusion of the others would have prompted significant debate. In short, one or other of Gerard and Francoise's children other than Claude might, as a shareholder, have spoken against the proposal that Claude receive value of $4.25 from the company. Gerard's decision whether to exercise his article 61 and article 66 powers might well have been affected by such debate. But, of course, there is no evidence that the opportunity for such debate ever eventuated. It is also possible that the presence of other children would have produced in Gerard a sense of restraint that prevented his agreeing to the giving of a large benefit to one child, either at all or without also giving something to the others. 
It is not appropriate to apply some extension or variant of the unanimous assent principle to the circumstance that Gerard, who would have had the article 61 and article 66 powers at his disposal had a general meeting been convened, was one of the three members represented as having participated in the meeting of 3 July 1993. The plain fact is that he did not exercise the article 61 and article 66 powers because there was no general meeting so that a condition indispensable to the exercise of the powers was not satisfied. Apart from those provisions of the constitution, his position as patriarch and the dynamics of family relationships in the company context (something properly taken into account in the Federal Court oppression proceedings) had no role to play in the proper and lawful administration of the company. The actions of the three family members who gathered together on 3 July 1993 did not amount to a valid and binding resolution of the company in general meeting; nor did they have any effect equivalent to that of such a resolution. 
Another insuperable obstacle confronts Claude's attempt to rely on the letter of 6 July 1993 as GC & Co's consent to or authorisation of what was done. 
The result of the mediation, as notified by the mediator's memorandum of 2 July 1993, was: "a proposed settlement involving a payment of $9,500,000 by CSIRO to Gerard
Cassegrain & Co Pty Limited."
The mediator also said: "The proposal is subject to approval on both sides. Such approval will be recommended by the legal advisers on both sides."
The mediation produced a result involving CSIRO and GC & Co alone. The mediator said nothing about an "offer in settlement of the dispute" involving $5.25 million to GC & Co and $4.25 million to Claude, that being the "offer" that the letter of 6 July 1993 said "would be accepted by Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd". Nor was any such "offer" ever made to GC & Co. CSIRO was astute to avoid any outcome that involved payment by it to Claude. There was thus never any offer in relation to which a resolution of GC & Co in terms of the 6 July 1993 letter could have operated, even if Gerard's assent had had the same effect as a resolution. 
Nor does it avail Claude to point to some other concurrence by Gerard in the course that saw the establishment of the loan account and recognition of indebtedness of $4.25 million by GC & Co to Claude following receipt of the settlement proceeds into GC & Co's bank account. Gerard's special powers under articles 61 and 66 were meaningful only in the context of a general meeting. He had previously occupied a special position under article 85A which designated him managing director for the duration of his tenure as a director and provided that "the management and control of the Company shall be vested in him and the other Directors shall be subject to his control and Decisions"; but Gerard ceased to be a director in 1989. 
There was no consent by GC & Co to the establishment of the $4.25 million loan account in favour of Claude or to the embracing by those operating the company of the proposition that GC & Co owed that amount to Claude in such a way to allow him to draw on the company's funds at will. 
The case against Felicity 
Felicity is the current registered proprietor of the Dairy Farm. She became one of two joint tenants (Claude was the other) by registration on 10 March 1997 of the transfer from GC & Co dated 14 September 1996. By virtue of registration on 18 April 2000 of a transfer dated 24 March 2000 executed by Claude alone as transferor in favour of Felicity as transferee, Felicity became the sole registered proprietor. 
GC & Co contends that the issue estoppels binding on Claude also bind Felicity as a privy in interest; 
Felicity's legal title as one of two joint tenants was registered through the fraud of Claude who was her agent, so that the exception to indefeasibility in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) applies; 
Claude's notice of the existence of a trust in favour of GC & Co was sufficient to cause his co-owner as joint tenant to cause the estate of both joint tenants to be affected by that notice; notwithstanding Felicity's registered title, proceedings lie against her for the recovery of the Dairy Farm because she was registered as proprietor through the fraud of her agent (Claude): [s (1)(d)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ; to the extent that Felicity may rely on the severing of the joint tenancy by the transfer of 24 March 2000 by Claude to her, proceedings for recovery of the land lie against her because she derived her remaining interest (otherwise than as a bona fide transferee for value) from or through a person (Claude) registered as proprietor through fraud: [s (1)(d)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ; because 
Claude acted as Felicity's agent for the specific purpose of registering her title to the land; that agent acquired his knowledge about relevant breaches of fiduciary duty, being the fraudulent acquisition of the transfer from GC & Co and proceeding to register it, during his performance of the very task on which he was employed as her agent 
Felicity acquired her title with notice of Claude's breaches of fiduciary duty.

Privity? 
The first issue for consideration here is whether Felicity is properly regarded as a privy in interest of Claude in the Federal Court proceedings so as to be bound by the issue estoppels arising against Claude. 
As Barwick CJ said in Ramsay versus Pigram (above) at 279, the "basic requirement of a privy in interest" is that "the privy must claim under or through the person of whom he is said to be a privy". Where, as here, the question is of privity between a defendant and another person, the requirement must be that the defence by the defendant is such that it is defence by the privy under or through the defendant. 
That simply cannot be the case as regards Felicity, Claude and the 1998 proceedings. Claude was a defendant to those proceedings because of the position he occupied within and in relation to the various companies, including GC & Co. In defending those proceedings - and, in particular, in resisting the allegation of oppression that was made good against him and reflected in the court's declaration - he was not defending anything in which Felicity had an interest. It is true that the Dairy Farm and the acquisition of it played a part in the court's conclusion with respect to oppression. But that did not change the nature of the defence as a defence by Claude alone in his own interest stemming solely from his position in relation to the company. The title to the Dairy Farm was simply not in issue. 
On this basis, the issue estoppels I have held to be binding on Claude are not also binding on Felicity. 
Agency? 
I consider next the proposition that Claude was (and acted as) Felicity's agent in taking and obtaining registration of, first, the transfer by GC & Co to Claude and Felicity as joint tenants and, second, the transfer by Claude to Felicity alone. 
The evidence regarding both transfers is sparse. On the face of each, it is clear that Felicity did not sign as transferee. In each case, the transfer was accepted by Mr McCarron as solicitor for the transferees or transferee. There is no evidence of the giving of any instruction to him by Felicity in relation to signing of the transfer (compare Davis versus Williams  <case>; [(2003) 11 BPR 21,313] at <case>). 
The only evidence of any relevant contact with Mr McCarron in relation to the first transfer comes from a letter of 27 February 1997 - that is, some five months after the date of the transfer - by which Mr McCarron was instructed to "register the transfer as exchanged". But that was a letter on GC & Co letterhead signed "Claude Cassegrain - Managing Director". It thus conveyed an instruction from the transferor, not either or both of the transferees; and an instruction, moreover, with respect to an already existing document. It related to an already existing document because it referred to the transfer "as exchanged" (in the past) and because the document is dated 14 September 1996. The letter is thus unrelated to the execution of the transfer. 
As regards the second transfer, there is no evidence at all of the circumstances in which it was signed by Mr McCarron as solicitor for the transferee (Felicity). 
In short, there is no basis in the evidence for a finding that, in any aspect of the events concerning the preparation of either transfer, its execution and the processes culminating in its registration, Claude had or exercised any actual or implied authority of Felicity. It was for GC & Co to prove such authority, not for Claude or Felicity to disprove it. 
The significance of the joint tenancy 
Counsel for GC & Co sought to derive assistance from cases about devises to joint tenants in circumstances where one but not the other promises the testator to give effect to a secret trust. Reference was made in submissions to Jones versus Badley [(1868) LR 3 Ch App 362] at 241: "If A. induces B. either to make, or to leave unrevoked, a will leaving property to A. and C. as tenants in common, by expressly promising, or tacitly consenting, that he and C. will carry out the testator's wishes, and C. knows nothing of the matter until after A.'s death, A. is bound, but C. is not bound: Tee versus Ferris <case>; [[2
K. & J. 357]]; the reason stated [Ibid. 368] being, that to hold otherwise would enable one beneficiary to deprive the rest of their benefits by setting up a secret trust. If, however, the gift were to A. and C. as joint tenants, the authorities have established a distinction between those cases in which the will is made on the faith of an antecedent promise by A. and those in which the will is left unrevoked on the faith of a subsequent promise. In the former case, the trust binds both A. and C.: Russell v. Jackson <case>; [[10
Hare, 204]];
Jones v. Badley [L.R. 3 Ch. 362], the reason stated being that no person can claim an interest under a fraud committed by another; in the latter case A.
and not C. is bound: Burney v. McDonald <case>; <case>; [[1
J. & H. 352]], the reason stated [[1 J. & H. 367]] being that the gift is not tainted with any fraud in procuring the execution of the will."
It is the principle of the "former case" (a devise to A and C as joint tenants) that is said to apply here. 
Where two persons hold as joint tenants, they are seised "per my and per tout" ( the correct transaction of which, according to Young J in Big River Timbers Pty Ltd versus Stewart (1998) 9 BPR 16,599, is "for nothing and yet for everything" or "for nothing and for the whole"), so that neither has a separate estate or interest that can be encumbered to the exclusion of an estate or interest of the other. It follows that, if the circumstances of the devise or conveyance to them as joint tenants are such as to cause the conscience of one to be bound so as to create an obligation of a kind that would give rise to an equitable encumbrance on a sole owner's title, the equitable encumbrance affects the title held by both joint tenants together. If it were otherwise, equity would fail in its task. Of course, the position is different if, after the two have taken as joint tenants, one acts alone in a way that would create an encumbrance. In that case, the co-owner in question acts inconsistently with the joint tenancy and shows an intention to sever it. 
The notion, as it relates to notice as such, is explained in Freeman versus Laing (above), a case concerning the right to tack a subsequent advance. Byrne J said at 358-9: "In the case of a mortgage of real estate to joint tenants to secure a debt due to them jointly, it cannot be said as against strangers that any one portion of the security or of the debt belongs to any one of the mortgagees: each is entitled to the whole; and if notice of a second incumbrance be given to any one of them, that appears to me, by creating an equity against one in respect of the whole, to prevent any tacking, which in such a case must be of the further advances to the whole subsisting original debt."
Here, GC & Co contends (and I have found), Claude was guilty of fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty against GC & Co in connection with the acquisition of the Dairy Farm by Felicity and him as joint tenants, in that, t o satisfy the unpaid consideration for the transfer, Claude drew on the false loan account and thereby obtained from GC & Co value to which he had no entitlement. The situation was thus, in substance, akin to one in which property was purchased with stolen money, albeit that Felicity may not have known at the time that the particular financial advantage had been improperly obtained by Claude. The circumstances were, in that way, the same as those in Heperu Pty Ltd versus Belle  <case>; [(2009) 76 NSWLR 230] where a husband paid into his wife's bank account funds misappropriated by him (she being unaware of the misappropriation at the time), from where they were expended for his benefit and also for hers. As Allsop P said at [93] with the concurrence of Campbell JA and Handley AJA: "The well-known principle is that a person entirely innocent of a fraud who comes to know that he or she has received and still retains the proceeds of, or taken advantage of, a fraud to which he or she was not party, cannot knowingly seek to retain those proceeds or that advantage, without, in effect, becoming a party to that fraud and liable accordingly: Black versus S Freedman & Company , per Griffith CJ (at 109), per Barton J (at 110), per O'Connor
J (at 110-111)."
In the present case, the value improperly obtained by Claude is now represented by Felicity's sole title to the Dairy Farm. There is no allegation that Felicity was a participant in or had notice of Claude's fraud at the time the Dairy Farm passed to the two of them as joint tenants. There is accordingly no claim of liability on Felicity's part under either limb of Barnes versus Addy [(1874) LR 9 Ch App 244] . But Felicity may have become aware subsequently that she had received the proceeds of fraud (she was obviously aware of the allegations in these proceedings) and that may be sufficient, in the eyes of equity, to cause Felicity to be accountable to GC & Co. 
It was clear in Heperu Pty Ltd versus Belle, however, (see [167]) that " no issue was raised at trial or on appeal by way of defence referable to any effect of the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)." Felicity does raise such an issue. She says that [s 42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) precludes recognition, as against her, of any interest of G C & Co detracting from the full and unencumbered registered title she now enjoys on the face of the register. [Section 42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) [Section 42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html), so far as relevant to this case, is in these terms: "Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or interest which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority, the registered proprietor for the time being of any estate or interest in land recorded in a folio of the Register shall, except in case of fraud , hold the same, subject to such other estates and interests and such entries, if any, as are recorded in that folio, but absolutely free from all other estates and interests that are not so recorded . . . " [emphasis added].
I am of the opinion that the operation of <case> is such that Felicity today holds free from any interest of GC & Co sourced in Claude's fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty and that the "fraud" exception to that section does not operate to detract from Felicity's current registered title. 
In the particular statutory context, "fraud" is "to be construed as meaning something more than mere disregard of rights of which the person sought to be affected had notice, and as importing something in the nature of personal dishonestly or moral turpitude": Stuart versus Kingston  <case>; [(1923) 32 CLR 309] at 210 cited with approval in Frazer versus Walker [1967] 1 AC 569, declared that "fraud" in this context means "actual fraud, i.e, dishonesty of some sort" and went on to say that "the fraud which must be proved in order to invalidate the title of a registered purchaser ... must be brought home to the person whose registered title is impeached or to his agents". 
Equitable fraud, in the form of an impingement upon conscience giving rise to an equitable interest, is, of itself, insufficient to activate the "fraud" exception to <case> - although, of course, some circumstances of equitable fraud will, on their facts, involve actual dishonesty of the kind with which the statutory exception is concerned. 
In the particular statutory context, there is no meaningful room for any concept of imputed dishonesty or imputed moral turpitude, unless the perpetrator is an agent of the person whose registered title is sought to be impeached. To the extent that Claude may have been guilty of fraud in the <case> sense, the mere fact that Felicity took under the first transfer as joint tenant with him (or even was aware of his dereliction), while it may have fixed her with notice of some kind, does not warrant any conclusion that the title she now has as sole registered proprietor is tainted by "dishonesty on the part of the registered proprietor in securing [her] registration as proprietor". 
The estate now vested in Felicity arose in consequence of the registration of the second transfer, that is, the transfer by Claude to Felicity dated 24 March 2000 and registered on 18 April 2000. It is that estate that, in accordance with <case>, she now holds free from all unregistered interests "except in case of fraud". Importantly, Felicity's present estate derived from registration of the second transfer is distinct from the estate she had as one of two registered proprietors holding as joint tenants after registration of the first transfer on 10 March 1997. The effect of the second transfer and its registration was to extinguish both Claude's interest as one of two joint tenants and Felicity's interest as one of two joint tenants; and to cause to arise in Felicity as sole registered proprietor a "new and different indefeasible title for the lot", that is, a title distinct from both the pre-existing interests: Peldan versus Anderson  <case>; <case>: "[T]here is no fraud for the purposes of <case> if a person does no more than to acquire title and become the registered proprietor with notice of a prior unregistered interest, and assert that his title is free of that interest:
Mills versus Stokman  <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 61], at 78 per Kitto J; the Leros case, 174 CLR at 418 per
Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ; Friedman versus Barrett [[1962] Qd R ."]
From Felicity's viewpoint, there could have been, at most, attribution to her of notice of matters involving Claude's wrongdoing that bound her conscience so as to produce in GC & Co an equitable interest that <case> does not allow to encumber her title. Even if she thus took with notice of such an interest, the "fraud" exception to <case> does not preclude her asserting against GC & Co a registered title free of that interest. 
The fact that Felicity gave no valuable consideration for the second transfer does not affect the protection given to her by <case>: Bogdanovic versus Koteff [(1988) 12 NSWLR 472.] [Section 118(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) [Section 118(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) provides: "Proceedings for the possession or recovery of land do not lie against the registered proprietor of the land, except as follows: . .
 proceedings brought by a person deprived of land by fraud against: a person who has been registered as proprietor of the land through fraud, or a person deriving (otherwise than as a transferee bona fide for valuable consideration) from or through a person registered as proprietor of the land through fraud."
Because the fraud relied upon is the fraud of Claude and the attempt by GC & Co to prove that Claude was Felicity's agent in relevant respects has failed, there is no basis for a finding of fraud on the part of Felicity. She is now (and has been since 18 April 2000) the sole registered proprietor. Because there was no fraud by her, she cannot be said to have been "registered as proprietor through fraud" [(s 118(1)(d)(i)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) That leaves the possibility that Felicity derived title "from or through a person registered as proprietor of the land through fraud" [(s 118(1)(d)(ii)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html)
Reference has been made to the "new and different indefeasible title" that arose in Felicity through registration of the second transfer. Felicity must be accepted as a person "deriving" that new and different title "from or through" Claude, since, had it not been for the effect of the second transfer (by Claude to Felicity), Felicity would not have attained the new and different title. Furthermore, since the transfer registration of which created Felicity's new and different title was for a purely nominal consideration of $1.00, she was not, in relation to the acquisition of that interest, "a transferee . . . for valuable consideration". 
Notwithstanding that the elements on which [s 118(1)(d)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) depends may be, to that extent, satisfied, one important thing is lacking. Claude, the person "from or through" whom Felicity derived her interest, was not "registered as proprietor of the land through fraud". These are the operative words of the section. Their focus is exclusively on the process by which registration as proprietor was achieved and the question whether that process was achieved by fraud. This is the effect of the words "registered . . . through". [Section 118(1)(d)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) thus deals with a much narrower and more specific subject-matter than the "except in case of fraud" exception in [s 42.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html)
The process by which Claude came to be registered as one of two proprietors involved the lodgment of a transfer for registration, followed by registration itself. The transfer was regularly executed under the common seal of GC & Co. It was a genuine instrument, regular on its face and suitable to be registered. There is nothing calling in question the integrity of the transfer or of the registration process to which it was subjected following its lodgment. The process by which the registration of Claude as a registered proprietor was achieved was not attended by fraud. The fact that he had wrongfully drawn funds from GC & Co to satisfy the consideration expressed in the transfer (or, perhaps more accurately, that he gave illusory consideration by reference to the false loan account) is remote from the process of registration and therefore beside the point. 
It follows that, if and to the extent that these proceedings, as they affect Felicity, are "[p]roceedings for the possession or recovery of land", [s 118(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) precludes their being brought. 
The position reached 
GC & Co has made good the allegation that Claude breached his fiduciary duty to GC & Co by: asserting against GC & Co that he was personally entitled to payment of $4.25 million in consequence of the CSIRO settlement; ensuring that GC & Co acknowledged the existence of a corresponding current liability to pay him $4.25 million; and relying on that acknowledgment to obtain money or value from GC & Co.
Subject to the question of defences about to be mentioned, GC & Co is entitled to appropriately framed declaratory relief accordingly, as well as an injunction restraining future resort to the loan account and an order for an inquiry to establish the amount of all money and value obtained by Claude in breach of duty. 
Subject to the same qualification, there should also be an order that Claude pay equitable compensation to GC & Co, with the quantum to be determined after inquiry made in accordance with the court's order. There will be a need for further submissions as to the precise method of assessing equitable compensation having regard to both accrual of " value to the misappropriating fiduciary" (to quote words used by Thomas JA in Ferrari versus Ferrari Investments (Townsville) Pty Ltd [[2000] 2 Qd R 359] and financial detriments to GC & Co resulting, in each case, from Claude's recourse to the supposed loan account. 
GC & Co has not established an entitlement to the relief it claims against Felicity in relation to the Dairy Farm. 
It remains to consider the availability of defences based on delay. 
Delay 
It is unnecessary to consider time-based defences raised by Felicity. I must, however, deal with time-based defences raised by Claude. 
Claude points to the fact that these proceedings were commenced by statement of claim filed on 11 September 2008. Although judgment on the <case> application was delivered only on 23 September 2008, Sackville AJ made consent orders on 5 September 2008 granting leave on the footing that it was to be revoked if the ultimate decision was that the application for leave should be dismissed. 
The substantive relief to which GC & Co has shown an entitlement, as against Claude, is equitable relief by way of declaration and an order for the payment of equitable compensation. The basis for such relief is not the mere establishment of the loan account in the books of GC & Co but the obtaining of money or value by Claude from GC & Co by resort to the loan account and in exercise of Claude's asserted entitlement to draw upon the account. 
Delay and the passage of time are relevant to both a defence of laches raised by Claude and the potential operation by analogy of provisions of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). 
It is significant that the present action is brought with leave granted under [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) . One of the matters on which the court must be satisfied in order to grant such leave is that the company itself will not bring the proceedings: [s 237(2)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) The court was so satisfied upon the hearing of the application for leave. Sackville AJ said ([2008] NSWSC 976; <case>; <case>): "The Company will not itself agree to bring proceedings against Claude because he controls the voting shares in the Company and will not authorise proceedings against himself. Accordingly, the requirement in [s (2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) is satisfied."
That finding must be considered in light of certain background facts. When the loan account was established in 1993 following the CSIRO settlement, Claude and John were the only directors of GC & Co and Gerard was in the background exercising his paternal influence. When, in 1996-7 the Dairy Farm was transferred to Claude and Felicity as joint tenants and Claude resorted to the loan account to satisfy the consideration, Claude and Anne-Marie were the only directors of GC & Co. It was they who passed the relevant board resolutions and affixed GC & Co's common seal to the transfer. Anne-Marie was appointed a director on 12 April 1995 and ceased to hold office on 25 June 1998, after which, it appears, Claude was in office alone until 22 October 1998 when A B Sarks was appointed a director. Sarks held office until 13 July 2005, at which point T G Cassegrain was appointed. 
There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that John played any active role in relation to the CSIRO settlement and the establishment of the loan account, even though he was a director at the time. The functionaries in that connection were Claude and Gerard, but Gerard died on 29 October 1993, so that his knowledge of relevant matters was then lost. The only repository of such knowledge on the board of directors thereafter was Claude himself. 
By mi-1997, however, all relevant family members were aware of the $4.25 million loan account established after receipt of the CSIRO settlement proceeds and the subsequent transfer of the Dairy Farm to Claude and Felicity. 
The awareness just mentioned is made clear by documents related to the Federal Court proceedings. An amended pleading produced in May 1997 referred to the CSIRO settlement and to Claude's having "agreed to accept $4.25 million of the settlement proceeds as being damages for personal injury suffered by himself"; and to Claude's having "declared himself to hold that proportion of the sum which exceeded his entitlement to an equal share in the moneys on trust, in equal shares, for all family members, including Gerard, the First to Fourth Applicants [Patrick, Catherine, John and Denis] and the Second and Third Respondents [Anne-Marie and Francoise]". 
In the course of submissions before Davies J on 20 October 1997 concerning an application to amend, there was reference by counsel for Patrick, Catherine, John and Denis to a claim for a declaration that Claude held the $4.25 million in trust and "the need to identify the extent to which the claim of 4.25 [sic] now made by Claude for himself is a proper extraction from the company's assets". There was also reference to an allegation that "Mr Claude Cassegrain improperly transferred assets to himself and his wife", that there was no real or genuine transaction in that respect, that the supposed transfer "purported to confer benefits in breach of his fiduciary duty" and that the true value of the assets concerned was more than the $1.3 million represented by the documents. Davies J said, at that point, "This 1.3 million came off the loan account I take it, did it?" Counsel for Claude and the other respondents answered in the affirmative. 
On 20 October 1997 Davies J granted leave to file a further amended statement of claim. It contained fully pleaded allegations in relation to the matters that had been referred to briefly in court on that day. In particular, it was alleged that, in order to minimise tax payable by CG & Co, Gerard and Patrick, at the direction of Claude, had instructed the accountants that the CSIRO settlement moneys were to be split so that Claude would receive $4.25 million purportedly as damages for injury to his reputation; that, after receipt of the $9.5 million by GC & Co, the $4.25 million loan account in favour of Claude was raised in GC & Co's books even though no loan had been made; that Claude thereby obtained benefit for himself in breach of his fiduciary duty; that, in or about July 1997, Claude caused the Dairy Farm to be transferred to himself and Felicity; and that the transfer caused loss to GC & Co, was carried out in breach of
Claude's fiduciary duties as a director and was not in the best interests of the company as a whole.
The claim based on these allegations appeared in the further amended application of February 1998 (see paragraph [43] above). 
Denis, who has brought these present proceedings on behalf of GC & Co, was one of the applicants in the Federal Court proceedings. The others were, as I have noted, Patrick, Catherine and John. Anne-Marie (co-director with Claude from 12 April 1998 to 25 June 1998) was a respondent. 
It is thus clear that, in the second half of 1997, Denis, Patrick, Catherine, John and Anne-Marie were all fully aware of the facts concerning the CSIRO settlement proceeds, the $4.25 million loan account and the Dairy Farm transfer to Claude and Felicity that form the basis for these present proceedings. Moreover, all of them except Anne-Marie had explicitly alleged breaches of duty by Claude that correspond with (or are closely analogous with) those at the centre of the present litigation. And all of them were aware of the judgment of 15 July 1998 in which Davies J, referring to the events concerning the CSIRO settlement moneys, and their application, said: "If the applicants wish to claim that Claude should repay moneys to GC &
Co, those proceedings can be taken and an order for the taking of accounts as between Claude and GC & Co can be sought. I do not think that these present proceedings are concerned with that."
In the period between the exchanges in court on 20 October 1997 and 25 June 1998, Claude and Anne-Marie were the only directors of GC & Co. The board thus constituted would not, as a practical matter, have caused the company to sue Claude, particularly since he and Anne-Marie were aligned on the same side of the Federal Court proceedings. After 25 June 1998, and until 22 October 1998, Claude alone was in office as a director and unable to function as a board (even if minded to cause the company to sue him). From 22 October 1998 until 13 July 2005, the board consisted of Claude and A Sarks, while from 13 July 2005, the directors were Claude and T G Cassegrain. Such a two-person board could not have caused the company to sue Claude except with Claude's concurrence which would not have been forthcoming. 
From at least mid-1997, it must have been obvious to the other shareholders of GC & Co - in particular, Denis, Patrick, Catherine and John - that, if there were to be any meaningful move to assert GC & Co's rights of recovery against Claude, it would be necessary for one or more of the shareholders to take the initiative. 
The statutory derivative action procedure now provided for in [Part 2F.1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p2f.1) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) has been available since December 1999 by virtue of amendments made to the Corporations Law by the [Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/clerpa1999375/) (Cth). Before that, a member could bring a derivative action for the company's benefit only under recognised exceptions to the rule in Foss versus Harbottle <case>; [(1843) 2 Hare 461]
None of the shareholders acted until 18 December 2007 when Denis filed the application upon which Sackville AJ made the orders of September 2008 granting leave under <case> for him to bring proceedings on behalf of GC & Co against Claude. None of the other shareholders joined in that application, although Patrick, Catherine and John gave certain undertakings supporting Denis for the purposes of a security for costs application; also, they were described by Sackville AJ as "supporting" Denis's <case> application. 
Why did Denis wait ten years? The answer is found in the judgment of Sackville AJ of 25 September 2008: "I also accept Denis' evidence that the primary reason for the very long delay in bringing the leave application was that the Company was in receivership from 1999 until the end of 2004 and that he considered that proceedings were not feasible during that period."
An ASIC extract in evidence shows that Mr Smith and Mr Kershaw were receivers and managers of GC & Co from 15 June 1999 to 21 December 2004. They were appointed by the Commonwealth Bank, a secured creditor. Since all registered charges recorded are described as "fixed/floating", it may be accepted that, during the period of receivership, decision-making with respect to any right of action GC & Co had against Claude was in the hands of the receivers. The prospects of leave being granted for a member to bring a derivative action while the company was in that state would be very remote. The "best interests" criterion in <case>(c) would, in the particular circumstances, direct attention to the agency and decision-making role of the receivers and treat as predominant their function of serving the interests of the secured creditor, with the normal decision-making organs superseded although not destroyed: Hawkesbury Development Pty Ltd versus Landmark Finance Pty Ltd [(1969) 92 WN 199] at 209. 
The question of delay in commencing these proceedings should therefore be approached on the basis that the board of directors of GC & Co was, at all relevant times, constituted in such a way as to make it impossible, in every practical sense, for GC & Co to commence proceedings against Claude through a decision of the directors; 
Denis, Patrick, Catherine and John were aware, from at least mid-1997, of all facts relevant to the institution of the proceedings; from mid-1997 to 15 June 1999 (when receivers were appointed) it was open to any one or more of Denis, Patrick, Catherine and John to take steps to initiate a general law derivative action asserting GC & Co's causes of action against Claude; the practical ability of those persons to take such steps came to an end on 15 June 1999; after 21 December 2004, however, it was again open to any one or more of
Denis, Patrick, Catherine and John to seek leave under <case> to bring a statutory derivative action against Claude.
It follows that operative delay was confined to the period mid-1997 to 15 June 1999 and the period 21 December 2004 to the filing of Denis's <case> application on 18 December 2007. 
The Significance of Delay 
The remedies to which GC & Co has established an entitlement against Claude (subject to any defence based on delay) are, as I have said, equitable remedies. The first question to be addressed in relation to delay is therefore whether the equitable doctrine of laches operates as a discretionary bar to recovery. If that bar does not operate might it be appropriate to consider some analogy with a bar created by the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). 
That this is an appropriate approach is, I think, indicated by Williams versus Minister, [Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) <case>. The [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) itself states, in [s 9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s9.html), that nothing in the Act affects the rules of equity concerning the refusal of relief on the ground of laches, acquiescence or otherwise, thus implying that the applicability of those rules should be considered first. 
Laches 
A succinct summary of principle appears in the judgment of Owen J in Bell Group Ltd versus Westpac Banking Corporation (No 9)  <case>; (2008) 39 WAR 1 at [9303] - [9308]: "The equitable defence of laches follows the maxim that the law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep over their rights. As Lord Blackburn said in Erlanger versus New Sombrero Phosphate Co [(1878) 3 AC 1218] ; Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co [(1878) 3 AC 1218] at 1279 (approved by Kitto J in Lamshed versus Lamshed [(1963) 109 CLR 44]; Lamshed v
Lamshed <case>; [(1963) 109 CLR 440] at 453-454): 'A Court of Equity requires that those who come to it to ask its active interposition to give them relief, should use due diligence, after there has been such notice or knowledge as to make it inequitable to lie by.' 
Thus laches provides a bar to the grant of relief where there has been an unreasonable delay in the commencement or prosecution of proceedings and where the delay renders it unjust in all the circumstances to grant the relief sought.

Mere delay is insufficient to invoke the laches defence, even in cases of 'spectacular delays'. For example, in Burroughes versus Abott [[1922] 1 Ch ];
Burroughes versus Abott [[1922] 1 Ch 86], the court granted rectification of an instrument after a delay of twelve years. A mortgagor's redemption suit was held not time-barred in Weld versus Petre [[1929] 1 Ch 33]; Weld versus Petre [[1929] 1 Ch 33] despite a delay of twenty-six years. Finally, in Fitzgerald versus Masters <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 420], the High Court granted specific performance twenty-six years after the cause of action arose.

The point of time from which the reasonableness of the delay is assessed is, prima facie, the time when the plaintiff became aware of facts that give rise to the availability of equitable relief. In Meagher, Gummow & Lehane at [36-085], the authors commented that where a plaintiff has knowledge of the relevant facts, he or she is presumed to have knowledge of his or her rights to a cause of action. They go on to say that the 'availability of the means of knowledge is as good as knowledge'. These propositions were confirmed in:
Savage versus Lunn [[1998] NSWCA 204] at 5-6;
Savage versus Lunn [[1998] NSWCA 203] at 59-60 (per
Handley and Sheller JJA and Sheppard AJA).

Unreasonable delay alone will not be sufficient to attract the laches defence.
The delay must render it unjust in the all circumstances of the case for relief to be granted (Spry, Equitable Remedies , 6th edition, 2001 at 43).
The doctrine can be relied upon where a plaintiff, in delaying to take or pursue an action, has: acquiesced to the defendant's conduct; or caused the defendant or a third party to alter their position in reasonable reliance on the plaintiff's acceptance of the status quo or otherwise permitted a situation to arise that would be unjust to disturb.

The question is whether the balance of justice favours granting the remedy or withholding it. In Lindsay Petroleum Co versus Hurd [(1874) LR 5 PC 221];
Lindsay Petroleum Co versus Hurd [(1874) LR 5 PC 221];
Lindsay Petroleum Co versus Hurd [(1874) LR 5 PC 221], the
Privy Council looked at, among other things, the nature of the claim, the nature of the property to which the claim relates, the identity of the party against whom the defence is raised, the length of the delay, the extent to which the delay has prejudiced the defendant and the acts of each party during the delay."
There are thus two central questions: first, whether the plaintiff has been guilty of unreasonable delay in bringing proceedings; and, second, whether any such unreasonable delay makes it unreasonable, in the particular circumstances, for the relief to be granted because the plaintiff has either acquiesced in the defendant's conduct or caused the defendant or someone else to change their position in reasonable reliance on the plaintiff's acceptance of the status quo or otherwise permitted to arise a situation that it would be unjust to disturb. 
Some further facts 
It is necessary, against this background, to consider yet further factual matters. 
On 24 August 1998, John, Catherine and Patrick gave what purported to be a notice convening a general meeting of GC & Co for 15 September 1998. Its efficacy as a notice of meeting and the question whether proposed resolutions notified lay within the competence of a general meeting do not matter. Its significance lies in the concerns it embodies. The proposed resolutions included the following: "That Claude Cassegrain and Anne-Marie Cameron being the Directors of
GC&Co provide a written report to the meeting listing, identifying and explaining basis of each movement in all company loan accounts of Claude
George Rene Cassegrain from 1 September 1993 to 15 September 1998." "The Directors of GC&Co advise the meeting whether they have taken steps to rectify the loan account or to require payment by Claude Cassegrain to
GC&Co of the amount of the loan account in view of the declaration by His
Honour Justice Davies on 15 July 1998. If so, what steps have been taken. If not, an explanation by the Directors as to why they have not taken such steps." "Further, an explanation to the meeting as to what steps the Directors of
GC&Co propose to take in respect to the matters in Item 2 above and a written Timetable for taking such steps." "That no further funds shall be drawn by Claude Cassegrain or for his benefit against his loan account in GC&Co." "That GC&Co amend its accounting records to reverse and rectify the entry made in relation to the $4.25 million in 1993." "That GC&Co take all necessary and proper steps to call, to account and recover from Claude Cassegrain all assets of the Company misapplied by him against his loan accounts."
Commentary in the notice of meeting referred to the 15 July 1998 judgment of Davies J and his Honour's findings about the establishment of the loan account and drawings on it. 
On 27 October 1998, a memorandum ostensibly from Catherine, Patrick, John and Denis and signed by John alone was sent to Claude as "managing director" of GC & Co. It referred to Davies J's judgment and to the notice of meeting dated 24 August 1998 and continued: "I refer to the meeting which was held on 15 September 1998. As you are aware you refused to participate in that meeting. The only conclusion that we can draw is that you intend to continue to conduct the affairs of the company for your own benefit and not for the benefit of the shareholders as a whole."
The memorandum then set out a request under <case> of the Corporations Law for access to books showing movement of funds from 1 April 1998 to the date of the memorandum. Claude replied to John (with a copy to Patrick, Catherine, Denis, Anne-Marie and others) on 28 October 1998 referring to a multitude of matters about family businesses that he regarded as reflecting badly on John. On the question of access to GC & Co's books, Claude merely said that John had had access over a period of two months "last year". 
By a letter of 30 October 1998 addressed to Denis alone, Claude said: "I hereby authorise you to inspect the books of Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty
Limited. Please arrange with me for a mutually convenient time during normal working hours."
Some eight months later, control of the affairs of GC $ Co passed to the receivers appointed by the Commonwealth Bank. 
In a report dated 24 April 2006 forming part of GC & Co's financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2005, Claude referred to the taxation litigation then in progress. He attributed that litigation to actions of Catherine, Patrick, John and Denis. He said that, during the case heard by Davies J, they had alleged "that the compensation Claude Cassegrain received from the CSIRO was held in trust by Claude Cassegrain on their behalf and the compensation received by Claude Cassegrain was for the purpose of the company avoiding tax"; and that it was after these allegations that the Commissioner of Taxation had issued amended assessments. There were also statements implicating Catherine, Patrick, John and Denis in the creation of the financial predicament that had led to the receivership. 
As at 24 April 2006, therefore, Claude made it clear that there was continuing hostility between him and Catherine, Patrick, John and Denis and that, by that time, he saw GC & Co as locked in battle with the Commissioner of Taxation and otherwise suffering continuing prejudice because of their actions. 
It is thus shown that, as at April 2006, there had been no healing of family wounds and that Claude saw the taxation proceedings as a vehicle for putting to rest allegations by his siblings adverse to him concerning the CSIRO settlement proceeds and their application. It is reasonable to think that the siblings also saw the taxation litigation as a forum in which the competing contentions on that subject would be addressed. 
Acquiescence? 
It cannot be said that the passage of some ten years from mid-1997 to December 2007 entailed acquiescence by Denis (or any of Catherine, John and Patrick) in the diversion of GC & Co assets to Claude in the wake of the CSIRO settlement. 
Denis and the siblings aligned with him were active in levelling relevant complaints at Claude in 1998. The receivership intervened in June 1999 and, for reasons I have stated, there can have been no real expectation that they would seek to assert and pursue GC & Co's rights against Claude while the receivership continued. 
After the termination of the receivership in December 2004, there was no acceptance by Denis (or the associated siblings) that there should be no pursuit of Claude. Rather, taxation proceedings were on foot which they were entitled to regard as keeping alive the controversy about GC & Co and the CSIRO proceeds in which they were interested. 
Change of position? 
There is no basis for finding that Claude changed his position in any material way on the faith of a belief or expectation that the complaints of Denis and the associated siblings were dead or would not be pursued. Nor has it been suggested that Claude has been otherwise prejudiced by the passage of time. It is not said, for example, that his ability to assemble and present evidence has been compromised. 
Conclusion on laches 
This is not a case in which the passage of time has had a deleterious effect on Claude, so far as the present proceedings are concerned. It seems clear that acrimonious differences between the family factions continued unabated throughout the period of the receivership. And after the receivers retired, Claude himself showed, by his statements in the report of 24 April 2006, that he regarded the general issue of his loan account and its application to be not only alive but also a source of serious differences between himself and the sibling group associated with Denis. 
There is accordingly no basis for the operation of the doctrine of laches to defeat the equitable claims pursued by Denis on behalf of GC & Co in these proceedings. 
The [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) 
Because the relief to which GC & Co has established an entitlement is wholly equitable relief, the provisions of [ss 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html), [16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s16.html), [17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s17.html), [18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s18.html), [20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s20.html) and [21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s21.html) of the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) have no direct application. This is the effect of [s 23.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s23.html) Nor, in my view, does [s 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s47.html) operate. This is because a company director owing fiduciary duties is not within the [s 11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s11.html) definition of "trustee". 
The question is accordingly whether the court should apply a [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) provision by analogy. In the absence of some sound analogy, a cause of action for equitable relief for breach of fiduciary duty is not subject to any period of limitation: Attorney-General versus Cockle [[1988] Ch 414.]
It is therefore necessary to consider whether any of the causes of action dealt with by the legislation is analogous with the cause of action for equitable relief actually before the court. In other words, is there any relevant analogy between the case expressly dealt with by any of the limitation provisions and the circumstances of this case, that is, where a company director who has applied company funds for his own use has been found to have acted dishonestly in breaching fiduciary duties owed by him to his company? 
It has been held in England that a claim for dishonest breach of fiduciary duty is relevantly analogous with a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation or conspiracy to defraud: Coulthard versus Disco Mix Club Ltd [[2000] 1 WLR 707.] at 121, Waller LJ, dealing with claims by a client against an insurance broker for dishonest breaches of fiduciary duty, said: "... equity would have taken the view that it should apply the statute by analogy to a claim for damages or compensation for a dishonest breach of fiduciary duty. I say that because what is alleged against Heath's as giving rise to the dishonest breach of fiduciary duty are precisely those facts which are also relied on for alleging breach of contract or breach of duty in tort."
Clarke LJ said (at 125): "... the essential nature of the pleaded case is the same whether it is put as damages for breach of contract, damages for breach of duty or damages (or compensation) for breach of fiduciary duty."
In Aussie Ideas Pty Ltd versus Tunwind Pty Ltd  <case>, the Court of Appeal (Handley JA; Giles JA and Bryson JA concurring) held, following Companhia de Seguros Imperio versus Heath (REBX) Ltd , that a breach of fiduciary duty by an accountant and financial adviser involving "elements of dishonesty" warranted analogy with breach of contractual and tortious professional duties. 
Breach of fiduciary duty by company directors was at issue in The Duke Group Ltd versus Alamain Investments Ltd (above). But the liability for which the plaintiff actually sought redress was that of a firm of accountants who, it was alleged, had knowingly and dishonestly assisted the directors in the breach of the directors' duties to the company. Doyle CJ was of the view (at [133]) that, had the directors themselves been under attack, "there are causes of action in tort against the directors sufficiently similar to the claim against the directors for breach of fiduciary duty, to warrant in principle the application of that time limit to a claim against the directors for breach of fiduciary duty" (his Honour no doubt had in mind the species of duty of care in negligence discussed in Daniels versus Anderson [(1995) 37 NSWLR 438).] Where, as here, the director acted dishonestly, a closer tort analogy is with deceit or conspiracy to defraud. 
In this case, the characterisation with respect to company directors in The Duke Group Ltd versus Alamain Investments Ltd (reinforced by Aussie Ideas Pty Ltd versus Tunwind Pty Ltd) warrants an analogy with tort so that the limitation period of six years specified in [s 14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) should be applied. GC & Co seeks equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty by Claude. The analogy with a claim for damages for deceit or conspiracy to defraud is valid. 
I have considered but rejected a possible analogy with an action in respect of fraudulent breach of trust or an action to recover trust property. Each of these, under [s 47(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s47.html), attracts a limitation period of twelve years. The provisions about trustees have regard to the fact that a trustee holds trust property and that the relevant fiduciary duties are owed in relation to that very property: see, for example, Cohen versus Cohen  <case>; [(1929) 42 CLR 91] That is not this case. The claim against Claude is for equitable compensation. 
When the analogy with tort is applied, the general rule under [s 14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) is that the cause of action becomes barred six years from the date on which it first accrued to the plaintiff. Given that relevant allegations were aired in the context of the Federal Court proceedings as early as mid-1997 (see paragraphs [193] to [196] above), it is reasonable to think that Denis, John, Patrick and Catherine became aware of the transfer of the Dairy Farm dated 14 September 1996 - and the ledger entries of 30 June 1997 - at or very soon after the happening of those events. 
I have already expressed the opinion that, in relation to the Dairy Farm transfer, Claude's dishonest breach of fiduciary duty consisted of his receiving the advantage of the book entries of 30 June 1997 by which it was recognised that the consideration for the transfer had been satisfied and the supposed indebtedness of CG & Co to Claude had been reduced by an equivalent amount. It was the recording of those matters in the books on 30 June 1997 that gave effect to the directors' resolution of 2 September 1996 and brought about the effective movement of value from GC & Co to Claude and the corresponding depletion of the assets of GC & Co. 
I therefore proceed on the basis that, in relation to the breach of duty involving the Dairy Farm, the start of the [s 14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) period was 30 June 1997. On that basis, the six-year limitation period applicable by analogy with the statute would be taken to have expired on 30 June 2003. 
But, bearing in mind that this is an equity case in which no common law remedy is sought and that the court, acting by analogy only, will follow the law according to the justice of the case, the process must be taken further. Because, at all times after 30 June 2003, Claude was either the sole director of GC & Co or one of two directors (Anne-Marie being the other), the situation was always one in which GC & Co could not, in any realistic sense, assert its cause of action against Claude by means of action by its board of directors and any action by GC & Co would have to be a derivative action initiated by one or more of its shareholders other than Claude. Throughout the period 15 June 1999 to 21 December 2004, however, there was no real ability for any such shareholder to initiate a derivative action either under the general law or by resort to the statutory procedure when it became available in December 1999: see paragraph [205] above. The bank-appointed receivers' predominant duty was to the secured creditor, particularly regarding the realisation of assets. They were at liberty to ignore the company's own interests, except to the extent that any surplus was held after satisfaction of the creditor's debt, in which event they were bound to preserve the surplus for the company. They had no duty to pursue claims of the kind involved in these proceedings. Indeed, they might well have been criticised for doing so instead of preferring easier avenues of realisation. 
The state in which GC & Co found itself between 15 June 1999 and 21 December 2004 closely resembles a state of "disability" under [s 11(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s11.html) of the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) . GC & Co was, during that period, "substantially impeded in" the management of its affairs in relation to proceedings against Claude by forces virtually equivalent to "impairment of . . . physical or mental condition" or "restraint of his or her person, lawful or unlawful". By virtue of [s 52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s52.html), the running of a limitation period imposed by the Act is suspended while the person with the cause of action is under a disability in the <case> sense. The process of analogy in the present case should be on the basis that the period 15 June 1999 to 21 December 2004 is one during which GC & Co was "substantially impeded" in the relevant sense, so that that period is excluded in determining whether proceedings commenced on 11 September 2008 upon a cause of action arising, in the relevant sense, on 30 June 1997 were commenced within six years after the accrual of the cause of action. 
The period 30 June 1997 to 11 September 2008 is eleven years two months and eleven days. The period 15 June 1999 to 21 December 2004 is five years six months and six days. When the latter period is excluded, it is seen that, in relation to the consideration for the Dairy Farm transaction, the period between the accrual of the cause of action and the commencement of the proceedings was five years eight months and five days, that is, less than six years. 
In relation to drawings on the loan account involving payment by GC & Co of Claude's personal expenses or drawing of cash by Claude, those occurring after the day that was eleven years six months and six days before 11 September 2008 must be treated as not affected by any time bar applied by analogy. Any earlier drawing must, however, be left out of account in determining equitable compensation to be awarded to GC & Co. 
Jones versus Dunkel 
In the course of his closing address, Mr Walker SC referred to this case as "Jones versus Dunkel at twenty paces". As I have noted, no party called any witness and the whole of the evidence was documentary. Submissions were made by all counsel regarding the significance of the absence of witnesses. 
Having regard to the principles in Jones versus Dunkel  <case>; [(1959) 101 CLR 298], I have proceeded on the basis that failure to call a particular witness cannot make up for any deficiency in evidence, allows a fact that might have been contradicted to be more readily accepted and operates in favour of drawing an inference made available in any event by the evidence actually presented. 
On that basis, the absence of evidence from Claude has been much more significant than the absence of evidence from Denis or, for that matter, any of the siblings aligned with him (John, Patrick and Catherine). Denis and his allies were remote from the relevant events except, as to one isolated aspect, for Patrick who was a signatory to the letter of 6 July 1993 and, to that very limited extent, played some active role. 
Claude, by contrast, was intimately involved in every facet of the events in question. He could have provided a vast quantity of relevant information. The fact that he chose not to do so has meant that inferences adverse to him available from the documentary evidence have been drawn with greater confidence. 
Relief 
The time-based defences having failed, relief will be granted against Claude and in favour of GC & Co as outlined at paragraphs [182] and [183] above (this is, however, subject to the limitation expressed at paragraph [243] above). The claims by GC & Co against Felicity will be dismissed. 
On costs, my present inclination is to think that Claude should be ordered to pay GC & Co's costs except as they relate exclusively to the aspects of the claims against Felicity not replicated in the claims against Claude; and that GC & Co should pay Felicity's costs as a whole. It is desirable, however, that, before coming to any firm decision, I hear submissions on costs and particularly on the question whether the outcome I have tentatively indicated may cause particular difficulties for a costs assessor. 
I will direct that, within fourteen days, the parties settle draft orders giving effect to these reasons and deliver them to my associate together with a statement of the parties' views as to the most expeditious method of dealing with the remaining matters. I shall then appoint a further hearing. * * *
