JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force while there is an application pending for a proceeds assessment order under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act. 
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 8 July 2014. In that affidavit, Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer within the meaning of [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, namely, supplying a prohibited drug contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) and (2) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) . Both of those offences are serious criminal offences pursuant to [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). 
Mr Spark bases his suspicion on his having read a statement of facts prepared by the police when the Defendant was arrested and brought before the Local Court. Mr Spark deposes to a conversation and email exchange with the police officer responsible for the preparation of those facts who confirmed that he prepared the facts in conjunction with another police officer, that the contents of the facts sheet were true, and the information contained in the facts sheet was obtained as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. 
I have also read the facts sheet and I am satisfied that the suspicion that Mr Spark deposes to is held on reasonable grounds. In those circumstances, under [s 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act, the Court must make a restraining order. 
The application is made ex parte. I have read what Mr Spark says, based on his long experience, of the ability of persons to dispose of and transfer property very quickly. I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the application should be made without notice to the Defendant. The Defendant, in any event, has rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) to apply to the Court in respect of the orders that have been made. 
I note that the Plaintiff gives the usual undertaking as to damages and upon that undertaking, I make the orders contained in paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft order. * * *
