JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
HARRISON J December 2009 /2009 State of New South Wales versus Frederick Francis Roach 
JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE HIS HONOUR: This is an application by summons filed on 10 November 2009.
The plaintiff seeks orders pursuant to [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s7.html) of the [Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/) appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Court, and to direct the defendant to attend those examinations. It also seeks an interim order pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s8.html) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/) that, for a period of 28 days from the expiry of the defendant's sentence on December 2009, he be subject to a supervision order requiring him to comply with certain conditions in the form of the conditions attached to the summons.
 In the events that have occurred, the defendant does not now oppose the making of either order and does not now object to the conditions in an amended form. He does not, however, concede that a supervision order should be made on anything other than an interim basis and expressly reserves his right to contest both the threshold question (to which I shall shortly refer) as well as to the nature and extent of any conditions attaching to an extended supervision order if in due course this Court were satisfied that such an order could or should be made.
 With respect to the so-called threshold question, I am required to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. That requirement exists even notwithstanding that a defendant, such as in the present case, does not oppose the making of an order or the form of the conditions that give it content. In this respect I note that the threshold for making interim orders is lower than that for making final orders: see, for example, Attorney General for the State of New South Wales versus Hayter <case> per Price J at [6] as follows: "[6] In determining whether to order psychiatric examinations pursuant to [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s15.html) the court is not involved in weighing the supporting documentation or predicting the ultimate result. See Attorney General for the State of New
South Wales versus Tillman <case>, where the Court of Appeal considered [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s16.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/), which is in similar terms to [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csoa2006309/s15.html)
The test for making the orders presently sought is similar to the requirement for a prima facie case to be made out in committal proceedings." I have had regard to the affidavits of Brett Thomson affirmed on 10 November and 24 November 2009 and to the considerable material annexed or exhibited to each of them. Those documents include, but are not limited to, a very detailed report dated 25 September 2009 prepared by Patrick Sheehan, a senior specialist psychiatrist from the New South Wales Department of
Corrective Services Serious Sex Offenders Review Group. I have also had regard to the helpful and extensive written submissions prepared by counsel on behalf of both the plaintiff and the defendant.
 On the basis of that material I am presently satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from the date of expiry of his sentence on 31 December 2009. To this end I have been provided with short minutes of order, in accordance with which I have been asked to make orders, to which are attached a series of amended conditions that I am informed are suitable to both parties. I consider that these amended conditions are appropriate and adequate to give effect to these orders.
 Accordingly I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order dated today, which I shall initial and place with the papers.
