EQUITY DIVISION 
ADOPTIONS LIST  
GZELL J  
MONDAY 12 MARCH 2007  /07 DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND E  
JUDGMENT  E is an infant of less than two years of age. The Director-General of the
Department of Community Services acquired parental responsibility for her on February 2006 when both her parents had given general consent to her adoption. The [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s75.html) provides that the Director-General has parental responsibility for a child to the exclusion of all other persons after general consent to the adoption of the child has been given by every person whose consent to the adoption of the child is required under the Act.  The [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s78.html) requires the Director-General to give a report to the court within a year of acquiring parental responsibility for a child and the court may make orders with respect to parental responsibility for the child. It provides as follows:  "(1) The Director-General must make a report to the Court concerning any child of whom the Director-General has parental responsibility under this Part if the Director-General has not, within a period of one year after taking over parental responsibility, ceased to have parental responsibility. 
The Court may make any order concerning parental responsibility for the child that it thinks fit. 
Without limitation, an order under subsection (2) may, if the child is less than 18 years of age:  declare the child to be under the parental responsibility of the Minister under the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/), or  order that the Director-General continue to have parental responsibility for the child for a further period of one year."  The Director-General sought an order continuing parental responsibility of E with the Director-General until further order, with leave to apply. I indicated to the Adoption Clerk that should the Director-General persist in that application, I required submissions as to why I should make such an order. The Director-General now seeks an order continuing parental responsibility of E with the Director-General for a period of 12 months or until further order, with leave to apply.  In my view, neither order should be made. It is the clear intention of the legislation that parental responsibility in the Director-General should be for a short period and subject to the review of the court. Hence the requirement in the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s78.html) for a report to the court by the Director-General within an year of the acquisition of parental responsibility and the general power in the court to extend that parental responsibility for one year under [s (3)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s78.html)  True it is that the Court may make any order concerning parental responsibility for a child under [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s78.html)
But, in my view, where the child is less than 18 years old, there must exist some factor that distinguishes the matter from the general case of a desire in the Director-General to continue parental responsibility to justify the court in departing from the clear intention of the legislation by extending parental responsibility for more than a year.  No factors have been drawn to the court's attention with respect to the parental responsibility for E. Nor have any submissions been made on behalf of the Director-General indicating a need to adopt a different approach from that contained in the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s (3)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s78.html)  I therefore decline to make either of the orders sought by the Director-
General. Instead, I make an order under the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s (3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s78.html) that the Director-General of the Department of Community Services continue to have parental responsibility for E for a further period of one year.
