JUDGMENT: 
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
HAMILTON J 
WEDNESDAY, 28 JULY 1999 /96 MICHAEL CAMPBELL LOWE versus BARRY ARTHUR LANG and EROLGREEN PTY LIMITED 
HIS HONOUR: In this matter the following question has been asked of in re-examination of the plaintiff Michael Lowe: "In the period from 30 October through to November and December 1991, do you recall telling any person about the conversation or the matters discussed in the conversation with Barry Lang on 30 October 1991?" 
It has been objected to. The way in which the matter arise arises is as follows. The crux of the case is a conversation which occurred on 30 October in which Mr Lowe says, but the defendant Barry Lang denies, that Mr Lang made an offer to pay part of the royalties to Mr Lowe if a quarry were established on the Lang's property ("the October conversation"). In cross- examination of Mr Lowe, Mr Deakin of Queen's Counsel for the defendants, put to him that at a considerably later time he heard discussions about royalties from the quarry with certain neighbouring landowners and that he had not thought of royalties before hearing that later conversation. There is no doubt in my mind that that amounted to a challenge to Mr Lowe that he had fabricated his version of the vital October conversation. On the surface of it, it seems to me that that the contentious question in re-examination, obviously designed to elicit from the witness prior statements consistent with his account of the
October conversation, did arise from cross-examination.
 Mr Deakin QC has submitted that this is not so, and that these this question, if to be asked at all, ought have been asked in chief. He says that that is so because it has been plain from the start of the case that it was denied that the October conversation contained any mention of royalties. Some prior statements made by the plaintiff consistent with his version of the
October conversation have in fact been put in in evidence in chief. Some of those statements made by the plaintiff were deposed to by other witnesses, but one at least has been deposed to by the plaintiff himself. Those statements I admitted through the exception contained in [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s64.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) ("the
Act"), without direct adversion to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) I should say that, in view of the ruling I am about to give on this question in re-examination, those statements by the plaintiff already in evidence, were they in truth not admissible at the time and on the basis on which I admitted them, they would now be admissible under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) Returning to the question that I am now dealing with, it seems to me that, even if it were earlier implicit in the way the case was conducted, that the
October conversation had not contained the vital matter which Mr Lowe asserts, and Mr Lang denies, and that Mr Lowe was wrong in his evidence, which ought not be accepted, in my view that does not prevent the direct challenge put to him in cross-examination being an assertion of fabrication by him and having effect as such in relation to the admissibility of evidence.
 It seems to me that this has two effects in that regard. The first is, I have recently indicated in a judgment delivered by me in Drabsch v
Switzerland General Insurance Co Ltd <case> that a broad approach should be taken to the matter allowable in re- examination, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s39.html) of the Act as at common law, on the basis of the authorities that I collected in that judgment. It seems to me that the contentious question is clearly admissible in re-examination under those principles; see particularly Wojcic v Incorporated Nominal Defendant [[1969] VR 263.] Any possibility that it should be rejected under the rule in <case> of the Act prohibiting evidence going to credibility only is removed by the provision of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) if the evidence falls within [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) it may be asked without the leave of the Court, as at common law. In my view, therefore, the question is admissible in re-examination without leave.
 If, however, I am wrong about that, the second consequence flowing from [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) is that the question is admissible under the rule set out in [s (3)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html)
In the view that I have already expressed, there was a direct suggestion of fabrication in the question asked in cross-examination. I do not think it much matters whether or not a suggestion of fabrication or reconstruction was implicit in the way the case was previously conducted. Cross examining counsel put directly to the witness an allegation amounting to an allegation of fabrication. If I am wrong with the question's admissibility under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html)
I should come to exercise the discretion conferred on the Court by the direct suggestion of fabrication that I have mentioned. If [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) applies, I would give leave to adduce in re-examination the evidence of the prior consistent statement. For the reasons that I have given the question is allowed.
