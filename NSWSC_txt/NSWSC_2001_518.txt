JUDGMENT: 
THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ADAMS J 
TUESDAY 19 JUNE 2001 /01 
CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL HEWITT versus THE MANAGER, SUPPORT 
SERVICES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NSW & 1 ORS 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: This is a matter in which there was a determination of costs.
The plaintiff was unhappy with that determination and proposed to seek a review. An application for review of determination was provided for by [s
KA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208ka.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) (the
Act). [Section
KA(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208ka.html) of the Act requires that an application must be made within 28 days after the issue of a certificate under [s
J](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208j.html) of the Act setting out the determination of the cost assessor. The determination of the cost assessor in this case was made on 5 October 2000. An application for review was filed on 27 October 2000 and accordingly within the prescribed time limit. However [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208.html)
KA(5) provides - "A party who applies for a review under this Subdivision must ensure that notice of the application is given to the other parties to the assessment not less than 7 days before the application is made or as prescribed by the regulations." [Section
KB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208kb.html) provides that where the application for a review "is duly made, the proper officer of the Supreme Court is to refer the application to a panel." The proper officer declined to refer the application to a panel, being of the view that proper notice had not been given. The plaintiff seeks a declaration that the application was duly given and consequential relief.
 It is submitted on behalf of the second defendant that notice within the meaning of [s
KA(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208ka.html) was not given. The plaintiff has tendered correspondence which, it is submitted, amounts to such notice. There is an argument as to whether sufficient notice was given as the correspondence is somewhat ambiguous. If it were necessary for me to do so I would conclude that, in the circumstances, it sufficiently conveyed the message that it was proposed to apply for review.
However, I am of the view that it is unnecessary for the proper officer of the
Supreme Court to ascertain whether, indeed, adequate notice is given under [s
KA(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208ka.html) before referring the application to a panel.
 I do not consider that the giving of notice goes to the jurisdiction of the panel to review the determination of a cost assessor. The provisions of [s
KA(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208ka.html) are designed to encourage settlement, if possible, of the cost dispute before an application is made. The consequence of failing to give notice may be taken into account on the question of costs by the panel exercising its jurisdiction under [s
KH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208kh.html) of the Act.
 In the circumstances, I do not think it appropriate for the Court to make orders to its proper officer. The expectation will be that the proper officer will act in accordance with the judgment.
 I order that the proper officer is to pay the costs except as to 25 percent of the plaintiff's costs of today which are to be paid by the second defendant.
