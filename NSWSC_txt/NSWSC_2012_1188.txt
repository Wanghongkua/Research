JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)
HIS HONOUR: There are before the court applications in nine windings-up of companies in the HIH Group ("Group"), representing the fourth of a series of applications by the liquidators of the Group to distribute the surplus in solvent companies, and dividends in insolvent companies, to the contributories and creditors which are themselves other companies in the Group, and, consequent upon some further formal steps being taken, to release the liquidators and deregister the subject companies.
The first tranche of these applications was considered by Barrett J in FAI General Insurance Co Limited versus FAI Car Owners Mutual Insurance Co Pty Ltd <case>; (2009) 262 ALR at 552; and subsequently in FAI General Insurance Co versus FAI Car Owners Mutual Insurance Co Pty Ltd <case>, where his Honour addressed many of the relevant principles. I have been guided by the approaches his Honour took, and his Honour's observations relieve me from the need to address more elaborately many of the issues.

HIH Services Pty Ltd (In Liq)
It is convenient to commence with the application made in respect of HIH Services Pty Ltd, which is an insolvent company. In that application, a direction is sought pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 479(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s479.html), to the effect that the liquidators would be justified in distributing, in specie, certain assets of the company to its sole creditor - another Group company - those assets being the right of the company to prove in the liquidation scheme of arrangement of yet another Group company.
In Longley versus ACN 090 609 868 (in liq) (formerly Solar Systems Pty Ltd) <case>; [(2010) 276 ALR 728], Finklestein J said that there was no reason in principle why creditors could not unanimously agree to have transferred to them all the assets of a company in liquidation instead of the proceeds of sale of those assets, provided that the rights of contributories were not prejudiced - which they would not be if the assets transferred had a market value that, when taken into account with the costs and expenses of a sale, was less than what was due to the creditors. His Honour considered that there was nothing in the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that would render an in specie distribution invalid or contrary to public policy.
As I have said, HIH Services Pty Ltd (in Liq) is an insolvent company. The assets to be transferred, being rights to prove in an insolvent estate, are less than the value of the creditors' claims, and considerable economies or savings will accrue to the Group from being relieved of the cost of realization and distribution of dividends in respect of the intercompany debts, rather than assigning them as proposed. I therefore make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process.
The second order claimed is a direction pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 1322(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html), that the proposed declaration of the final dividend is not invalidated by reason of non-compliance with (Cth) Corporations Regulation 2001, reg. 5.6.65, and, alternatively, that the time for publication of the notice of the intention to declare a dividend in accordance with that regulation be extended. This arises because reg 5.6.65 requires that the liquidator give notice of an intention to declare a dividend not more than two months before the intended date (by publishing Form 546 in the Gazette, and in writing in accordance with Form 547 or 548 to any known potential creditor), and no such notice has been published or given. That said, notice calling for proofs of debt in respect of this company, under reg 5.6.48, was published, and there is, by reason of the wide publicity that has attended the liquidation of the Group, and the extensive investigations that have taken place, a sound basis for the liquidators to form the conclusion, which they have expressed on oath, that they are satisfied that there are no creditors other than the sole internal creditor. Given the nature and the extent of the publicity surrounding this liquidation, and the liquidator's examinations and investigations, the prospect of any interested party being unknown to the liquidators is extremely remote. The publication of the requisite notice is, particularly in the context of this case, procedural in nature. I am satisfied that relieving the liquidator of the consequences of non-compliance with 5.6.65 will not prejudice any person. I therefore make order 2A in the amended interlocutory process. 
The third order sought is the approval of remuneration. I am satisfied that the amounts for past and future remuneration are reasonable in the circumstances. I make order 3 in the amended interlocutory process.
Orders 4 and 5 in the amended interlocutory process are not sought on this occasion, and are to be addressed on the adjourned date. I am, on the basis of the decisions ultimately made by Barrett J in earlier phase applications, satisfied that it would be appropriate to make the order for destruction of books and records in the terms sought. 
HIH New Zealand Pty Limited (In Liq)
The second application is made in respect of HIH New Zealand Pty Limited (In Liq), which is a solvent company. In that case, special leave is sought pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 488(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s488.html), to distribute surplus assets of the company. The company has only one contributory. 
The requirement for "special" leave means no more than that there must be a "particular" grant of leave to make the distribution, rather than its merely being included with other administrative matters [Klaus Maertin Pty Ltd (in liq), Re; Maertin versus Klaus Maertin Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2009) 232 FLR 239]; Re Trussted Fames & Trusses Holdings Pty Limited (in Liq) (unreported, 28 June 2012, NSWSC)]. 
Supreme Court Corporations Rules, r 7.9, specifies that the affidavit in support of an application for special leave to distribute a surplus must state how the liquidator intends to distribute the surplus, including the name and address of each person to whom the liquidator intends to distribute, and that at least fourteen days before the date fixed for hearing the liquidator must publish a notice of the application in accordance with Form 15, published in accordance with r 2.11. The evidence - in particular, the affidavit of Ashleigh Jannece Kable sworn 17 July 2012 - proves compliance with those requirements.
The evidence also establishes that there is a surplus available for distribution. Given that there is only one contributory, the case is a simple one, such that it is appropriate to dispense with the requirement to annex to the order a schedule in accordance with Form 511, as is otherwise required by Corporations Regulation, reg. 5.6.71(1). However, consistent with what has happened in other cases, the order should state on its face to whom the assets are to be distributed, if it is not set out in a schedule [Re Klaus Maerten Pty Limited; Brealey versus Shields  <case>; Re FAI Car Owners Mutual Insurance Pty Ltd  <case>; Re Trussted Frames & Trusses]. Accordingly, I make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process, subject to the addition thereto of the words "to the sole contributory at HIH Overseas Holdings (in liquidation)". 
I make order 2 in the amended interlocutory process. 
Claim 3 is for direction, pursuant to 479(3), that the liquidators would be justified in making an in specie distribution. The constitution of the company provides for an in specie distribution in the case of a winding up, if authorised by a special resolution of a company. The evidence establishes that such a special resolution has been adopted. The resolution specifically refers to a distribution "in kind" of particular assets, and thus addresses the concerns that troubled Barrett J in the earlier cases, to which I have referred. In those circumstances, it might be said the liquidators need no authority or approval from the Court to take that course. However it has been submitted that because, in effect, the liquidators are contracting or dealing with themselves, they ought, as officers of the Court, be entitled to approach the Court for, as it were, endorsement of the course that they propose to take, lest it may otherwise be called in to question. The evidence establishes that the practical effect of what is proposed in this, and the associated cases, is to transfer rights of proof of debt in other Group companies to companies higher in the Group structure, without the cost of realising the debt and declaring or distributing a dividend, or in this case realising the debt and paying the proceeds to the contributory. This will ultimately see a greater fund available for distribution to creditors of the main companies in the Group, and avoid those benefits being further eroded by costs associated with realisation of the debts in the meantime. I am satisfied in those circumstances it is appropriate to give the liquidators the direction that they seek. I make order 3 in the amended interlocutory process.
The fourth order sought is approval of remuneration, and for reasons expressed in respect of the preceding company, I make order 4 in the amended interlocutory process. 
HIH (Australia) Pty Limited (in Liq)
The third application is in respect of HIH Australia Pty Limited (in Liq), an insolvent company. The same considerations apply to the relief sought in this case as applied in the first case. I make orders 1, 2 and 3 in the amended interlocutory process.

Mariners on the Water Pty Ltd (In Liq)
The fourth application is in respect of Mariners On the Water Pty Limited (in Liq), a solvent company. The same considerations apply in this case as in the second application. 
I make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process, subject to the addition thereto of the words, "to the sole contributory FAI Properties Pty Limited (in liquidation)". I make orders 2, 3, and 4 in the amended interlocutory process. 
FAI Properties (Qld) Pty Ltd (In Liq)
The fifth application is in the matter of FAI Properties (QLD) Pty Ltd (in Liq), a solvent company, to which the same considerations apply as in the second application. I make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process, subject to the addition thereto of the words "to the sole contributory FAI Properties Pty Limited (in liquidation)". I make orders 2, 3 and 4 in the amended interlocutory process. 
FAI Property Services Pty Ltd (in Liq)
The sixth application concerns FAI Property Services Pty Limited, an insolvent company. I make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process, subject to the addition thereto of the words, "to the sole contributory FAI Properties Pty Limited (in liquidation)". I make orders 2, 3 and 4 in the amended interlocutory process. 
Sailport Pty Ltd (In Liq)
The next matter concerns Sailport Pty Ltd, a solvent company. I make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process, subject to the addition thereto of the words "to the sole contributory FAI Leasing Finance Pty Limited (in liquidation)". I make orders 2, 3 and 4 in the amended interlocutory process. 
Bingaton Pty Ltd (In Liq)
The eighth matter is in respect of Bingaton Pty Ltd (in Liq), a solvent company, I make order 1 in the amended interlocutory process, subject to the addition thereto of the words, "to the sole contributory FAI Insurances Limited (in Liquidation and Subject to a Scheme of Arrangement)". I make orders 2, 3 and 4 in the amended interlocutory process.

Worldwide Weather Underwriting Agencies (Australia) Pty Ltd (in Liq)
The final matter is Worldwide Weather Underwriting Agencies (Australia) Pty Ltd (in Liq). The circumstances of this company are somewhat different, in that it is the only one of those presently under consideration which is not wholly owned by another member company of the HIH Group, and which potentially has a creditor external to the Group.
So far as the external creditor is concerned, he has not lodged a proof of debt, despite advertisements calling for one, and, despite extensive endeavours on the part of the liquidators to locate him, in Australia and abroad, he has not been able to be located. It appears that this creditor is associated with the other shareholder, a company formerly registered in the Bahamas, which was apparently deregistered in or about 2002. The prospect that he would now emerge is remote. The liquidator has determined not to make provision for his claim. Although the company may not be technically insolvent, as the only admitted creditor has been paid in full, it will generate no surplus, as the assets are insufficient to cover the costs of the liquidation and interest on the creditor's claim. In those circumstances, the prospects that there would be any return to the Bahaman company as a contributory are effectively nil. 
I make order 1A in the amended interlocutory process. I make order 2 in the amended interlocutory process.

Dispensing with notice requirements 
In connection with the proposed release of the liquidators and deregistration of the companies, the liquidators have sought, in each matter, orders pursuant to [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/), r 7.5(6), dispensing with the requirement to serve on each creditor and contributory a copy of the interlocutory process, liquidator's accounts and statements of financial position. 
The purpose of r 7.5(6) is to ensure that each person interested in the winding up is informed of the liquidator's application for a release, and provided the essential financial information that may enable that person to object to the liquidator being released, or otherwise to take steps for the protection of their position before the liquidator is released. In this case, with the exception of Worldwide Weather Underwriting Agencies, to which I have referred, each creditor is a company internal to HIH Group, of which the liquidators, or one or more of them, are liquidators, and each contributory is a company in that Group. In those circumstances, requiring service of the interlocutory process and associated material would be superfluous. So far as World Wide Weather Underwriting Agencies is concerned, for the reasons I have already given, I consider it unnecessary to serve notice of the interlocutory process. 
In each matter therefore, I order pursuant to Corporation Rules, r 7.5(6), that the liquidators need not serve on each creditor who proved a debt in the course of the winding up of the company and on each contributory of the company, a copy of this interlocutory process, the liquidator's receipts and payments in the winding up of the company, and the statement of financial position of the company at the date on which this interlocutory process was filed.
