PROCEDURE - notice of motion - order to strike out statement of claim - orders sought under the Crimes Act 1914 - order to issue notices of quo warranto - motion dismissed  
JUDGMENT
The Deputy Commissioner claims that under [s 8AAZH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazh.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act 1953](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (Cth) Mr Bonaccorso owes some $1,467,626.47 in respect of an "RBA deficit debt" for the 2013 income year and now seeks to recover that sum, together with further interest. The amended statement of claim addresses how this debt was quantified. It includes amounts claimed to be due under the BAS provisions of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1997](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/) (Cth), as well as interest.
By his December 2014 amended defence Mr Bonaccorso denies that he has such a tax debt, or that the Deputy Commissioner is entitled to recover what is claimed. There are certain difficulties with that pleading, in respect of which he seeks leave to amend.
From the case which Mr Bonaccorso, who appears in these proceedings unrepresented, advanced in support of the motions which he now presses, it is apparent that he believes that he is wrongly being pursued for a tax debt which was the subject of earlier proceedings brought against him in the Federal Court. In those proceedings orders requiring payment of $3,552,577.81 were made against him in respect of tax assessments issued in 2009 (see Commissioner of Taxation versus Grimaldi (No. 5) <case>; [(2009) 76 ATR 352).] Mr Bonaccorso was legally represented in those proceedings. Other orders were made against other defendants to those proceedings, including for the sum of $36,341,461.73 in the case of Mr Grimaldi and $3,664,366.20 in the case of IFTC Broking Services Ltd.
It is Mr Bonaccorso's case that the income tax he was ordered to pay in those proceedings, has since been paid by others and that accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner cannot now pursue him for the tax the subject of these proceedings.
What lies in issue between the parties in these proceedings includes various matters of fact, as well as questions of law, including as to the proper operation of the tax legislation on which the Deputy Commissioner's case depends.
Despite Mr Bonaccorso's submissions, what of course cannot be done in these proceedings is for the correctness of judgments given in the Federal Court as to Mr Bonaccorso's then tax liability, to be challenged. Unless set aside by order of the Federal Court, those judgments bind the parties to those proceedings, including the Commissioner and Mr Bonaccorso.
Nor can final orders be made in favour of Mr Bonaccorso on these interlocutory applications, for example as to damages, as he sought by his motions.

The parties' motions
The parties have filed various motions. Those filed by the Deputy Commissioner are motions of: * (1) 1 July 2014 as to service and 5 May as to amendment of the statement of claim.
* (2) 2 February 2015 amended by a motion filed on 5 March - seeking orders: * (a) striking out the defence as disclosing no reasonable defence and in the alternative, as tending to cause prejudice, embarrassment and delay, or for want of due despatch in the conduct of the defence.
* (b) Summary judgment in favour of the Deputy Commissioner.
* (3) 1 June 2015 - seeking orders to set aside a notice to produce documents to the Court issued by Mr Bonaccorso on 11 May, amended over his objection at the hearing, to include an order to set aside a second notice to produce documents issued by Mr Bonaccorso on 23 May 2016.
* (4) 19 April 2016 - seeking orders to set aside a subpoena to produce documents issued by Mr Bonaccorso on 18 April 2016.
It is the June 2015 motion and the April 2016 motions that the Commissioner now presses.
The motions filed by Mr Bonaccorso are: * (1) 11 September 2015 - seeking orders: * (a) Striking out the statement of claim as an abuse of process.
* (b) As to the creation of certified copies of specified certificates.
* (c) As to the conduct of an inquiry into the shares of Murchison Metals Ltd and an alleged fraud.
* (d) Damages in excess of $20 million.
* (e) Removal of a writ in respect of a property at Terrigal.
* (f) As to the cross-examination of the Deputy Commissioner.
* (g) Giving leave to file a cross-claim.
* (h) Costs.
* (2) 14 September - seeking orders: * (a) As to leave to file a notice to produce.
* (b) That the application be struck out.
* (c) Damages and costs.
* (3) 4 December 2015 - seeking leave: * (a) to further amend his defence because his former legal representatives did not follow his instructions; and * (b) under [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to permit him to defend himself.
* (4) 23 March 2016 - seeking orders: * (a) For strike out.
* (b) Orders under the [Crimes Act 1914](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (Cth).
* (c) As to damages and costs.
* (d) As to issue of notices of quo warranto to the Deputy Commissioner as to his office and the Court as to its authority and that of its officers.
Some of the orders sought in these motions are repetitive, but they were all pressed.

The requirements of [s 56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/)
These proceedings already have a considerable history. There is also a considerable history of prior litigation between the parties, disclosed in the affidavits sworn by Mr Bonaccorso in support of his motions, the affidavits sworn by Mr Zafiriou, a Director in the Australian Public Service employed in the debt section of the ATO, and the documents annexed to those affidavits, or otherwise tendered by the parties.
What the parties have joined issue over must be resolved, bearing in mind the requirements of [s 56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) , which requires the Court to give effect to the overriding purpose there specified, namely, to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings. The section also imposes duties on the parties to assist the Court in furthering that purpose. The Court must also exercise its powers having regard to the objects specified in [s 57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s57.html), namely: "(a) the just determination of the proceedings,  the efficient disposal of the business of the court,  the efficient use of available judicial and administrative resources,  the timely disposal of the proceedings, and all other proceedings in the court, at a cost affordable by the respective parties."
The Court must also act in accordance with the dictates of justice, having regard to relevant matters specified in [s 58(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s58.html), namely: "(i) the degree of difficulty or complexity to which the issues in the proceedings give rise,  the degree of expedition with which the respective parties have approached the proceedings, including the degree to which they have been timely in their interlocutory activities,  the degree to which any lack of expedition in approaching the proceedings has arisen from circumstances beyond the control of the respective parties,  the degree to which the respective parties have fulfilled their duties under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) ,  the use that any party has made, or could have made, of any opportunity that has been available to the party in the course of the proceedings, whether under rules of court, the practice of the court or any direction of a procedural nature given in the proceedings,  the degree of injustice that would be suffered by the respective parties as a consequence of any order or direction,  such other matters as the court considers relevant in the circumstances of the case."
The object of the elimination of delay (see [s 59)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s59.html) and the proportionality of costs, [(s 60)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s60.html), must also be borne in mind.

Issues
The matters in issue pursued by the parties include: * (1) The Deputy Commissioner's standing to bring the proceedings.
* (2) Whether the proceedings should be struck out.
* (3) Whether the notices to produce and subpoena should be set aside.
* (4) Whether Mr Bonaccorso should have leave to further amend his defence and to file a cross-claim.
* (5) Whether other relief claimed by Mr Bonaccorso should now be dealt with.

Evidence
From what he submitted and deposed to in his affidavits, it seems that Mr Bonaccorso not only considers that these proceedings are an abuse of process and challenges the Deputy Commissioner's standing, he also purportedly seeks to challenge the existence of the legislative scheme under which the proceedings are pursued; the Court's jurisdiction and indeed, its existence; the very existence of Australia as a nation; the existence of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) as a law under which the Federal Parliament enacts statutes, and whether certain statutes have been enacted in accordance with the requirements of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). He also claims that <case> notices should be issued.
The Commissioner's case is advanced on the basis of an affidavit sworn by Mr Zafiriou.
I received that affidavit despite he not being available for cross-examination, given the nature of what he there deposed to and the late notice given that he was required for cross-examination. There was a dispute as to whether that notice had been given by way of confirmation of earlier advice that he was required for cross-examination.
Given that on an interlocutory application such as this, the evidence as to the basis on which the Deputy Commissioner will seek to make out the case against Mr Bonaccorso must be taken at its highest and that it is not an opportunity for a mini trial or rehearsal of the foreshadowed testing of Mr Zafiriou's evidence, I concluded that he should not be required for cross-examination and that the hearing of the motions should not adjourn so that he could be brought to court for cross-examination.

The case does not raise Constitutional issues
That many of the matters by which Mr Bonaccorso seeks to advance his case are not, in truth, in issue and do not necessitate the giving of <case> Notices, as Mr Bonaccorso contended, became apparent from the submissions which he finally himself advanced. Those submissions, it should be noted, included the submission that "I stand on the land and I am only bound by the laws and the jurisdiction under the federal legislation".
Mr Bonaccorso claimed that but for the "interference" of the Australian Taxation Office he would have been able to sell a share portfolio in 2009 for some $8,767,224, in which event he would have paid tax on that amount, honestly assessed. Instead, the shares were sequestered and sold for a sum totalling $1,800,000. A question thus arose, Mr Bonaccorso contended, as to whether the ATO had the power to acquire his property without providing 'just terms' and using powers not authorised by <case>(xxxi) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
It was in those circumstances, Mr Bonaccorso contended, that a <case> [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) notice should be issued.
[Section 78B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) provides: "78B Notice to Attorneys-General 
Where a cause pending in a federal court including the High Court or in a court of a State or Territory involves a matter arising under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) or involving its interpretation, it is the duty of the court not to proceed in the cause unless and until the court is satisfied that notice of the cause, specifying the nature of the matter has been given to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and of the States, and a reasonable time has elapsed since the giving of the notice for consideration by the Attorneys-General, of the question of intervention in the proceedings or removal of the cause to the
High Court."
While Mr Bonaccorso relies on [s 51(xxxi)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html) to resist the Deputy Commissioner's case, it is settled that "[a] law which is in truth a law imposing taxation escapes the requirement of [s 51(xxxi)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) that an "acquisition of property ... for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws" be "on just terms"" (see Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd versus Commonwealth  <case>; <case>).
In the result, I am satisfied that <case> notices are not required, these proceedings not in truth involving either a matter arising under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), or its interpretation.
In Australian Competition & Consumer Commission versus C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd <case>; [(1999) 95 FCR 292] at 486-489: "Section 78B only operates when the circumstances it postulates are made to appear to the court: it does not operate simply because a party asserts those circumstances. It is clear, from the reference to the possibility of intervention or removal of the cause to the High Court upon the initiative of an Attorney-General, that what the section contemplates is a constitutional question which is a live issue in the proceedings."
French J also said: "14 Section 78B does not impose on the Court a duty not to proceed pending the issue of a notice no matter how trivial, unarguable or concluded the constitutional point may be. If the asserted constitutional point is frivolous or vexatious or raised as an abuse of process, it will not attach to the matter in which it is raised the character of a matter arising under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) or involving its interpretation - Nikolic versus MGIC Limited <case> cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus White (unrep, Fed
Court, 16/7/98, Drummond J, No QG 40 of 1998, 16 July 1998)."
Mr Bonaccorso himself relied on the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) to advance various of his own submissions. He also relied on various statutes enacted by State and Federal Parliaments, for example the [Crimes Act 1914](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (Cth), the [Bills of Exchange Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/boea1909148/) and the [Crimes Act 1958](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca195882/) (Vic). The case which he finally advanced confirmed that in reality, the existence of the nation, its [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), Parliaments and courts and the proper enactment of various laws, including the [Taxation Administration Act 1953](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (Cth), are not in reality, in issue in these proceedings.
In the result, in so far as the motions, notices to produce and subpoena seek the production of documents going to these matters, the orders sought cannot be granted and the notices and subpoena must be set aside.

Applicable principles on strike out
There is no question as to the Court's power to strike out the proceedings under [Rule 14.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.28.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , but the discretion can only be exercised in the limited circumstances discussed in Spencer versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(2010) 241 CLR 118] where it was observed at [3]: " <case>; [241 CLR 118] was concerned with <case> of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) but the following principles stated in it are of general application: 
On a summary judgment application, the real issue is whether there is an underlying cause of action or defence, not simply whether one is pleaded (at [23]). 
The critical question can be expressed as whether there is more than a "fanciful" prospect of success (at [25]) per French CJ and Gummow J) or whether the outcome is so certain that it would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow the action to go forward (at [54] in the judgment of the plurality). Demonstration of the outcome of the litigation is required, not an assessment of the prospect of its success (ibid). 
Powers to summarily terminate proceedings must be exercised with exceptional caution (ibid at [55]; see also French CJ and Gummow J at [24])."
Mr Bonaccorso did not address these principles, but by the arguments which he advanced, it was apparent that he contended that, in truth, the Deputy Commissioner has no cause of action against him. Mr Bonaccorso's submissions are not all easy to understand, but amongst his concerns, which must be accepted are genuinely held, is that as the result of the Commissioner's past actions, he is now in danger of losing his family home, if these proceedings are also pursued, given his mortgage liabilities, which exceed $800,000.
That provides a good explanation as to what has motivated his various applications, but it does not provide a basis for the conclusion that he has met the high onus which falls upon him to establish that the Deputy Commissioner's case is so certain to fail, that it should be struck out.
For reasons which I will explain, while some basis for arguments which Mr Bonaccorso wishes to pursue can be seen, that the Deputy Commissioner's case will necessarily fail, given the strength of the arguments which he seeks to advance, is not apparent.

The Deputy Commissioner's standing
The Deputy Commissioner's standing derives from the [Taxation Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/). Section <case> provides for the office of Deputy Commissioner and [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s4.html) for the offices of Commissioner of Taxation and Second Commissioners of Taxation and for the engagement of staff necessary to assist the Commissioner, under the [Public Service Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/psa1999152/) (Cth). For the purposes of that Act, the Commissioner and that staff together constitute a Statutory Agency of which the Commissioner is the Head. The [Public Service Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/psa1999152/) also gives the Commissioner the powers of an employer [(s 20)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/psa1999152/s20.html), including determination of employees' duties [(s 25).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/psa1999152/s25.html) This permits the allocation of the duties of the office of Deputy Commissioner to a particular employee.
[Section 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/psa1999152/s8.html) gives the Commissioner powers of delegation to Deputy Commissioners and provides for how they may be exercised. I note the definition of the principle "delegatus non potest delgare" in Black's Law Dictionary, but that principle does not establish any lack of standing on the Deputy Commissioner's part, as Mr Bonaccorso contended.
Section 255-[5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s5.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) provides that: "255-5 Recovering a tax-related liability that is due and payable 
An amount of a *tax-related liability that is due and payable:  is a debt due to the Commonwealth; and  is payable to the Commissioner. 
The Commissioner, a *Second Commissioner or a *Deputy Commissioner may sue in his or her official name in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover an amount of a * tax-related liability that remains unpaid after it has become due and payable. 
Note: The tables in section -[10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s10.html) set out each provision that specifies when an amount of a tax-related liability becomes due and payable. The Commissioner may vary that time under
Subdivision 255-B.
Tax related liability is defined in <case>-[1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s1.html) in terms which includes a "pecuniary liability" defined in <case>(10) to include an RBA deficit debt arising under [s 8AAZH(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazh.html) [Section 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s15.html) provides that in proceedings brought by or on behalf of a Deputy Commissioner under, or arising out of, a taxation law the Deputy Commissioner may be legally represented. [Section 15(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s15.html) provides that: "(2) The appearance of a person, and the statement of the person that the person appears by authority of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a
Deputy Commissioner, is prima facie evidence of that authority."
In response to a notice to produce, documents relating to the Deputy Commissioner's appointment have been produced to Mr Bonaccorso. They are in evidence. He did not rely on any of those documents to show that the Deputy Commissioner has not been appointed to his office; that he does not have power to bring these proceedings; or that those who appear for him in the proceedings, do not have the necessary authority to do so.
That there is any real question as to the Deputy Commissioner's standing is not apparent. That the Australian Tax Office is not a legal personality, as Mr Bonaccorso also contended, is not to the point. It is not a party to the proceedings. What was said in the High Court during submissions in 2000 in proceedings between parties to other proceedings, in which no judgment was given, simply takes the matter no further.
In the result, it must be concluded that what Mr Bonaccorso raised as to the Deputy Commissioner's standing, provided no basis for a strike out order.

Leave to amend the defence and to file a cross-claim
Mr Bonaccorso's amended defence certainly needs to be further amended, so that it complies with the requirements of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), which apply to all litigants.
Those requirements include that a summary of the material facts on which Mr Bonaccorso relies be pleaded [(Rule 14.7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.7.html); that the effect of identified documents or spoken words must, so far as material, be stated, but that the precise terms of the document or spoken words must not be stated, except so far as those terms are themselves material [(Rule 14.9).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.9.html) Further, that in accordance with [Rule 14.14(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.14.html) there must be express pleading as to any matter: "(a) that, if not pleaded specifically, may take the opposite party by surprise, or  that the party alleges makes any claim, defence or other case of the opposite party not maintainable, or  that raises matters of fact not arising out of the preceding pleading."
Given the requirements of the Rules, leave to amend in terms of the further amended defence filed on 4 December 2015 cannot be granted. That document is, in parts, difficult to follow and it certainly does not comply with the requirements of the Rules, in various respects. Nor can a defence make an application for strike out, as this proposed defence seeks to do at [12], for example, or require the production of documents, as it purports to do at [19], [20] and [21], for example. It also purports to put in issue matters which by the case which Mr Bonaccorso himself advanced on his motion, are clearly not, in truth, in issue, as I have explained.
In the result, while Mr Bonaccorso must have an opportunity to re-plead, leave cannot be given to file the proposed pleading. He was earlier, properly, refused such leave by the Registrar. No basis on which the leave which he pressed in respect of that proposed pleading can be given.
There was also an incomplete draft cross-claim filed with Mr Bonaccorso'[s 11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s11.html) September motion. That document also fails to comply with the requirements of the Rules, in various ways, which it is unnecessary to outline in detail. It is in large part difficult to understand; it poses questions; it fails to specify the relief which is claimed; and it also fails to particularise the damages which are sought. In the result the leave sought in respect of that pleading cannot be granted.

The claim that the tax the subject of these proceedings has already been recovered
There is no issue between the parties that in Grimaldi (No. 5), Graham J gave judgment against Mr Bonaccorso for $3,552,577.81 unpaid income tax in respect of notices of assessment issued in 2009 for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax years. The proceedings and the assessment were concerned with income generated by the sale of shares in Murchison Metals Pty Ltd, sold through IFTC Broking.
It is Mr Bonaccorso's case in these proceedings that he was a principal investor in that company; that Mr Grimaldi was a director, who defrauded him and other investors in the company; that he was deemed to have received profits from the sale of the shares, which he had never received, being the victim of that fraud; and that the Commissioner's assessments rested on that fraud, aspects of which had only become known to him in 2013 or 2014, when he obtained access to certain documents under a Freedom of Information application.
In an affidavit sworn by Mr Zafiriou in the 2009 proceedings, it appears that the respondents to the 2009 proceedings came to the attention of authorities as the result of the Project Wickenby investigation into international tax avoidance. Mr Bonaccorso contends that this affidavit supports his contention that he never received the profits on which the Commissioner's 2009 assessment rested.
It is common ground that Mr Bonaccorso had not filed a tax return in 2008, nor has he since filed any tax returns. Indeed, in April 2016 he served on the Commissioner notices of "non lodgement advice" for tax years going back to 2008, in which he says that he did not lodge returns in each of those years for "religious and spiritual reasons". Attached to those notices is an "affidavit of truth" in terms which it is not here necessary to explain, but by which he contends, amongst other things, that he is not liable to pay taxes.
Mr Bonaccorso also contends that payment of income tax is voluntary. To establish this he relies on what was said in a document issued by the Australian Taxation Office, entitled "Taxpayer's Charter - What you need to know", in which it is said at p 23: "Being cooperative in your dealings with us 
We prefer to work with you cooperatively, providing you with help to meet your tax obligations voluntarily. However, if you are uncooperative or obstructive, we may need to take firmer action. For example, we have formal access and information gathering powers that we use if necessary. People who are obstructive may even be prosecuted. 
We ask that you treat tax officers with the same courtesy, consideration and respect they are expected to give you. If tax officers are subjected to rude or abusive behaviour, they may end an interview or phone call."
The statement that "[w]e prefer to work with you cooperatively, providing you with help to meet your tax obligations voluntarily" he submits, establishes that while he may pay taxes voluntarily, he has no obligation to do so.
Mr Bonaccorso may have such a belief, but that his obligations are as he claims them to be, cannot be established by this document.
It was a default assessment, it is common ground, issued in relation to the 2008 tax year by the Commissioner as the result of a May 2009 audit decision, which explained the basis of that assessment, which became the subject of the Federal Court proceedings. That assessment, on the Deputy Commissioner's case, also later became the base assessment for the tax which is pursued in these proceedings, Mr Bonaccorso having himself not lodged any tax returns since that assessment; not having appealed the 2009 judgment given in Grimaldi (No. 5), not having pursued proceedings which he commenced in the AAT, to challenge the Commissioner's 2009 assessment; or succeeded in the objection to that assessment, which he did pursue.
It was in June 2009 that Mr Bonaccorso pursued an objection to the assessment, which failed. Reasons for that decision were given in June 2010. There was also no challenge to that decision.
Mr Bonaccorso also referred in his submissions to a mediation which, it is common ground, followed proceedings in the High Court in relation to other proceedings involving the Crime Commission and other defendants to the 2009 Federal Court proceedings, which it is not necessary here to outline. On his case the result of that mediation was that the Commissioner had settled with all parties to those proceedings, other than him.
Mr Bonaccorso also contends that the Commissioner later twice brought bankruptcy proceedings against him, but they were not finally pursued. His defence in those proceedings was that his tax debt, the subject of the order made in in Grimaldi (No. 5), had been extinguished by payments made by other respondents to the 2009 proceedings to the Tax Commissioner. A subpoena was issued in the bankruptcy proceedings, which required the production of documents sought in relation to IFTC Broking, Raphael J having concluded that they were relevant to what was in issue on the bankruptcy application (matter no 2136 of 2013). The documents were produced, but the proceedings were later withdrawn by the Commissioner.
In these proceedings the Deputy Commissioner contends that Mr Bonaccorso cannot challenge the calculation of the $3,552,577.81 he was ordered to pay in Grimaldi (No. 5). The Deputy Commissioner's case is that it is not the same tax which is now sought to be recovered from Mr Bonaccorso; that while the 2009 assessment was relevant to the calculation of the RBA deficit debt which is pursued in these proceedings, the tax now sought to be recovered relates to the 2013 tax year. The Deputy Commissioner also contends that payments made in respect of the income the subject of the 2009 assessment are irrelevant to the tax debt now pursued. That is in issue.
In Grimaldi (No. 5) it was observed by Graham J at [22] that "[i]t is immaterial to the validity of the power to assess one taxpayer to tax that the Commissioner believes it possible that another taxpayer is liable to tax in respect of the same particular income." Further at [23] his Honour said "The fact that a tax liability remains outstanding against two taxpayers pending the ascertainment of the taxpayer truly liable is no bar to the exercise of the power to assess both to tax in respect of the same income." At <case>; [(2009) 181 FCR 275] orders were also sought against the fourth respondent, MGG Capital Pty Limited As Trustee For Webtel Management Super Fund for $25,909,612.54. They were resisted on the basis of the orders earlier made against another respondent. Graham J observed at [6] - [9]: "6 Whilst the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit in the claim against the first respondent may have passed into judgment, so that it is merged and no longer has an independent existence, the right or cause of action claimed or put in suit in the applicant's claim against the fourth respondent is a different right or cause of action. Its independent existence has not been destroyed (cf Chamberlain versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 502] at -511). The applicant's right or cause of action against the fourth respondent has not passed into judgment. It retains its independent existence.  Whilst there will inevitably be cases in which it would be oppressive for the Commissioner to seek to enforce payment of the full amount due under a number of notices of assessment issued by the Commissioner on an alternative basis to different taxpayers in respect of the same income, such a possibility does not preclude the Commissioner from securing judgments against different taxpayers in respect of the same income. What would be oppressive would be for the Commissioner to seek to execute such judgments so as to enforce payment of the full amount due under the several judgment debts. Double recovery by the
Commissioner would be oppressive (see The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia versus Moorebank Proprietary Limited  <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 55] ('Moorebank') at 67).  A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue, so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies (per Dixon J, as his Honour then was, in Blair versus Curran <case>; [(1939) 62 CLR 464] at 531).  Res judicata estoppels operate for, or against, not only the parties, but those who are privy to them in blood, title or interest. 'Privy' includes any person who succeeds to the rights or liabilities of the party upon death or insolvency, or who is otherwise identified in estate or interest (see Handley,
Honourable Mr Justice KR, Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley: The Doctrine of
Res Judicata (3rd Ed, Butterworths, 1996) ('Spencer Bower, Turner and
Handley') at para 231)."
At [28] his Honour reiterated that "[p]lainly, alternative or concurrent assessments are permissible and judgments founded upon such assessments are also permissible. As Davies J observed one might expect the courts to intervene to ensure that alternative assessments and judgments based thereon would not lead to double recovery by the Commissioner." Nevertheless, his Honour concluded that the existence of the judgment against Mr Grimaldi did not estop the Commissioner from securing a judgment against MGG Capital.
In these proceedings Mr Bonaccorso relies on Graham J's observations, contending that, in fact, the Commissioner has recovered the tax payable on the income the subject of the 2009 litigation, which was the subject of the 2009 assessment as to his tax liability, from other taxpayers. Accordingly, on his case, he no longer has any liability in respect of that income and it would involve double recovery to permit the Deputy Commissioner now to pursue him for the RBA deficit debt sought to be pursued in these proceedings, given that it has been calculated by reference to the order made against him in the 2009 proceedings in respect of the income the subject of the 2009 assessment. He also contends that the orders there made against him were obtained as the result of a fraud, which only came to his attention long after judgment in Grimaldi (No. 5) was given. In the result, even though the judgment has not been challenged, the Commissioner is not entitled to rely on the orders there made.
Attached to Mr Bonaccorso's December 2015 affidavit is a deed of settlement between the Commissioner and other respondents to the 2009 proceedings, who were also parties to other proceedings in New Zealand, in which certain freezing orders had been made. One of the matters there agreed was for payment by Mr Grimaldi of amounts which Mr Bonaccorso contends the Commissioner accepted as settling the tax assessed against he and IFTC Broking, dealt with in Grimaldi (No. 5). It is on these payments and their alleged consequences, that Mr Bonaccorso's case depends.
In his February 2015 affidavit, Mr Bonaccorso also deposed that in excess of half of the 2009 judgment debt has been recovered from him and that execution of a writ against his property at Terrigal is being pursued. That is being pursued despite what transpired in the bankruptcy proceedings which were not finally pursued and the views there expressed during the course of hearing by Raphael J (matter no 2136 of 2013).
On his evidence, in those proceedings Raphael J had given him leave to issue a subpoena for production of documents which he contended were also relevant in these proceedings, namely a "May 2009 Audit Report - Reasons for decision in respect of IFTC Broking Services Limited." That document, he contends, establishes that the tax the subject of the orders made against him in 2009 has been recovered from other respondents to those proceedings.
The Deputy Commissioner relied on the affidavit evidence of Mr Zafiriou, who has day-to-day conduct of these proceedings, which went to the ATO's computerised accounting system. That system records that Mr Bonaccorso had various liabilities, from time to time, for income tax instalments and pay as you go tax, as well as BAS liabilities, under the [Income Tax Assessment Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/). The total of his liabilities the subject of these proceedings, including interest, there recorded is $1,593,255.86. Copies of PAYG instalment advices issued to Mr Bonaccorso, including those issued for the October to December 2012 quarter, the January 2013 to March 2013 quarter, the April 2013 to June 2013, as well as advice as to how interest on outstanding PAYG was calculated, were annexed to his affidavit.
The Deputy Commissioner's case is that these proceedings are concerned with those tax liabilities, not the liabilities which were the subject of the 2009 proceedings, relying on [s 8AAZH(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazh.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) which provides: "Liability for RBA deficit debt 
If there is an RBA deficit debt on an RBA at the end of a day, the tax debtor is liable to pay to the Commonwealth the amount of the debt. The amount is due and payable at the end of that day."
Mr Zafiriou's evidence explains how Mr Bonaccorso's alleged RBA debt was calculated. On the submissions advanced for the Deputy Commissioner it is apparent that because Mr Bonaccorso has not filed a tax return since the orders made against him in Grimaldi (No 5), that those calculations depend at least, in part, on the assessment which was the subject of that order. That is said to follow from the provisions made in <case>-405, <case>-325 and <case>-330, which defines a taxpayer's "base assessment" to be the latest assessment for the most recent year in which an assessment had been made, in his case for the 2008 tax year.
The Deputy Commissioner's case is that the alleged tax debt pursued in these proceedings is thus not the same tax which was the subject of the order made in Grimaldi (No 5). It is the effects of [s 8AAZC(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazc.html) and [s 8AAZD(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazd.html) which were relied on to establish an RBA for Mr Bonaccorso and to allocate a primary tax debt, as defined in [s 8AAZA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aaza.html) [Sections 8AAZI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazi.html) and [8AAZJ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazj.html) are also relied on. They provide: "8AAZI - RBA statement to be evidence 
The production of an RBA statement:  is prima facie evidence that the RBA was duly kept; and  is prima facie evidence that the amounts and particulars in the statement are correct. 
In this section: 
RBA statement includes a document that purports to be a copy of an
RBA statement and is signed by the Commissioner or a delegate of the
Commissioner or by a Second Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner. 
AAZJ - Evidentiary certificate about RBA transactions etc. 
In proceedings for recovery of an RBA deficit debt, a Commissioner's certificate stating any of the following matters in respect of a specified RBA is prima facie evidence of those matters:  that no tax debts (other than general interest charge on the RBA deficit debt) were allocated to the RBA after the balance date shown on a specified RBA statement for the RBA;  that general interest charge is payable on the RBA deficit debt, as specified in the certificate;  that payments and credits were allocated to the RBA, as specified in the certificate;  that a specified amount was the RBA deficit debt on the date of the certificate. 
In this section: 
Commissioner's certificate means a certificate signed by the
Commissioner or a delegate of the Commissioner, or by a Second Commissioner or
Deputy Commissioner."
It is in that way that the 2009 assessment is said to be relevant to the tax debt which the Commissioner pursues. Section 45-[15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s15.html) permits the Commissioner to give a tax payer an instalment rate of the kind served on Mr Bonaccorso. It is <case>-112 which imposes a liability on tax payers to pay instalment amounts of the kind served on Mr Bonaccorso.
Section 45-50 imposes liability on such a tax payer to pay quarterly instalments, at the time specified, in Mr Bonaccorso's case, in <case>-61(b). Section 45-130(a), which the Commissioner contends applies to Mr Bonaccorso, defines "quarterly". It provides: "45-130 Quarterly payer who pays on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax 
You are a quarterly payer who pays on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax if, at the end of the * starting instalment quarter in an income year:  you are an individual who is not an *annual payer, a *monthly payer or a *quarterly payer who pays on the basis of instalment income; or  ..."
It is <case>-80 which makes provisions as to general interest. In the result, the Deputy Commissioner contends, prima facie effect must be given to the RBA statements and evidentiary certificates served on Mr Bonaccorso. The Deputy Commissioner accepted, however, that these provisions left open the possibility that Mr Bonaccorso could lead evidence at the hearing to establish that they were not accurate, for example.
What is evident from the case which the Deputy Commissioner so advances is that what is now pursued against Mr Bonaccorso has been calculated by reference to the amount specified in the assessment which became the subject of the order made against him in Grimaldi (No. 5). That was the Commissioner's last issued tax assessment for Mr Bonaccorso. Ordinarily such assessments cannot be challenged in a court such as this. Such a challenge must be pursued in the AAT, a course which Mr Bonaccorso in fact took, but abandoned (see <case> of the Income Tax assessment Act).
Mr Bonaccorso's case is, however, that the Commissioner accepted in those proceedings that the same tax could not be twice recovered from different tax payers and such payment is evidenced by the deed of settlement between the Commissioner other respondents to the 2009 proceedings. The tax the subject of his 2009 assessment was, as events later unfolded, not recoverable from him, that it having been recovered by the Commissioner from other taxpayers respondent to those proceedings, who were also assessed to have been responsible for tax on the income the subject of those assessments.
That, it seems to me, cannot simply be dismissed as an unarguable basis for Mr Bonaccorso's challenge to the Commissioner's calculation of the debt he is claimed to have for the 2013 tax year. If he were able to establish that the 2013 assessment, in reality, involves double recovery of tax on the income the subject of the 2009 proceedings, because firstly, that some, or all of that tax has already been recovered from another taxpayer and secondly, that any later assessment cannot, as a result, be based on tax that was not payable by him, as Graham J discussed in Grimaldi (No 9), it might be expected that the Court would intervene.
Furthermore, were that to be shown, as a model litigant it might be expected that the Deputy Commissioner would not press its case further against Mr Bonaccorso.
Mr Bonaccorso also seeks to rely on a tax return which showed that he purportedly owed $1,616,651.35 tax, which he alleges was fraudulently lodged, without his consent or authority. Mr Bonaccorso also contends that the Deputy Commissioner has unclean hands and must be refused equitable relief. Mere silent acquiescence and partaking the benefits of such fraud, on his case was sufficient. It is more difficult to see the basis of these submissions.
Despite, however, what does appear to be arguable by Mr Bonaccorso, none of his submissions established a basis for the conclusion that Mr Bonaccorso has met the heavy onus which falls upon him on his strike out application, to show that the Deputy Commissioner's case has a "fanciful" prospect of success, or that the outcome of these proceedings is so certain, that it would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow the proceedings to go forward. In the result, no strike out order can be made.

The notices to produce and subpoena
The Commissioner contends that relevant documents have been served and that Mr Bonaccorso's notices and subpoena otherwise seeks the production of documents which are irrelevant to what is in issue in these proceedings and hence should be set aside.
Mr Bonaccorso pressed his case, submitting that advice he had received from the Deputy Commissioner's solicitors, as to how his tax had been calculated under statutory provisions on which those calculations were based and the documents he had been served were "absurd". He also submitted: "How does someone earn $3.9 million. It is beyond my belief, especially when someone has not even lodged a tax return to the Australian Taxation Office so that is why I have asked the plaintiff to produce the documents, to come up with them manually, entering figures into a running balance account which they admit themselves they can just put in manually so has that figure been put in accidentally or fraudulently. 
That is why I ask your Honour, one must say either it was put in accidentally or it was put in fraudulently."
The documents which he pursues, which go to the matters the subject of the assessment the subject of the 2009 proceedings, do not appear to be relevant to what is in issue in these proceedings.
As I have explained Mr Bonaccorso's case does rest, in large part, on the conclusions reached in the 2009 proceedings and what later eventuated as to the payment of the income tax the subject of those proceedings and the consequences of those payments, for the calculation of tax which he might owe, under the statutory scheme, in later years. That is why Mr Bonaccorso relied on the Deputy Commissioner's pursuit, on two occasions, of bankruptcy proceedings, which were withdrawn after his pursuit of a subpoena which he had issued in those proceedings, which he claimed evidenced that the tax the subject of the 2009 order had been paid by others.
Mr Bonaccorso also contends that such documents are thus also relevant to his defence to the Deputy Commissioner's claim that he has an obligation to pay further tax for the 2013 year.
In the May 2015 notice to produce he thus seeks production of: "The Document issued in or about May 2009 by the Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation as Known as the "Audit Report - Reason For the Decision of IFTC
Broking Services Limited ( without limitations including all attachments A, B
C, etc - being the audit report with information relating to the alternative assessment in relation to the assessable income from the sale of MMX shares and options and share trading activity of RLB)."
The apparent relevance of the other documents which Mr Bonaccorso seeks to pursue, so far as these proceedings are concerned, is that thereby, as I have explained, he seeks to challenge the existence not only of the legislative scheme pursuant to which the Deputy Commissioner claims Mr Bonaccorso's tax liability for the 2013 tax year rests, but the very existence of the Commonwealth of Australia and its [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), the laws enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament under that [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and the appointment of the Deputy Commissioner and other ATO officers, to their respective offices under those laws.
Nothing advanced by Mr Bonaccorso established a conceivably arguable basis for all of those challenges. Nothing which he has submitted suggests that what is sought to be produced is pursued for a legitimate forensic purpose, or that its production is pursued bona fide. To permit the pursuit of such documents would be oppressive and an obvious abuse of the Court's processes. They do not have any apparent relevance to what is in truth in issue in these proceedings.

Other relief
Final relief, such as an order for damages in Mr Bonaccorso's favour, or removal of a writ and orders under the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca195882/), which were not in truth pressed on the case which Mr Bonaccorso finally advanced, also cannot be entertained.

Notices Quo Warranto
I should finally observe that Mr Bonaccorso variously sought the issue of such notices and, in his final submissions, claimed that such a notice had already been issued.
[Section 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s12.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) provides that: "12 Quo warranto 
Informations in the nature of quo warranto are abolished."
It follows that the leave sought may not be granted and that Mr Bonaccorso is not entitled to pursue information by way of such a notice.

Costs
The usual order under the Rules is that costs, as agreed or assessed, follow the event. The parties should consider the question of costs and provide short written submissions as to any costs order which they seek, within 14 days.

ORDERS
Otherwise, for the reasons given, I make the following orders: * (1) Mr Bonaccorso's notices to produce and subpoena are set aside, other than as to the document described at [85].
* (2) Mr Bonaccorso has leave to file a further defence, within 21 days.
* (3) Otherwise Mr Bonaccorso's motions are dismissed.
* (4) The proceedings are otherwise adjourned to the Registrar's list on 3 June 2016.
