JUDGMENT: 
THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG CJ in Eq 
FRIDAY 27 APRIL 2001 /01 - MALOUF versus O'DONOHOE 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: This is an ex parte application made under [section
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74k.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) to extend a caveat. The statute requires that no ex parte application to extend a caveat is to be entertained unless the Court has dispensed with service.
 At least since the decision of the then Chief Judge in Equity in
Wonderland Business Park Pty Ltd versus Hartford Lane Pty Ltd [[2001] NSWSC ] noted in [75 ALJ 226], the Court almost never makes an order of this nature ex parte. It is extremely difficult to see any justification for dispensing with service in cases where lawyers have left their application for dispensing with service to the last day and no other factor is present. Indeed it is difficult to see when the Court would ever be justified in dispensing with service in a case where there was an identifiable caveator in the jurisdiction.
 However, as the practice may have been a little lax over the last few years
I will on this occasion make an order under <case> O allowing a fresh caveat to be lodged in identical terms to the current caveat, on condition that that caveat will be withdrawn next Wednesday, 2 May 2001, unless the Court extends the period.
 I am doing this for two reasons; first, because there appears to have been genuine inadvertence in the instant case, rather than it being one where the application was deliberately left to the last day; secondly, there would not appear to be an impending contrary dealing and it is only fair that a short time be allowed for the profession to come to grips with the current practice.
