AUST YIEH STAINLESS PTY LIMITED (ACN 076 379 587) 
Plaintiff 
HORANS STEEL PTY LIMITED (ACN 000 048 233) 
Defendant 
JUDGMENT -- ex tempore  March 2000 The Plaintiff applies by Notice of Motion for the substitution of contrary orders to those made by the Registrar on 2 November 1999. Essentially, the
Registrar declined to wind-up the First Defendant and the Plaintiff presses the Court to substitute orders which would have the effect that the First
Defendant would be wound up.
 This is in circumstances where: 
The Defendant did not apply to set the Plaintiff's Statutory Demand aside and in particular did not contend that the Defendant was solvent, and 
Where it is common ground that even if the Defendant were to pay the whole amount of the Statutory Demand the Defendant would be solvent.
 The Plaintiff's argument depends upon the incorrect proposition that the
Defendant should have applied for leave of the Court under s459S(1) of the
Corporations Law as a mandatory pre-condition to opposing the application for winding up. Then it is said, correctly that the Defendant has not done so; it is also said that the Defendant could not have got this leave in any event.
This, it is said, is because the Defendant necessarily would be relying on a ground which, in the words of s459S(1), "(a) that the company relied on for the purposes of an application by it for the demand to be said aside; or that the company could have so relied on, but did not so rely on (whether it made such an application or not)." In a context where general solvency is now relied upon to resist winding up, that proposition is based upon the premise that a corporation could have raised general solvency earlier in support of an application for a demand to be set aside.
 There is clear authority refuting that premise, holding that solvency is not a ground on which a statutory demand may be set aside: Chippendale Printing
Co Pty Ltd versus Commissioner of Taxation [(1995) 13 ACLC 229] at -243; Liverpool Cement Renderers (Aust) Pty Ltd versus Landmarks Constructions
Pty Ltd [(1996) 19 ACSR 411] at 418;
Elite Motor Campers Australia versus Leisureport Pty Ltd [(1996) 14 ACLC ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2014%20ACLC%201759 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 1762-1763; Master Paving Pty Ltd versus Heading Contractors Pty Ltd [(1997) ACLC 1025] at 1031-1032; Mandarin International Developments Pty Ltd v
Growthcorp (Australia) Pty Ltd (Santow J, 23 March 1998 unreported). It follows that a defendant company is not prevented by s459S from raising general solvency as a defence at the hearing of the application; indeed that is the proper course.
 It should be mentioned that Young J in Kekatos versus Holmark Construction Co
Pty Ltd [(1995) 13 ACLC 1581] purported to grant leave to a defendant company under s459S to adduce, at the hearing of the winding up application, evidence that it was solvent. The grant of such leave was also assumed to be possible by me in Alcatel Australia Ltd versus P R B
Holdings Pty Ltd [(1998) 27 ACSR 708] at 713; see also McPherson, The Law of Company Liquidation (4th edition, 1999) at page
However, in Kekatos the point does not seem to have been debated and the
Chippendale decision was not cited. In Alcatel the relevant statement by me was obiter, but at the same time I reaffirmed the line of authority which has been set out above: see at 712. That line of authority should be followed and applied by the Court in this case. In any event, if the Defendant had required leave under s459S to prove its solvency contrary to my conclusion that it did not, then it would clearly have been appropriate to grant such leave: compare
Kekatos at 1582.
 There is nothing in the Court of Appeal's recent decision in Switz v
Glowbind ([2000] NSWCA 37, 10 March 2000, unreported) in any way contradicting these propositions. That judgment bears rather upon the implications of the presumption of insolvency following the failure to meet a statutory demand or set it aside. It is for the company concerned to establish solvency, the onus being squarely upon it to do so, unaffected by how the party with the statutory demand chooses to argue solvency at the s459S application stage. Those issues do not arise here.
 It follows that the Registrar's decision was correct and the Plaintiff's motion should be dismissed with costs.
