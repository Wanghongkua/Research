On 15 August 1989 the respondent lodged a claim for the subject land in the
County of Cumberland under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act . On 1
February 1996 the appellant (Minister) refused the claim on the ground that it was needed for the essential public purpose of nature conservation. The respondent challenged this decision in the Land and Environment Court. The trial Judge concluded that the essential public purpose of nature conservation could be served without refusing the claim. He also found that the Minister had not discharged the onus of proof that the land was needed for this purpose and granted the claim. The Minister appealed.

HELD: Dismissing the appeal: (1) In assessing the refusal of a claim on the ground in <case> (1)(c) that "the land is needed or likely to be needed for an essential public purpose" it is not relevant to consider whether that purpose could have been achieved without refusing the claim. (2) The issue under <case>(c) is essentially a question of fact. NSW Aboriginal Land Council versus Minister [(1988) 14 NSWLR 685] applied.

Appeal dismissed with costs. 
MINISTER ADMINISTERING THE [CROWN LANDS ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/) v

DEERUBBIN LOCAL ABORIGINAL LAND COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT 
MEAGHER JA: This is an appeal from the decision of Sheahan J of the Land and Environment Court of NSW, delivered 14 August 1997. Sheahan J allowed an appeal from the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council (the respondent in these proceedings "the DLALC") against the decision of the Minister Administering the [Crown Lands Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/) (the appellant and "the Minister") to refuse a claim to certain lands. 
On 15 August 1989 a claim was lodged, as anticipated by the [Aboriginal Land
Rights Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/), by the respondent to lands comprising portions 172 and 173, Parish of Londonderry,
County of Cumberland. On 1 February 1996, the appellant decided to refuse the claim and communicated that decision to the respondent. The reasons for refusal distinguished between two portions of the lands claimed: i in respect of a strip of the land, the Minister refused the claim on the basis that it was needed for the essential public purpose of access or road widening; and ii in respect of most of the land, it was needed for the essential public purpose of nature conservation.

If the Minister is satisfied that lands claimed are "claimable Crown lands", or a portion of the land is claimable, then the Minister must transfer those lands to the claimant: [s (5)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html)
If the Minister finds that the lands are not "claimable Crown lands" then the claim must, with one exception mentioned below, be refused: [s (5)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) 
Whether lands are "claimable Crown lands" depends on whether the lands satisfy the various requirements of [s (1):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) Claims to Crown lands 
In this section, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires: claimable Crown lands means lands vested in Her Majesty that, when a claim is made for the lands under this Division: are able to be lawfully sold or leased, or are reserved or dedicated for any purpose, under the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913 or the western
Lands Act 1901, are not lawfully used or occupied, do not comprise lands which, in the opinion of a Crown Lands Minister, are needed or are likely to be needed as residential lands, are not needed, nor likely to be needed, for an essential public purpose, and ...

The Minister, in refusing the claim, relied upon <case>(c). The Minister conceded that the other requirements of <case> were satisfied. Unless the
Minister proceeds to grant a claim in accordance with <case>(5A) the claim must be refused. Section 36(5A) allows the Minister to avoid the statutory prohibition to granting a claim where "the lands are needed, or likely to be needed, for an essential public purpose, but that the need for the lands for the public purpose would be met if the claim were to be granted... subject to the imposition of a condition... relating to the use of the lands" and the relevant Aboriginal Land Council agrees to the condition. Such a conditional grant is wholly discretionary and one which, in the present case, the Minister chose not to exercise. Nothing much turns on this issue in these proceedings.

Following refusal of the claim by the Minister, the respondent in these proceedings appealed to the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales on the basis that the lands did satisfy <case>(c). In other words, the respondent asserted that the lands were "not needed nor likely to be needed for an essential public purpose" as at the date the claim was made, namely 15
August 1989. Such an appeal proceeds by way of full, de novo, hearing and the court has available to it all of the "functions and discretions" of the decision-maker: <case> [Land and Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/). As stated, Sheahan J allowed the appeal and determined that the lands in question did, as at the date of the claim, satisfy [s (1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s36.html)
The appeal to this court is on a question of law: essentially that his Honour misconstrued [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s36.html) and that his misconstruction infected his findings to such an extent that the decision is to be regarded as erroneous.

It is quite clear that his Honour did entertain considerations irrelevant to the question he needed to decide. He misstated the law not once but many times. It is only necessary to deal with the larger portion of land, "needed" for nature conservation; the smaller strip "needed" for access does not seem to be the subject of any appeal.

First, his Honour stated that "[i]f the [essential public] purpose can be fulfilled otherwise than by maintaining a particular system of land tenure, it cannot be said that the land is `needed' for that purpose". Later his honour said: "It is fundamental to DLALC's case that it is not `essential' to the achievement of the `public purpose' of `nature conservation' that the state retain ownership or total control of the land". Then: 
Hence, in contrast to other traditional public uses, such as roads, schools, hospitals, etc., the public purpose of nature conservation does not necessarily require relevant lands to remain in public ownership.
 ...

The Minister must, therefore, satisfy the court that, as at 15 August 1989, the conservation values of this land were such as to require its retention in public ownership to recognise that the public purpose of its protection could be satisfied only by so doing.
 ...

The Court is satisfied that the conservation values on the land are quite high, but is not satisfied that their protection requires the claim to be refused.

In this regard, no evidence has been presented that maintaining the land in public ownership as a nature reserve is the only, or even the best, way to afford those values the necessary protection.

Later still: 
It is DLALC's submission that the purposes of nature conservation could properly be satisfied in 1989, and since, by employing any of a number of mechanisms, without the ownership of the land necessarily remaining public, as the relevant statutory schemes and provisions can apply to the land regardless of its tenure.

All of these passages display a fundamental error. It is totally irrelevant in determining whether or not [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s36.html) has been satisfied to consider whether the essential public purpose could have been achieved in some other manner. It is not correct that lands cannot be "needed or likely to be needed" for the public purpose just because that public purpose may be (or is likely to be) achieved even if the lands are not in public ownership. On one view, that is the purpose of the insertion of [s (5A).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s36.html)
Similarly, it is irrelevant to inquire as to whether the best method of ensuring that the public purpose is achieved is keeping the lands in public ownership. The question is simply whether the land was, at the date of the claim, needed or likely to be needed for an essential public purpose. That question does not involve an extensive inquiry into whether the purpose can somehow otherwise be achieved; it is essentially a question of the view held by the government of the day the claim was made.

His Honour then reached his conclusion in the following fashion: 
Counsel for DLALC asks the Court to infer from this history that as at 15
August 1989 the real hierarchy of public purposes evidenced by the three relevant State agencies was (to put it simplistically): possible urban development (Department of Lands).
 possible expansion of the state forest (Forestry Commission).
 nature conservation (NPWS [NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service]).

None of these purposes seems to have been regarded as "essential" in the view of those respective agencies, and, although involved, at relevant times, in other local issues like urban development, waste proposals, assessment of road needs, and the expansion of nearby corrective service facilities, the then
Department of Planning appears to have remained silent on what use should best be made of the land.

With the passage of years, the State appears to have reserved the above hierarchy, and asks the Court now to give effect to that reversal retrospectively, and find that the land was "needed" in 1989 for nature conservation as an "essential public purpose".

I have come to the conclusion that the Minister has not discharged the onus of proof in this regard.

Accordingly, I uphold the appeal and grant the claim.

His Honour concluded that the Minister had not discharged the onus of proving that the lands were "needed" for the "essential" public purpose of nature conservation on 15 August 1989. Standing alone that finding would be practically unassailable. However, the finding is qualified by his Honour's erroneous understanding of the terms "need" and "essential", misunderstandings which pepper his judgment. It is impossible to divorce those misunderstandings from his ultimate findings and, accordingly, this aspect of the appeal must be allowed.

It should also be stated that, in my view, it does not matter whether the essential public purpose of the day when the Minister makes his decision is different from the perceived essential public purpose of the day the claim was made. That ignores the practical reality of politics. If land is said to be "needed" for three different purposes by three different Ministers of the
Crown, that does not mean the land is not needed at all. It means that there are three conflicting needs. Land which was once "needed" for urban development may, by the time the government actually gets around to doing something about it, be "needed" for nature conservation or some other essential public purpose. Accordingly, the hierarchy of public purposes is irrelevant. There need only be one essential public purpose at the time the claim is made; by the time the Minister makes the decision that public purpose may be lower down the list (or even absent from the list) of essential public purposes. The Land and Environment Court need not, on an appeal, retrospectively reverse the hierarchy; it needs to determine whether the land was needed or likely to be needed for an essential public purpose at the time a claim is made.

I propose the following orders: i appeal allowed; ii orders of Sheahan J set aside; iii the matter be remitted to the Land and Environment Court of NSW for re- hearing of that part of the Sheahan J's decision which was appealed to this
Court; and iv costs of the appeal abide the costs of the re-hearing 
MINISTER ADMINISTERING THE [CROWN LANDS ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/) versus DEERUBBIN LOCAL ABORIGINAL LAND COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY & POWELL JJA: We have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Meagher JA in this appeal. He sets out the relevant facts, the statutory provisions, and the history of the proceedings, and we need not repeat these matters. We agree with almost everything Meagher JA has written except his conclusion that the trial Judge's ultimate findings were vitiated for errors of law earlier in his reasons. 
No appeal has been brought to this Court from the order in respect of the small parcel of land which had been identified as required for road widening in 1964, and had been gazetted for that purpose in 1968. The matter was not argued before us, but the failure to appeal seems to have been the result of an oversight on the part of the appellant's legal advisers which may have unfortunate consequences for the public since land vested in an Aboriginal
Land Council cannot be resumed except by an Act of Parliament ([Aboriginal
Land Rights Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) , [s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s42.html) 
The land that was the subject of the appeal was claimable Crown land within s (1)(a) of the Act which, at the date of claim, had not been reserved or dedicated for any purpose under the [Crown Lands
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/). Thus it could lawfully be sold or leased to members of the public, which was not a promising start for the Minister's case under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/s36.html) (1)(c) that the lands were needed, or likely to be needed, for an essential public purpose.

The trial Judge made the findings at pp 33-4 of the appeal book which are quoted by Meagher JA at pp 4-5 of his reasons. These are findings of fact which, as he said, standing alone, would be practically unassailable. The relevant principles were stated in NSW Aboriginal Land Council versus Minister [(1988) 14 NSWLR 685] at 691-2 by Hope JA as follows: "... the definition of `claimable Crown lands' in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/s36.html) (1) fixes the time as at which the conditions which it specifies must be satisfied as the time when the claim for the lands is made. It does not require the conditions to be satisfied at some later time, as, for example, when the
Minister investigates the matter or when the Court, on appeal, investigates it. What the Minister was then required to do under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/s36.html) (5) was to investigate whether the land the subject of the claim satisfied the conditions of the definition at the time the claim was made, and if so satisfied he was required ... to transfer the land to the claimant Land
Council in fee simple. He had no discretion in the matter; he was simply required to look at a state of facts existing at the date of the claim.

The nature of his enquiry was not affected by the circumstance that the resolution of the question might be difficult or might involve questions of judgment. Thus the nature of the question whether the land is likely to be needed for an essential public purpose as at the date of the claim is a question of fact ... no question of discretion would be involved".

Since the appeal to this Court in cases of this kind is limited to questions of law, the findings of fact were in truth unassailable.

The word "needed" in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cla134/s36.html) (1)(c) means "required". The Land & Environment Court on an appeal from the
Minister under this Act would not be called upon to second guess, for example, a decision by the Executive Government that Sydney needed a second major airport, and that it should be located at Badgery's Creek. The only question for the Court in such a case would be whether a second airport for Sydney was an essential public purpose, and if so whether the particular land was needed, that is required or wanted, by the Executive Government for that purpose.

When the trial Judge said that none of the public purposes identified for this land by the various government agencies in August 1989 were regarded by them as "essential", we do not understand him to be saying that those purposes, in the abstract, were not essential public purposes. His use of inverted commas around "essential" indicates otherwise. Properly understood he was saying that the agencies did not really consider that this land was needed for those purposes.

The trial Judge also held that the Minister had not discharged the onus of proof imposed on him (s 36 (7)) in the appeal. This finding, and the earlier finding about the attitude of the agencies were straightforward findings of fact. The variety of public purposes suggested by the different agencies, their lack of interest in the years before and after the claim, and the fluctuating priorities demonstrated in the evidence provided ample support for these findings.

The Judge found that nature conservation was third in the order of public purposes suggested by the agencies in 1989. This alone entitled him to find that it was not needed for this essential public purpose. The relationship between the fulfilment of this public purpose and the tenure of the land was not material to his reasoning leading to this ultimate finding. His errors of law therefore related to different and, in this case, with respect irrelevant, questions. In Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd versus Darling Harbour Authority [(1991) 24 NSWLR 156] Handley JA said at 177: "The relevant principles are ... correctly stated by Moffitt P in Leichhardt
Municipal Council versus Seatainer Terminals Pty Ltd [(1981) 48 LGRA 409] at 419 as follows: `... It is not sufficient to show that some error of law appears in the judgment ... The error has to be one upon which the decision depends, so the decision is vitiated by the error ... It will not suffice to establish that one or some only of a number of alternate findings upon which the decision was given involved errors of law, if one alternative involved no error of law'.

The same approach has guided the Federal Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to review decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for errors of law ...".

In these circumstances the earlier errors of law exposed in the Judge's reasoning do not vitiate his ultimate findings. In our opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
