 `MAXWELL JOHN WALMSLEY versus KERRIE ANNE STANTON` `1862/96 ` `THURSDAY 27 FEBRUARY 1997` `SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is a claim made under the general principles of equity by a man who is registered as joint tenant with a woman, the defendant, of property under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) at 3 Seabrook
Avenue, Grays Point.` ` Both parties are now in ill health, but, in October 1986, they were facing life with a desire to get married and to live together in the property that I have mentioned. Unfortunately, that was not to be. The parties separated late in 1986; the defendant went back to her mother. However, they got together again in 1989.` ` The plaintiff says that the relationship ceased again later in 1989, but, from time to time, they would meet together, have sexual intercourse and support each other. He says that they did not live together as man and wife after 1989.` ` The defendant, on the other hand, says that the parties continually lived together as husband and wife from about August 1989 through to August 1995. In support of her claim she puts forward her own oral evidence together with various medical notes from the St George Hospital, where the plaintiff was being cared for, which described her as "the principal carer" or "the girlfriend" or "the fiancee of fourteen years" and she also produced bundles of photographs.` ` The key document in the case, however, is exhibit PX02, that was a form of [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) transfer which was prepared by the plaintiff's solicitor, Mr Howes, in May
Mr Walmsley, the plaintiff, says that some day late in 1989, he thinks about 15 October, he went with the defendant to 15 Ventura Avenue, Miranda, nearby, and asked a Mr Noel Draper, who lived there, to witness the signatures of himself and the defendant to a transfer whereby the defendant and the plaintiff transferred to the plaintiff the whole of the property for $1. This transfer has not yet been registered; indeed since 10 March 1996, a caveat lodged by the defendant has prevented its registration.` ` Mr Draper's evidence is that, whilst he could not be 100 per cent sure, he is fairly sure that the woman who was in his house on that day and who signed the document in his presence was the defendant. The plaintiff says it was the defendant. The defendant denies this and has done so for the last two years.` ` There are admitted signatures of the defendant before the court. These are the signatures on her affidavit and as part of exhibit PX03, the admitted signature on the caveat. In each case there is a very distinctive "K" used in the signature and there is a flourish from the end of the "n" in Stanton back to the capital "S" in Stanton and then across the two "t's". Although the signatures are different, because one is "K A Stanton", one is "K Stanton", and one is "Kerrie Stanton", they are very similar in essentials. It must be remembered that this was not a document which was prepared secretly in someone's study where there could be time to trace or forge a signature; it was signed in the normal way in the presence of Mr Draper who had no axe to grind with either of the parties. Mr Draper saw the signature affixed, it was affixed quickly and in the absence of any handwriting expert evidence to the contrary, the only conclusion is, on the balance of probabilities, that it is the defendant's signature. If she has lied about that essential point, I find it impossible, when I can't see any reason to disbelieve the plaintiff after he was cross-examined, to accept the defendant's evidence against the plaintiff.` ` Accordingly, I cannot find that there was a de facto relationship in the appropriate period and the cross-claim must fail.` ` So far as the claim is concerned, the evidence is that the property was bought in anticipation of a marriage which never took place and it was, perhaps, bought in anticipation by the parties of it being their joint home in which they would live together.` `` The plaintiff says, and I accept him, that there was intermittent cohabitation after 1989 and the fact that the defendant could sign the transfer in 1989 again either operates as an admission that she recognised that the relationship had come to an end or, as Mr Walmsley put it, that she was a trustee of a resulting trust with an obligation to transfer her interest to the beneficiary.

One way of looking at the case is that there was a resulting or constructive trust, because the prime purpose of the trust had failed. Thus, the parties, in equity, owned the property in proportion to their contributions. As both were liable to the St George Bank for the $24,000 mortgage and the total costs together with stamp duty, et cetera, were $121,461.30, the defendant was entitled, subject to a proviso, to the fraction of the property where the numerator is 12,000 and the denominator is 121,461.30. One then multiplies this by the present value of the property. The only valuation evidence is that the property was worth $205,000 in 1989. For the purpose of illustration only, if $205,000 were still its value, the defendant would be entitled to $20,253.36. However, set against that would have to be the amount which the plaintiff paid to the St George Bank which the defendant ought to have paid.
She says she paid half in cash most of the time but I don't believe that. It would seem to me that at the rate at which mortgage payments had to be made that this would eat up the whole of the $20,253.36.

Accordingly, when one looks at the matter in this technical way or when one looks at the transfer of 1989 as an acknowledgment that the property was the plaintiff's, one gets the same result.

The plaintiff is entitled to the order that he seeks that the defendant holds her interest in trust for the plaintiff so that I make orders 1 and 2 in the summons. I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings and grant liberty to apply generally. The exhibits may be returned.
