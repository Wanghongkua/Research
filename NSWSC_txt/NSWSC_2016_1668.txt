JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst, as here, there is an application pending for an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the Act.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 22 November 2016. In that affidavit Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer as defined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to her suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or serious crime-related activities, namely, dealing with the proceeds of crime being reckless as to whether it is the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193B(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . That is a serious criminal offence under <case>(d) of the Act being an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.
Although the Defendant has not been charged with any offence at the present time, Ms Bourne sets out in some detail in her affidavit the material facts which causes her to hold the suspicion to which I have referred. It is not necessary to detail all of that information. Her suspicion is justified by the material which relates the Defendant to two persons in particular, Email Badalyan and Vahe (Wayne) Geokjian. Those persons are known to be involved in the importation and distribution of drugs. The information also discloses the handing over of large sums of money by the Defendant to a number of persons for the purpose of that money being remitted overseas.
I am satisfied that the material upon which Ms Bourne relies justifies the reasonable suspicion held by her that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity involving dealing with the proceeds of crime.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10a.html) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the authorised officer's suspicion. As I have indicated, there are such reasonable grounds.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to a defendant before an order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of the evidence contained in Ms Bourne's affidavit concerning the speed with which persons are able to alienate property in their possession, and noting the nature of the offence involved, I do not consider that the Defendant should be given notice of this application before the order is made. The Defendant in any event has the rights of review set out in [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10c.html) of the Act.
I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given by Senior Counsel for the Plaintiff.
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8 of the order provided. I grant the leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 3 and 6. I order that the costs should be costs in the cause. The balance of the summons is stood over for mention to 20 March 2017 before the Registrar. These orders may be entered forthwith.
