JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On Public Interest Immunity claim by NSW Police Service re confidential exhibits A and B to affidavit of Deputy Commissioner Moroney sworn 3 March 2000 - T4456) HIS HONOUR: A subpoena was issued by the solicitors for the plaintiff on 3
February 2000 directed to the proper officer of the New South Wales Police
Service.
 Documents caught by the subpoena, but in an edited version, were the subject of a ruling by me on 2 March 2000 (NSWSC 112: DLJT 105).
 An application founded upon public interest immunity has been made on behalf of the Police Service and I have read an affidavit filed in court of Deputy
Commissioner Moroney sworn on 3 March 2000, to which there are two confidential exhibits. I have read those confidential exhibits.
 I uphold the claim for public interest immunity, as it rests in one of the accepted categories thereof.
 Inspection of the documents is refused and the confidential exhibits to Mr
Moroney's affidavit will forthwith be returned.
