Smith versus Sadler Matter No 4564/97 [1998] NSWSC 146 (8 May 1998) 
Last Updated: 22 May 1998 `GRAHAM SMITH versus GARY R SADLER` ` 4564/97` `8 May 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` `JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: This matter was heard by me on 29 October 1997 as a matter of urgency. There were faults on both sides. It appeared that the defendant was holding a meeting at a place where the representatives of the plaintiff could not attend. When the matter actually came on at 10 o'clock most of the difficulties fell away. Accordingly no order was necessary and the only thing remaining was for the costs. 
Today I have heard evidence on the question of costs and there is evidence as to whether the plaintiff Mr Smith was the proper plaintiff and whether in any event his wife could have attended the meeting as representative of the corporate entity which was a principal of the defendant. However, the main debate when the matter came before me was not on parties but was on the existence or non-existence of an apprehended violence order and the apparent exclusion of the natural plaintiff from a meeting which he was prima facie entitled to attend.

I think because of the difficulties on the plaintiff's side and because of the attitude then taken by the defendant that these proceedings should now be dismissed with no order as to costs.
