JUDGMENT
REIN J: These proceedings concern a partnership entered into by the plaintiff, Mrs Deborah Raulfs ("Mrs Raulfs") with Fishy Bite Pty Ltd ("Fishy Bite") a company which was controlled by, and the shares in which were owned by, Mr Louis Michael Ajaka ("Mr Ajaka"). In my reasons for judgment delivered on 2 March 2011 (see Deborah Raulfs versus Fishy Bite Pty Ltd  <case> I found that Mrs Raulfs had agreed to pay $400K into the partnership and that Fishy Bite, within days of her payment, had wrongly removed $400K from the partnership account for purposes unconnected with the partnership business and for the benefit of Mr Ajaka. Mrs Raulfs sought the repayment to her of the $400K by Fishy Bite and Mr Ajaka but I held that she had taken steps inconsistent with any right to rescind the partnership agreement and was not entitled to refund of the money paid on any of the various different bases asserted. I held however (see [95]) that Fishy Bite and Mr Ajaka were required to pay the $400K plus interest to the receiver of the partnership business who had been appointed on 3 October 2008 on the application of Mrs Raulfs. I rejected a claim by Mrs Raulfs against Mr Ajaka's de facto wife.
Following my judgment the parties on 8 March 2011 agreed on the form of orders which should be made and they were as follows: 
Declaration that the $400,000.00 paid by the plaintiff to the first defendant on 27 July 2006 was paid by the plaintiff to the first defendant as a contribution to the capital of the partnership created between the plaintiff and first defendant by written agreement dated 27 July 2006 [the Partnership].
Declaration that the first and second defendants are liable to pay the sum of $368,000.00 plus interest in the sum of $156,430.62 pursuant to s. 100 of the Civil Procedure Act from 26 October 2006 being a total of $524,430.62 [the
Judgment Sum] for the benefit of partnership.
Order that the first and second defendants pay the Judgment Sum to a controlled monies account to be held by the solicitors for the plaintiff and first and second defendants jointly, such monies to be dispersed in accordance with the entitlements of the plaintiff and first defendant as parties to the
Partnership.
The parties' entitlements as partners to the monies in the controlled monies account described in paragraph 3 above shall be either agreed between the parties or in the absence of agreement shall be determined pursuant to the liberty to apply referred to below. 
Liberty to the parties to apply on three days' notice if necessary to give effect to the provisions thereof [sic].
The plaintiffs claim against the third defendant is dismissed.
Other than for the relief granted herein the Further Amended Statement of
Claim be dismissed.
The Cross Claim is dismissed.
Costs: The Court orders: the first and second defendants pay 70% of the plaintiffs costs of the proceedings the first and second defendants pay the third defendants costs of the proceedings
Matter stand over for directions, Wednesday, 30 March 2011 at 9:30am before Rein J.
Mrs Raulfs appealed the judgment and Fishy Bite and Mr Ajaka cross appealed against the costs order made.
The Court of Appeal rejected Mrs Raulfs' appeal and upheld the cross appeal on costs: see Raulfs versus Fishy Bite Ltd  <case>
Mrs Raulfs then sought special leave in the High Court in relation to the dismissal of her appeal by the Court of Appeal. Special leave was refused.
The matter returned before me on a number of occasions due to the failure of Fishy Bite and Mr Ajaka to pay the $400K plus interest into the joint account. Mr Ajaka claimed that neither Fishy Bite nor he had the funds to pay the money which they had been ordered to pay in support of which assertion he filed several affidavits. 
By notice of motion Mrs Raulfs now seeks a variation of order 1 so that it reads: 
An order that the First and Second Defendants pay to the receiver of the Fishy
Bite partnership, Mr Christopher John Palmer the amount of $641, 799.72 as at the date of filing this motion along with interest thereon up to the date of payment currently at the rate of $129.31 per day.
 and in the alternative that the first and second defendant pay the said amount to her. She has also sought an order for the taking of accounts and other directions for the finalisation of the winding up of the Fishy Bite partnership.
Mr Sneddon of counsel appears for Mrs Raulfs and Mr Michos, solicitor appears for Mr Ajaka and Fishy Bite. Ms White, solicitor, appears for Mr Palmer. Mr Palmer does not oppose the making of the orders sought but has indicated that should the money not be paid to him in accordance with the first of the two proposed orders he would need to have his lien for payment of the $309K claimed for his fees recognised.

Variation of Order 3 in the Short Minutes of 8 March 2011
Mr Sneddon put the application for variation of order 3 on four bases: 
In reliance on [part .16(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p36.16) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) ("UCPR") which relevantly states: 
In addition to its powers under subrules (1) and (2), the court may set aside or vary any judgment or order except so far as it: determines any claim for relief, or determines any question (whether of fact or law or both) arising on any claim for relief, or dismisses proceedings, or dismisses proceedings so far as concerns the whole or any part of any claim for relief.

In reliance on the "liberty to apply" provision in the orders made on 8
March 2011.

In reliance on the inherent power of the Court as reflected in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s23.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) which provides: 
The Court shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales.

The slip rule (see [part .17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36.17) of the UCPR).
In relation to [part 36.16(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36.16) Mr Sneddon contended that: 
Rule 36.16(3) permits the Court to vary any judgment tor order provided that it does not fall into the category of (3)(a) or (b).

Rule 36.16(3) is not restricted by a time for application as is rule .16(1) (see (3A) and as is (3B).

That the order in respect of which variation is sought does not determine the claim for relief or determine any question arising on any claim for relief.
In relation to the "liberty to apply" provision, Mr Sneddon relies on what was said by Campbell JA (with whom Tobias JA agreed) in Australian Hardboards Ltd versus Hudson Investment Group <case>; [(2007) 70 NSWLR 201] at 244.
 ...
 [58] There is no difficulty about exercising a liberty to apply for the purpose of dealing with facts that have arisen only since the original order was made. Mahoney JA, in Wentworth versus Woollahra Municipal Council (unreported, NSWCA, 31 March 1983) at 5 expressly so recognised, saying: 
In some cases, orders have been made which alter the effect of an existing order because of facts which were not before the court which made the original order. It may be that such a supplemental order can be made because of facts which had occurred before the making of the original order but were not brought to the court's attention: see in Re Scowby; Scowby versus Scowby [[1897] 1
Ch 741.]
It has been held that supplemental orders can be made because of facts occurring after the making of the original order: Bailey versus Marinoff 125 CLR at p 540, per Gibbs J; see also Ford-Hunt versus Raghbir Singh(1973) 1 WLR 738;
Northern Counties Securities Ltd versus Jackson & Steeple Ltd [(1974) 1 WLR ]
at 1138; cf Easton versus Brown [(1981) 3 All ER 278] at (e). This jurisdiction has been long recognised in the practice books:
Seton on Judgments and Orders (1912) p 126, 816; Daniell's Chancery Practice (8th edition) p 710, 1139. See also the Annual Practice (1982), Notes to Order , r 11/5; Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Edition, Volume 37, par 329(n).
There has been no finally authoritative examination of the nature of the supplemental orders which can be made.
 [59] One example is that it is possible for an order for specific performance to be discharged by the court, by reason of events occurring after the order was made: JAG Investment Pty Ltd versus Strati [[1981] 2 NSWLR 600] In the extracts from Riltang and Fylas quoted at [53] and [54] above, the various types of remedy that White J and McPherson SPJ listed as being obtainable under liberty to apply would frequently involve, in a way crucial to the availability of the remedy, proof of facts that had arisen since the making of the original order.
Mr Sneddon submitted that in this case what has occurred is that Mr Ajaka and Fishy Bite have failed to comply with the orders made and that their failure to comply is a fact occurring after the date of the order and is analogous to the failure of a defendant to comply with an order for specific performance.
In relation to the inherent power point Mr Sneddon relies on the statement of principle of the Court of Appeal in Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd versus The J Aron Corporation and the Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Others <case>; [(2007) 70 NSWLR 411] at 489: "In addition to powers resulting from rules of court, it is clear that there are necessary powers which are inherent in the jurisdiction of the court. It would, I think, be undesirable to limit the scope of these powers as a result of any words which describe them. I respectfully agree with what was indicated by Evershed
LJ in Meier versus Meier [[1948] P 89] at 95 when he said: 'I prefer not to attempt a definition of the extent of the court's inherent jurisdiction to vary, modify or extend its own orders if, in its view, the purposes of justice require that it should do so'." ...

The inherent jurisdiction [67] It is well established that the inherent jurisdiction is not at large, but it is not capable of being confined to defined categories. (See Tringali versus Stewardson Stubbs & Collett Pty Ltd [[1966] 1 NSWR 354] at 617-618.) Both sources of jurisdiction may be exercised when necessary for the administration of justice: Reid v 
Howard (at 17).
 [69] As McLelland J said of the exercise of both the inherent power and [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s23.html) in Dwyer versus National Companies & Securities Commission [(1988) 15 NSWLR 285] at 287: "Since it rests on necessity for the purpose of preventing injustice, the extent of the power is commensurate with the requirements of the necessity which calls it into existence".
 [70] Where it is suggested, as it is in this case, that the effect sought to be given to an order of the court is directly contrary to the court's intention, the test of necessity may extend to protecting the integrity of the administration of justice and/or to maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice.
In reference to the slip rule, Mr Sneddon again relied on Newmont: see [116]-[117].
Mr Michos attacked all four grounds making the following points: 
Rule 3.16.3 is subject to a time limit as a matter of construction 
The Court made final orders on 11 March 2011 following a full contested hearing and an unsuccessful appeal process launched by Mrs Raulfs in which there was no change to the form of orders made and which are the subject of a res judicata.

There is no inherent power to vary orders - the UCPR is a comprehensive code as it were and if the rules do not permit variation there is no jurisdiction or scope for variation.

There is no uncertainty or error in the order made - the parties, with benefit of the advice of senior and junior counsel and solicitors, agreed on the form of orders to be put in place and the mere fact that Mr Ajaka and
Fishy Bite have no money is not a reason to vary the orders. The plaintiff may understandably be disappointed but disappointment is not a ground for variation.

That it was necessary for the Receiver to make the application for a change in the order - referring to UCPR 39.49(1) which provides: .49 Enforcement by or against non-party (cf SCR [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p42), rule 10) 
If, in any proceedings, a person who is not a party obtains an order, or an order is made in favour of a person who is not a party, that person may enforce the order as if that person were a party.

An admittedly small amount of money, $50, has been paid in total to establish the bank account required to be established in accordance with order .

There has been a very long delay between making of the orders and the applications.

Some of Mr Michos submissions and the cases cited addressed UCPR provisions on which the plaintiff was not relying: for example UCPR .15 and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) .
I do not accept that there is a time limit on applications to vary orders made that fall within rule 36.16(3) but are not caught by subparagraphs (a) and (b). I do not accept that the Court's inherent power was removed by the UCPR. Rule 36.16(4) makes it clear that it was not and the decision Newmont is inconsistent with such a proposition. It is true that there has been a considerable delay since the orders were made. Some of that delay is attributable to the appeal process and some to the attempts to force Mr Ajaka to explain the failure to comply with the orders. Even though the delay is not wholly attributable to the factors I have mentioned, I do not think it is sufficient as a matter of discretion to preclude variation of the orders if otherwise appropriate. 
I accept that the inherent power to vary judgments and orders is very limited and that it cannot be used to reopen a case to alter the substantive conclusions reached: see Gamser versus the Nominal Defendant <case>; [(1977) 136 CLR 145] make it clear that there are circumstances in which a court may vary a judgment.
I do not accept that the Receiver has to be the moving party for the variation of orders. The Receiver, although appointed by the Court, was not made a party to the proceedings and did not need to be a party. It is Mrs Raulfs who seeks to protect the funds of her, albeit limited, success in the litigation and who has a significant interest in doing so UCPR. [part 39.49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p39.49) permits a person in whose favour an order is made who is not a party to "enforce" the order as if that person were a party.
I accept Mr Sneddon's submission that it cannot have been intended that in the absence of payment by Mr Ajaka and Fishy Bite as required by with the Court's order there could be no enforcement of that order by anyone which is inherent in Mr Michos' submissions. I regard the payment of $50 as merely the cost of establishment of the account and an insufficient basis to preclude variation. To avoid any doubt however I will deduct $50 from the amount that is calculated to otherwise be due in respect of the order. In my view, Mrs Raulfs is entitled to protect the fruits of her success in the litigation by empowering the Receiver to pursue Mr Ajaka and Fishy Bite.
I think that [part 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) [rule 16(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s16.html) and the inherent power both provides a basis for the variation sought and I do not need to consider whether the other two bases advanced provide support.

Amount
There was no dispute that as at Friday 8 November 2013 the amount of that debt the first and second defendant are required to pay is $662, 405.86 plus a further 6 days interest of $129 per day i.e. $774. Therefore as at today's date (15 November 2013) that amount needs to be added, i.e. a total of $663, 179.86 from deducted the $50 referred to in [20] above i.e. total of $663, 129.86.

Alterative Order: Payment to Mrs Raulfs. 
As this is an alternative proposed order and for the reasons expressed I am of the view an order that the money be paid to the Receiver is appropriate it is not necessary to further consider this proposed order, save to note that it is contrary to the conclusion I expressed in the reasons for judgment.

Taking of Accounts
This order cannot now be made as an additional order. It is beyond the scope of any inherent power and as Mr Michos pointed out it is precluded by virtue of the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim beyond the orders made: see order 6 in [2] above. 
Costs
Mr Ajaka and Fishy Bite have been unsuccessful in resisting the plaintiff's principal order and I think it is appropriate to order them to pay Mrs Raulfs' costs of the motion.
