JUDGE1
SANTOW J Arising from and left open by my earlier judgment of 30 January , and as foreshadowed at p 3 of that judgment, there is a further issue to be determined. That is whether all or any of the determinations made by the
Appeals Committee of the
League of questions of fact are to be "final and binding", within the meaning of that expression in clause 14 of the Playing
Contracts, such that they may not be controverted in the present proceedings before me.
There has already been identified and recorded in today's transcript what the Defendant contends to be the questions of fact determined by the Appeals
Committee in the course of their decision of 22 December 1995 referred to in my earlier judgment. I do not need to record these again in this judgment but incorporate reference to the transcript for this purpose.
I have reached the conclusion, that the determinations of those questions of fact, even though they may have been necessary to determine the ultimately legal question referred for arbitral decision, are not to be treated as final and binding. In reaching that conclusion, I have not had referred to me any authority precisely in point.
The question is ultimately one of construing
Clause 14 of the Playing Contracts and determining its effect in the context of the [Commercial Arbitration Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) , ("the Act"). I do so having regard to the conclusion that I have earlier reached in my judgment of 30
January 1996. This was to the effect that the decision in paragraph 59 of the
Arbitrator's determination, which decided the dispute referred for arbitration, was not final and binding on the parties, being ultimately a question of law.
I first note that [s.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the Act quoted in my earlier judgment, simply makes "the award", (which according to [s4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s4.html) of the Act may be final or interim), "final and binding on the parties to the agreement". However this is "unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement." Those latter words are clearly directed at qualifying the scope for the statute to render an award final and binding, doing so by reference to the arbitration agreement. One would not expect that they would be directed also at potentially expanding the scope of the statute in rendering the award final and binding, so as to render binding, determinations of fact which were not part of the award itself. However, that begs the question, what is, or is not, to be treated as comprised within "the award" for the purposes of [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the
Act? At the least, [s29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s29.html) of the Act makes clear that the arbitrator shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties) "include in the award a statement of reasons for making the award". That clearly indicates that the award includes any stated reasons. Hence necessary findings of fact, to the extent made in the present case, may fairly be said to be comprised in such reasons insofar as they constitute part of the stated reasons.
The award made in the present circumstances obviously includes the actual decision on the dispute, as stated in paragraph 59 of the committee's decision of 22 December 1995, namely: "The decision of the committee is that the
Playing
Contracts between Bradley Scott Fittler and the Penrith Rugby League
Football Club Limited and Matthew Charles Sing and the Penrith
Rugby League
Football Club Limited have been validly terminated by each of the players."
I had earlier concluded in my judgment of 30 January 1996 that this conclusion is ultimately one of law. The question of repudiation and its acceptance, involved in the conclusion that the Playing Contracts are validly terminated by each of the players, is ultimately one of law because, as stated by J W Carter "Breach of Contract" the Law Book Company 1991 at 230: "The
Court must always enquire into the standard of duty imposed by the contract and such an inquiry is legal in character". This is so, though there be critical factual elements to be decided in reaching that ultimately legal conclusion. Thus one example is whether the plaintiff evinced an intention not to be bound by the relevant "Playing Contracts"; see J W Carter op cit at -231. It is true that such questions of fact are inextricably interwoven with questions of law, in reaching that ultimate conclusion. Indeed that in itself points to the first difficulty, namely that of dissecting fact from law, if associated questions of fact, but not law, were held to be conclusively determined by the committee.
It follows that if the Defendants' contention were correct (that associated questions of fact may still be conclusively determined)
I would on the one hand have to treat the actual decision on the dispute as not final and binding and thus subject to appeal by way of the present proceedings, as I have done, yet have to treat the determination by the arbitrator of the associated questions of fact as nonetheless final and binding. Such a result would be an unexpected one, given that the parties had explicitly given finality only to arbitral determinations of questions of fact - not to mixed questions of fact and law. It would also impose a constraint on the Court in admitting any further evidence in an appeal against the arbitrator's ultimately legal decision on the dispute.
The very considerations that led me in my earlier judgment to conclude that the proper interpretation of clause 14 is that such an ultimate question of law was not to be treated as conclusively and finally determined, are further reasons for not concluding that anterior factual steps to that ultimate decision should nonetheless be treated as determined finally. The determination by the three arbitrators is, under the relevant Rules of the
League, a lay determination, lending itself to the conclusion that only pure questions of fact, divorced from questions of law, were intended to be determined in final and binding fashion. On balance, I am of the view that this was not the parties' intention as derived from the arbitration agreement.
This is further reinforced by the fact that my preferred view comports best with the general law, as explained below. Issue estoppel arises under general law, when ultimate (not merely evidentiary) facts have necessarily been determined as were indispensable to a binding determination of rights, so that the latter determination gives rise to a res judicata and the former to issue estoppel. There is no such binding determination here.
To elaborate. It is undoubtedly the case that the doctrine of issue estoppel applies equally to arbitrations as to other forms of curial proceeding; Spencer-Bower and Turner "Res Judicata", Second Edition 1969 at and Diplock LJ in Fidelitas Shipping
Co., Ltd, versus V/O Exportchelb, [(1965) 2
All E.R. 4],C.A. at p.10. Thus at general law, issue estoppel applies equally to issues decided as the fundamental basis of an award in arbitration proceedings, as it does to issues determined in litigation. As put by Dixon J in Blair versus Curren (1939) 62 CLR 462 at 532, issue estoppel thus applies to those ultimate facts forming the very title to rights, as distinct from merely evidentiary facts. But the crucial point is that the ultimate decision on the dispute must be final and binding if that result is to follow. Clearly that is wholly different from the situation presently before me. That is because the ultimate decision the subject of referral to the arbitrator is itself not to be final and binding. Thus it must follow at general law that questions of fact, whether indispensably or incidentally determined in reaching that ultimate decision, could not themselves be final and binding.
Accordingly, to treat [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the Act as giving rise to a different result than the general law would be quite unexpected and require much clearer language.
This is more especially where the consequences of so doing would be problematic.
I am thus of the view that only a dispute as to a pure question of fact referred to arbitration, one whose determination is divorced from any question of law, may be rendered final and binding by clause 14, when read with [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the Act. That circumstance is clearly not the case here. I thus conclude that the determinations or conclusions concerning questions of fact in the present award were not determined so as to be final and binding on the parties and thus do not give rise to issue estoppel.
