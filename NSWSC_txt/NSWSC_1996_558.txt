REGINA versus Virginia Anne HANCOCK /96 
Thursday 21 November 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
GLEESON CJ, JAMES J, DOWD J 
EVIDENCE - TENDENCY 
The appellant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The appellant and the complainant were involved in a fight, and the crucial question was as to who started the fight. The Crown Prosecutor sought and obtained leave to cross-examine the appellant about a previous incident of violence in which she was involved, a previous conviction for violence, and an apprehended violence order that had been made against her. The trial judge dealt with the application under [Part .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) on the basis that the evidence went to credibility. He did not apply the provisions of [Part .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) relating to tendency evidence - HELD - the evidence was tendency evidence and the application should have been dealt with, and refused, under [Part .6.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) 
ORDERS Appeal allowed.
 Conviction and sentence quashed.
 Judgment of acquittal entered.

JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: On the 29 January 1996 the appellant together with two co-accused persons was indicted before his Honour Judge Knight at the District Court at Tamworth on a charge of assaulting Rachel Patricia Cryer occasioning to her actual bodily harm.

Having regard to the nature of the issues that have emerged on this appeal it is unnecessary for present purposes to go into much detail about the facts and events giving rise to the charge against the appellant.

The two co-accused were acquitted. The appellant was convicted and his Honour deferred passing sentence upon the appellant entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of five years.

It suffices for present purposes to say that on the evening of the 27 February there occurred a violent physical encounter between the appellant and the complainant, Rachel Cryer. As a consequence of that encounter Rachel Cryer suffered serious physical injuries and required treatment at hospital.

It was common ground at the trial that the appellant was drunk at the time of the encounter. The substantial factual issue which the jury had to resolve was who, as between the appellant and the complainant, instigated the fight.

Rachel Cryer gave an account to the effect that the appellant and her boyfriend returned late at night, drunk, to the house in which they and the complainant were living and that the appellant thereupon and without any provocation set upon Rachel Cryer.

The appellant gave a quite different account asserting in substance that she had been the subject of an unprovoked attack by Rachel Cryer and that she was merely, albeit vigorously, defending herself. The defence case was one of self-defence.

Trial counsel for the appellant, in the course of cross-examining Rachel
Cryer, questioned her about a previous incident in which Rachel Cryer had attacked a man with a hammer. There does not seem to have been any dispute that some such incident occurred; nor does there seem to have been any dispute that Rachel Cryer had made the incident known to the appellant.

The relevance of that line of cross-examination was that it went to the issue of self-defence. Knowledge by the appellant of Rachel Cryer's propensity to violence, at least in circumstances of the kind that gave rise to the hammer incident, could have been regarded by the jury, depending on all the circumstances and depending upon the other evidence in the case, as being of probative significance on the issue of self-defence.

It may have been material to an evaluation of the appellant's conduct on the occasion in question to have information as to what she knew as to violence in which Rachel Cryer had engaged on a previous occasion.

It is common ground in this appeal that the cross-examination of the complainant about the hammer incident was legitimate cross-examination and that the information elicited was information relevant to the issue of self- defence.

When the appellant came to give evidence the Crown Prosecutor made what he described as an application under [s104](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s104.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) for leave to examine the appellant on her prior record. The evidence which the Crown
Prosecutor sought to elicit by cross-examination was evidence that the appellant had a conviction for assault and that she had been made the subject of an apprehended violence order.

Knight DCJ, who was in this respect merely pursuing the course he had been invited to take by counsel, dealt with the question as one to be resolved under the provisions of [Part .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

His Honour made no reference to the provisions of [Part .6.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6)
In particular his Honour made no reference to the provisions of [s97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and s[101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html).

His Honour gave leave to the Crown to conduct the cross-examination the subject of the application and the Crown Prosecutor thereupon asked the appellant a series of questions about a drunken incident in which she and another woman had been engaged on a previous occasion, and about the conviction for assault that followed. Questions were also asked about the apprehended violence order. No pre-trial notice that this line of cross- examination would be pursued had been given to the appellant.

As senior counsel for the appellant has observed in argument, the questions that were asked of the appellant about the incident were of a general nature and the information which they elicited made it very difficult for a jury to relate the facts and circumstances of the incident, the subject of the cross- examination, to the facts and circumstances of the incident, the subject of the charge.

Cross-examining counsel made clear in a number of questions what he was seeking to demonstrate by this evidence. He repeatedly put it to the appellant that she was a person of a violent disposition and that she was a person who was prone to engage in violence when intoxicated.

Knight DCJ accepted the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that the case was a proper one to be considered under [Part .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and that the evidence in question was evidence which was relevant only to the appellant's credibility.

This was the premise upon which the argument was conducted. It appears to me, unfortunately, to be a false premise. I have serious difficulty in understanding how the evidence in any respect went to the credibility of the appellant. I cannot understand how it could be described as evidence that was relevant only to the credibility of the appellant.

There are, of course, some kinds of prior convictions of an accused person which are relevant, and perhaps relevant only, to the credit of the accused.
To take a simple and extreme example, if cross-examining counsel had desired to put to the appellant that she had on a previous occasion been convicted of perjury, that would have been material that went only to her credit. The same might apply if she had been cross-examined about some previous history of dishonesty.

I do not suggest that evidence going to credibility is limited to evidence of that kind. I simply give those as examples.

Here, however, the prior conviction was a conviction for assault on a previous occasion when the appellant was drunk. That cannot properly be said to have been evidence that went only to her credibility. On the contrary the evidence, in my view, was plainly tendency evidence of the kind the subject of [Part .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Indeed, at one point in his reasons for allowing this evidence, Knight DCJ said: "If this evidence that the Crown seeks to have adduced is admitted it will simply go to point out that the other lady, the accused Virginia Hancock, also had some history of violence".
 
The evidence, being tendency evidence, and not being evidence that related only to the credibility of the appellant, the provisions of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) that were of primary significance were [s97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and s[101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html).

The policy of the law protecting accused persons from evidence and cross- examination as to what the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) calls tendency, although now dealt with by statute, was explained by the High Court in Pfennig versus The Queen <case>; [182
CLR 461.] 
It is unnecessary for present purposes to analyse the reasons in that case or to formulate the principle which it states. It is sufficient to say that the court, once again, made it clear that tendency evidence is not excluded because it is irrelevant. On the contrary, it is often very relevant. It is excluded because of its potential for prejudice.

I have little doubt that, as a matter of commonsense, a jury seeking to decide which of the complainant and the appellant had instigated the physical encounter on this occasion would have regarded it as relevant, if it had been established, that the appellant was a person of violent disposition. I think that they would have regarded it as being even more obviously relevant when they already had before them information, adduced in relation to the issue of self-defence, from which they might have concluded that the complainant was a person of violent disposition.

I do not dismiss the possibility that in some cases, having some features in common with the present case, evidence of the nature which the Crown sought to adduce could properly be received under the provisions of [Part .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), depending on all the facts and circumstances of the individual case, and upon the trial judge's evaluation and consideration of prejudice to which attention needs to be directed.

In the present case, however, no notice had been given in compliance with [Part .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) and, as was mentioned earlier, the nature of the evidence was such that it was calculated to be of substantial prejudice to the appellant.

The learned trial judge did not direct his mind to the provisions of [s97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and s[101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html).
In the circumstances of this case, if he had directed his mind to those provisions, then he ought to have come to the conclusion that the cross- examination should not be allowed.

It is unnecessary to go into the matter in any greater detail. What I have already said has substantially been conceded and fairly conceded by the Crown in this appeal.

Before leaving this ground of appeal I should add one observation.

In his summing-up, Knight DCJ directed the jury that they should not use the evidence concerning the appellant's propensity to violence as bearing upon the question as to who started the fight. I find it hard to see what the jury would have made of that direction. His Honour did not explain to the jury what other relevance the evidence might have. Although this does not appear from the transcript, it is possible that his Honour put the provisions of [Part .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to one side because he had in mind ultimately giving such a direction. However, [Part .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) could not be put to one side. The evidence in question was, in its nature, evidence as to the appellant's tendency. To pick up his Honour's words quoted above - evidence that a person charged with assault "had some history of violence" is evidence which goes to prove a tendency; it did not go to prove anything else that was relevant to the present case.

It is unnecessary to consider the second ground of appeal relied upon by the appellant.

The Crown has acknowledged that in the event that this Court should allow the appeal, it would not be a proper case for the ordering of a new trial. In that respect the Crown submission is influenced by the nature of the penalty which the trial judge saw fit to impose.

I would propose that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction and sentence should be quashed and the judgment of acquittal entered.

JAMES J: I agree with the judgement of the Chief Justice.

DOWD J: I also agree.
