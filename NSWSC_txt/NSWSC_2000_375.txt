JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Defendant's subpoena - Police Service - access- T5791) In answer to the subpoena issued by the defendant's solicitors, the New
South Wales Police Service has produced a parcel of documents in response to the subpoena issued on 1 May relating to Detective Panich and another. The materials are contained in packet number 391. I have examined the schedule to the subpoena and skimmed through the documents attached. There is nothing in there that persuades me that the plaintiff should have first access. The defendant will have first access, and the plaintiff thereafter.
