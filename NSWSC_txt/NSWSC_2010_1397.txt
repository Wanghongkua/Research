THURSDAY, 2 DECEMBER 2010  /356145 KRYSTLE KELLEY versus WESTERN PACIFIC INSURANCE LTD & 2
ORS 
JUDGMENT I am dealing with an originating process filed by Krystle Kelley on 27
October 2010 in which three defendants are named: Western Pacific Insurance
Ltd ("Western Pacific"), Checkmate New Generation Security Pty Ltd ("Checkmate") and RDL Investments Pty Ltd ("RDL").
 The relief Ms Kelley seeks is: "Leave to substitute Western Pacific Insurance Ltd as second defendant in
Supreme Court proceedings 2310/2008 before the Common Law Division of the
Supreme Court." The originating process commences: "This application is made under 601AG [sic] [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)
Corporations Regulations [sic] and <case> of the Law Reform Miscellaneous Act [sic]." Ms Balendra of counsel, who appeared for Ms Kelley and sought relief ex parte, made it clear that no reliance is placed on [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) and that [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) is alone relevant.
 The factual background is, in essence, that Ms Kelley suffered injury in an incident at a hotel in Wollongong in circumstances in which, she says, each of
RDL (the hotel operator) and Checkmate (the provider of security guards or security services at the hotel) breached a duty of care in negligence owed to her.
 In 2008, Ms Kelley commenced proceedings in the Common Law Division seeking damages for negligence against RDL. By means of an amended statement of claim filed on 29 February 2010, Checkmate was added to those proceedings as second defendant. Some three months earlier, however, Checkmate had ceased to exist by reason of its deregistration on 28 November 2009 following completion of its winding up.
 Ms Kelley accepts that, because Checkmate does not exist (and did not exist when she purported to join it as a defendant to the Common Law Division proceedings), she cannot proceed against Checkmate. She considers herself to have, however, a separate cause of action against Western Pacific under [s
AG:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) "A person may recover from the insurer of a company that is deregistered an amount that was payable to the company under the insurance contract if: the company had a liability to the person; and the insurance contract covered that liability immediately before deregistration." It was held by the Court of Appeal in Almario versus Allianz Australia Workers
Compensastion Insurance Ltd <case>; [(2005) 62 NSWLR 148] that [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) creates a new cause of action against an insurer to recover an amount that was payable to the deregistered company under the relevant insurance contract. Ipp
JA said (at [19] - [20]) with the concurrence of Hodgson JA and Hunt AJA: "[Section
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) creates a new cause of action. The action is not a claim for damages. It is for an amount that was payable to the deregistered company under the relevant insurance contract. A claim in terms of [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) is subject to two conditions, namely, proof that the deregistered company "had a liability" to the person claiming and that the insurance contract covered that liability immediately before deregistration.
 
The two conditions are expressed in the past tense. The inference is that the time for determining whether the deregistered company had a liability to the person claiming, and whether the insurance contract covered that liability, is "immediately before deregistration" (being the phrase qualifying condition (b)). This was not disputed." The new cause of action, of its nature, does not arise until the company having the benefit of the insurance is deregistered; and any defences that the insurer may have had at that point to an action on the insurance contract may be pleaded by it in defence to the [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) claim. This follows from paragraph (b) of the section which has regard to the cover actually provided by the contract of insurance immediately before the deregistration.
 In the present case, it appears at a prima facie level that Checkmate held relevant insurance from Western Pacific at the relevant time. There is thus at least an arguable basis for a [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) claim by Ms Kelley against Western Pacific.
 Ms Balendra did not settle the originating process. She accepted that the statutory provisions are such that there is no such thing as an application for leave under [s
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) and that Ms Kelley's claim ostensibly advanced by originating process under the [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) by reference to that section is, in substance and reality, a claim for such leave as may be necessary to reconstitute the existing Common Law Division proceedings by adding Western Pacific as a defendant in place of Checkmate and adding a derivative cause of action against Western Pacific for recovery pursuant to <case> in place of the claim against Checkmate itself.
 In terms of [rule .24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s6.24.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), Western
Pacific should be seen as "a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to the determination of all matters in dispute in" the proceedings - one of those matters now being whether Western Pacific, as the insurer of the now defunct
Checkmate, may be liable on account of Ms Kelley's injury upon a statutory cause of action that arose upon Checkmate's deregistration. An alternative characterisation of matters is that Ms Kelley is, on the view she takes, now entitled to proceed against Western Pacific for relief arising out of facts and circumstances substantially overlapping with those that form the basis of her action against RDL and that that proceeding should from the outset be joined with that against RDL.
 Western Pacific should therefore be joined as a defendant in the Common Law
Division action and the new cause of action should be pleaded against it, based, in part, on the current pleading as against Checkmate. Ms Kelley should be granted leave accordingly; and that leave should be granted even though
Western Pacific (or, for that matter, RDL) has had no opportunity to be heard on the matter: Dura (Australia) Constructions Pty Ltd versus Victorian Managed
Insurance Authority <case> at <case>.
Western Pacific's position is sufficiently protected by the ability to defend in the ordinary course and, if so advised, to seek to have the new claim struck out.  The best way forward, I think, is for Ms Kelley's legal advisers to submit through my Associate short minutes of appropriate orders to be made in the
Common Law Division proceedings, together with the further amended statement of claim in respect of which leave is sought. I shall then deal with the matter in chambers unless there is some perceived need for it to be relisted.
