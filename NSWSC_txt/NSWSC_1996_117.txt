Mina Deitz versus Abernethy [1996] NSWSC 117 (9 May 1996) 
Mina DEITZ versus ABERNETHY /96 
WEDNESDAY 8 May 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DIVISION 
ABADEE J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: For reasons that will appear during the course of my judgment, my ruling in relation to this summons must be delivered as a matter of some urgency.

The plaintiff, Mina Ruth Deitz, who is the widow of the late Haim Mendel Deitz (aka Victor Deitz) seeks the continuance of an injunction restraining the defendant, who is the Deputy Coroner, from performing, permitting to be performed, or directing the performance of an autopsy examination upon the body of the late Mr Deitz. Mr Deitz died in the Prince of Wales Hospital on 5
May 1996. The matter of his early burial is one of considerable urgency.

Late on the afternoon of 6 May 1996 in my capacity as duty judge I granted an interim injunction in terms of the relief sought. Time was abridged for the service of the summons and I directed that proceedings come before me on 7 May at 2 pm.

On the afternoon of 7 May 1996 Mr Segal appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in support of the continuance of the order granting an injunction. Mr Molomby appeared on behalf of the defendant, who, as I have said, is the Deputy
Coroner and who wishes to exercise powers pursuant to <case> of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca120/). It will be necessary to return to that provision in due course.

On the afternoon of 7 May 1996 evidence was led in support of the summons.
This evidence included affidavit evidence and extensive oral evidence from a
Dr Warwick Stenning, a neurosurgeon, conducting his practice in Randwick. Dr
Stenning was the treating specialist of the deceased in respect of serious injuries that the deceased had suffered in a motor vehicle accident on 10
March 1996 which resulted in his death on 5 May 1996.

It is appropriate that I should immediately make two observations: In the first place, Mr Molomby, on behalf of the defendant, objected to the evidence being led from Dr Stenning upon the ground that it was irrelevant to any issue that I had to determine. I indicated that because Dr Stenning was in court and because of the urgency of the summons that I considered it was appropriate to take Dr Stenning's evidence and then give a final ruling in relation to its admissibility after his evidence had been concluded.

The hearing extended part-head over to today. Over night the transcript of Dr
Stenning's evidence became available and available to the legal representatives for the purposes of obtaining appropriate instructions. The matter came before me part-heard this morning at midday. As duty judge I had other obligations to meet prior to that time.

The next observation that I would make at this stage is that it is accepted that if the plaintiff be entitled to relief that no argument is advanced that injunctive relief rather than prerogative or declaratory type relief is appropriate. In other words, as I understand it, if the plaintiff is entitled to succeed in obtaining the order, the defendant does not challenge that the appropriate order is one continuing the injunction. Although injunctive relief has been granted upon a temporary basis, the plaintiff seeks an order that the body of the deceased be released to the plaintiff for burial. No interlocutory order has been made in respect of that order that has been sought. However, as
I understand it, if the plaintiff is entitled to the first order, then the plaintiff is also entitled to an order that the body be released to her for the purposes of burial.

The summons is supported by a number of affidavits. The first affidavit is from one Dovid Deitz dated 6 May 1996. In that affidavit Mr Dovid Deitz said he is the son of the deceased who passed away at the Prince of Wales Hospital on or about 5 May 1996 (by error described as the St Vincent's Hospital).
According to Mr Deitz his father was of the Jewish faith as are all members of his family. His father kept a kosher home and upheld Jewish traditions. Mr
Deitz also said that he personally is an observant Jew who has spent many years studying Jewish law. He said that he has read the draft affidavit of
Rabbi Gutnick sworn 6 May 1996 and said that he adhered to the principles set forth by Rabbi Gutnick in that affidavit and more particularly in par 3 of that affidavit. He said that his late father also adhered to those principles.

Since I am talking about those principles, it is convenient at this point of time to perhaps digress for a moment and refer to what those principles are.
Rabbi Gutnick in an affidavit of 6 May 1996 said that he was a Rabbi of the
Jewish faith and that he knew the deceased person. He said as follows:- "The precepts of Halachah (meaning the whole body of ethico-legal principles which govern all aspects of Jewish life) prescribe an intricate set of rules and regulations which govern our treatment of the dead, beginning with the moment of death and continuing through the preparation for burial, the actual burial ceremony itself, the erection of tombstones and monuments, the care and maintenance of graves and cemetery areas as a whole, and so on. Moreover, it is the firm belief of Orthodox Jews that reverence for the dead, as expressed through scrupulous adherence to our religious teachings in all the areas mentioned above, is of paramount importance to us, to the extent that it is regarded as a "sacred duty." Some indication of the significance attached to these practices may be seen from the fact that even Jews who are not religiously observant during their lifetimes insist on being buried in strict conformity with Jewish laws, customs, and usages. These principles and practices which relate to our treatment of the dead emanate from beliefs that are central to our values, customs, traditions and practices extending over many hundreds of years in Jewish communities throughout the world. Among the foremost of the precepts concerning reverence for the dead is one which is of particular importance in the context of the present application. Put simply, according to Jewish religion, an autopsy is an action of desecration, and as such is inimical to out deepest principles and feelings." 
It is these principles which I understand are those adhered to by Mr Dovid
Deitz in his affidavit.

Returning again to Dovid Deitz' affidavit, he said that the deceased was born on 17 September 1982 and thus as at the time of his death in 1996 was therefore aged almost 75 years. The deceased came to Australia in 1948 from
Cairo Egypt and he and the plaintiff were married in 1950. It appears, according to the affidavit of Mr Dovid Deitz, that his father was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 10 March 1996. Apparently, the deceased was crossing Anzac Parade Little Bay when he was struck by a bus. From information given to Mr Dovid Deitz he believed that the deceased was totally at fault in the accident. He said that neither the plaintiff, being his mother, or any other person in the family wished to bring any proceedings arising out of the death of his late father.

Following the accident, the deceased was admitted to the Prince of Wales
Hospital where he remained until his death. During his stay in hospital the deceased was under the care of several medical specialists including Dr
Warwick Stenning and Dr Wang neurologist and Dr Shin and other doctors performing their duties in that hospital.

Subsequent to his father's death, a death certificate was issued by Dr Kai
Chin Chan. As I understand it, that medical certificate, as to the cause of death, was issued on 6 May 1996 and is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Dovid
Deitz. The cause of death is set forth in the death certificate as being septicaemic shock, MRSA pneumonia, acute renal failure, MRSA septicaemia and multiple trauma. Mr Deitz says in his affidavit that there has not been any suggestion made by anyone of any untoward event occurring during the deceased's hospitalisation. Orders are sought by him in accordance with the summons.

Mr Francis Levy solicitor on behalf of the plaintiff has filed an affidavit.
He said that on 6 May 1996 at about approximately 1.20 pm he spoke to a
Sergeant John O'Keefe of the Coroners Office at Glebe. He asked Sergeant
O'Keefe as to whether a decision had been made for the coroner to hold an inquest. According to his affidavit, Sergeant O'Keefe said to the him words to the effect: "The autopsy has been scheduled for 8 am tomorrow morning and should finish approximately 10 am." According to Mr Levy, he asked Sergeant
O'Keefe why the autopsy was necessary to which a reply was given the death was as a result of pneumonia septicaemia, renal failure as consequence of the car accident, and these factors are referred to in the doctor's death certificate.
He also said that the coroner noted the file accordingly, requiring an autopsy, because of the provision of [s (1)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ca120/s13.html) of the [Coroner's Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/). It will be necessary in due course to return to the provisions of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) including [s (1)(g).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) 
Yesterday in oral evidence Mr Levy gave evidence that during the afternoon of May 1996 he had spoken to an officer who had been working with the police officer who was in charge of the investigations in connection with the motor vehicle accident. The investigating officer was regrettably not available.
Without objection, Mr Levy was able to give evidence that he was informed by the police officer to whom he had spoken that the Police Department had formed, at least at that stage, that nobody was likely to be charged in connection with the motor vehicle accident.

Before coming to the evidence of Dr Stenning it is appropriate for me to observe that none of the matters referred to in the several affidavits to which I have made reference were objected to, nor has it been submitted in final addresses that I should not act upon the basis that I should accept the matters contained in the affidavit material to which I have made reference. I unreservedly accept materials referred to in the affidavits and the evidence of the respective deponents.

I now come to the evidence of Dr Stenning. On any view he is a most eminent specialist in the city of Sydney. He is a specialist neurosurgeon. He has been involved in the treatment of head injuries since 1971. He has been a member of the Department of Health's Head Trauma Committee. His expertise is not questioned. He gave evidence before me that he saw the deceased, Mr Deitz, at the Prince of Wales Hospital on or about 12 March 1996, which was some two days after the motor vehicle. He also gave evidence that he was one of the treating specialists of the deceased until the deceased's death on or about 5
May 1996.

When he first saw Mr Deitz he said that Mr Deitz was deeply unconscious and was in the intensive care ward. A tube had been inserted into his throat and a machine was breathing for him. It appears that these procedures had been performed as part of the medical treatment for severe injuries which the deceased had suffered particularly to his head. A CAT Scan performed shortly after admission to the hospital revealed that the plaintiff had suffered a sub arachnoid haemorrhage, worse on the left than on the right. That there was blood in the occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle, that is one of the cavities inside the brain. Incidentally, the deceased was seen to have suffered a fractured right cheek bone.

The CAT Scan also revealed that there were small almost microscopic areas of haemorrhage which could be seen indicating that the deceased had suffered diffuse axonal injury, which, as I understand it, means generalised injury to the brain as a whole. The injuries so seen were said to be consistent with a motor vehicle accident that the deceased had suffered.

It would appear that prior to Dr Stenning coming into the case the deceased had presented to the casualty department with a Glasgow Coma Score of 3 which was about the minimum score that could be achieved, indicating that there was no neurological activity recorded whatsoever. Indeed, according to Dr
Stenning, such a deceased person is also regarded as having a Glasgow Coma
Score of 3. As part of the treatment, apparently the Glasgow Coma Score improved to 5, which is still a very low score, particularly when one has regard to the fact that all those in the court room present at the time of giving evidence would be regarded as having a Glasgow Coma Score of 15.

The score, as I have said, improved over a period of time; however, apart from the neurological problems, almost within a day or so of admission the deceased developed infections at multiple sites. Indeed, he was also in a post- traumatic amnesic state up to the time of death. He developed chest infection and infection of the sinuses. The infection of the lung was said to be an invariable consequence of the trauma that Mr Deitz had suffered.

Dr Stenning said that treatment of severe head injuries generally involved radical measures to try to prevent pneumonia with aggressive antibiotics and other procedures which is often unsuccessful. In Mr Deitz's case his injuries required aggressive treatments which were persisted with from the time of commencement of Mr Deitz's treatment through to the beginning of May. The aggressive treatments were by way of antibiotics. These antibiotics were changed from time to time, and according to Dr Stenning the treating doctors were never able to fully eradicate.

Dr Stenning expressed the view that the infections spread despite the receipt of exotic antibiotics and indeed the infections had become resistant to these antibiotics. Ultimately, the infections ended his life. Apparently, he developed infections with different types of organisms causing his blood pressure to fall - a well known complication. His blood pressure dropped, his kidneys stopped functioning, and a decision was made on proper medical grounds not to proceed with further antibiotics.

Dr Stenning expressed the view that were an autopsy to take place it would, in effect, reveal nothing that he or others involved in the treatment were unaware of. He said that it was known the deceased had major brain damage, that he had developed pneumonia, that he had infections which had become generalised throughout the body which could not be controlled, and really all that would be revealed at post mortem was perhaps that there was infection at a site which had not been anticipated, but an infection which was not in itself a cause or contributing factor to the deceased's death. The normal hospital procedures identified the major disease processes that had influenced the deceased's course.

Dr Stenning was asked to look at the death certificate annexed to the plaintiff's affidavit. He said that the certificate accurately set out the complication of the multiple trauma and is to quote his own words: "Virtually as I would have written the death certificate." (Transcript p 8.) He said that the certificate demonstrates the cause of Mr Deitz's death, that the cause of death was consistent with injuries that had been suffered in the motor vehicle accident. He said that it was perfectly consistent with complications of injury, namely, the infections, that it was the infections which caused the death not necessarily the injury, although a large majority of trauma deaths are due to complications not the effects of the trauma itself. In his opinion a post mortem examination would not likely change any of the opinions expressed.

In cross-examination he again said that it was unlikely that the autopsy would disclose anything that he did not already know, and that together with experience would not cause him to change his approach. He also gave evidence that the plaintiff died from the complications, being pneumonia and infections, namely, from pneumonia produced by infection produced by the injuries. The infections were in consequence of those injuries. He also said that the deceased had commenced to develop chronic infections which had become generalised almost at the commencement of treatment, that persistent antibiotic and other treatment of an aggressive nature had not stopped the generalised infection, and that that treatment was concluded on 31 April or 1
May. He said that the antibiotics were being overwhelmed - "we tried new ones and they too were being overwhelmed." 
The evidence of Mr Dr Stenning does not suggest any suspicious circumstances associated with the death of the deceased. Indeed, it is abundantly clear from the evidence of Dr Stenning that he was quite clear as to the explanation for the death of the deceased. Indeed, it has not been suggested otherwise. There is absolutely not a scintilla of evidence to support any possible suggestion to the contrary of that stated, although the defendant was given full opportunity to put before the court such medical evidence as he considered appropriate. No medical evidence casting doubt about the medical evidence of
Dr Stenning was put before the court, nor was any evidence put before the court by or on behalf of the defendant. The defendant's position is that he does not have to provide any explanation whatsoever for requiring an autopsy, that he is not to divulge to the court any reasons for such a decision, nor does he have to provide any medical evidence either supporting or contradicting the evidence given, as I have said, by a most eminent specialist being the treating doctor, Dr Stenning. In saying this, I recognise the defendant's argument that he is not required to put any evidence before me and that I am entitled to rely upon arguments which are said to be the strict letter of the law supporting his position by reference to the provision of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/).

No evidence has been put before me by or on behalf of the defendant pointing to a reason for his declining, even for example, to make an order dispensing with an inquest under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) of the Act, it being common ground in the proceedings before me that the coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest into the deceased's death by virtue of the provisions of [s (1)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) of the [Coroner's Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/).
Literally, no explanation has been forth coming as to why the coroner has declined to exercise his powers under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html)
The stance of the defendant is that he does not have to provide any such explanation. Again, literally, no explanation has been provided or has been forth coming as to why the defendant may wish to have a post mortem autopsy under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/). The coroner may either before commencing or after commencing and before completing an inquest concerning the death of a person direct a post mortem examination and a report of the examination or tests to be furnished to him. It is common ground that if an inquest has already been completed no such post mortem can be so ordered. As at this moment in time no inquest has even, in fact, been ordered at all.

It seems to me that were the matter limited to a question of considering the merits and the merits alone, leaving aside the provisions of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) and their effect, the plaintiff has an overwhelming case for injunctive or appropriate relief as sought. Indeed, I did not understand Mr Molomby to suggest to the contrary or to challenge any part of the evidence to which I have made reference. His stance on behalf of his client is that as a matter of law I lack the power irrespective of the merits to make the order as sought.

This is neither the time nor the place to embark upon any great examination of the legal principles. In the instant case there is absolutely no doubt of the genuineness of the plaintiffs and the genuineness of their beliefs. No question has been raised in relation to matters referred to by Rabbi Gutnick, although it could hardly be said that the views expressed by Rabbi Gutnick could be adopted, justifiably so, in all circumstances in which a member of an orthodox section of the Jewish community has died. There is nothing to be drawn from my reasons for judgment to support his affidavit view, or to endorse his view, or giving its full effect to such, that because an autopsy is an act of desecration and as such inimical to the deepest principles and feelings of people of the orthodox Jewish faith, that such would provide a foundation for a court order in all or indeed, in most cases where the question that I am being asked to consider might arise. However, I do believe that in the circumstances it is not necessary for me to go that far and that I am entitled to look at the situation in the instant case without necessarily creating a decision which is precedent making or which ought to be precedent making.

I turn now to the provision of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/). It is common ground between the parties that the jurisdiction of the coroner in relation to death or suspected deaths is to be found in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html)
It is common ground in the instant matter that because the deceased died within several months of his accident in March 1996, to which accident his death clearly is or might be attributable, that the coroner has jurisdiction under [s (1)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) of the Act, indeed there can be no doubt on the evidence before me, and nothing has been put to suggest otherwise, that the cause of death was attributable to the accident and it consequences. Thus, jurisdiction is conferred upon the coroner to hold an inquest in the circumstances here. In circumstances where there is jurisdiction the coroner may, however, dispense with an inquest except in certain classes of case. He may dispense with an inquest pursuant to the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) except in those cases where an inquest is required to be held. Those cases are set forth in the provisions of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14a.html), [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14b.html), [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14c.html) respectively. The point to be made is that in the circumstances of this case the coroner does, in fact, have jurisdiction to dispense with the inquest.
That is not, however, the point in issue in the case. The question is not whether he should dispense with an inquest or be forced to dispense with an inquest, but whether the coroner can be prohibited from having a post mortem or be prohibited from either ordering or enforcing an order to have a post mortem.

It is not necessary for me to determine whether this court has jurisdiction in relation to making an order, for example, compelling a coroner to dispense with an inquest pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html), that is not in issue. Except in circumstances in which an inquest is required to be held, the coroner may dispense with an inquest, but if he does, he is required to give reasons for dispensing with an inquest pursuant to the provision of [s
D(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14d.html) of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/). As I understand the arguments that have been advanced on behalf of the defendant and which have been perhaps accepted by the defendant, once the coroner has jurisdiction under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) he must have an inquest unless he makes a positive decision under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) not to have one. Making that general observation I leave aside those exceptional cases referred to in the Act. However, it seems to me that whilst it is mandatory to have an inquest in circumstances where the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) apply and it has not been submitted to the contrary, it has been submitted that absent an order dispensing under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html), that an inquest is to be held.

However, when one looks at the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) of the Act it seems to me that having regard to the language of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) that whether or not there is to be a post mortem it is essentially a discretionary matter. The coroner may before commencing an inquest order a post mortem, or, may after he actually embarked upon the inquest but before its completion order on post mortem. It seems to be accepted that in this case no decision not to have an inquest has been yet made. It also appears to be accepted that the purpose of a post mortem in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) serves perhaps two distinct purposes. One is to assist the coroner in determining whether he will dispense with an inquest under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) in cases where he has jurisdiction, or perhaps to put it another way to otherwise proceed in holding the inquest in relation to which he has jurisdiction. The other purpose is that once the decision has been made to have an inquest and the inquest has commenced, then there may be a purpose in having such an autopsy during the course of the inquest to assist the coroner in coming to his conclusions, in conducting his inquiry, in determining the scope and issues arising from such inquest on arriving at his findings.

In this case, as I have said, it is not disputed that the learned Deputy
Coroner has jurisdiction. It is not necessary for me to determine whether or not he should make a decision under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html), although I must say on the materials that have been placed before me it is somewhat difficult to see why a decision could not be made pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) of the Act, namely, to dispense with an inquest, but that is not in issue and it is not a matter for me. Of course, were the inquest dispensed with, any power to make an order pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) would cease to exist, the same way as it would cease to exist once an inquest embarked upon had reached a state of conclusion. But nothing in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) in my view - reading the language of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) - suggests [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) is mandatory or directory in its nature. Merely because the coroner may be obliged to conduct an inquest pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) of the Act, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) does not require or make it mandatory - that the coroner should exercise the power to order a post mortem. I do not as presently advised see why it can necessarily be said that in all instances the coroner's powers under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) are necessarily affected by any view I might take in relation to whether or not I should prevent in the circumstances of this case, a post mortem.

Mr Molomby submitted that the decision to hold an inquest is not reviewable.
He submits that the power in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) is ancillary to the power to have an inquest and, therefore, if it is a decision to hold an inquest is not reviewable, nor is a decision to order a post mortem reviewable.

It is not necessary for me to reach a final decision in relation to that wide submission. However, in my view, having regard to the language of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) the submission should, at least in the general terms stated, be rejected. Even if it be accepted that the power in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) is an ancillary power, nevertheless, it seems to me open to conclude that it is a power that is independent of or is capable of being independent, of the power in relation to the conduct of an inquest. The language of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) is not mandatory or directory in nature. To put it another way, even if the coroner is required to have an inquest under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) and decides not to dispense with it under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) the language of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) would suggest that the power to have an autopsy is of a permissive nature, and that is how such a provision should be so interpreted. The legislative imperative to have an inquest doesn't necessarily carry a legislative imperative to have a post mortem.

Once it is accepted that there is a discretion to be found in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html), it seems to me that the argument that has been advanced on behalf of the defendant, that such discretion is not examinable and is an unfettered one and should be so viewed and should be rejected. It is not an argument that has appeal in the circumstances of this particular case. I emphasise the words "this particular case". I do not believe that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) should be so construed as to suggest that the discretion contained therein is unexaminable and that all the defendant is required to do is to come along to this Court and without more, say in effect he has a discretion, it is unfettered, and the Court cannot interfere in any way, shape, or form with the exercise of that discretion. I would not interpret [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) as giving the defendant that right and would not interpret [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) suggesting that such a view of an unfettered discretion should prevail, at least in the circumstances of this case. I do not believe it is unfettered. I believe in this day and age the trend in case law would suggest that such a discretion is examinable by the courts.

Leaving aside the provisions of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/), according to Jervis on Coroners, 10th edition, at pages 264 - 266, at least in relation to the position in England - and I have not been taken to the English provisions of that country - judicial review is available in relation to certain decisions of the Coroner's court. At pp 265 - 266 the following statement appears: - "However, judicial review extends wider than the imposition and in principle covers all preliminary and interlocutory decisions made by the coroner in connection with or in the course of his official duty. Thus, applications for judicial review have been entertained by the courts in relation to decisions ... whether a first post mortem examination should be prohibited." 
Mr Molomby challenges the accuracy of that statement. He submits that it needs to be seen in the context of English legislation which is not before the court, and, in any event, the authority for it does not support the view in
Jervis that an order may be made in relation to a post mortem examination.

The decision cited in support of the proposition in Jervis, is R v
Westminster City Coroner, ex Parte, Rainer, QBD 112 SJ 882. Rainer's case was not a case that concerned the question of jurisdiction, but was a case rather directed to dealing with a question of the type with which I am concerned, namely, whether in the circumstances a prohibition order to prevent the post mortem examination from being carried out could be made based on religious belief grounds of the applicant in that case. The judgment of Lord
Justice Parker appears not to address the question of jurisdiction, but rather addresses the question of whether in the circumstances such an order should be made. It seems to me, as I read the short remarks made, that as a matter of discretion, the order was refused because from the coroner's point of view it was clear that there was some uncertainty as to the cause of death and that it was impossible to say that the coroner did not have reasonable ground to suspect that the deceased had died suddenly from an unknown cause. The decision rejecting prohibition in Rainer's case, is therefore explicable. In the present circumstances there is no uncertainty on the evidence as to the cause of death. In the instant case on the evidence and further absent any evidence from the defendant it could not be suggested that there are reasonable grounds to even suspect that the death of the deceased had not occurred in the way described by Dr Stenning.

I have been taken to a newspaper clipping. It appears in the Age Newspaper of August 1985 purporting to be a newspaper report in relation to the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court, Phillips J where it appeared that his Honour made an order prohibiting a post mortem and further ordering that the deceased's body be handed over to the executors of the dead man's estate. This decision it is said, and pre-dates the provision of the Victorian [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) of , some of which provisions are discussed by Beach J in the decision of
Green versus Johnstone <case>; [(1995) 2 VR 176.] As I indicated in submissions, when the newspaper clipping was handed up to me, it is very difficult to regard a newspaper clipping as being an authority or even an accurate reflection of what was said by the court in the particular case. Neither party has had the opportunity of taking me to the decision, nor has time permitted me to have access to the decision.
I say no more in relation to that newspaper clipping.

Mr Segal referred me to the decision of Green. In some respects, if one is talking about factual merits, there is some similarity between Green and the facts of the instant case. However, it is to be remembered that the decision of Green was a decision of the Victorian Court given against the background of a specific statutory provision being [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s29.html) of the Victorian [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) which permits next of kin to make an application to the Supreme Court for an order that no autopsy be performed, and for an order to be made if that the court is satisfied that such is desirable in the circumstances.

Regrettably, this State has no such progressive legislation. Why this State has not introduced a provision such as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s29.html) is not something that is by any means clear. Perhaps the Victorian legislature introduced the provision to clear up any possible doubt in the law. Perhaps the Victorian legislature introduced the provision to highlight the fact that notwithstanding the public interest in post mortems in some cases there was equally an interest in appropriate circumstances of next of kin in not having post mortems particularly, absent special circumstances as to the cause of death, or where a post mortem would not reveal anything further in a realistic way as regards the cause of death. Because of the absence of a provision such as [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s29.html) of the Victorian [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) it has been necessary for the plaintiff in the circumstances to seek the order from me in the circumstances that have been stated.

It is appropriate to briefly refer to what Beach J said in Green, albeit that it is a decision based upon an expressed discretionary power given by [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s29.html) of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) of
Victoria. His Honour said, albeit in a slightly different context at 1979: -
 "In a multicultural society such as we have in this country it is my opinion that great weight should be given to the cultural and spiritual law and practice of the various cultural groups forming our society, and that great care should be taken to ensure that their laws and practices, assuming they are otherwise lawful, are not to be disregarded or abused." 
In our society, in a community made up of not only people from different cultural background, but of different religious beliefs, what Beach J said can be thought to be applied equally to peoples' religious beliefs as well as their cultural and spiritual laws. I do not believe that the public interest in a case like this demands that further grief or anguish or hurt be caused to the plaintiff and to members of her family. Having regard to the matters to which I have made reference I do not conceive how it could be said, on the evidence before me, that the interests of society should be served or could be served in the circumstances by requiring an autopsy to be performed.

I believe that in the circumstances, I have a right to examine the discretion and I have done so. I believe that in the particular circumstances of this case where the cause of death is clearly known, that the rights of the family to be spared further grief should prevail. This is not a case where the community has an interest in ascertaining the cause of death because such has been clearly established. An autopsy, on the evidence of one of the most eminent men in town, would establish little in relation to the cause of death.
Leaving aside the specific provisions of the Victorian Corner's Act, it seems to me that much of the reasoning by Beach J in Green is supportive of the view that I have reached in this case.

Be that as it may, it is interesting to observe that Mr Waller in his book
Coronial Law and Practice in New South Wales 3rd edition at p 123 has discussed at least in general terms the type of problem with which the coroner is confronted and with which I am now confronted. At p 123 in his discussion of the provisions of s48 of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/), Mr
Waller said as follows: - "Certain religions, particularly those of Jewish and Muslim sects, have objected to the bodies of their deceased relatives being subjected to autopsies. Their religious beliefs include that a body should not be interfered with after a death. Experience has shown though that these beliefs may be subjugated to the laws of the state." 
He does not suggest that they must be so subjected and, in fact, I agree with his views. Mr Waller at p 124 also referred to the fact that the ordering of an autopsy is discretionary, so that while a coroner might have a policy with regard to full post mortem examinations, that policy must be related to the particular case at hand, especially where the exercise of that discretion is being questioned. In this case it is being questioned. The coroner's answer, "I do not have to provide any explanation" might in itself tend to suggest that for such additional reason there has been some misconception as to his discretionary powers under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) and as to how such should be exercised.

It seems to me, for all the reasons herein the relief sought by the plaintiff should be granted. I repeat, that this case does not represent a precedent.
Nothing that I have said is to suggest that it is a decision, other than one applicable in the particular circumstances of this case. Nor is it been taken as being an endorsement of the full views of Rabbi Gutnick or endorsement of any general view that religious beliefs, either collectively or individually, provide a foundation in itself for making an order of the type that has been sought. If it becomes necessary, it is appropriate for me to say that each case will turn on its own special facts.

Before parting in this case, I would like to add something else. It is hard to see why the Victorians have introduced a provision such as 29(4) of the [Coroner's
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/) and yet the state of New South Wales has not. The public interest must surely be the same whether one is looking north or south of the Victorian border. Had there been a provision such as 29(4), this application perhaps would not even have been necessary, or perhaps to put it another way, if there had been such a provision, my decision would have been made much easier, and the reasons for that decision would have been briefer. I commend to the legislature early attention to my observations and to the need for the legislature to consider introducing a provision similar in terms to that of [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s29.html) of the [Coroner's Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1985120/) .

In the light of stance adopted by the defendant, I make orders 2 and 3 as requested by the plaintiff's summons.

I grant a stay on terms that counsel approach the court within twenty-four hours.

Order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs.

I grant Mr Molomby leave to approach me in chambers in relation to seeking a stay of proceedings and the terms thereof.

At this point of time, I note that the defendant proposes to urgently appeal to the Court of Appeal from my decision. Upon the basis that that is what is to take place, I will make an order that there be a stay of proceedings in respect of order number 3 pending further orders by me later this afternoon.

SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
ON RESUMPTION AT 5.00 pm (IN CHAMBERS) 
HIS HONOUR: I propose to continue the stay granted in court on the following terms:
That a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal be filed by 9.30 am
Thursday 9 May 1996.
That the defendant release to the plaintiff the body of the deceased, Haim
Mendel Deitz, upon the plaintiff giving the following undertakings: that the said release be effected by the release of the body to the Sydney
Chevra Kadisha Oxford Street; that aside from the plaintiff permitting the ritual washing and dressing of the body according to Jewish law and custom, the plaintiff undertakes to ensure, so far as she is able, that the body be properly preserved and, further, not to permit the body to be otherwise dealt with or disposed of by the Sydney Chevra Kadisha, its staff, its members or by or on behalf of the plaintiff.
The stay is to continue until further order of the Court of Appeal.
Either party to have liberty to apply to me if necessary.
