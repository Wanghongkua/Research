JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
LATHAM J  MAY 2005  /05 - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS versus MARK ALAN BEAMAN  
JUDGMENT  HER HONOUR: The plaintiff appeals pursuant to <case> of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 against the orders of Local Court
Magistrate M I MacPherson made at Tamworth Local Court on 12 November 2004.  The defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of Drive with Low Range
Concentration of Alcohol contrary to <case> (2)(a) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/) 1999 [the Safety Act]. The magistrate find him $330 and disqualified him from driving for a period of 6 months to date from 22 November 2004. The automatic disqualification periods prescribed by <case> of the [Road Transport (General)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1999242/) 1999 [the General Act] which applied were - 6 months (but no less than 3 months) where there were no convictions for major offences in the preceding 5 years - <case> (2)(a), or 12 months (but no less than 6 months) where there were such convictions for major offences in the preceding 5 years - <case> (3)(a).  The evidence relied upon is annexed to the affidavit of R V Paul sworn 15
March 2005. The court attendance notice, annexure A, disclosed that the defendant was charged with a Low Range offence by reason of having driven a motor vehicle on 25 October 2004. The defendant's traffic record, annexure B, disclosed that he was originally licensed in 1981 and since that time he has had two alcohol related driving convictions recorded against him. Both convictions were in Queensland courts, the first in June 1995 and the second on 4 September 2000. The second entry is as follows:  "QUEENSLAND COURT  -08-2000 EXCEED PRESCRIBED 
CONCENTRATION OF ALCOHOL  $150 
DISQ 1 Month (Court Order) From 04-09-2000 
Interstate Conviction 
BLOOD ALCOHOL CONTENT (.15)"  The reasons of the magistrate are set out at pages 2 and 3 of annexure C to the affidavit of R Paul. The magistrate had regard to the version current in , of <case> (3A) of the Motor Traffic Act and the consideration of the section in Regina versus Green [(1982) 2 NSWLR 933.] His Honour noted that the present section, that is <case>, did not have the words "other crimes and offences" but referred to "one or more other major offences". The magistrate concluded at page 3 of the transcript of that date:  
It seems to me the words are different. This is an opportunity for somebody to take it to the Supreme Court and have it sorted out. So I am holding that in fact those words do not appear, it says major offence. Major offence (sic) seem to me to be confined to New South Wales legislation. I do not know that other States and territories use the words major offence. It really needs to be sorted out.  
Statutory Framework  The present case is concerned with a breach of <case> of the Safety Act which I set out below: 
Offence--novice range of prescribed concentration of alcohol  ... 
Offence--special range prescribed concentration of alcohol  ... 
Offence--low range prescribed concentration of alcohol 
A person must not, while there is present in his or her blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol:  drive a motor vehicle, or  occupy the driving seat of a motor vehicle and attempt to put the motor vehicle in motion, or  if the person is the holder of a driver licence (other than a provisional licence or a learner licence issued under the [Road Transport (Driver
Licensing) Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtla1998340/) - occupy the seat in a motor vehicle next to a holder of a learner licence who is driving the vehicle. 
Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units (in the case of a first offence) or 20 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
Offence--middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol  ... 
Offence--high range prescribed concentration of alcohol  ...  The dictionary defines "special range" as 0.02 gms or more but less than .05 gms of alcohol in 100 ml of blood; "low range" as 0.05 gms or more but less than 0.08 gms of alcohol in 100 ml of blood; "middle range" as 0.08 gms or more but less than 0.15 gms of alcohol in 100 ml of blood; and "high range" as 0.15 gms or more of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtla1998340/s24.html) of the General Act which in terms is subject to, inter alia, <case> provides for the general power of a court to disqualify persons upon their conviction of certain offences. That section provides that a court that convicts a person of an offence under the road transport legislation may, at the time of the conviction, order the disqualification of the person from holding a driver's licence for such period as the court specifies. Section 24(5) requires the court to cause particulars of each conviction or order under the road transport legislation to be forwarded to the Roads and Traffic Authority.  Section 25 of the General Act prescribes the disqualification periods for major offences including offences contrary to <case> of the Safety Act. A major offence is defined by <case> as:  "'major offences' means:  a crime or offence referred to in the definition of 'convicted person' in section 25 (1), or  any other crime or offence that, at the time it was committed, was a major offences under this Act or the Traffic Act 1999."  
The relevant subsections of <case> are as follows:  
Definitions in this section:  ...  'convicted person' means:  a person who is, in respect of the death of or bodily harm to another person caused by or arising out of the use of a motor vehicle driven by the person at the time of the occurrence out of which the death of or harm to the other person arose, convicted of:  the crime of murder or manslaughter, or  an offences under section 33, 35, 53 or 54 or any other provision of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), or  a person who is convicted of an offence under [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s51a.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), or  a person who is convicted of an offence under any of the following provisions:  [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s42.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/) of driving a motor vehicle on a road or road related area furiously or recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public,  [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s42.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/) of driving a motor vehicle negligently (being driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm,  [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s43.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/),  [section (1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s9.html), , (2) (a) or (b), (3)(a) or (b),(4) (a) or (b) or [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s15.html) or [16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s16.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/),  [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s22.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/),  [section (1)(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s12.html) or (b) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/),  [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s29.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/),  [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s70.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/),  or  a person who is convicted of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of or being an accessory before the fact to, any such crime or offence.  ...  
Disqualification if no previous major offence.  ...  
Disqualification if previous major offence 
If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction (whether that period commenced before or commences after the commencement of this section), the convicted person is or has been convicted of one or more other major offences (whether of the same or a different kind):  where the conviction is for an offence under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s9.html) , (1) or (2) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/);  the person is automatically disqualified for 12 months from holding a driver licence, or  if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 6 months) or longer period of disqualification -  the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order, or  where the conviction is for an offence under [section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s9.html) or [12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s12.html)(1) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/):  the person is automatically disqualified for 3 years from holding a driver licence, or  if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer period of disqualification -the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order, or  where the conviction is for an offence under [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s29.html) of the [Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/):  the person is automatically disqualified for 5 years from holding a driver licence, or  if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer period of disqualification -  the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order, or  where the conviction is for any other offence:  the person is automatically disqualified for 5 years from holding a driver licence, or  if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 2 years) or longer period of disqualification -  the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order.  
Calculation of disqualification periods in case of multiple offences.  ...  
Disqualification in addition to any other penalty.  ...  
Relationship to Subdivision 2.  ..."  Finally it should be noted that [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rtatma1999412/s26.html) specifically provides for the recognition and giving effect to of disqualifications in other States. It provides that a disqualification to hold an Australian driver licence held under a law in force in another State or internal Territory by a person who holds a driver licence issued in this State is to be treated as if it were a disqualification to hold the driver licence issued in this State.  In the Second Reading Speech to the Safety Act delivered on 23 June , the Minister stated that the primary purpose of the Bills was to provide a legislative framework for the adoption of a nationally uniform set of
Australian road rules and as a result, there was the opportunity for much needed rationalisation of the Traffic Act 1909.  I turn to a consideration of the legislative history of section 25. Section of the Motor Traffic Act 1909 gave power to a court before whom a person was convicted of an offence under that Act to suspend a person's licence or disqualify the person from obtaining a licence.  The next relevant amendment of section 10 was effected by the Motor
Traffic Amendment Act No 29 of 1937 which inserted s.10(3A) which was relevantly in the following form:  
Where a person is convicted of an offence under section four of this Act of driving a motor vehicle upon a public street furiously or recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public under subsection two of section five of this Act or of an offence under subsection one of section eight of this Act, then -  if, during the period of five years immediately before such conviction (whether such period commenced before or commences after the commencement of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act 1937) such person has not been convicted of any offence (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this paragraph - he shall be disqualified by such conviction and without any specific order for a period of one year from the date of such conviction or for such longer period as the court may specifically order, for holding a driver's licence under this Act or under the Transport Act 1930, as amended by subsequent Acts;  if, during the period of five years immediately before such conviction (whether such period commenced before or commences after the commencement of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act 1937), such person has been convicted of one or more offences (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this paragraph - he shall be disqualified by such conviction and without any specific order for a period of three years from the date of such conviction or for such longer period as the court may specifically order, for holding a driver's licence under this Act or under the Transport Act 1930, as amended by subsequent Acts.  
The disqualification referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be in addition to any penalty imposed upon the conviction.  The operative portion of that provision for present purposes is the phrase "such person has been convicted of one or more offences (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this paragraph".  In seeking leave to introduce the Bill on 24 November 1937, the Minister made only a passing reference to section 10 at page 1924. That reference did not advert to the present issue, namely, whether interstate convictions would activate section 10(3A).  Between 1937 and 1980, section 10 was amended on a number of occasions. In , section 10(3A) was relevantly in the following form:  "(3A) 
Where a person is, in respect of the death of or bodily harm to any other person caused by or arising out of the use of a motor vehicle driven by such first-mentioned person at the time of the occurrence out of which such death or harm arose, convicted of the crime of murder or manslaughter or of an offence under section 33, 35, 53 or 54 or any other provision of the [Crimes
Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), or is convicted of an offence under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s4.html) of driving a motor vehicle upon a public street furiously or recklessly or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, or of an offence under section 4E(1), (1B) or (7), section 5(2) or [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s8.html), or is convicted of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of, or being an accessory before the fact to any such crime or offence then -  if, at the time of such conviction or during the period of five years immediately before such conviction (whether such period commenced before or commences after the commencement of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act 1951), such person is or has not been convicted of any other crime or offence (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this paragraph, he shall be disqualified by such conviction and without any specific order for a period -  ....  ...  if, at the time of such conviction or during the period of five years immediately before such conviction (whether such period commenced before or commences after the commencement of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act 1951), such person is or has been convicted of one or more other crimes or offences (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this paragraph, he shall be disqualified by such conviction and without any specific order for a period -  ...  ..."]  The only judicial consideration of the present section or its predecessors occurred when section 10 was in this form. In Regina versus Green the Court of
Criminal Appeal considered the present issue and determined that the words "other crimes and offences" were not confined to crimes and offences committed in New South Wales.  The next relevant amendment of section 10 was effected by the Motor
Traffic (Road Safety) Amendment Act No 123 of 1982. That Act removed subsection 10(3A) and inserted a new section 10A. Section 10A(1) was entitled "Disqualification for certain major offences" and set out the persons to whom the section applied ("the convicted person") in terms of a series of offences which had previously been listed in section 10(3A). Convictions for those offences were to be referred to as "the conviction".  Thereafter section 10A relevantly provided as follows:  "(2) If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction (whether that period commenced before or commences after the commencement of this section), the convicted person is not or has not been convicted of any other crime or offence (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this section, then -  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1E) -  he shall be disqualified by the conviction and without any specific order ...  ...  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1F) -  ...  .... 
If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction (whether that period commenced before or commences after the commencement of this section), the convicted person is or has not been convicted of one or more other crimes or offences (whether of the same or a different kind) of the class referred to in this section, then -  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1E) -  he shall be disqualified by the conviction and without any specific order ...  ...  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1F) ...  ..."  It is noteworth the term "major offence" was not used in the body of section 10A. In the Second Reading Speech on 24 November 1982 the Minister for
Transport stated that the principal purpose of the Bill was to introduce random breath testing. Accordingly, there was only a passing reference to the issue of disqualification periods.  The last amendment of significance to the present issue occurred on 15
April 1999 to what was then known as the Traffic Act 1909. Section 2 of that Act defined the term "major offence" as meaning:  "(a) a crime or offence referred to in s.10A(1), or  an offence under section 4E(1) or (1B) as in force before the commencement of this paragraph."  
Section 10A(1) was substantially similar to the 1982 version and the remaining relevant subsections were as follows:  "(2) If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction (whether that period commenced before or commences after the commencement of this section), the convicted person is not or has not been convicted of any other major offence (whether of the same or a different kind) then -  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1D) or (1E) -  the person shall be disqualified by the conviction and without any specific order ...  ...  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4 E(1F) or 5(2) -  ...  (b(i)) where the conviction is for an for offence under section 5AC -  ...  ... 
If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction (whether that period commenced before or commences after the commencement of this section), the convicted person is or has been convicted of one or more major offences (whether of the same or a different kind), then -  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1E) -  he shall be disqualified by the conviction and without any specific order ...  ...  where the conviction is for an offence under section 4E(1F) -  ...  ..."  In summary then, two changes to section 10(3A) or section 10A occurred since 1982. The first was the use of the term "major offence" in the body of the section; the second was the omission of the qualifying phrase "of the class referred to in this section". The question then is whether there is anything in the amendments since 1982 which indicates an intention that the disqualification provisions should not have regard to interstate offences.  In Regina versus Green the Court of Criminal Appeal was comprised of Street
CJ, Samuels JA and O'Brien CJ of CrD. Street CJ gave the leading judgment in which he posed the question in the stated case as whether the appellant's
Canberra offence brought him within the terms of section 10(3A) - in other words, was that offence within the concept of "other crimes or offences" in section 10(3A)(b). It was common ground that the Canberra offence was "an offence of the class referred to in the paragraph".  His Honour referred to the provisions of the [Habitual Criminals Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hca1957176/) and continued at pp 935-936 of the reported decision:  "In the Motor Traffic Act the context is different. There is to be found in that Act no similar indication which might be relied upon as giving a territorial limitation to the concept of 'other crimes or offences'. There is accordingly no necessity to look for words of extension in the Motor Traffic
Act.  ... the Legislature has, by the terms it has used in the relevant portions of section 10(3A), intended to, and in fact achieved, an extension of the meaning of those words so as to extend to 'other crimes or offences' whether committed within New South Wales or outside New South Wales. The qualification which is placed upon 'other crimes or offences' is that they be 'of the class' referred to in the paragraph.  
Plainly enough the Canberra offence was 'of the class' referred to in the paragraph and I see no reason on the face of this statute, nor upon any other consideration of the legislative purpose which can be seen to have been enshrined within its terms, for restricting the words 'other crimes or offences' to those committed within New South Wales."  Samuels JA stated at page 936:  "It seems to me that there is every reason to suppose that the Legislature intended to pick up offences of the class in question wherever they were committed. To put it in a negative way, and if I may respectfully borrow the words of Bray CJ in R versus Collins [(1976) 12 SASR 498] at p.501, 'Neither the language nor the purpose of the section seems to me to require any such limitation'; that is to say, any limited territorial application. On the contrary, to my mind the purpose of the section requires the opposite construction."  In R versus Collins it was held that the words "to be of good behaviour" in the Offenders Probation Act 1913-71 should not be limited in any territorial sense.  Two Practice Books refer to Green as being authoritative in relation to s.25 (see Motor Traffic Law - Butterworths, volume 2 at p.85,090; and
Leslie and Britts Motor Vehicle Law at page 2-84.  From a review of the above it is evident that there is nothing in the
Safety Act or the General Act which points to a territorially restricted application of section 25. In fact, the advent of those Acts in , with the stated purpose of providing a legislative framework for the adoption of a nationally uniform set of Australian road rules, tends to support the notion that rather than the States and Territories existing in isolation, there is a public benefit in their acting co-operatively. This is particularly so where public safety is the primary consideration.  The movement towards a co-operative approach is reinforced by the enacting of section 26(2), which specifically provides for the recognition and giving effect to of disqualifications in other States.  The replacement of the terms "other crimes and offences" with "major offences" is not significant and whether or not other States adopt this technique of legislative drafting is not the point. The issue of substance is whether other States have offences of the same or similar character to the offences defined as major offences. In the present case the relevant
Queensland conviction has an obvious counterpart in s.9 of the Act and is unambiguously a major offence.  If the proper approach is that taken by the magistrate, some curious results may flow. Some States may have adopted similar terminology in their corresponding traffic legislation - if that were so, on the reasoning of the magistrate, s.25 would have regard to them. Other States may have similar substantive offences, but not adopt the terminology, and they could not be taken into account.  A third option is that other States may have adopted the terminology in relation to offences other than arising out of the use of a motor vehicle. The magistrate's reasoning would require those offences to be taken into account.
Each of these results are arbitrary and arguably unfair and their application would not be for the evident purpose of public safety.  In any event, it is evident in Green that it was not the phrase "other crimes and offences" of itself which persuaded the Court of Criminal Appeal of its territorial application. It was the context and purpose of the provision in its statutory context which their Honours found persuasive. It is submitted that nothing in the Safety Act and the General Act indicates a narrow territorial application of s.25; nor is there any indication in the apparent purpose of those enactments, which leads to the conclusion. I find that submission persuasive in the circumstances.  In the present case, the Queensland conviction in 2000 was the equivalent of a conviction for a high-range PCA offence contrary to s.9(4) of the
Safety Act. As such, it was in substance a major offence as defined in s.3(1) and s.25(1) of the General Act (see paragraph (c)(iv) of the definition of "convicted person").  Accordingly, the magistrate should have concluded that the defendant had been convicted of a major offence in the five years preceding the present conviction. In those circumstances I am satisfied that the magistrate erred in focusing solely upon the different terminology between s.10(3A) and s.25 and in concluding that the latter does not have regard to interstate offences.  Further, his Honour erred in failing to have regard to Green's case as cogent authority on the proper construction of s.25.  Accordingly, I make the following declaration:  
I declare that the magistrate erred in law in determining that interstate offences could not be taken into account in determining the applicable maximum monetary penalty and the applicable automatic and minimum disqualification periods of the offence of drive with low concentration of alcohol.  No other orders set out in the summons filed in this Court on 16 March 2005 are sought and I make no further orders, save that in relation to costs, I award costs to the plaintiff and grant a certificate under the Suitors' Fund
Act to allow those costs to be met. I note that an undertaking was given by the plaintiff not to pursue the defendant personally for those costs.
