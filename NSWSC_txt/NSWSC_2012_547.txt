EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR:This is an application by Interlocutory Process filed with leave today for orders varying certain orders made by Ward J on 19 September 2011 under [s 588FF(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588ff.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)") that the time for the making of an application in respect of Octaviar Administration (in liquidation) ACN 101 069 390 ("OA") under [s 588FF(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588ff.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) be extended from 3 April 2012, as earlier ordered, to 3 April 2013 in the case of any application against Octaviar Investment Notes Limited (in liquidation) ("OIN") and Octaviar Investments Bonds Limited ("OIB") or either of them. 
The application is supported by the affidavit of Tracy Knight, Director Corporate Recovery of the accountancy firm who is assisting the liquidators of OA in the administration of OA and OL, that is in Octaviar Limited (Receivers and Managers appointed) (in liquidation) ACN 107 863 436. 
This judgment should be read in conjunction with my judgment of 30 May 2011 and that of Ward J of 19 September 2011, both of which are to be found on the court file. 
The gravamen of the application is that there are potential proceedings available to OA against OIN and OIB which companies are significant creditors in the administration of OA. Those companies have lodged proofs which have been adjudicated on and it is quite possible that once all proofs in the administration have been completed, those companies will comprise the major creditors in the estate. 
Since the making of Ward J's orders on 19 September 2011, the liquidators have engaged in a series of steps including the commencement of proceedings against other parties and the carrying out of further investigations. 
The liquidators of both OIN and OIB consent to the variation of the orders sought. This will permit the liquidators to preserve the opportunity for OA to pursue claims in due course against OIN should they come to the view that once the adjudications are complete it would be in the interests of OA as a whole to pursue them. In the meantime it will be unnecessary to take steps to pursue them, save that the liquidators propose to conduct additional investigations into the matters which have been raised by OIN and OIB as being potential defences. 
It is appropriate in the present circumstances, given the factual background and in particular the consent provided by the prospective defendants, that the order be varied. 
The basis upon which the variation is sought is that it is open to the Court to do so pursuant to [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) [Pt 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p36) r 36.16. The juridical basis for this is concisely discussed by Ward J in her Honour's judgment earlier referred to. It is also clear that if there is any prejudice to any party as a consequence of the making of the orders, it is to OIN and OIB, and they both consent.
The orders sought include an order that they be joined as respondents to these proceedings. 
I make the following orders: 
The order of the Court made on 19 September 2011 is varied by adding after the words "3 April 2012" the following words, "Except in the case of any application against any of Octaviar Investment Notes Limited (In Liquidation) and Octaviar Investment Bonds Limited (In Liquidation) in respect of which the time for making any application under <case> FF (1) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) is extended to 3 April 2013.

These orders are to be entered forthwith.
