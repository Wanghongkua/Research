REGINA versus N 
The applicant, who was accused of sexually assaulting his son, sought the production of certain documents, including confidential counselling communications which, it was submitted, were privileged from production under [s126H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126h.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) . The trial judge declined to make an order as to whether or not access should be given to material produced in answer to the subpoenas issued.

Held: . Derivative applicability of [s126H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126h.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) [Section
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126h.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) requires that evidence is not to be adduced of a "protected confidence". Counsel accepted the applicability of [s126H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126h.html) to subpoenas by virtue of Pt29 r1 of the District Court Rules.
 . Determination of the trial judge was a "judgment or order" which was appellable 
Judge Shillington did not determine whether or not to grant access to the documents but left the matter to be determined by the trial judge. Held this was an order within s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. (Attorney-General for
New South Wales versus Stuart [(1994) 34 NSWLR 667], and R v
Keeling, unreported, NSWCCA, 5 September 1996, at pp10 and 20 referred to.) . No risk of prejudice to accused given access a week before trial 
The nature of the documents in issue are not likely to be of such significance that access given the week before the trial carries sufficient risk of either prejudice to the preparation of the defence or of a successful application for the adjournment of the trial.

ORDER 
Leave to appeal refused.

CRIMINAL APPEAL /98

REGINA versus N 
JUDGMENT 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The applicant is accused of sexually assaulting his son on a number of occasions. At the time of the alleged offences the son was between the ages of four and thirteen. In preparation for trial, the applicant caused a number of subpoenas to be issued, relevantly, to the Royal North Shore Hospital and Parramatta Marist High School. On return of the subpoenas objection was made to the production of some of the material on that basis that it was privileged from production under [s126H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s126h.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) which provides: "(1) Evidence is not to be adduced in a proceeding if it would disclose: a protected confidence, or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence, unless the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.

Evidence of a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence is not to be adduced if the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing of the party's intention to adduce the evidence to: each other party, and if the protected confider is not a party, the protected confider, and 
The court must not give leave to adduce evidence of a protected confidence or a document recording a protected confidence unless the court is satisfied that: the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have substantial probative value, and other evidence of the protected confidence or the document recording the protected confidence is not available, and the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or a document of substantial probative value.

Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of [subsection (c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s3.html), the court must take into account the likelihood, and the nature or extent, of harm that would be caused to the protected confider if evidence of the protected confidence or document is adduced.

The court must state its reasons for giving or refusing to give leave under this section.

A protected confider or counsellor who is not a party to proceedings may, with the leave of the court, appear in the proceedings." [Section
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s126g.html) provides: "(1) In this Division: 'address' includes a private, business or official address.
 'harm' includes actual physical bodily harm, financial loss, stress or shock, damage to reputation or emotional or psychological harm (such as shame, humiliation and fear).
 'protected confidence' means a protected counselling communication made by a person against whom a sexual assault has been, or is alleged to have been, committed, whether before or after the acts constituting the offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred.
 'protected confider' means a person who made a protected confidence.
 'protected counselling communication' means a communication made by a person in confidence to another person (in this Division called the 'counsellor') in the course of a relationship in which the counsellor is treating the person for any emotional or psychological condition suffered by the person.
 'protected identity information' means information about, or enabling a person to ascertain, the address or telephone number of a protected confider or a counsellor of a protected confider.
 'sexual assault offence' means: an offence referred to in section 578 of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), or an offence prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition.
 'telephone number' includes a private, business or official telephone number.

For the purposes of this Division, a communication may be made in confidence even if it is made in the presence of a third party if the third party's presence is necessary to facilitate communication or further the counselling process." 
On 18 June 1998, his Honour Judge Shillington of the District Court had before him an application on behalf of the accused seeking that the documents produced in answer to the subpoena be made available for inspection. This was objected to and his Honour declined to make the order sought.

His Honour made reference to the decision of McLelland CJ in Equity in
Telstra Corporation versus Australis Media Holdings [(1997) 41 NSWLR 147.] 
When the matter came on for hearing today the effect of his Honour's application of the decision in Telstra Corporation was acknowledged to be superseded by the introduction in the District Court Rules of Pt29 r1 which provides: "Nothing in this Part compels a person on whom a subpoena is served to produce a privileged document or thing." 
The definition of "privileged document" in Pt29 r1 extends to documents privileged under the provisions of Div1B with which we are here concerned. In the light of these amendments to the rules, Counsel for Mr Nagy accepted the application of s126H to subpoenas and other ancillary processes of the court as put beyond doubt by these amendments to the rules. The rules were not relevantly challenged before us.

The complaint that was made to us was to the effect that his Honour ought to have decided the question whether or not access should be given to material produced in answer to the subpoenas, so that the accused could have sufficient time to prepare his defence. There is little doubt of the significance of material of the character which is likely to be contained in the two reports.
Judge Shillington had access to both the reports. We have not thought it necessary to have such access for the purposes of dispensing with this case, although the documents were proffered to us if we wished to read them. As I have indicated, we have not thought it necessary to do so.

The issue before the court is whether or not the proper decision to be made by
Judge Shillington was to decide whether or not access should be granted. It is common ground that his Honour did not in fact do so.

As quoted above, s126H(1) requires that evidence is not to be adduced of a "protected confidence". The definition of "protected confidence" extends to a protected counselling communication which, in turn, as quoted above, requires: "A communication made by a person in confidence to another person ... in the course of a relationship in which the counsellor is treating the person for any emotional or psychological condition suffered by the person." 
There was no evidence before Judge Shillington as to whether or not a communication to a social worker or to a school counsellor was in fact a "communication made by a person in confidence". Nor, at least in the case of the school counsellor, does it appear that there was any evidence that it was done in the course of a relationship which could be appropriately identified as "treatment".

These, however, on the submissions that were made to this court, are matters to be determined on another occasion. It appears to be common ground that
Judge Shillington did not in fact determine these matters.

The submission was made that Judge Shillington ought to have done so and that, as a general rule, matters associated with access to documents ought to be determined with sufficient notice to the party seeking the documents so that proper use can be made of such rights of inspection as may be granted by the court.

Be that as it may, it is by no means clear that the matter has to be determined on the basis of the urgency with which it is brought before this court.

According to an affidavit of a solicitor employed by the Crown Solicitor and read before us, it appears that flexible arrangements exist whereby subpoena proceedings can be listed for argument before the trial judge in the week before the commencement of the trial.

The submissions to the court suggested the practical use of such material as may become available in the two reports, would be for the purposes of cross- examining the complainant. In a case such as the present, where there is an allegation of sexual misconduct which is strenuously denied, more often than not the case will fall to be determined on the basis of the credibility of the complainant. Material of the character which is contained or is probably contained within the documents to which access is sought is likely to be of significance, either directly or in suggesting a course of enquiry with respect to such cross-examination.

I do not wish for a moment to understate the significance of access in these matters if it is properly available, in accordance with the provisions of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), for access to be granted to the accused or his legal representatives.

Nevertheless, nothing in the nature of the material gives rise to any belief that notice of a period of about a week; namely, the week before the trial, would be, in the normal course of events, so short as to render the access of little utility. If in particular circumstances that is not the case then, of course, application can be made to the trial judge for adjournment.

The submission was made that these proceedings fell within [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) which relevantly provides: "5F(3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings ...".

The question in this case is twofold: whether or not his Honour's determination constitutes "an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings". The second question is whether or not the court should give leave to appeal from an order of this character. It is not necessary to set out in detail the authorities on what constitutes a "judgment or order". The question is whether or not there is an order.

There is authority in this court to the effect that an order for production of documents addressed to a stranger to the proceedings, consequent upon the rejection of a claim of public interest immunity, constituted an interlocutory order within the meaning of [s5F.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) (See Attorney General for New South Wales versus Stuart [(1994) 34 NSWLR ).](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2034%20NSWLR%20667 "View LawCiteRecord" )

Furthermore, there is authority in this court that a ruling that a person is not required to produce a document to the court on the basis of successfully making out a claim for legal professional privilege was within [s5F.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) (See R versus Keeling, unreported, NSWCCA, 5 September 1996. James J at p10 and
Cole JA at p20).

By [s5F(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html), the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions is given a right to appeal against interlocutory judgments or orders. Other parties to the proceedings require leave under [s5F(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html)
Other than by the requirement of leave, the position of the parties on appeal should be taken as equal. It can hardly be regarded as a position of equality that the Crown should be able to appeal, without leave, if access to a document is given, but an accused cannot appeal even with leave, where access to a document is denied. Nothing in [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) suggests that such a fundamental inequality was intended to be enshrined at the heart of the criminal appeal process.

There is, however, a real question as to whether or not leave should be granted in this case.

In my opinion, one has to have in mind the general proposition that it is undesirable to fragment the process by permitting interlocutory appeals either before or, let alone, during the course of a criminal trial. Matters relating to access to documents for use in a trial are matters that are properly left, in the usual course, for the trial judge to determine. No doubt, there will be circumstances in which notice greater than a week before the trial, when the identity of the trial judge becomes known, would suggest that an earlier hearing by the court below is required. This does not appear to be such a case.

The nature of the documents that are in issue in this case are not likely to be of such significance that access given the week before the trial carries the real risk of either prejudice to the preparation of the defence or of a successful application for the adjournment of the trial.

In my opinion, this is not a case appropriate for leave to be granted. I would refuse leave.

SULLY J: I agree. 
IRELAND J: I also agree. 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the court is that leave is refused. * * *
