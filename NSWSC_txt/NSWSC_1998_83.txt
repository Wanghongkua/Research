LORNA MAREE JOHNSTON versus DARRYL JOHNSTON` ` 4410/97` `25 March 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This matter has been heard ex parte and I am satisfied that the defendant was duly served with process. He was of the view that he could bluff it out with the process servers rather than attend the Court so that there is no further need to consider his position unless, of course, he makes the appropriate application under Part 40 Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules. 
The evidence is that the plaintiff expended $33,644.94 in improvements to the defendant's land on the basis that there would be an ongoing relationship and that the land and the home built on it would be the home of them both. The plaintiff also supported the defendant during the period and it would be unconscionable when the relationship broke up for one party to the relationship to keep the whole of the work and materials put into the property by the other.

It is a matter of equity choosing which is the most appropriate relief and it seems to me that in this case the conscionability problem is appropriately dealt with by directing that there be an equitable charge over the property for the sum I have mentioned which with interest at Court rates amounts to $54,532.81.

Accordingly the Court declares that the plaintiff has an equitable charge over the land comprised in folio identifiers 2, 3 and 4/14/758876 in the sum of $54,532.81.

The Court directs that the order be served on the defendant and also be served on two persons who appear to be caveators namely Household Financial Services
Pty Ltd or its successor in title and Joanne Johnston.

I will stand the matter over until 8 April at 10 o'clock at which time I will entertain a motion to appoint trustees for sale to enforce the equitable charge and I will entertain any application by a caveator to be joined.

The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings to date plus the costs of serving him and the caveators in accordance with these orders.
