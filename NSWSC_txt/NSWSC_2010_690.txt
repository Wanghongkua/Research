COMMON LAW DIVISION 
JAMES J 
FRIDAY 2 JULY 2010 /289628 BRIAN CHETWYND versus ARMIDALE DUMARESQ COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings the plaintiff Brian Chetwynd sued the defendant the Armidale Dumaresq Council ("the Council" or "the defendant") for publishing allegedly defamatory matter in November 2007.
 The plaintiff was a member of the Council between 2000 and 2008 and was
Mayor between 2000 and 2005. In 2005 he was a member of an advisory committee set up by the Council ("the Advisory Committee") in relation to the New
England Regional Art Museum (NERAM).
 On 11 July 2005 the plaintiff attended meetings of the Advisory Committee and then of the Council. Complaints were subsequently made about the plaintiff's conduct at the meeting of the Advisory Committee and in early 2007 a committee ("the Code of Conduct Committee") was set up to investigate these complaints.
 The Code of Conduct Committee prepared a report which contained a number of adverse findings about the plaintiff's conduct at the meeting of the Advisory
Committee on 11 July 2005. This report was included in the agenda contained in a notice of a meeting of the Council to be held on 26 November 2007. The notice of meeting including the agenda was sent by the Council to all members of the Council, to a number of members of the Council's staff, to some members of the public and to a number of representatives of the media. It was this distribution of the agenda which was alleged by the plaintiff to have been the publication by the Council of defamatory matter about him.
 Subject to minor qualifications, the defendant did not dispute that the imputations alleged by the plaintiff had been conveyed and that the imputations conveyed were defamatory of the plaintiff. However, the defendant raised defences of justification [(s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s25.html) of the [Defamation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/) - "the
Act"), absolute privilege (s 27 of the Act), publication in a public document (s 28 of the Act), common law qualified privilege, statutory qualified privilege (s 30 of the Act) and common law fair comment. A defence of honest opinion (s 31 of the Act) was raised at the hearing but later withdrawn.
 In his amended reply the plaintiff in reply to the defence under <case> of the
Act alleged that the defamatory matter had not been published honestly for the information of the public and in reply to the defences of common law qualified privilege, statutory qualified privilege and common law fair comment alleged that the Council had been actuated by express malice in the publication of the matter complained of.
 The evidence in the proceedings was extensive. Witnesses who gave oral evidence for the plaintiff were the plaintiff himself, the plaintiff's wife,
Mrs Beverly Roobol who was a member of the Council from 2001 to 2008 and Mrs
Margaret Wolfer who gave brief evidence on an aspect of damages.
 Witnesses who gave oral evidence for the Council were members of the Council at relevant times Mr Ducat, Mr Whan, Mr Waters and Mr Maher; employees of the
Council, Mr Harvey, Mr Hadfield, Ms George and Mrs Stachiw; a solicitor who was a partner in Phillips Fox Ms Judith Healy; a solicitor who was a member of the Code of Conduct Committee Mr Singh; and an employee of an information technology firm Mr McLachlan.
 Apart from the oral evidence a large number of documents were admitted into evidence.
 There are some disputed questions of fact which I will endeavour to resolve later in this judgment. However, many facts were not disputed or were clearly established by the evidence. A number of facts were established by the file notes, letters and oral evidence of Ms Healy of Phillips Fox. No suggestion was made at the hearing that any of the evidentiary material from Ms Healy was otherwise than completely reliable. I will now set out some of the undisputed or clearly established facts. When I refer to a document I am recording that a document in those terms came into existence and not that facts asserted in the document are necessarily true.

Undisputed or clearly established facts In 2000 the Armidale and Dumaresq Councils were amalgamated to form one
Council, the Armidale Dumaresq Council.
 In May 2000 the plaintiff was elected as a Councillor to the new amalgamated Council and in September 2000 he became the Mayor.
 In 2004 Dr Janice Lally was appointed the Director of NERAM for a term of five years. In May 2005 the Council became the corporate trustee of NERAM and the Advisory Committee for NERAM was appointed of which the plaintiff was a member.
 Complaints were made about Dr Lally's performance as the Director of NERAM.
These complaints were discussed in a long telephone conversation on 5 July between the plaintiff and Ms Healy acting as the Council's solicitor.
Extensive notes of the conversation were taken by Ms Healy, which included the following:- "Opinion of general manager concurs with Brian's (that is the plaintiff's) in that if we do not terminate this agreement there will be no staff. Brian understands that Council may have to pay out for the balance of the term." On 5 July 2005 Ms Healy prepared notes to be used by the plaintiff at a meeting of the Advisory Committee to be held that night. The notes were based on instructions which Ms Healy had received from the plaintiff and were in the following terms:- "NOTES FOR MEETING - CONFIDENTIAL 
Some very serious concerns have been raised today with respect to the performance of the Director, Dr Janice Lally, of the New England Regional Art
Museum.
 
These concerns include the serious following facts: * The claim that the Director treats staff (including volunteers) and the public very poorly and in such an inappropriate and bullying way that the staff have informed me that they intend to resign if the Director's employment is not terminated. For example, the staff asked for a meeting with me only and the Director found out about this and told the staff that they were not to meet with me, unless the Director was present.  * The Director denied to me (contrary to what a staff member had informed me) over the telephone today, that the Director had prevented the staff from meeting with me, without the Director being present:  * The Director declines to assist the Consultant, Mr Garry Slocombe (who has been appointed on a short term basis) to consider the financial position of the Museum and its structure, as a matter of urgency.  * The Director is frequently not present in the museum during business hours.  
Given the above, I intend to consider whether the Director has committed wilful breaches of the employment contract and also whether the Director has committed misconduct.

Resolution 
Propose to consider, as a matter of urgency, whether the Director has committed wilful breaches of the employment contract/and also whether the
Director has committed misconduct and whether therefore the employment contract should be terminated immediately." I infer that a meeting of the Advisory Committee was held on 5 July 2005 and that the plaintiff spoke at the meeting in accordance with the notes which had been prepared by Ms Healy.
 On 7 July 2005 Ms Healy sent a letter of advice to the plaintiff. A later letter sent on 11 July 2005 was in identical terms, apart from some additions to the later letter. As the letter of 11 July 2005 was the focus of submissions at the hearing and as I will be setting out the letter of 11 July in full, I will not set out the terms of the letter of 7 July 2005.
 On 8 July 2005 Ms Healy had a telephone conversation with the Council's general manager Mr Burns, who informed her that an emergency meeting of the
Council would be called for Monday 11 July 2005. On the same day Ms Healy had a telephone conversation with Del Bennett, a volunteer at NERAM, concerning the behaviour of Dr Lally.
 At 11:46 am on 11 July 2005 Ms Healy emailed to the plaintiff two documents, being a letter of advice and Ms Healy's notes of her conversation with Del Bennett. The letter of advice was in the following terms:- "Termination of Employment Agreement between you and New England Regional
Art Museum Reserve No. 96366 (NERAM) and Janice Lally, dated 29 June 2004 
We have been asked to advise on the termination of the Employment
Agreement of Dr Lally (Agreement).

Terms of the Agreement 
The Agreement is between NERAM and Dr Lally, the Director of NERAM.
 
We understand that the Council has appointed, on about 20 May 2005, its own
Advisory Committee to oversee the corporate trust management role for NERAM.
Whilst some changes have occurred as a consequence of this appointment (for example the appointment of Garry Slocombe as a consultant and business manager on a short term basis) the appointment of the Council's Advisory Committee does not change that the Agreement continues to apply to Dr Lally's employment.
 
Clause 2.1 of the Agreement states that: 'The term of this Contract shall be five (5) years commencing Monday, 30
August 2004.' 
Thus the Agreement appears to be a fixed term contract and has just over four years to 'run' being the balance of the term.
 
Clause 11.1 of the Agreement provides that: 'The Director may terminate the Employment Agreement on three (3) months written notice given to NERAM.' 
Unfortunately (and rather unusually) there is no similar term in the
Agreement providing for NERAM to give notice to the director Therefore assuming NERAM gave notice of the termination of the contract, it would have to give notice of the balance of the term or, to avoid damages being awarded by a Court (equivalent to the balance of the term of the contract) it would have to pay Dr Lally pay in lieu of more than four years (about $300,000 assuming a remuneration package of about $73,760 pa). This however may be reduced if Dr Lally was to mitigate her damages by earning income from alternative work.
 
Clause 11.2(c) provides that: 'If the Director at any time is convicted of a felony or is guilty of any wilful breach or continued neglect of the provisions of this Employment
Agreement or of misconduct bringing the Director or NERAM into disrepute,
NERAM may by written notice given to the Director terminate the Employment
Agreement: ...
 for any reason specified in paragraph (c) of this subclause, without any period of notice and without payment and allowances (other than remuneration benefits accrued to the date of termination).' 
The effect of clause 11.2(c) is that, if Dr Lally had committed such serious breaches of the Agreement, NERAM may terminate the Agreement without any notice.
 
Courts are conscious that summary dismissal (ie termination without any notice or pay in lieu of notice) can have a detrimental effect on the employee's reputation.

Obviously each case has to be considered in light of its particular circumstances but the effect of summary dismissal places a heavy burden on an employer to justify dismissal without notice. Whilst the circumstances do not have to be exceptional, they nevertheless have to establish that the breach was of a serious nature.

Background 
Dr Lally has expressed concerns about Garry Slocombe's appointment. On 9
June 2005, the Mayor, on behalf of NERAM, Advisory Committee, wrote to Dr
Lally saying, amongst other things, that: 'The Committee recognises the importance of your role in NERAM and is appreciative of the efforts and actions you have taken. It acknowledged that you were appointed to the position at a difficult time for the gallery and that you have in essence, inherited an onerous task. It is also acknowledged that under these circumstances you have carried out your obligations with enthusiasm and dedication. The Committee has already conveyed to you, their confidence in your identified skills and attributes and it is desirous that you continue to play an important role in NERAM.' 
On 5 July 2005, various concerns were raised by the Mayor at a meeting of the Advisory Committee for NERAM being as follows: Dr Lally treats staff (including volunteers) and the public very poorly and in such an inappropriate and bullying way that some members of the staff have informed the Mayor that they intend to resign if Dr Lally's employment is not terminated. For example, the staff asked for a meeting with the Mayor only and Dr Lally found out about this and told the staff that they were not to meet with the Mayor, unless Dr Lally was present; . Dr Lally denied to the Mayor (contrary to what a staff member had informed the Mayor) that Dr Lally had prevented the staff from meeting with the Mayor, without Dr Lally being present; . Dr Lally declines to assist the Consultant, Mr Garry Slocombe (who has been appointed on a short term basis) to consider the financial position of the Museum and its structure; . Dr Lally is frequently not present in the museum during business hours (although Dr Lally has apparently been present more frequently since Garry
Slocombe's appointment)..

Evidence 
We are concerned that Council may not have sufficient evidence (providing specific examples (etc) with respect to the above concerns (see paragraphs 1 to 4). Further, the concerns above may not be sufficiently serious to warrant
NERAM terminating the Agreement by relying upon clause 11.2(c) and therefore not giving Dr Lally notice of termination.
 
We also understand that there may be issues concerning: * Dr Lally refusing to reply a response with respect to the founding submissions; and  * probity issues concerning Dr Lally taking leave (eg. trip to Germany in about February 2005) but not applying for and taking leave as annual leave.

However we are yet to receive any documents concerning the above.
 
Letter to Dr Lally 
At the very least, a letter should be prepared to Dr Lally setting out the concerns and asking that Dr Lally promptly responds to the concerns. Dr Lally should be informed, in the letter, that NERAM is considering terminating the
Agreement on the basis of clause 11.2(c). (A draft of the letter to Dr Lally is attached.

Strictly speaking if circumstances are so serious as to justify summary dismissal, the contract should be terminated immediately and there is no need to put the issue to Dr Lally by letter and seek his (sic) response.
 
However, given the fact that the evidence is arguably not strong enough to justify summary dismissal, we think it prudent to put the concerns to Dr Lally in writing and to give her a short period in which to respond.
 
We are instructed that staff are somewhat reluctant to discuss 'openly' the issues concerning Dr Lally for her reprisal.
 
Judith Healy has had two telephone discussions with staff being: * Corrine (who works in Finance) and who has asked that her comments, for the moment, be kept confidential; and  * Del Bennett (a volunteer) who is prepared for us to share with you the comments which she has made (a copy of the file note of Del's comments is attached).

Potential claims 
Assuming NERAM terminates the Agreement, Dr Lally may institute proceedings in the District Court against NERAM for breach of contract and claiming damages representing the balance of the term of the five year fixed term, interest and costs.
 
Alternatively to Dr Lally commencing a claim for breach of contract, Dr
Lally may commence proceedings under Section 106 of the Industrial Relations
Act of New South Wales (unfair contracts claim).
 
Dr Lally may claim that: the Agreement and arrangements surrounding it (including the involvement of the Council, its Advisory Committee , and the Mayor) was unfair; the communication to Dr Lally, in early June 2005, that the Committee was confident of Dr Lally's skills etc and that she would continue to play an important role in NERAM was misleading and deceptive;
Dr Lally was not properly consulted concerning the appointment of Garry
Slocombe, who in effect took over her duties and responsibilities and accordingly her position was in fact made redundant.

Dr Lally may institute an unfair contracts claim against not just NERAM but also, the Council, the Mayor and possibly, Garry Slocombe.
 
Unfair contracts claims are expensive (costs above are likely to exceed $120,000) and there are considerable delays (the case may not be heard for about two years from its commencement date). However, unfair contracts claims commonly settle at conciliation (which usually occurs within about six to twelve months of the claim being lodged) and at which time costs may only be about $20,000.
 
There is no question that, assuming NERAM terminates the Agreement, the best result would be that: * NERAM agrees to pay Dr Lally a sum of money (obviously considerably less than $300,000 representing remuneration which Dr Lally would have earlier during the balance of the term);  * there is no litigation arising from the Agreement and its termination; and  * Dr Lally signs a Deed of Release in which she agrees to make no claims against NERAM, the Council, members of the Advisory Committee, the Mayor and Garry Slocombe.

To try to achieve the above, a 'without prejudice' discussion would need to occur with Dr Lally and this should occur at about the same time (or shortly thereafter) as the letter to Dr Lally is provided to her which sets out the concerns. It may be of importance to Dr Lally from a reputational point of view to try to resolve her claims, rather than to argue the claims 'publicly'.

We look forward to discussing this advice with you." This letter of 11 July 2005 was in the same terms as the letter of 7 July , except for the addition of the second and third paragraphs under the heading "Evidence" and all of the material under the heading "Letter to Dr
Lally, after the first two sentences.
 In a covering email sent at 11:46 am on 11 July 2005 Ms Healy said that she would shortly be sending the draft letter to Dr Lally.
 At 5:00 pm on 11 July 2005 Ms Healy emailed to the plaintiff a draft letter to Dr Lally, which was in the following terms:- "Dear Dr Lally 
I refer to your employment agreement, dated 29 June 2004, between New
England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) and yourself. (Agreement).
 
In particular I refer to clause 11.2 of the Agreement which provides, amongst other things, that the Agreement may be terminated if you are guilty of any wilful breach or continued neglect of the provisions of the Agreement or of misconduct bringing NERAM into disrepute.
 
During the last few weeks the following breaches and acts of neglect by you have been raised:
You treat staff (including volunteers) very poorly and in an inappropriate and bullying way; 
Certain staff contacted the Mayor and asked for a meeting to discuss concerns about your treatment of the staff. You refused to allow the staff to meet with the Mayor without you being present; 
You denied to the Mayor (contrary to what the staff say) that you had prevented the staff from meeting with the Mayor without you being present; 
You decline to assist Mr Garry Slocombe (who has been appointed as a consultant on a short term basis to consider, amongst other things, the structure of NERAM); and 
You have refused to supply and keep informed relevant persons with respect to providing funding submissions; 
As you will appreciate these breaches and acts of neglect are very serious.
 
Consideration is being given to terminating the Agreement and your employment as Director of NERAM, pursuant to Clause 11.2 (c) and 11.2 (e).
Further or alternatively, consideration is being given to termination on the basis that you have repudiated your obligations pursuant to the Agreement.

NERAM would like to give you an opportunity, on an urgent basis, to respond in writing to the breaches and acts referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5.
 
If you do not respond, by July 2005, or your response is unsatisfactory,
NERAM intends to terminate the Agreement and your employment.
 
Yours sincerely" At 5:03 pm a further copy of the letter of advice of 11 July 2005 was sent to the plaintiff.
 Between about 5:00 pm and 5:19 pm on 11 July 2005 Ms Healy and the plaintiff had a telephone conversation. Ms Healy's notes of the telephone conversation and the oral evidence of Ms Healy and the plaintiff establish that one of them said "we really have not anywhere to go" and the plaintiff said "not really a case for summary dismissal". In the context of the plaintiff expressing a desire to summarily dismiss Dr Lally, Ms Healy said "can take gutsy move & terminate on summary dismissal grounds. Worst position is that you have to pay out for the balance of the term".
 On the evening of 11 July 2005 a meeting of the Advisory Committee was held between about 5:45 pm and 7:20 pm. There are two sets of Minutes of this meeting. At the hearing there was no explanation why there are two sets of
Minutes. One set of Minutes was in the following terms:- "MINUTES OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL ART MUSEUM,
HELD MONDAY 11 JULY 2005 IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS, AT 5.45PM 
PRESENT: Chair Chetwynd, Clrs Maher, Roobol and Waters 
IN ATTENDANCE: CIrs Ducat, Kelly, Walford, and Whan and General Manager, Mr
Shane Burns.

APOLOGY: Clrs Beyersdorf and Patricks 
The Committee discussed a number of issues of concern.

The Motion on being put to the vote was CARRIED.
 
MOVED CR WATERS SECONDED CR ROOBOL

The Motion on being put to the vote was CARRIED.
 
CLOSE OF MEETING 
There being no further business, the meeting closed at 7.20pm." The other Minutes were in the same terms, except that, in lieu of "the
Committee discussed a number of issues of concern" the following appears:- "The Chair gave an update on developments and legal advice. The following options were presented:
Not happy with performance of Director 
Unfair contract 
Incompetence 
Pay out Contract 
Paid leave 
Power of Chair" Neither set of minutes records in any detail what was said at the meeting of the Advisory Committee. What happened and what was said at the meeting was strongly contested at the hearing and was the subject of much disputed evidence. I will make findings about what happened and what was said at the meeting later in this judgment.
 At the meeting of the Council held at 7:20 pm, that is immediately following the conclusion of the Advisory Committee meeting, at which the plaintiff and Councillors Ducat, Kelly, Maher, Roobol, Walford, Waters and
Whan were present, it was resolved that the Council endorse the recommendations of the Advisory Committee.
 On the morning of 12 July 2005 the plaintiff had a telephone conversation with Ms Healy. The plaintiff informed Ms Healy of the passing of the resolution to terminate the contract with Dr Lally. Ms Healy said that "Council recognises that its full liability (to Dr Lally) may be for the complete balance of the term".
 On 12 July 2005 Ms Healy sent a letter to the plaintiff in the following terms:- "We refer to your telephone conversation with Judith Healy this morning.
 
We note that a resolution has been passed to terminate the agreement between NERAM and Dr Lally, the Director of NERAM without notice and that the termination should occur today.
 
As discussed with you, Dr Lally may, amongst other things, make a claim under Section 106 of the Industrial Relations Act NSW (Unfair Contracts
Claim).
 
In Lang versus Commonwealth Bank of Australia  <case>, Justice Schmidt found the contract of employment to be unfair within the meaning of Section 106 because of serious deficiencies in the investigation into the conduct of the Applicant, despite finding that the
Applicant had engaged in misconduct warranting his summary dismissal.
 
Her Honour commented: "The consequences for any employee of dismissal for misconduct may, of course, be serious. In the case of a Senior Executive such as Mr Lang, it can readily be appreciated that the effective result may be the end of a career, otherwise successful prior to the termination. In those circumstances, that fairness would require that an employer would conduct a thorough investigation of allegations of misconduct, giving an opportunity to the employee to understand the allegations and what they are based on, to respond and to then have the response taken into account in any decision, can also readily be appreciated".

For that reason, I drafted the letter (which I sent to you yesterday) to
Dr Lally giving her an opportunity to respond to the alleged breaches and act of neglect and informing her that, if the response was unsatisfactory, her employment may be terminated.
 
We note that we are instructed to proceed on the basis of not providing Dr
Lally with an opportunity to understand the allegations and to respond to them.
 
Attached is a draft letter to Dr Lally terminating the employment on the basis set out in the preceding paragraph.
 
Assuming you wish to proceed on this basis still, two persons should be present when you provide the letter to Dr Lally and you should make notes, immediately after your meeting with Dr Lally, as to what is said.
 
If you have any queries, please contact Judith Healy." The draft letter to Dr Lally was in the following terms:- "Dear Dr Lally 
I refer to your employment agreement, dated 29 June 2004, between New
England Regional Art Museum (NERAM) and yourself (Agreement).
 
In particular I refer to clause 11.2 of the Agreement which provides, amongst other things, that the Agreement may be terminated if you are guilty of any wilful breach or continued neglect of the provisions of the Agreement or of misconduct bringing NERAM into disrepute.
 
You have committed the following breaches and acts of neglect, amongst others:
You treat staff (including volunteers) very poorly and in an inappropriate and bullying way, 
Certain staff recently contacted the Mayor and asked for a meeting to discuss concerns about your treatment of the staff. You refused to allow the staff to meet with the Mayor without you being present, 
You denied to the Mayor (contrary to what the staff say) that you had prevented the staff from meeting with the Mayor without you being present, 
You decline to assist Mr Garry Slocombe (who has been appointed as a consultant on a short term basis to consider, amongst other things, the structure of NERAM), and 
You have refused to supply and keep informed relevant persons with respect to providing funding submissions, 
As you will appreciate these breaches and acts of neglect are very serious.
 
Accordingly, I confirm that your Agreement and your employment as Director of NERAM, is terminated with immediate effect, pursuant to Clause 11.2 (c) and .2 (e). Further or alternatively, to relying on clause 11.2 (c) and 11.2 , termination with immediate effect is occurring on the basis that you have repudiated your obligations pursuant to the Agreement." On 12 July 2005 a letter in the terms drafted by Ms Healy, which was signed by the plaintiff, was personally delivered to Dr Lally by the plaintiff.
 After the dismissal of Dr Lally three letters expressing concern about her dismissal were written.
 One letter dated 24 July 2005 was from Associate Professor Kerry Dunne to the Minister for Local Government. Professor Dunne expressed her concern about the possible deleterious effects of the dismissal on the Museum. The only reference to the plaintiff was that "while the Mayor might not be at liberty to comment on the situation publicly, it is imperative that there be transparency in the case, because otherwise NERAM's reputation will be damaged..." Another letter dated 12 August 2005 was from Mr Bob Baxter, a member of
NERAM. In his letter Mr Baxter pointed to the situation of conflict for Dr
Lally which had been created by the appointment of a business manager. In his letter Mr Baxter said that "in my almost 40 years of experience in public and private sector employment practices I have never seen a termination notice based on such flimsy and vague reasons and with no prior advice or notice".
 In a letter to the manager of the Investigation and Review Branch of the
Department of Local Government, which was undated but which was received on 16
September 2005, Jane Hall said:- "I wish to express my deep concern at the recent summary dismissal of the
Director of the New England Regional Art Museum, Dr Janice Lally, by the
Armidale Dumaresq Council.

The Council's actions have been far from transparent: both in the press and at a NERAM committee meeting which was attended by well over a hundred concerned members and friends of the Gallery, Mayor Chetwynd has consistently refused to answer any questions about the reasons for Dr Lally's dismissal.

I am concerned that due process has not been followed and I ask the
Investigation and Review Branch of the Department of Local Government to look into this matter during its upcoming investigation of the Armidale Dumaresq
Council." In August 2005 Dr Lally brought proceedings in the District Court against the Council for breach of contract.
 In September 2005 the plaintiff did not seek re-election as Mayor but remained as a Councillor.
 The plaintiff declined to provide a statement for use by the Council in defending Dr Lally's proceedings. Phillips Fox gave advice that in their opinion the Council had little chance of successfully defending the proceedings and that it was imperative that the proceedings be settled. In May the proceedings were settled, on terms that the Council pay Dr Lally $80,000 and her costs, later agreed at $40,000.
 In March 2006, while the court proceedings by Dr Lally were still pending, a report by the Department of Local Government into the Council was issued. In the report it was noted:- "The former Mayor was Council's representative on the trustee committee.
The termination of the former director of New England Regional Art Museum is the subject of a current legal challenge, involving Council. Council should seek advice on whether it can refer concerns about the former Mayor's actions in his capacity as Council representative on the NERAM trust to the conduct committee while legal action is under way or if it should wait until any legal action is finalised (Recommendation 40)." On 20 June 2006 the general manager of the Council Mr Burns wrote a letter to the Mayor Councillor Ducat referring to Recommendation 40 in the report and noting that the proceedings by Dr Lally had been finalised and saying that:- "This now allows Council through its Code of Conduct Committee to consider
Cr Chetwynd's role relating to the following matters:
The recruitment process of the employment/ engagement of the business manager. 
The dismissal of the former Director Ms J Lally." On 11 July 2006 Mr Ducat sent an email to an officer of the Department of
Local Government inquiring about "our way forward with the issue of a Code of
Conduct complaint against the former Mayor Councillor Brian Chetwynd".
 On 31 July 2006 Mr Burns made a record that he and Mr Ducat had contacted the Department of Local Government about a report of a Code of Conduct
Committee into a complaint against Councillor Walford, asking whether the report could be dealt with in private or whether the complaint could be withdrawn. Mr Burns recorded that "(the Departmental officer)...advised that it is too late to go back. Once a review has commenced there is an obligation to place the matter before Council upon a breach being determined. Also the matter needs to go in open Council".
 On 20 December 2006, after a delay of some months, the Director General of the Department of Local Government wrote a letter to Mr Burns, in which he noted that the court proceedings (by Dr Lally) had been finalised and added:- "The Minister for Local Government and the department received three complaints about the conduct of the Mayor in this matter. As contemplated in the recommendation, the conduct of Clr Chetwynd as outlined in these complaints should be examined by you and, if appropriate, referred to council's conduct committee. To that effect, I am attaching the three complaints received." Mr Burns considered it inappropriate that he should investigate the conduct of the plaintiff and did not carry out any investigation.
 Some steps were taken to form a Code of Conduct Committee to inquire into complaints against the plaintiff.
 On 5 February 2007 the Council received a letter from Councillor Waters dated 2 February 2007. Parts of this letter were as follows:- "TO: The Armidale Dumaresq Council Code of Conduct Committee 
Re: Complaint against Councillor Brian Chetwynd 
Dear members of the Code of Conduct Committee, 
I contend that Cr. Chetwynd breached Council's Code of Conduct and
Council's Code of Meeting practice by providing misleading information to the
NERAM Advisory Committee meeting of 11 July 2005 held at 530 pm and the extraordinary meeting of Council held at 6.20 pm that same day.
 
At the meeting Councillor Chetwynd led me to believe that it was necessary that Dr. Janice Lally's contract of employment as Director of NERAM should be terminated 
Over a number of weeks the following are some of the points of contention which Cr. Chetwynd brought to meetings, used as reasons that Dr. Lally's performance was unsatisfactory.
 * Open hostility between the Director and Business Manager,  * A large number of signed but unpresented cheques were found in a drawer, and the suggestion from the Mayor was that this was to conceal the true financial position of NERAM.  * Portrayal that the place was a total mess and that we should act or "there would be nothing left".  * Verbal report by Mayor that staff were willing to sign declarations regarding their inability to work with the director and staff resignations were likely  * Dr Lally's extended periods of absence,  * Applications for grants, which would have resulted in a financial loss to NERAM, were lodged by the Director without consultation and approval of the business manager 
In addition he reaffirmed the grounds for dismissal, stating that the advice from Lawyers Phillips Fox was that if Dr. Lally lodged a claim against
Council, then our case was "eminently winnable", he used the word "watertight", and said that any one of the matters above would be sufficient grounds for dismissal, placing particular emphasis on the matter of the alleged cheques in the drawer.
 
I clearly recall asking what was Council's legal exposure in the event of a claim by Dr Lally? what was Council's legal advice regarding our position in defending a claim.
 
Cr Chetwynd claimed that Council would win any case and that it was highly unlikely that Dr Lally would lodge a claim.
 
I recall Councillor Maher asking if, in the opinion of Council's Lawyers, 'Natural justice and procedural fairness" had been followed. Councillor
Chetwynd answered "Yes". It is clear from the letter of 12th July 2005 from
Phillips Fox, that "natural justice and procedural fairness" had not been followed.
 
Attached are letters from Phillips Fox emailed to Cr. Chetwynd and Council on 11th July 2005 and 12th July 2005, and a copy of telephone call times by Cr
Chetwynd and Phillips Fox from 5th July to 21st July 2005.
 
I do not recall seeing the letter from Phillips Fox dated 11th July prior to the commencement of the meeting. The letter clearly stated that "we are concerned that Council may not have sufficient evidence".
 
Sometimes Cr. Chetwynd handed out information at the commencement of a meeting. If this was the case in this instance, then no time was provided to read it I would never have agreed to go to court contrary to legal advice. I do not believe the balance of the Councillors were provided with a copy of the letter prior to the meeting of Council.
 
I contend that the evidence is clear that Cr. Chetwynd had every opportunity to know of the advice from Phillips Fox regarding Council's exposure to risk, either by the emailed letter of 11th July 2005 or the telephone conversations between Cr. Chetwynd and Phillips Fox that same day, and should have conveyed that to the meeting of July 11th 2005." The first meeting of the Code of Conduct Committee was held on 8 February
This meeting was attended by Mr Ducat, Mr Whan, Mr Mitchell (the
Council's solicitor) and Mrs Stachiw as administrative support. It was noted that the general manager Mr Burns had "declined to be involved in this investigation due to his position as general manager and the potential conflict in this matter". Mr Whan was nominated to take the place of Mr Burns.
The Committee determined that all communications for the purposes of the inquiry would be in writing and that no verbal investigations would be conducted. It was determined that the Committee would write to the plaintiff referring to the letter from the Department of Local Government of 20 December and to the complaints relating to the plaintiff and informing the plaintiff of the composition of the Committee and of the evidentiary material which would be included in the investigation.
 On 12 February 2007 Mr Ducat as chairman of the Committee wrote a letter to the plaintiff stating:- "CODE OF CONDUCT INVESTIGATION - PROMOTING BETTER PRACTICE REVIEW 
RECOMMENDATION 40 
FORMER MAYOR'S ACTIONS IN RELATION TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF NERAM STAFF 
I am writing to advise you of the Code of Conduct Investigation to be held following receipt of a letter from the Department of Local Government arising from the Local Government Promoting Better Practice Review, Recommendation 40, which was referred to Armidale Dumaresq Council's Code of Conduct Committee process.

The Investigation committee will consist of myself, Deputy Mayor Bruce
Whan, an independent representative yet to be determined, and Mrs Rhonda
Stachiw as Administrative Support.
 
Please note that as of today, Mr John Mitchell has notified Council of his decision to disqualify himself as the independent representative due to his involvement as Council's Solicitor in 2005. Efforts are being made to find a suitable replacement for Mr Mitchell and we will advise you immediately a
Committee is established.
 
I apologise for the delay in establishing this investigation and advise that, due to the Christmas vacation, the letter from the Department of Local
Government, addressed to the General Manager, did not reach me until 16
January 2007.
 
Please find attached a copy of the letter from the Department and attached letters of complaint.
 
I wish to advise that it is anticipated that all communications relating to this investigation will be in writing." On 1 March 2007 Mr Ducat as chairman of the Committee wrote a letter to the plaintiff for the purpose of keeping the plaintiff informed of progress in the investigation. In the letter Mr Ducat said:- "Council has secured the services of Mr Kip Werren, a solicitor of Moin & Associates, to act as the Independent Representative on this complaint investigation. The initial meeting of the Committee will be held on Thursday 8
March 2007.
 
I also wish to advise that I have received a complaint from Councillor Ken
Waters, registered on 5 February 2007, relating to the NERAM staffing matter.
It is intended that the complaints referred by the Department of Local
Government and the complaint from Cr Waters will be dealt with simultaneously by this Committee." On 5 March 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat. In his letter the plaintiff said that he strongly objected to the manner in which Mr Ducat was proceeding and asserted that Mr Ducat had not complied with the Code of
Conduct and in particular clause 10.12 of the Code.
 Clause 10.12 of the Code of Conduct, which I will set out in full later in this judgment required that inquiries made by the general manager, an independent person or a Conduct Committee should follow the rules of procedural fairness.
 In his letter the plaintiff provided details of his objections as follows:- ) The first paragraph of your letter of 12th February 2007 states"...Recommendation 40, which was referred to Armidale Dumaresq Council's
Code of Conduct Committee process." In fact, the letter from the Director
General of Local Government dated 20th December 2006 is to the General
Manager. The fourth paragraph states,"...these complaints should be examined by you and, if appropriate, referred to Council's Conduct Committee." Clearly, the DLG requests the General Manager to examine the complaints. Why was this not done? Further, on what, or whose authority, has the Committee been convened, in the absence of such determination? ) The General Manager is required to make enquiries under Sect 10.12 of the Code and amongst other things, to inform the person against whose interest a decision may be made. I am not aware of any enquiries and I have not been informed in accordance with the Code. Why was this process not undertaken? The mere fact of enclosing what is purported to be "complaints," is insufficient and does not comply with the Code.
 ) In the Review Procedures, I note that a complaint, "must be in writing", and "must specify with precision the alleged breach(es) of the Code of
Conduct." I have not seen a complaint against me in writing, nor have I been advised of any alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct. Why has this process not been undertaken and why have I not been advised? The fact that I have not been informed of the complaint, severely compromises my position, in respect of procedural fairness.
 ) I note that Sect 10.12 refers to the enquiries to be conducted without undue delay. I am concerned that this has not been the case, despite your apology. This delay has led to speculation that has compromised my position.
This is particularly the case, as the matter was mentioned by the General
Manager in a Committee Meeting at which Councillors and others were present, prior to making any enquiry or informing me of any complaint or alleged breach. This inappropriate action has compromised my position.
 .) I refer to your letter of 1st March 2007, in which you state that a complaint has been received from Cr Waters, presumably against me. Again I note that the Code has not been followed and procedural fairness not considered. Why was Sect. 10.9 of the Code not adhered to? I refer to my points 1), 2) and 3) above and repeat my questions in that regard, about this alleged complaint.
 ) I note that you state in your letter of the 1st March 2007 that the complaints "will be dealt with simultaneously" On what authority or section of the Code do you rely upon to deal with this alleged complaint, when you have not complied with Sect. 10.12 of the Code? ) I note that you advise me that Mr Kip Werren of Moin & Associates is to be on the Conduct Committee. I advise that I wish to strongly object, to this person hearing any possible or alleged complaint against me, on the following grounds: 
That Moin & Associates are engaged by Council to act for them from time to time.
 
That the above firm have and presumably are acting for Council in the
NERAM matter.

Under such circumstances, I do not believe that I would receive a fair and unbiased hearing. Furthermore, Sect 10.12 of the Code specifically refers to persons involved in enquiries, in which they have a direct interest. In addition, I note with interest the reason that Mr. John Mitchell excluded himself, as stated in your letter of 12th February 2007.
 ) I further note that you intend for the Conduct Committee to meet on the th March 2007. Considering the above, I would contend that any such meeting, would be a blatant attempt to further compromise my position." A meeting of the Code of Conduct Committee at which Mr Ducat, Mr Whan and
Mr Werren and Mrs Stachiw as administrative support were present was held on 8
March 2007. The Minutes of the Meeting recorded that Mr Werren was welcomed as an independent representative on the Committee. It was decided that a letter should be sent to the general manager asking why he has proceeded as he had. A detailed paragraph by paragraph response to the plaintiff's letter of 5 March was discussed, as follows:- "Response to Cr Chetwynd: 
Para 1: The complaint from the Department of Local Government was received by the General Manager and referred to the Code of Conduct Committee via the
Mayor. It is clear that the Department of Local Government requested the matter to be dealt with by the Code of Conduct Committee and that the
Department be advised of the outcomes of the investigation.

Para 2: Procedures have been followed according to the Code of Conduct
Handbook. Clause 10.12 states: "enquiries made by the general manager, an independent person or the conduct committee".

Para 3: The Committee had its first meeting on 8 March 2007 and will be commencing an investigation into the four written complaints. The committee will examine the documentation, conduct an investigation and ensure that Cr
Chetwynd is kept informed of progress. Procedural fairness will be applied according to Clause 10.12 of the Handbook.

Para 4: As previously explained, the delay in dealing with this complaint can be attributed in part to the Department of Local Government's letter not being received by Council until 22 December 2006. A further delay has been experienced due to appointment of an Independent Representative on the
Committee. Now that Mr Kip Werren has accepted the appointment, the Committee will be taking action to investigate this matter without further delays.

Para 5: The complaint from Cr Waters was referred to the Code of Conduct
Committee by the General Manager. Cr Chetwynd was advised of the intention to include Cr Waters' complaint with the other complaints received from the
Department and due process will be followed in dealing with all complaints under the Code of Conduct Handbook. The Committee determined that following this meeting, a copy of Cr Waters' complaint will be provided to Cr Chetwynd.

Para 6: The Committee will reconvene on 16 March 2007 to consider the specific written complaints in this matter. The Committee will follow the procedures under Clauses 10.7,10.11 and 10.12 of the Handbook.

Para 7: At all times, Council was the client of Moin and Associates and there was no conflict of interest for the purposes of the Solicitor's Professional
Rules of Conduct. Furthermore, Mr Kip Werren does not have an interest in the matter." On 12 March 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff as a progress report on the Code of Conduct investigation. In this letter Mr Ducat said:- "The Code of Conduct Investigation Committee met at 8am on Thursday 8
March 2007. The Committee was in receipt of your letter dated 5 March 2007 and considered the contents before progressing with other discussions.
 
Due to the nature of the concerns expressed in the letter, the Committee was unanimous in its determination that it is necessary to appoint an independent representative from outside of Armidale as a fourth member of the investigation committee. Mr Alexander Singh from Everingham Solomons
Solicitors in Tamworth has agreed to act as the fourth member of the
Committee.
 
Mr Kip Werren, the other independent representative, has assured the
Committee that there is no actual or perceived conflict in this matter.
Moreover, while noting the concerns expressed in your letter, the Committee will continue with its inquiries and the newly constituted Committee will meet as soon as Mr Singh has familiarised himself with the documentation." On 28 March 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a further letter to the plaintiff. In the letter Mr Ducat informed the plaintiff that the Committee now consisted of Mr
Ducat, Mr Whan and two independent representatives Mr Werren and Mr Singh. The first meeting of the newly constituted Committee had been held on 22 March
Action would be taken to obtain further and better details of the complaints.
 Over a period of some months letters were written on behalf of the
Committee to various persons requesting them to provide statements about inter alia the dismissal of Dr Lally. These letters were written to members of the
Council, employees of the Council and persons associated with NERAM. Replies were received from many of these people.
 A reply dated 13 April 2007 was received from the general manager Mr Burns.
In his reply Mr Burns said that the plaintiff had told him that there were problems with Dr Lally, which were stated by the plaintiff to be:-
The staff were ready to walk out and they were dissatisfied with Dr
Lally's performance
The volunteer base was decreasing and if Dr Lally did not leave the place would not have any volunteers left.
 Mr Burns said that the plaintiff had made a comment "something like 'she has to go or there will be no NERAM operation left'".
 Mr Burns said in his letter "when the matter was considered at Council the former Mayor and Trust Chair Councillor Chetwynd did most of the talking to convince the other councillors to support the dismissal".
 On 23 April 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat. In this letter the plaintiff said "I have never met Mr Werren and my objection is based solely on his connection with Moin and Associates and his conflict in my view is both actual and perceived". In this letter the plaintiff complained about what he said was the delay in investigating the complaints, he criticised the
Committee for not acting in accordance with the Code of Conduct, he accused Mr
Ducat of "making up your own rules" and of writing responses to the plaintiff's letters which contained "meaningless and verbose rhetoric" and he expressed the view that the Committee was not properly formed.
 The plaintiff concluded the letter by saying:- "More than enough time has elapsed for you to carry out these simple processes and I have been very patient over this time, albeit that I have alleged complaints against me. Regretfully, I must take the view that your
Committee is not properly formed under the Code and is not following procedural fairness and therefore the veracity of any decision could hardly be taken seriously. Further, in light of your inaction, I now formally object to your membership of the Committee on the basis that, in my view, you have breached Section 10.12 (amongst others) of the Code of Conduct.
 
Please be advised that I now request from you, a detailed reply to my correspondence, the proper and formal notification of the alleged complaints and an undertaking in respect of proper process and procedural fairness.
Further, I request that your reply adequately address all of my concerns and that you provide such reply by 5pm 24th April 2007. Should I not receive this reply, I may follow such course of action as I may be advised." On 23 April 2007 Mr Ducat sent an email to the plaintiff asserting that time was required "due to the need of the Committee members to familiarise themselves with the details of the complaint and the logistics of bringing four people together". Mr Ducat asserted that the Committee was properly formed.
 On 30 April 2007 the plaintiff sent an email to Mr Ducat reiterating his complaints about the delays in the investigation.
 On 15 May 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff, which included the following:- "The Committee notes your continued objection to the presence of Mr Werren on the Committee solely due to his connection with Moin & Associates. Mr
Werren will remain on the Committee.
 
The Committee notes your criticism that it should have acted sooner. In this regard, we note that the committee is now formed and has followed the procedures required by the Code of Conduct Committee Handbook and will continue to do so until this matter is concluded and a report prepared.
 
As to the need for communications to be in writing, please refer to Clauses and 12 of the Code of Conduct Committee Handbook Procedures, pp6-7.
 
We note that you do not accept that procedural fairness is being afforded to you. You will have every opportunity to respond to those allegations (if any) that the committee believes have sufficient substance. The Committee is thoroughly investigating the matter to ensure that the obligations of procedural fairness are met.
 
The Committee notes your desire to receive forthright responses from the
Mayor. The Mayor can only deal with this matter in his capacity as Chairman of this committee.
 
The Committee is properly constituted and will continue to do its duties prescribed by the Code of Conduct Committee Handbook.
 
Your objection to the Mayor's membership of the committee is noted.
However, the Code does require the Mayor's membership unless the Committee is formed to deal with a complaint by or about the Mayor.
 
The Committee met on 10 May 2007 and advises that its investigation is continuing. We confirm that clarification has been sought from certain complainants and this clarification is required before proceeding further.
 
We will contact you again regarding progress following the next meetings scheduled for 18 and 31 May 2007." On 6 June 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff. In this letter Mr
Ducat identified three issues stating the relevant sections of the Code of
Conduct and stating "allegations/questions to be answered". Issue 1 was "the dismissal of Dr J Lally". Issue 3 was "the proceedings of the meetings of the
NERAM Advisory Committee and Council on 11 July 2005". It is unnecessary to refer in detail to issue 2, which was "the appointment of Mr G Slocombe as business manager".
 The parts of the letter dealing with issues 1 and 3 were as follows:- 
Issues 
Relevant Code of Conduct Section 
Allegations/Questions to be answered  --- 
The dismissal of Dr Lally
The proceedings of the meetings of the NERAM Advisory Committee and
Council on 11 July 2005 .4, 4.6, 4.7, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.9 .1-8, 5.1-6, 8.1-3, 8.6-7 
The Committee is investigating the Mayor's actions in the dismissal of Dr
Lally.

Please outline the procedure that you adopted in the dismissal of Dr Lally.
Specifically, did you take action within the jurisdiction of the Mayor under the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) in dealing with staff issues? 
The Committee is investigating the Mayor's actions in the dismissal ofDr
Lally.

Please outline the procedure that you adopted in the dismissal of Dr Lally.
Specifically, did you take action within the jurisdiction of the Mayor under the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) in dealing with staff issues? 
There is evidence before the Committee to suggest that you had telephone conversations with Phillips Fox on 11 July 2007, prior to the meetings with NERAM and Council on 11 July 2005.

Was that advice received by you in the telephone conversations relayed to the
Councillors at the meeting? 
Did you accurately represent to the meeting the substance of the written and verbal legal advice received by you prior to the NERAM and Council meetings relating to the potential liabilities which could be incurred by
Council as a result of the dismissal of Dr Lally? 
It is alleged that Councillor Maher was heard to ask you during one of the meetings whether it was the opinion of Council's solicitors that "natural justice and procedural fairness" had been followed and that you answered "Yes".

Could you please advise the Committee of your recollection of this issue? 
It is alleged that during one of the meetings, Councillor Waters asked you a question as to what was Council's legal exposure in the event of a claim by
Dr Lally. It is further alleged that at the same meeting, Councillor Waters also asked you what was 
Council's legal advice regarding defending a claim by Dr Lally. In response to these questions it is alleged that you said words to the effect that Council would win any case and it is highly unlikely that Dr Lally would lodge a claim.

Could you please advise the committee of your recollection of this issue?  The letter concluded:- "The Committee is now providing you with an opportunity to submit your written response to the questions raised in the three areas identified in the table above.
 
The next scheduled meeting will be on 14 June 2007, and if time permits, your response would be appreciated by 5pm 12 June 2007 to allow the Committee a day to consider your response prior to the meeting. For your information, please find attached the latest version of Council's adopted Code of Conduct,
June 2006." On 12 June 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat. In the letter he complained that a full copy of Councillor Waters' complaint and the attachments to the complaint had not been attached to Mr Ducat's letter of 6
June 2007, as asserted in that letter; he complained that in the circumstances insufficient time had been allowed in which to provide responses; he asserted that since Mr Ducat's letter of 12 February 2007 the plaintiff had been requesting full details of the allegations against him.
 With respect to issues 1 and 3 identified in Mr Ducat's letter of 6 June the plaintiff said:- "a) In respect of Issue 1 - dismissal of Dr J Lally. Is this an allegation in respect of any action that may have been, or is alleged to have been taken by me? If so, please provide full details in accordance with my request in 3) above. If not, then please provide any information that you rely upon in respect of those Sections of the Code of Conduct stated therein.
 .....
 c) In respect of Issue 3 - proceedings of the meetings of the NERAM
Advisory Committee and the Council meeting on the 11th July 2005. Are these allegations in respect of any actions that may have been, or are alleged to have been taken by me? If so, please provide full details in accordance with my request in 3) above. If not, then please provide any information that you rely upon in respect of those Sections of the Code of Conduct stated therein.
Further, and in respect to each particular point of Issue 3, I advise and/or request: i.) In respect of part (a), I request that you provide full details in respect of any alleged telephone conversations and further that you provide any evidence that you rely upon in respect of any statements about alleged conversations being "relayed to the Councillors." ii.) In respect of part (b), are you alleging that I did not accurately represent the substance of any written or verbal advice that you allege I received? If so, please provide full details of the allegations. If not, please provide the substance of the information upon which you rely. Further, are you alleging that I may or could be responsible for any "potential liabilities that could be incurred by Council, as a result of the dismissal of
Dr Lally?" If so, please provide full details of any such allegations). If not, then please provide the substance of the information upon which you rely.
 iii) In respect of part (c), are you alleging that Cr. Maher asked me a particular question and that I allegedly provided the answer of 'yes'? If so please provide the full details of any alleged conversation, or questions, when and where they are alleged to have taken place and in the presence of whom, as well as any statement of fact upon which you rely. If not, please provide the substance of any information upon which you rely.
 iv) In respect of part (d), are you alleging that Cr. Waters asked certain questions in respect of "legal exposure" and "a claim by Dr. Lally," to me and that I answered in a particular manner? lf so, please provide the exact details of any alleged conversations or questions, when and where they are alleged to have taken place and in the presence of whom, as well as any statement of fact upon which you rely. If not, please provide the substance of any information upon which you rely."  The plaintiff asserted near the end of the letter that he was prepared to answer "in a true and proper manner" any definite allegations made against him, provided that appropriate evidence was supplied.
 The Committee prepared a document described as a Notes and Action Plan, which was progressively updated. In the Plan an "Actions/Task" to be performed was described and a note made of the date on which it was completed.
 On 14 June 2007 a letter was written to the plaintiff on behalf of the
Committee which had been drafted by Mr Singh. The letter contained the same three issues as had been set out in the letter of 6 June 2007 but references were made to numerous specific documents relating to each issue. For example, a number of documents were specified in relation to each of pars (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Issue 3.
 On 28 June 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat. In the letter he complained that he had not been provided with "any definitive allegations and the appropriate evidence". He queried the use in Mr Ducat's letter of 14 June of the expressions "allegations/questions" and "issues". He asserted that the documents provided were "selective" and appeared to be "either hearsay, speculation or supposition". The plaintiff asked that the complaints made against him be clearly identified. As to the three letters of complaint sent to the Department he asserted that none of them contained any complaint against him and asked whether any of Associate Professor Dunne, Mr Baxter and
Ms Hall had made a complaint against the plaintiff. As to the complaint by Mr
Waters he said "I deny the allegation" (that he had provided misleading information to the meetings on 11 July 2005) and he asked that Mr Waters clarify his complaints and be "absolutely specific". The plaintiff demanded to know why information about telephone call details had been supplied by the general manager to Mr Waters. The plaintiff sought more information in relation to the statements made by Ms George and by Ms Jennifer Hughes.
 On 20 July 2007 a letter nine pages long, which had been drafted by Mr
Singh was sent to the plaintiff on behalf of the Committee. In the letter it was asserted that the plaintiff's letter of 28 June 2007 had been "unresponsive" to the three issues. It was suggested that the plaintiff's options were to clearly deny an allegation and provide reasons, clearly partially accept an allegation and provide reasons or clearly totally accept an allegation and provide reasons. In the absence of any clear statement, it would be assumed by the Committee that the plaintiff neither denied nor accepted an allegation.
 In relation to each of the three issues the letter summarised at length "background evidence" and "matters of concern worthy of investigation".
Clauses of the Code of Conduct which it was alleged the plaintiff had breached were specified. As to each allegation the plaintiff was asked "how do you respond to this allegation?". The letter asked the plaintiff to respond to allegations - "please only make responses to the allegations listed above...all comments, requests and observations should be drafted clearly in separate correspondence".
 A two-line reply was received from the plaintiff dated 5 August 2007. The plaintiff said "I acknowledge receipt of your letter above (the Committee's letter of 20 July 2007). I reject the allegations therein".
 From time to time the Committee received replies from persons to whom it had written asking for information, including replies from Mr Burns (13 April ), Ms George (27 May 2007), Mr Waters (15 June 2007), Mr Maher (2 July and 18 July 2007) and Mr Hadfield (22 August 2007).
 On 4 September 2007 a letter was written by Mr Ducat on behalf to the
Committee to the plaintiff. In the letter the plaintiff was informed that "the
Committee has formed interim conclusions as to the viability of the allegations made against you". The clauses of the Code of Conduct which the
Committee had concluded on an interim basis that the plaintiff had breached were specified and the plaintiff was given "a further opportunity to put your case forward in regard to the Committee's interim conclusions". The letter continued:- "Attached to this letter is the evidence the Committee has relied on and you may be able to provide some further guidance of the weight the Committee should place on the evidence".
 On 12 September 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat referring to the Committee's letter of 4 September 2007. The plaintiff complained that his previous letters complaining about the process (in which the Committee was engaging) and requesting information and documents had not been answered. The plaintiff asserted that the Committee had been "very selective" about who it had sought information from and had forwarded a selection of documents to those persons "to help you in refreshing your memory". The implication in the plaintiff's letter was that the informant's recollections might have been improperly influenced by the selective documents sent to them.
 On 14 September 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff. In the letter Mr Ducat said "it is the opinion of the Committee that you have been given all relevant documentation that has been considered by the Committee in the assessment of the complaint against you". It was pointed out that the plaintiff as a Councillor had the ability to access Council's records. The final paragraph of the letter read as follows:- "The Committee will meet on 28 September 2007 with an aim to finalise the report to the October Ordinary Council Meeting. Any statement or information you may wish to provide should be submitted to the Committee by 5pm on 25
September 2007".
 On 17 September 2007 a rough draft of a report by the Committee was distributed to members of the Committee by Mrs Stachiw. The document was only four pages long. The nature of the material to be inserted in a final report was indicated by entries such as "Committee's findings by Alex (Singh) and Kip (Mr Werren) "... "comment by Alex and Kip".
 On 28 September 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat asserting that his requests for documents and information had been ignored and that, accordingly, he was not able to provide any appropriate response to the letter of 14 September 2007.
 A draft of the report of the Committee was emailed to members of the
Committee on 28 September 2007.
 On 9 October 2007 a letter was sent by the Committee to the plaintiff, which was in the following terms:- "CODE OF CONDUCT COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION, RECOMMENDATION 40 OF THE
PROMOTING BETTER PRACTICE REVIEW - NERAM STAFFING 
The Code of Conduct Committee met on 28 September 2007 to make a finding and prepare a final report. The report will be presented to the Council meeting of 29 October 2007.
 
As per the Code of Conduct Committee Handbook Procedures (Clause 13 p 7), the report is attached to allow you an opportunity to comment before the report is finalised.
 
Any comments you wish to make should be forwarded to me prior to 5pm Friday October 2007." On 10 October 2007 an email was sent to the plaintiff reading:- "Please find attached a letter from the Code of Conduct Committee and the
Final Report to be presented to the October Council Meeting." In the heading to the email was the entry "Attachments: Draft Report Agency .doc; Letter to Cr Chetwynd 9-10-07-2.doc; Index documents 10-10-07.doc".
 There is no doubt that an index listing the working papers of the Committee was sent to the plaintiff. The index listed 56 documents together with minutes of meetings of the Advisory Committee and of the Council.
 On 18 October 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat. The opening paragraphs of the letter were in the following terms:- "Re: Your letter dated 9th October 2007 
I acknowledge receipt of your above dated letter. I note your advice that the Committee has made an adverse finding against me.
 
I further note that you are affording me the opportunity of making a comment (Clause 13 page 7 of the Handbook). I understand that the Committee will consider my comments, before the report is finalised.
 
Please be advised that I do wish to make some comments for your consideration. In this regard, I note that you have included as an attachment, an Index of all documents. I understand than in accordance with Clause 11 of the Handbook, that such documents will be referred to me as the person complained about. I note that a considerable number of documents on the Index have not been referred to me. I do acknowledge that previously, you have referred a number of documents to me, but many of those that have not been referred to me, are of crucial importance and include documents that I have previously requested, but not been supplied." Subsequently in the letter the plaintiff expressed the wish to go through the index documents and identify the documents not previously supplied to him and to request that he be supplied with those documents. He requested an extension of time in which to comment on the report. The concluding paragraph of the letter was in the following terms:- "In view of the fact that the finding of the Committee is "sufficiently serious" against me, I would appreciate if my request for an extension of time could be granted. I await your reply and thank you for your consideration." On 19 October 2007 Mr Ducat sent an email to the plaintiff. In this email
Mr Ducat said:- "It is the Code of Conduct Committee's ('the committee') understanding that all relevant documents that the Committee has relied upon in making its interim findings have already been given to you. However, in order to expedite the matter, the committee will again provide all the relevant documents that the committee has relied upon to you on 24 October 2007. For our records we request that you sign a check list of the documents upon receipt." In the email the time for the plaintiff to make comments was extended to 1
November 2007.
 On 24 October 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff confirming that the documents (with a single exception) would be made available to the plaintiff that day. The plaintiff was asked to submit any written comments by November 2007.
 The documents referred to in the index of documents were actually collected by the plaintiff on 25 October 2007, when he signed the index sheet as requested (the documents had in fact been made available to the plaintiff on October 2007).
 In a letter dated 30 October 2007 to Mr Ducat the plaintiff asserted that some of the documents had not previously been supplied to him and, having examined some of those documents not previously supplied to him, he requested further documents, which he would need time to examine. He requested an extension of time for making comments to 26 November 2007.
 On 1 November 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff listing eight documents which Mr Ducat said had not previously been provided to the plaintiff. Mr Ducat said that these documents "relate to information supplied on request by the Committee as part of the investigation process". In the letter the plaintiff was granted an extension of time to 9 November 2007, "after which the Committee will consider your submission".
 On 5 November 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat. In the letter he asserted that the extension of time granted was not sufficient - he had not previously been supplied with other documents "apart from those listed in Mr
Ducat's letter of 1 November 2007". In a paragraph of the letter the plaintiff complained that not all of the documents said in the letter of 4 September to have been attached to that letter were so attached. The plaintiff complained that he had not been provided with all documents and had thereby been denied natural justice. Having examined the documents supplied, the plaintiff observed that there were several errors in the list - "first the document no 17 does not even relate to the matter about me. Document no 15 is not complete, in that only pages 1 to 3 have been produced. There are two documents no 48. Document no 56 is badly copied and parts are unreadable".
 On 5 November 2007 the plaintiff wrote a long letter to the general manager requesting a long list of documents, described in fairly general terms. For example, the first class of documents was described as follows:- "All documents relating to any communications with respect to NERAM that
Council (yourself in particular) had with Forsyth's Accountants and in particular, Mr Bob Finch, between the 1st February 2005 and the 31st July
This includes: a) Correspondence b) Emails c) Records of telephone conversations d) Records of personal meetings e) Documents relating to financial records" On 5 November 2007 the plaintiff communicated with Mrs Stachiw, repeating the complaints he had made in his letter to Mr Ducat of 5 November 2007. On 6
November 2007 Mrs Stachiw sent an email to the plaintiff supplying copies of documents and further information. The plaintiff responded, saying "I have all of the documents now".
 On 7 November 2007 Mr Ducat sent an email to the plaintiff saying that the
Committee had agreed to extend the time for the plaintiff to make comments to November 2007 and that no further extension would be considered.
 On 13 November 2007 the plaintiff wrote a letter to Mr Ducat, which was in the following terms:- "Re: Code of Conduct Committee 
I refer to the above and advise that I have now had an opportunity to consider the documents provided to me. I advise, that I emphatically deny any and all of the alleged complaints and/or allegations made against me.
 
Considering the above, I advise the following: ) The substance of the alleged complaints and your adverse findings, appears to me to be firstly related to the dismissal of Dr. Lally and secondly that I have allegedly misled the Council. Apart from the fact that I deny these, I advise: a) The dismissal of Dr. Lally was not, as you appear to allege, by the Mayor , but in fact by a Resolution of Armidale Dumaresq Council dated 11th
July 2005, upon which I and the General Manager were delegated to act.
 b) The documents sent by Phillips Fox to me, were also copied to Mr. S. Burns,
General Manager, for Councillors to consider.
 ) It is my view, that the only issue appears to be derived from an alleged complaint by Cr Waters, that I either intentionally, or negligently misled the Council and the NERAM Advisory Committee and thereby apparently wasted public resources. In making reference to the above, Cr Waters only refers to two meetings, both on the 11th July 2005 (the NERAM Advisory
Committee and Council). I note that he provides no direct evidence of his allegations, but rather, appears to rely on purported recollections of what he thought may have happened, or what he does not, or cannot recall.
 ) I note that you have provided me with a large amount of documentation, perhaps relating in some way to the matters, upon which you have relied, in making your adverse findings. I do not, however, have any specific evidence of where it is alleged that I have misled the Council (or
Councillors), by not providing certain information, as alleged.
 ) My letter dated the 6 November 2007, requests a number of documents that are in my view relevant to my being able to answer the allegations. I also note that point 5 of my letter dated 28 June 2006, specifically requests minutes, notes, copies of tapes, agendas and attachments etc. relating to the meetings of the 11th July 2005.
 ) Quite apart from the previous requests, the documents have not been supplied. As a matter of urgency, I request the following: a) All minutes, tape recordings, minute notes, files, agendas, attachments and the like referring to the meeting of Council held on the 11th July 2005.
 b) All minutes, minute notes, files, agendas, attachments and the like relating to the meeting of the NERAM Advisory Committee held on the 11th July
This should also include the "processes outlined", as referred to in the Resolution.

This request is made to you as Mayor and I request you pass it on the
General Manager.
 ) The above information is in my view, vital in respect of the alleged complaint by Cr. Waters and to my defence of same. Without such information, I believe it would be unfair of the Committee to finalise its findings, without providing me the opportunity to consider the information and provide my comment.
 ) To allow me procedural fairness, I request that you grant me an extension of 14 days after providing the above information, in order that I may properly respond.
 ) I refer to my earlier correspondence to you, wherein I expressed my serious concerns about the composition of the Code of Conduct Committee. My opinions are based on the fact that two members of the Committee were actually present and took part in both meetings of the 11 July 2005 and would therefore be unable to take an independent view. I note that the Dept of Local Govt, views independence of these Committees as very important and has foreshadowed changes to have all Committees composed of independent persons.

I await your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter by return and your response to the above, as a matter of urgency." On 14 November 2007 Mr Ducat wrote a letter to the plaintiff replying to the plaintiff's letter of 13 November 2007. Mr Ducat's letter simply stated that "the Committee notes your concerns expressed in points 1-6 and 8 and has considered the issues raised and that "the Committee will not be granting any further extensions". In an email to the plaintiff Mr Ducat said that he had passed the plaintiff's request to the general manager and "he is hoping to have the requested material (that is available) to you early next week".
 On 19 November 2007 the general manager wrote a long letter to the plaintiff. In the letter the general manager gave details of what he said was his (limited) involvement in the events of 2005. The final paragraph of the letter was in the following terms:- "The Mayor provided a letter dated 13th November 2007 to me and as requested, within the attachments, are the minutes and agendas for the extra- ordinary meeting held on the 11th July 2005, as well as the NERAM Advisory
Committee meeting held on the same day. The meeting was not taped and there are no file or minute notes (only kept until the minutes have been confirmed), on the Trim system." On 20 November 2007 the plaintiff wrote to Mr Ducat saying that Mr Ducat's response to the plaintiff's letter of 13 November 2007 "appears to me to be denying me procedural fairness. I believe that documents I have requested are critical in this matter. Accordingly, I advise that I am seeking legal advice in respect of this matter".
 An agenda for the meeting of the Council to be held on 26 November 2007 was distributed. Item 8 in the agenda included "Code of Conduct complaint against Cr Chetwynd - Recommendation 40 of Department of Local Government
Better Practice Review 2006". The report of the Code of Conduct Committee was set out on pages 8-16 of the agenda. Pages 8-16 of the agenda are set out in a schedule to this judgment. According to an answer by the defendant to an interrogatory from the plaintiff the agenda was distributed to the following:-

Hard copy  On 23 November 2007 Mr Harvey sent an email to Mrs Stachiw saying:- "I have a clear recollection of the Mayor Cr Chetwynd addressing the meeting (of the Council on 11 July 2005) and saying I have legal advice that is so confidential that I cannot give it to you, you will have to trust me on this matter. At the time the statement and Council's acceptance of it surprised me and I mentioned this to other senior staff after the meeting as I have never before witnessed such behaviour at a Council meeting." On 26 November 2007 the plaintiff through his lawyers obtained an ex-parte injunction from the Supreme Court restraining the Council from considering the item in the agenda for the meeting to be held that night, being the Code of
Conduct Committee report into the allegations against the plaintiff. In compliance with the injunction, the Code of Conduct Committee report was not considered at the meeting of the Council held that night.
 On 29 November 2007 the Council gave undertakings to retrieve, and it took steps to retrieve, copies of the Code of Conduct Committee report which had been distributed. On 29 November 2007 the general manager directed that the
Code of Conduct Committee report be removed from the Council's website.
 Further documents were filed in the Supreme Court proceedings commenced by the plaintiff. On 29 February 2008 orders were made by consent but without admissions that the Code of Conduct Committee report be set aside, that the membership of any new Code of Conduct Committee should not include any person who was a material witness to any conduct the subject of allegations against the plaintiff, that the allegations referred by the Department of Local
Government and the allegations by Mr Waters be considered separately by a delegate appointed by the general manager of the Council and that, if the delegate determined that both sets of allegations should be referred to a Code of Conduct Committee, they should be referred to separate Code of Conduct
Committees.
 In March and April 2008 a report of the Code of Conduct Committee into an allegation against Councillor Roobol was dealt with "in private".
 Another Code of Conduct Committee was appointed to investigate the complaint that the plaintiff had acted in breach of the Council's Code of
Conduct at the meetings held on 11 July 2005. At the hearing of these proceedings this Code of Conduct Committee was often referred to as "the second Code of Conduct Committee". This Committee comprised persons who I was informed were officers of the Department of Local Government. The Committee received written statements and interviewed the plaintiff and the general manager.
 The second Code of Conduct Committee produced a report dated 21 August which became exhibit K at the hearing. The Committee's conclusion was that "the Committee does not find that Cr Chetwynd...acted in breach of the
Code of Conduct".
 Key paragraphs in the executive summary in the report of the second Code of Conduct Committee are:- "The Committee find that the legal advice dated 11 July 2005 (marked draft) provided by Phillips Fox Lawyers to Council was provided to Councillors during the meeting which occurred on 11 July 2005. This legal advice is important as it briefs those who read it with the financial implications of proceeding with the proposed dismissal of a staff member.
 ....

Once it is determined that the advice was made available to the meeting or even that it existed, the onus falls upon each and every Councillor to satisfy themselves as to the contents of the advice. Clauses 9.2 and 9.5 of the Code of Conduct make it clear that each Councillor had a right to read the legal advice and a personal responsibility to satisfy themselves as to any matter which related to their decision." The results of the second Code of Conduct Committee inquiry were reported extensively in the media in the Armidale area.

Code of Conduct The model Code of Conduct for Local Councils in New South Wales was adopted by the Council on 28 February 2005. The Code as amended, as it was in force from 26 June 2006, was part of an exhibit at the hearing. The provisions of clause 10 of the Code, which was the clause most frequently referred to at the hearing, were as follows:- "10 REPORTING BREACHES, COMPLAINT HANDLING PROCEDURES & SANCTIONS 
Corrupt conduct, maladministration and waste of public resources .1 You have an obligation to act honestly. You should report any instances of suspected corrupt conduct, maladministration and serious and substantial waste of public resources in accordance with council's internal reporting policy.
 .2 The Protected Disclosures Act 1994 provides certain protections against reprisals for council officials who report such matters. It is an offence to take detrimental action against people who make such reports.

Reporting breaches of the code of conduct .3 You should report suspected breaches of the code of conduct to the general manager, preferably in writing.
 .4 Where you believe that the general manager has failed to comply with this code, you should report the matter to the Mayor, preferably in writing, who will report the matter to the conduct committee.

Complaint handling procedures - staff conduct (excluding the general manager) .5 Where appropriate, the general manager will make enquiries, or cause enquiries to be made, into breaches of the code of conduct regarding members of staff of council and others engaged by the council and will determine the matter.
 .6 Where the general manager has determined not to enquire into the matter, the general manager will give the complainant the reason/s in writing.
 .7 Enquiries made into staff conduct which might give rise to disciplinary action must occur in accordance with the relevant local government award and make provision for procedural fairness including the right of an employee to be represented by their union.

Complaint handling procedures - councillor and general manager conduct .8 Council will establish a conduct committee that will consist of the
Mayor, the general manager and at least one person independent of council. The independent representative/s should comprise council's nominated legal adviser or other independent person/s of appropriate standing. In the instance of a complaint being made by or against the Mayor or the general manager, the
Deputy Mayor, or another councillor who has been designated by council, will take the place of the Mayor or general manager on the committee.
 .9 Councillors should report suspected breaches of the code of conduct to the general manager, preferably in writing, in the first instance and refrain from making allegations at council meetings. Where appropriate, the general manager will report the matter to the conduct committee.
 .10 Where the general manager has determined not to report the matter to the conduct committee, the general manager will give the complainant the reason/s in writing.
 .11 Council's conduct committee is responsible for making enquiries into allegations of breaches of the code of conduct by councillors and must either: * determine not to make enquiries into the allegation and give the reason/s in writing  * make enquiries into the alleged breach to determine the particular factual matters, or  * engage an independent person to make enquiries into the allegation to determine the particular factual matters.
 .12 Enquiries made by the general manager, an independent person or the conduct committee will follow the rules of procedural fairness. The enquirer must: * inform the person/s against whose interests a decision may be made of any allegations against them and the substance of any adverse comment in respect of them  * provide the person/s with a reasonable opportunity to put their case  * hear all parties to a matter and consider submissions  * make reasonable enquiries before making a recommendation  * ensure that no person is involved in enquiries in which they have a direct interest  * act fairly and without bias, and  * conduct the enquiries without undue delay.
 .13 Council's conduct committee must decide whether a matter reported to it discloses a prima facie breach of this code. The conduct committee will report its findings, and the reasons for these findings, in writing to the council, the complainant and the person subject of the complaint.
 .14 The conduct committee may recommend that council take any actions provided for in this code of conduct that the committee considers reasonable in the circumstances.

Sanctions .15 Where the council finds that a councillor has breached the code, it may decide by resolution to: * censure the councillor for misbehaviour in accordance with section 440G of the Act  * require the councillor to apologise to any person adversely affected by the breach  * counsel the councillor  * make public findings of inappropriate conduct  * refer the matter to an appropriate investigative body if the matter is serious (for example, the Department of Local Government, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the NSW Ombudsman or the NSW Police)  * prosecute for any breach of law.
 .16 Sanctions for staff depend on the severity, scale and importance of the breach and must be in accordance with any staff agreements, awards, industrial agreements and contracts." 
Clause 9.5 of the Code of Conduct, which was also referred to at the hearing, was in the following terms:- "Councillors have an obligation to properly examine and understand all the information provided to them relating to matters that they are dealing with to enable them to make a decision on the matter in accordance with council's charter." 
The meetings on 11 July 2005 What happened and particularly what was said at the meetings of the
Advisory Committee and the Council on 11 July 2005 is critical to the outcome of these proceedings. The two subjects on which the Code of Conduct Committee made adverse findings against the plaintiff in its report were the dismissal of Dr Lally and the conduct of the plaintiff at the meeting of the Advisory
Committee. The two subjects are closely connected. At the meeting of the
Advisory Committee the Committee resolved that Dr Lally's contract of employment be terminated and at the subsequent meeting of the Council the
Council resolved that the Committee's recommendation (that Dr Lally be dismissed) be endorsed.
 Of the meetings the meeting of the Advisory Committee was by far the more important. The meeting of the Committee lasted from 5:45 to 7:20, whereas the subsequent meeting of the Council lasted barely eight minutes. When I subsequently refer in this part of my judgment to "the meeting", I am referring to the meeting of the Advisory Committee.
 As I have already noted, neither of the two sets of minutes of the meeting of the Committee records in any detail what was said at the meeting and there is no other contemporaneous record of what was said. Evidence was given at the hearing by persons who were present at the meeting of their recollection of what was said at the meeting and it will be necessary to examine this evidence in some detail.
 Before conducting this examination, I will make some observations about the Phillip Fox letter of 11 July 2005. The letter was sent twice on 11 July and a substantially similar letter had been sent on 7 July 2005. I set out the terms of the letter of 11 July 2005 earlier in this judgment.
 I am conscious that for some purposes what is material is how the letter was understood by persons present at the meeting, rather than how a lawyer would construe it. Nevertheless, I consider that it would be sufficiently clear to any person, whether a lay person or a lawyer, reading the letter with some care, that in the letter Phillips Fox advised that, if Dr Lally had committed serious breaches within clause 11.2(c) of the employment agreement, then pursuant to clause 11.2(c) of the agreement NERAM could terminate the agreement; however, there is a heavy burden on any employer to justify summary dismissal of an employee; that Phillips Fox were concerned that the Council might not have sufficient evidence to justify summary dismissal; that Phillips
Fox were concerned that the matters about which the Council was complaining might not be sufficiently serious to justify summary dismissal; that, if the circumstances were so serious as to justify summary dismissal, the agreement should be terminated immediately; however, "at the very least" or as a matter of prudence, a letter should be sent to Dr Lally setting out the Council's concerns and giving Dr Lally an opportunity to respond; that, if NERAM terminated the agreement, Dr Lally might bring common law proceedings for breach of agreement claiming damages for the balance of the fixed term of her contract or make an unfair contracts claim under the Industrial Relations
Act; and that, if NERAM terminated the agreement, the best result would be a negotiated settlement.
 In the covering email Ms Healy said that she would shortly be sending to the plaintiff a draft letter to Dr Lally and later that day she sent a draft letter to the plaintiff, not summarily dismissing Dr Lally, but giving Dr
Lally an opportunity to respond to the complaints against her and warning her that, if she did not respond or her response was unsatisfactory, NERAM intended then to terminate the agreement.
 The Phillips Fox letter to the plaintiff did not advise that the Council had grounds for summarily dismissing Dr Lally and the letter did not set out "options" for the Council, in the sense of setting out alternative courses of action, none of which was clearly preferable.
 Oral evidence about the meeting on 11 July 2005 was given in the plaintiff's case by the plaintiff himself and Councillor Roobol and documentary evidence was given by Councillor Walford and the general manager
Mr Burns. Oral evidence about the meeting was given in the defendant's case by
Councillors Waters, Maher, Whan and Ducat and by members of the Council's staff and there was also documentary evidence.

The plaintiff's evidence 
Evidence in chief The following questions and answers occurred in the plaintiff's evidence in chief:- "Q. What did you say at that meeting about the letter from Phillips Fox, the legal advice and Dr Lally's contract? 
A. I gave a briefing to the council that I had spoken to the Advisory
Committee all 8 councillors, that I had spoken to Judith Healy a short time ago, that the advice that Judith Healy from Phillips Fox had provided in a letter dated the 11th which is attached was sent through to me earlier in the day and a copy was also sent through to Mr Burns for the councillors information.

Q. Then what else did you say? 
A. And I said that I wanted the councillors to read that letter or the attachments very carefully and to discuss the matter and any questions would be discussed in detail either by myself or by Mr Burns.
 .....

Q. What did you say? 
A. I asked the councillors to look at the advice, to go through the various options that were available.
 .....

I said there is a number of options Miss Healy has advised. She has laid out the issue of evidence. She has laid out the options of sending a letter of advice or she also said in her advice which I said was that the council - if the situation was so serious that the council could summarily dismiss Dr Lally and that her advice in all of that at the end of the letter was that it would be best, preferable, to settle that matter immediately or as soon as possible thereafter.

Q. Is there any particular part of the letter you relied on? 
A. Can I refer to the letter? 
Q. Yes of course you can? 
A. I certainly relied upon the paragraph on page 3 which says "Strictly speaking if circumstances are so serious as to justify summary dismissal the contract could be terminated immediately and there is no need to put the issue to Dr Lally by letter and seek his response", which I assume is actually "her"." Later in his evidence in chief the plaintiff said that the Phillips Fox letter provided "the alternatives", "the options".
 When shown Ms Healy's file note of the conversation of 11 July 2005, the plaintiff confirmed that the part of the file note reading "not really a case for summary dismissal" was correct. However, he said it "wasn't my understanding" that Ms Healy was advising against summary dismissal.
 The plaintiff said that "there was no other advice. There was only one piece of legal advice dated 11 July which is attached to the agenda and which was confirmed in my conversation with Judith Healy and her file notes at 4pm (semble 5pm) on 11 July. That's it. There is no other." The plaintiff said that Councillor Waters had asked questions at the meeting but denied that Councillor Waters had asked questions about the
Council's exposure if Dr Lally was dismissed and what was the lawyer's advice about possible claims by Dr Lally.
 The plaintiff said that Councillor Maher had indicated concern at the meeting about whether sufficient natural justice had been given to Dr Lally but denied that he had said that sufficient natural justice had been given to her.
 The plaintiff accepted that he had waved a piece of paper at the meeting.
The paper would have been the agenda and the legal advice.
 The plaintiff denied that he had misled the other councillors, denied that he had asserted that procedural fairness had been given to Dr Lally and denied that he had misrepresented to other councillors the legal advice that had been received.

Cross-examination  The plaintiff said that by early July 2005 "I was coming to the conclusion that there was no other option (but to get rid of Dr Lally)".
 The following questions and answers occurred in cross-examination:- "Q. She says you should write her a letter giving her a chance to respond to the allegations? 
A. But she didn't say you should not summarily dismiss her.
 .....
 
Q. Her advice was, you agree, as you understood it, not to summarily dismiss her but rather to write to her and get her response? 
A. No.
 .....
 
I agree exactly with what is in this letter here but she doesn't specifically state not to summarily dismiss her but certainly warns against it.
 .....
 
Q. She was advising you to give her notice and to get her response, wasn't she? 
A. Yes, that was the preferable course of action, yes." The plaintiff, after some prevarication, said that it was "quite probable" that he had said at the meeting "we won't have an organisation to manage, if we don't get rid of her".
 Later in the cross-examination the plaintiff made concessions about the
Phillips Fox letter. The following questions and answers occurred:- "Q. But we, Phillips Fox, think the evidence is not strong enough to justify-- 
A. Oh, that's quite clear.
 
Q. It is quite clear, isn't it? 
A. Sure.
 
Q. So you should not summarily dismiss, but rather you should put the concerns to Dr Lally in writing? 
A. That's right." The following question and answer occurred:- "Q. Are you saying in that letter she gave you two options, either to summarily dismiss or to not summarily dismiss? 
A. Yes, with a resolution." With regard to the telephone conversation with Ms Healy commencing at 5pm on 11 July 2005, the plaintiff said that Ms Healy's file note was accurate.
The plaintiff said that he himself had said "not really a case for summary dismissal" but later said "I don't believe anyone actually used those words".
The plaintiff accepted that Ms Healy by using the word "gutsy" was conveying that it would take some courage for the Council to adopt the course of summarily dismissing Dr Lally.
 The plaintiff confirmed that he had received the agenda with the attachments at about 5.40, as the other persons present at the meeting had.
 The plaintiff disputed that at the meeting he had argued very strongly "that Dr Lally needed to be dismissed".
 The following questions and answers occurred in the cross-examination:- "Q. Firstly that you said something like this "Written advice has been provided by Phillips Fox that Dr Lally should not be summarily dismissed but they have now told me on the phone that Dr Lally has had natural justice and that council is within our rights to terminate. Their latest advice today contradicts their previous written advice"? 
A. Definitely not.
 
Q. And did you say this or something like it "The verbal advice I have recently received from Phillips Fox contradicts the written advice provided.
The oral advice is that Dr Lally could be dismissed and could be dismissed legally however the solicitors are not prepared to put their subsequent verbal advice in writing"? 
A. Definitely not.
 
Q. Did you say something like "In addition to what I've just said I have legal advice that is so confidential that I cannot give it to you, you will have to trust me on this matter"? 
A. Definitely not.
 
Q. Did you say something like "The lawyers have now told me verbally that
Dr Lally can be summarily dismissed, I can't provide this advice to you in writing because it is confidential"? 
A. No.
 
Q. Did you say something like this "I have spoken with our solicitor at
Phillips Fox. They have advised that we have every ground for getting rid of
Dr Lally and that she will not challenge her dismissal"? 
A. Definitely not.
 
Q. Were you asked a question along these lines "In the event that she does make a claim what is council's exposure" and did you answer such a question along these lines "The advice from the solicitors is that she would not make a claim because of possible damage to reputation and secondly because she wouldn't win the case"? 
A. No.
 
Q. Was a question like this asked by someone at the meeting "What is council's legal position if Dr Lally is dismissed. Will the council be open to legal action if she is dismissed" and did you answer along these lines "There would be little chance of Janice Lally suing and if she did there would be little chance of her winning the case"? 
A. No.
 
Q. Were you asked questions to this effect "Do the lawyers believe that Dr
Lally has had sufficient natural justice" and did you answer "Yes"? 
A. I did not.
 
Q. Were you asked a question to that effect? 
A. I think there were some questions in relation to natural justice, yes.
 
Q. Were you asked a question to the effect "Do the lawyers believe that Dr
Lally has had sufficient natural justice"? 
A. No, I don't think I was asked that. I can't recall who was asked but it certainly wasn't a yes answer. It was discussed. The issue was discussed.
 
Q. I'll ask my question for the third time. Just answer this question. Were you asked a question like "Do the lawyers believe that Dr Lally has had sufficient natural justice"? 
A. I don't recall. I probably was asked that question.
 
Q. Did you answer to the effect "yes"? 
A. No, I did not answer that "yes".
 
Q. Were you asked a question to the effect of "Do the lawyers believe that
Dr Lally has had sufficient procedural fairness"? 
A. That's possible.
 
Q. Did you answer to the effect of "yes"? 
A. No." 
Councillor Roobol  Councillor Mrs Roobol was a member of a group of four councillors who frequently voted together at Council meetings. The other members of the group were the plaintiff, Councillor Walford and Councillor Beyersdorf. Councillor
Roobol was a member of the Advisory Committee.

Evidence in chief Mrs Roobol said that she had received the agenda with the attachments. She had read the Phillips Fox letter in the period of about 15 minutes before the meeting of the Committee commenced. She described the plaintiff's conduct at the meeting as follows:- "Very open. He started by going through the whole issue right from start to go because of councillors who were not members of the Advisory Committee, so he brought us all up to date. He asked if we'd - anybody had any questions, anybody wanted to contribute. It was completely open." 
Cross-examination The following questions and answers occurred in the cross-examination of
Mrs Roobol.
 "Q. Now it was quite clear that as far as the written letter is concerned,
Phillips Fox were saying the evidence is arguably not strong enough for summary dismissal so you shouldn't summarily dismiss, you should give her a letter inviting her to respond to the concerns, correct? 
A. Yes, I think that would be right.
 .....
 
A decision to dismiss her summarily was contrary to what was contained in the letter if you just consider the letter by itself, wasn't it? 
A. If you just discussed - yes, if you just think of that, yes.
 .....
 
Q. So something that was said at the meeting presumably persuaded you that, notwithstanding what was said in the letter, the written advice, the decision should be nevertheless to dismiss her summarily? 
A. Yes, part of.
 
Q. What was said at the meeting, I want to suggest to you, was that Mr
Chetwynd conveyed to the meeting that he had had verbal advice from Phillips
Fox that was a bit different from what's in the letter? 
A. No.
 .....
 
Q. Did he say that the written legal advice is that Dr Lally should be given a warning. "However, I have spoken to the lawyers since then and they have now said that Dr Lally could be summarily dismissed"? 
A. I can't remember that verbatim that you have said that.
 ..............
 
Q. You are being asked whether the plaintiff said words to this effect.
 
A. Was words to that effect, yep.
 .....
 
A. He was telling us there was additional information because he had had a phone call just before the meeting.
 
Q. And that the lawyers had changed their stance? 
A. He didn't say that.
 
Q. That they (the lawyers) were now saying that it would be okay to summarily dismiss Dr Lally? 
A. They were saying there could be grounds.
 
Q. Did Mr Chetwynd say to the meeting that the lawyers had told him on the phone that there were in fact sufficient grounds for dismissing Dr Lally summarily? 
A. As long as that's not verbatim, that there was changes, yep, that there was - there was issues that we could bring in, there was grounds.
 
Q. Did he say to the meeting words to the effect that the lawyers had told him on the phone that there were grounds for summarily dismissing Dr Lally ? 
A. There were grounds, yes.
 
Q. Did he say that? 
A. I guess so, yes.
 
Q. What is your best recollection, that he did? 
A. Yes, otherwise we wouldn't have been doing - going to do it." Mrs Roobol did not recall one way or the other whether the plaintiff had said "he couldn't provide this new advice from the phone call to the meeting in writing, because it was so confidential".

The following questions and answers occurred:- "Q. Was he asked during the meeting whether Dr Lally had been given procedural fairness? 
A. He was asked and the general manager was as well.
 .....
 
Q. And did he answer, "Yes, Dr Lally has been given procedural fairness"? 
A. Yes.

Q. And did he say that was also the view of the lawyers, i.e. that Dr
Lally had been given procedural fairness? 
A. Probably, I can't remember." Mrs Roobol said that the plaintiff was asked "something like" "what is
Council's legal position if Dr Lally is dismissed? Will the Council be open to legal action if she is dismissed?".
 Mrs Roobol could not remember whether the plaintiff had said "there would be little chance of Dr Lally suing and if she did there would be little chance of her winning the case".

The following questions and answers occurred:- "Q. Did he say anything to the effect at that time advice that he had received on the phone contradicted the previous written legal advice? 
A. No, he didn't say that.
 .....
 
Q. Was he waving a piece of paper around while talking to the meeting? 
A. When - yes, when talking to Councillor Maher.
 
Q. And what was he saying to Councillor Maher while waving the piece of paper around? 
A. Councillor Maher asked about the natural justice and Councillor - and he said, "It's in the legal advice here" and other words to that effect." .....
 
Q. And yet Mr Chetwynd told the meeting, you tell us, that Dr Lally had had procedural fairness? 
A. Yes.
 .....
 
Q. I'm just asking you the question about what Chetwynd said. He told the meeting, didn't he, that the lawyers had said to him that Lally had had procedural fairness? 
A. Yes." Mrs Roobol said that the plaintiff had done the bulk of the talking at the meeting. Mrs Roobol denied that the plaintiff had made it quite clear that his view was that Dr Lally should be dismissed. The plaintiff had given his opinion, after all the other members of the Committee had given theirs.

Councillor Walford A statement by Councillor Walford was admitted into evidence. No point was taken by counsel for the defendant that Councillor Walford did not give oral evidence. The Court was informed that she is elderly and in poor health.
 Councillor Walford's statement had been given by her to the second Code of
Conduct Committee. The statement was quite brief. In the statement Councillor
Walford said that there had been "a full frank open discussion" at the meeting. She had read the legal advice, had listened to the many questions and answers at the meeting and was happy with how the meeting had been conducted.
She said "I do not agree that there was any misleading information given, as the paperwork supported all that was said".

The general manager Mr Burns  Mr Burns did not given oral evidence at the hearing. I do not consider that I should draw a Jones versus Dunkel inference against either party, because
Mr Burns was not called as a witness for that party, particularly as there was documentary evidence from Mr Burns.
 There was admitted into evidence a letter written by Mr Burns to the first
Code of Conduct Committee and a transcript of notes of an interview of Mr
Burns by members of the second Code of Conduct Committee.
 In his letter of 13 April 2007 to the first Code of Conduct Committee Mr
Burns said in part:- "The former Mayor, Councillor Chetwynd was in frequent contact leading up to the dismissal with Ms Judith Healy at Phillips Fox Solicitors receiving advice with respect to dismissing Dr Lally. Councillor Chetwynd, during this period, came to me saying that he needed my support to dismiss Dr Lally. After advice was received from Judith Healy at Phillips Fox that Council as trustee had a slim chance in defending an unfair dismissal claim if she were to be dismissed, I stated to Councillor Chetwynd that the Trust should try to manage her out over time through her continued refusal to carry out instructions and build a case which would be more defensible. Councillor Chetwynd stated that if she did not go, the Museum would 'implode'.

When the matter was considered at Council the former Mayor and Trust Chair
Councillor Chetwynd did most of the talking to convince the other councillors to support the dismissal. When I was asked for my comment, I advised that I can only comment on what I had experienced and this was that Dr Lally had failed to comply with an instruction to cooperate with the business manager and had also failed to converse with the business manager prior to submitting the funding applications. While I held reservations about the dismissal, I was relying on the advice from the former Mayor Councillor Chetwynd that it was as bad as he was making out and subsequently she had to leave." When he was interviewed by the second Code of Conduct Committee on 11
August 2008 Mr Burns said that he was sure that at the meeting all the councillors had the Phillips Fox legal advice and that the plaintiff offered time to read the advice and councillors took that time. When asked whether the plaintiff had misled councillors about the legal advice Mr Burns said "not that I recall".

The defendant's witnesses 
Councillor Waters 
Evidence in chief Councillor Waters was a member of the Advisory Committee and attended the meeting on 11 July 2005.
 Councillor Waters asserted that he did not receive the agenda and did not have the Phillips Fox letter available to him at the meeting.
 Councillor Waters said that the plaintiff had spoken at length at the meeting. The plaintiff had spoken about Dr Lally's performance, that "there were a number of cheques found in a drawer, which were portrayed that they were there to conceal the true financial position. He told us about the conflict between Dr Lally and the business manager. The problems with staff meetings, with the staff, and the fact that Dr Lally had submitted grant applications, which were actually going to cost the gallery money. He'd done so without - she'd done so without getting the approval of the business manager. That was some of the things. There were other things." At the meeting the plaintiff had expressed "his view that we should dismiss Dr Lally".
 The plaintiff had said:- "He'd been on (the) phone a lot that day. In fact I think the words were "all that day" but it couldn't be all that day. A lot that day and that
Phillips Fox had advised him that we had every ground to dismiss Dr Lally and we should do so. He even used the words at one stage that the place would be in a mess if we didn't do so." The following questions and answers occurred in the examination in chief:- "Q. What is your recollection of what you asked him? 
A. I asked him two questions. One was what was our exposure in the event that Dr Lally lodged a claim because she had a contract.
 
Q. What did he answer? 
A. He answered that Phillips Fox's advice was that we had every reason to dismiss Dr Lally. I also asked him about what was our chances of defending a claim. And he answered that we would, that Phillips Fox's advice was that we would win on any one of a number of points that he talked about." Councillor Waters said that:- "...(Councillor) Maher asked him about whether Dr Lally had been afforded natural justice and procedural fairness and he answered yes." Councillor Waters gave evidence that "at one stage he (the plaintiff) was waiving bits of paper around but I have no idea what they were".
 Councillor Waters had himself moved the motion that Dr Lally be dismissed and the motion had been passed unanimously. Councillor Waters had believed the answers the plaintiff had given to questions.
 Councillor Waters said that he first saw the Phillips Fox letter some time later. Having seen the letter "It was very clear that we didn't have grounds to dismiss Dr Lally and she hadn't been granted procedural fairness because they suggested in there that we should write to her and give her an opportunity to respond." Councillor Waters offered an explanation for the delay in lodging his complaint against the plaintiff. He said that he had not really known what the position was, until the proceedings brought by Dr Lally had been settled. He then drew up a statement for submission to the Independent Commission against
Corruption, that he had discussed the statement with the Council's general manager and the Council's general manager had advised him that it was not a matter of corruption and Councillor Waters had then re-drafted his statement and submitted it as a Code of Conduct complaint.

Cross-examination  In cross-examination Councillor Waters was shown a copy of the Phillips
Fox letter of 11 July 2005. He denied having seen the letter at the meeting on July 2005 and disagreed that the central topic at the meeting had been the
Phillips Fox letter and the employment of Dr Lally. He could not remember when he had first seen the letter.
 Councillor Waters said that at the meeting he had been convinced by the plaintiff that Dr Lally should be dismissed. Councillor Waters said in evidence "I don't believe that Mr Chetwynd gave us the true story of what
Phillips Fox advised us".
 Councillor Waters had organised the obtaining of statements from a number of persons about what had happened. He was confused about whether the statements had been obtained for both Code of Conduct Commitees or only one.

Councillor Maher Councillor Maher was a member of the Advisory Committee and attended the meeting on 11 July 2005.

Evidence in chief Councillor Maher believed that the Phillips Fox letter and the draft letter to Dr Lally had been available at the meeting on 11 July 2005.
 At the meeting the plaintiff had been "arguing for the termination of Dr
Lally".
 Councillor Maher said that at the meeting the plaintiff had said "that he'd had a very busy day with communications backwards and forwards between himself and the solicitor at Phillips Fox whose name was Judith Healy".
Councillor Maher's evidence continued:- "He had already (at the meeting) recommended the termination of Dr Lally and I had still had my concerns, so I asked a couple of questions. Firstly, I asked the Mayor, did he believe that she had sufficient natural justice and secondly, did the lawyer believe she'd had sufficient natural justice and to both questions he said "Yes"." Councillor Maher said that when he had asked these questions the plaintiff had had a bit of paper in his hand and he was shaking it around and "I was under the impression that that was some advice that had come through by fax or whatever".
 Councillor Maher gave evidence that the plaintiff had said that "legal advice she (Ms Healy) had given him on the phone (was) that we could terminate her because she had been given natural justice".
 The following question and answer occurred in the evidence in chief:- "Q. How did you perceive what he said orally, given what you could read on the written letter? 
A. Well, I believe it contradicted the earlier advice, but he said things had been moving rapidly, he had several phone calls backwards and forwards and, you know, we were led to believe that the advice was that she should be terminated, or could be terminated." Councillor Maher concluded his evidence in chief by saying:- "I was the last councillor to come on board, if you like, to vote for a termination. As I said, there were two councillors away. I felt that
Councillor Chetwynd would have preferred to have a unanimous decision about this. Given the advice that I had received at that meeting, I thought well, you know, who am I to argue if she has been given natural justice and there are reasons to terminate, then I guess I'll have to vote in favour of it." 
Cross-examination Councillor Maher's evidence did not appear to me to be cut down or qualified in cross-examination.

Councillor Whan Councillor Whan was not a member of the Advisory Committee but he was present throughout the meeting of the Advisory Committee on 11 July 2005.

Evidence in chief Councillor Whan received at the meeting the agenda, the Phillips Fox letter and the draft letter to Dr Lally.
 At the meeting the plaintiff said "she has to go".
 Mr Whan read the Phillips Fox letter "to some extent" and understood that "it was saying that we should take caution, that we should in fact give Dr
Lally some time to answer the allegations and that she should be allowed to write back to the council in answer to those questions." The plaintiff said that "he had more recent verbal advice from the solicitors, that in fact contradicted what was in the written advice and that in fact we had every ground to dismiss her immediately and that is what he believed should happen." At the meeting "councillor Chetwynd left the mayor's chair and stood in the middle of the circle and walked around brandishing a piece of paper and in a very forthright manner saying what he believed should happen." Mr Whan gave further evidence as follows:- "He actually told us that he would give us a copy of the piece of paper at the beginning of the meeting but legal advice was that that piece of paper must be handed back in and that we could not keep it.
 .....

Yes we did see it for a period of time.
 .....

I can't remember exactly what was written on it but it certainly contradicted the written advice that was in our council papers and basically said that they believed that or somebody believed that it was quite legal for us to dismiss Dr Lally immediately and that there would be no consequences or very few consequences." Mr Whan himself did not ask any question at the meeting. However "councillor Maher in particular said "can we be assured Mr Mayor that procedural fairness is being followed with what we are proposing to do... He assured councillor Maher that procedural fairness was being followed." The following question and answer occurred in the evidence in chief:- "Q. When it came time to vote what were you influenced by? 
A. Very much so by counsel Chetwynd's assurances and the more recent verbal advice that he had apparently received." 
Cross-examination  In cross-examination Mr Whan confirmed that he had had the Phillips Fox letter at the meeting, that he had read it and that he had understood the gist of it.
 Mr Whan said that the paper the plaintiff had had was not the Phillips Fox letter, it was another piece of paper, a single sheet which was handed out but which the councillors were asked to give back and it "suggested that we did have grounds to sack" Dr Lally.
 At the meeting the plaintiff was "extremely forceful in his delivery and said that there were very good reasons for acting quickly".
 Mr Whan accepted that the statement "she's got to go" which he had attributed to the plaintiff was not included in the statement Mr Whan had made to the second Code of Conduct Committee.

Councillor Ducat Councillor Ducat was not a member of the Advisory Committee but he was present throughout the meeting of the Advisory Committee on 11 July 2005.

Evidence in chief The Phillips Fox letter was available to Councillor Ducat at the meeting.
He received it either shortly before the meeting commenced or at the meeting.
He thought that he had received the draft letter to Dr Lally at the same time as he received the Phillips Fox advice.
 There had been only one issue at the meeting, whether Dr Lally should be dismissed.
 Councillor Ducat said in his evidence:- "My recollection is that he (the plaintiff) spoke for most of the time of the Advisory Committee meeting which I think went for an hour or an hour and a half or so." At the meeting the plaintiff had put forward a definite point of view, which was that "irrespective of the advice we had, which was saying that Mrs
Lally should be given procedural fairness and time to reply, there was an urgency in relation to something being done with NERAM... he said that he had more current advice than the advice we had, that advice was wholly confidential, he wasn't able to give it to us".
 Councillor Ducat's understanding of the advice in the Phillips Fox letter of 11 July was "we should give her the opportunity to respond to the allegations or the comments that had been made about her standard of management, and not to proceed without doing that".
 Councillor Ducat said that "he had a piece of paper - now I'm not sure whether it was one piece or a few pieces, a piece of paper he was referring to as the advice that he had. I'm not sure whether that was his handwritten notes of the advice. It would have to be that, because I believe it was only telephone advice he had from his solicitor".
 Councillor Maher asked a question whether Dr Lally had been given procedural fairness and the plaintiff answered that she had.
 Councillor Ducat's recollection was "that Councillor Waters was worrying about council's liability of whether we were able to do this without putting council at risk of being involved in legal actions...and the plaintiff's answer was "that it was highly unlikely that there would be a claim from Dr
Lally...and that if there was, it would be unlikely that she would have any recourse on council".
 Councillor Ducat's understanding was that this answer was "part of the legal advice (the plaintiff) had through the day because it was very much contrary to what we had in writing in front of us".

Cross-examination  In cross-examination Councillor Ducat confirmed that the plaintiff had never actually given to the other councillors the document containing the advice which the plaintiff said was confidential.

Mr Hadfield In July 2005 Mr Hadfield was the manager administration for the Council.
 Mr Hadfield gave evidence that in the late afternoon of 11 July 2005 he had a conversation with the plaintiff. The plaintiff showed Mr Hadfield a letter he had received from the Council's solicitors. Mr Hadfield "briefly perused" the letter and said to the plaintiff that "the letter didn't show clearly that Council was on good firm ground to dismiss Janice Lally". The plaintiff answered "that this was not a problem because he had spoken to the solicitors and they had said in fact Council was on firm legal ground but they couldn't put it in writing".

Ms George In July 2005 Ms George was employed by the Council as executive assistant to the general manager. Her workplace was close to the general manager's office and also close to the Mayor's office. She was aware of the problems at
NERAM, which was "a big issue" for the Council.
 Ms George gave the following evidence about what happened before the meeting on 11 July commenced:- "He (the plaintiff) arrived in a bit of a rush. He came into my office which was a glass fronted office where my door met the general manager's door.
He came in. He stood in front of my desk. He said "I've been talking to
Phillips Fox. We can't do it".
 When Ms George became aware that Dr Lally's appointment had been terminated, she was "amazed", because the legal advice had been that it could not be done.

Mr Harvey In July 2005 Mr Harvey was the transport operations manager employed by the Council. He was asked by the general manager to attend the meetings on 11
July 2005 and he attended the meetings.
 Mr Harvey gave evidence that at the meeting of the Advisory Committee the plaintiff said that "he had legal advice that Dr Lally could be dismissed and words along the line that it was imperative to do so, the legal advice was confidential, so confidential that he could not present it to Council and that they would have to trust him on this matter".
 The plaintiff held up a document "which implied that there was written legal advice".
 At the meeting the plaintiff expressed the view that Dr Lally needed to be dismissed "very strong and forcefully".
 At the meeting a question was asked about whether compensation would be payable and the plaintiff said that the legal advice was that compensation would not be payable.

Cross-examination In cross-examination it was put to Mr Harvey that he was not at work on 11
July 2005 (this suggestion was rebutted by the production of Mr Harvey's diary) and that he did not attend the meetings (the minutes of the meetings do not record him as having been present). Mr Harvey rejected both of these suggestions.

The second Code of Conduct Committee  The second Code of Conduct Committee investigated the complaint by
Councillor Waters of 2 February 2007. However, the only finding made by the second Code of Conduct Committee was that the Phillips Fox letter of advice of July 2005 had been provided to the councillors attending the meeting and that the councillors could have, and should have, accessed the letter of advice. No finding was made by the Committee about the conduct of the plaintiff at the meeting, except that he had played a leading role at the meeting and that he was advocating the termination of Dr Lally's contract without further delay. The Committee expressly stated that it would be inappropriate for it to make a finding on whether the plaintiff had acted in breach of the Code of Conduct in the way he explained the Phillips Fox letter or Council's position. In any event, it was common ground at the hearing before me that I should make my own findings about what was said and done at the meeting.

Consideration I am in agreement with the second Code of Conduct Committee in that I am satisfied that copies of the Phillips Fox letter of 11 July 2005 were distributed to councillors at or shortly before the commencement of the meeting of the Advisory Committee. This conclusion is supported by the evidence of the plaintiff and Councillors Roobol, Maher, Whan and Ducat and the only evidence to the contrary is Councillor Waters' evidence, which I consider I should reject. I accept that, the Phillips Fox letter having been provided to councillors, councillors were under an obligation to properly examine and understand it (clause 9.5 of the Code of Conduct). Some time was allowed to councillors, even if only during the meeting, to read the letter.
 Another part of the evidence of a witness for the defendant which I consider I should reject is Councillor Whan's evidence that at the meeting a piece of paper containing legal advice was handed out by the plaintiff to the other councillors but required by the plaintiff to be returned to him. This evidence is not supported by the evidence of any of the other witnesses.
 I have, however, reached the conclusion that I should accept much of the other evidence of the defendant's witnesses about what they say the plaintiff did and said at the meeting and reject evidence by the plaintiff which is inconsistent with that evidence.
 By the time of the meeting the plaintiff strongly desired to dismiss Dr
Lally. The plaintiff's evidence that by early July he was merely coming to the conclusion that there was no other option but to get rid of Dr Lally understated his true state of mind. In cross-examination he made a concession that it was quite probable that he said to the meeting that there would be no organisation (NERAM) left, if Dr Lally was not got rid off. In his letter of April 2007 to the first Code of Conduct Committee the general manager said that the plaintiff had said to him that he needed the general manager's support "to dismiss Dr Lally".
 The plaintiff chaired the meeting; he was the person who, to the knowledge of the others present, had been in communication with Ms Healy; and he was the person who did most of the talking at the meeting. This finding is supported by much evidence, including the account given by the general manager in his letter of 13 April 2007.
 In addressing the meeting the plaintiff endeavoured to convince the other councillors that it was necessary to summarily dismiss Dr Lally. In reaching this conclusion I have taken into account evidence to the contrary, including the evidence of Councillor Roobol that the plaintiff's conduct at the meeting was "very open" and the evidence of Councillor Walford that there had been "full frank open discussion". However, this evidence is outweighed by the concessions made by Councillor Roobol in cross-examination, the evidence of the defendant's witnesses, the evidence of the general manager and the likelihood of the plaintiff's strong desire that Dr Lally be summarily dismissed affecting what he said at the meeting.
 The Phillips Fox letter of 11 July 2005 did not support Dr Lally being summarily dismissed. On the contrary, the letter advised against Dr Lally being summarily dismissed and, instead, advised that Dr Lally should be accorded procedural fairness by sending her a letter, which was drafted by the lawyers, giving Dr Lally an opportunity to reply to the complaints against her.
 The evidence of Ms Healy, Mr Hadfield and Ms George establishes that, before the meeting on 11 July 2005, the plaintiff appreciated that the letter of 11 July 2005 did not, by itself, support the summary dismissal of Dr Lally.
 There was not really any dispute at the hearing that at the meeting
Councillor Maher asked a question to the effect of whether Dr Lally had received procedural fairness. Councillor Maher was described by the plaintiff as being "reasonable". He was not a member of the group of councillors who, the plaintiff said, usually opposed him.
 That question having been asked by Councillor Maher, it is probable that something was said by the plaintiff to remove, or at least alleviate,
Councillor Maher's concern about whether procedural fairness had been granted.
What the plaintiff said was likely to have been that procedural fairness had been granted and/or that the Council's lawyers had advised that procedural fairness had already been granted to Dr Lally.
 It is inherently likely that someone at the meeting asked the plaintiff questions about the Council's legal liability, in the event of Dr Lally being summarily dismissed. Phillips Fox had advised in their letter that, if Dr
Lally was summarily dismissed, she might bring court proceedings.
 More generally, given the contents of the letter of 11 July 2005 and the understanding of the letter by Councillor Roobol, Councillor Maher,
Councillor Whan and Councillor Ducat, it would be difficult to explain how all of those councillors eventually voted in favour of the resolution summarily dismissing Dr Lally (at either or both of the meeting of the Advisory
Committee and the meeting of the Council), unless the plaintiff conveyed to the meeting that he had received further advice from the Council's solicitors which was more favourable than was the letter of 11 July 2005 to Dr Lally being summarily dismissed.
 On the plaintiff's own evidence at the present hearing, he misrepresented the advice given in the letter of 11 July 2005. It would have been a misrepresentation of the advice to assert that in the letter the solicitors were presenting "options" or "alternatives". The part of the letter on which the plaintiff placed most reliance, that is the part reading "strictly speaking if circumstances are so serious as to justify summary dismissal the contract should be terminated immediately..."did not express any opinion on whether circumstances were in fact so serious as to justify summary dismissal.
Elsewhere in the letter the solicitor expressed concern about whether summary dismissal was justified.
 I am satisfied that, in his desire to convince the other councillors that
Dr Lally should be summarily dismissed and conscious that the letter of 11
July did not support summary dismissal, the plaintiff seriously misrepresented the advice which had been received from the Council's lawyers by conveying that he had received more recent, oral advice in a telephone conversation he had had with Ms Healy, which went beyond the written advice and provided greater support for summarily dismissing Dr Lally but which had to remain confidential.
 A further reason for rejecting the plaintiff's evidence is the successful attack which was made at the hearing on the plaintiff's general credibility.
Counsel for the defendant identified a number of matters as to which he submitted, and I consider established, that the plaintiff's evidence was demonstrably untrue.
 Of particular importance was evidence of the plaintiff denying that he had received with the letter of 9 October 2007 and the email of 10 October 2007 a copy of the draft report said to have been attached to the letter and the email, which, although not identical with, was substantially similar to, the
Code of Conduct Committee's final report. This denial was important to the plaintiff's case on damages in the present proceedings, because it is part of the plaintiff's case on damages that the distribution of the final report by the Council on or about 23 November 2007 came as an unexpected shock to him, causing him considerable upset and distress.
 I am satisfied that there was attached to the letter and the email a copy of the final report in an advanced state of preparation. I base this finding on the terms of the plaintiff's letter of 18 October 2007 in reply to the letter of 9 October 2007, in which he refers to the Committee making adverse finding against him; refers to those findings being "sufficiently serious", which is clearly a reference to a part of the report and not, as the plaintiff asserted, a reference to parts of clause 11 of the Code of Conduct; and the absence of any complaint in the plaintiff's letter that the draft report had not been attached, whereas on other occasions the plaintiff had been quick to castigate the Council for not having sent him documents alleged to have been sent.
 An alternative assertion was made by the plaintiff that, although some draft of the report might have been attached to the letter and the email, it was not the advanced draft but an earlier draft of September 2007. The earlier draft was only a template with many parts remaining to be filled in and, had it been the document attached, it would surely have provoked comments by the plaintiff in his letter of 18 October 2007.
 Ultimately, evidence by Mrs Stachiw established beyond doubt that there had been attached to the letter and the email a copy of an advanced draft of the Committee's report.
 Apart from the findings I have already made, I am satisfied that:-
Councillor Waters asked questions to the effect of what was the Council's exposure if Dr Lally was dismissed and what was the Council's legal advice relating to any possible claim by Dr Lally and that the plaintiff answered to the effect that it was unlikely that Dr Lally would bring any claim and that, if she did, the Council would win.
Councillor Maher asked whether sufficient natural justice had been given to Dr Lally and whether the Council's lawyers considered that Dr Lally had been given sufficient natural justice and the plaintiff replied in the affirmative to both questions. The plaintiff waved a piece of paper, which he said confirmed the solicitor's advice that natural justice had been given.
The plaintiff made misleading statements about the advice which had been received by him from the Council's lawyers, representing that advice later than the letter had been received from the lawyers, which was confidential and which was more favourable to Dr Lally being summarily dismissed than was the letter of 11 July 2005.

Imputations In the amended statement of claim the plaintiff pleaded 15 imputations, as follows:- "(a) The Plaintiff had engaged in conduct that breached the Council's
Code of Conduct.
 
The Plaintiff contravened the local Government Act, Associated
Regulations and Council's relevant administrative requirements.
 
The Plaintiff engaged in conduct which was improper or unethical (page Committee's findings, page 15 Committee's findings).
 
The Plaintiff engaged in conduct which was an abuse of power or otherwise amounted to misconduct 
The Plaintiff engaged in conduct which compromised or involved discrimination, disadvantage or adverse treatment in relation to employment.
 
The Plaintiff made misleading statements which led to adverse treatment in relation to Dr Lally's employment 
The Plaintiff engaged in conduct which involved himself in unauthorised operational activities relating to Dr Lally's employment.
 
The Plaintiff engaged in conduct which was an abuse of power and improper or unethical.
 
The Plaintiff took irrelevant matters into consideration when advising
Councillors of the legal position in dismissing Dr Lally.
 
The Plaintiff failed to present all relevant facts to Councillors.

The Plaintiff failed to act in good faith.

The Plaintiff misrepresented the legal advice to Councillors.
 
The Plaintiff conducted himself disgracefully in respect of the dismissal of Dr Lally.

The Plaintiff denied Dr Lally procedural fairness.

The Plaintiff's conduct was so serious as to warrant the matter being referred to the Department of Local Government." Almost all of the imputations were taken directly from pages 15 and 16 of the agenda, adopting the language actually used in the agenda. It would seem that a number of the imputations did not differ in substance from other imputations. See Uniform Civil Procedure Rules Pt 14 r 14.30(3). However, no application was made to me to strike out any of the imputations.
 Counsel for the defendant accepted that all of the imputations pleaded were conveyed, apart from imputation (m), that is that the plaintiff conducted himself disgracefully in respect of the dismissal of Dr Lally, an imputation alleged to have been conveyed by the agenda as a whole. In my opinion, the agenda as a whole did convey that imputation.
 Counsel for the defendant accepted that all of the imputations were defamatory of the plaintiff, except for imputations (g), (i) and (j). In my opinion, all of these three imputations were likely to cause ordinary reasonable persons to think less of the plaintiff and were therefore defamatory.
 I will now proceed to consider the defendant's defences.

Defence of justification In its amended defence the defendant asserted that each of the imputations alleged by the plaintiff was substantially true ([Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/) [s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s25.html) I have already set out all of the imputations alleged by the plaintiff.
 The onus lies on the defendant to prove that each of the imputations was substantially true. If some of the imputations are statements of fact and some of the imputations are statements of opinion, a defendant under a plea of justification has to prove that the statements of fact are true and that the statements of opinion are correct: See Gatley on Libel and Slander (11th ed) at par 11.7 p 318 and the cases there cited.
 The defendant provided particulars of the defence of justification in the amended defence. These particulars were criticised by counsel for the plaintiff on the grounds that the defendant had not provided separate particulars of justification for each of the imputations. However, in a case where there were so many imputations and so many of the imputations overlapped with other imputations, it would have been impracticable to provide separate particulars for each imputation.
 The particulars of justification provided by the defendant, which applied to all of the imputations, can be briefly summarised as follows:- 
The appointment of the Council as the corporate trustee of NERAM 
The plaintiff's insistence that all communications between NERAM and the
Council be through him 
The Phillips Fox letter of 11 July 2005 
The telephone advice given by Ms Healy to the plaintiff 
The plaintiff's conversations with Mr Hadfield and Ms George 
The questions asked by Councillor Waters and Councillor Maher at the meeting on 11 July 2005 and the answers given by the plaintiff to those questions and the assertions made by the plaintiff at the meeting about having received legal advice different from the advice in the letter of 11 July 2005 
The resolution that Dr Lally be dismissed and the dismissal of Dr Lally 
The telephone conversation between the plaintiff and Ms Healy on 12 July and the letter of 12 July 2005 from Ms Healy to the plaintiff 
The complaints by Dunne, Baxter, Hall and Waters 
The letter of 20 December 2006 from the Department of Local Government 
The reference of the complaints to the Code of Conduct Committee 
The investigation by the Code of Conduct Committee and the report of the
Code of Conduct Committee On the basis of the findings of fact already made by me earlier in this judgment, I find that the defendant has established all of the particulars of justification.
 I further find that the defendant has established that all of the imputations were substantially true, even though some of the imputations are to be regarded as statements of opinion rather than statements of fact. There was some discussion at the hearing about whether, where an imputation contained an alternative (for example imputation (h)), it was sufficient for the defendant to prove the truth of one of the alternatives or whether it was necessary for the defendant to prove the truth of both of the alternatives. It is unnecessary for me to resolve this issue, because I am satisfied that, where an imputation contained alternatives, both the alternatives were true.
 My decision that the defence of justification has been established for all of the imputations is sufficient to dispose of the case. However, in accordance with the usual practice of trial judges, I will proceed to consider the rest of the defences raised by the defendant, on the assumption that the defence of justification has not succeeded.

Defence of absolute privilege  The defendant pleaded a defence of absolute privilege under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s27.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/). The part of [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s27.html) relied on by the defendant provides that matter is published on an occasion of absolute privilege if... "(d) the matter is published by a person or body in any circumstances specified in Schedule 1." The circumstances specified in clause 26 of Schedule 1 are "...matter that is published to or by a public official or public authority referred to in s (1)(b) or (c) of the Protected Disclosures Act 1994 of a disclosure made to the public official or public authority in relation to an allegation of corrupt conduct, maladministration or serious substantial waste of public money or Local Government money if the publication is for the purpose of investigating that allegation".
 A Local Government authority is a public authority referred to in s (1)(b) or <case>(c) of the Protected Disclosures Act (see <case> and <case> of the Protected Disclosures Act).
 Ultimately, this defence was not really pressed by counsel for the defendant. Apart from any other difficulties with the defence, the publication of the agenda by the Council was not for the purpose of investigating any allegation against the plaintiff. The investigation of the allegations against the plaintiff had already been carried out by the Code of Conduct Committee which was reporting the result of its investigation to the Council.
 I reject the defence under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s27.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/).

Defence of publication of public documents The defendant pleaded a defence of publication of a public document pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s28.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/). Section (1) of the Act provides that it is defence to the publication of defamatory matter, if the defendant proves that the matter was contained in a public document.
 The expression "public document" is defined in sub-s 4 of <case> so as to include a number of types of documents. The only part of sub-s 4 which was pleaded in the amended defence was par (d), which provides that "public document" includes, so far as is relevant, any document issued by a local government "for the information of the public". However, at the hearing counsel for the defendant also sought to rely on par (c), which includes any report or other document that under the law of any country is authorised to be published, and two parts of par (e), namely "any record or other document open to inspection by the public that is kept...(ii) by a statutory authority of an
Australian jurisdiction or...(iv) under legislation of an Australian jurisdiction".
 I was not referred by either counsel to any authority on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s28.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/).
 I do not consider that the agenda fell within par (d). It seems to me that par (d) requires that the purpose of informing the public be a principal purpose for the issuing of the document and such a requirement would not be satisfied in the present case, even though some copies of the agenda were sent to the media and to "members of the public", such as the Armidale library and the Customer Service Centre for public exhibition. Nor do I consider that the agenda published by the Council could be regarded as being, within par (e), a record or other document "open to inspection by the public" which was "kept" by the Council.
 As to par (c), counsel for the defendant sought to apply a line of argument which he had advanced earlier in his written submissions in relation to the defence of common law qualified privilege. Concisely stated, the argument was that by virtue of certain provisions of the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) and the
Local Government (General) Regulation the report of the Code of Conduct
Committee was required to be included in an agenda for a meeting of a Council, which would be available to the public at the Council's office and at the meeting, which would itself be open to the public. Particular reliance was placed on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s9.html) of the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/).
 However, even if all these steps in the argument are accepted, it does not seem to me that the report of the Code of Conduct Committee would be "authorised" to be published within par (c). In my opinion, par (c) is limited to some specific report or document or some specific class of reports or documents which are expressly authorised by the law to be published.
 I reject the defence under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s28.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/).

The defence of qualified privilege at common law It is a condition of qualified privilege at common law (leaving aside the extension of common law qualified privilege in Lange versus Australian
Broadcasting Corporation <case>; [(1997) 189 CLR 520] that the maker of the defamatory statement should have had a duty or interest to make the statement and the recipient of the statement should have had a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. See for example Adam versus Ward [[1917] AC 309] at 334 per Lord
Atkinson; Roberts versus Bass <case>; <case> 26 per
Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.
 In Bennette versus Cohen <case>
Ipp JA, with whom in this part of his judgment Campbell JA agreed, noted at <case>; <case>; [(1947) 47 SR 357] at 363, that in order for the defendants in that case to succeed on a defence of qualified privilege:- "[I]t was necessary that they should show by evidence that both the givers and receivers of the defamatory information had a special and reciprocal interest in its subject matter, of such a kind that it was desirable as a matter of public policy, in the general interest of the whole community of New
South Wales, that it should be made with impunity, notwithstanding that it was defamatory of a third party." In the present case it is necessary to distinguish between the four classes of persons to whom, according to an answer by the defendant to an interrogatory from the plaintiff, the agenda containing the report of the Code of Conduct Committee was distributed, namely "members of the public", "media", "councillors" and "Council staff".
 It was conceded by counsel for the plaintiff that the defence of qualified privilege should succeed in relation to the distribution of the agenda to members of the Council. It also appeared to be conceded, and I would in any event hold, that the defence of qualified privilege should succeed in relation to the distribution of the agenda to the members of the Council staff, all of whom held senior positions and had a sufficient interest in receiving information about the business proposed to be dealt with at a meeting of the
Council. What was disputed by counsel for the plaintiff was whether the defence of qualified privilege should succeed in relation to the distribution of the agenda to the members of the public to whom it was sent and the representatives of the media to whom it was sent.
 In support of his submission that publication to the members of the public and to the representatives of the media was protected by qualified privilege, counsel for the defendant propounded an elaborate argument, to which I have referred earlier in this judgment. On the basis of the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) including ss 9, 10, 10A, 371 and 440 and of the Local Government (General) Regulation, the Code of Conduct and the Code of Meeting Practice as adopted by the
Council, counsel submitted that the Code of Conduct Committee was under a duty to submit to the Council a report of its investigation into the complaints relating to the plaintiff, that the Council was under a duty to consider the
Committee's report, that the only way in which the Council could consider the report was at a meeting of the Council, that in order for there to be a meeting of the Council there had to be a notice of the meeting, that it was necessary that the notice of meeting of the Council contain an agenda of the business to be dealt with at the meeting, that if the business to be dealt with included consideration of a report it was necessary that the report be included in the agenda and that the agenda for a meeting of the Council had to be available to the public, both before and at the meeting.
 I would accept most of the steps in this argument, although I note <case>(2A) and [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s10a.html) of the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/). However, even if all the steps in the argument are accepted, I do not consider that the argument establishes the necessary reciprocity of duty or interest between the
Council and the members of the public or the representatives of the media to whom the agenda was distributed. On counsel for the defendant's argument, the sending by a council of an agenda containing defamatory matter to any member of the public or any representative of the media would be protected by qualified privilege.
 I do not consider that the sending of the agenda to the members of the public or the representatives of the media was protected by qualified privilege under any principle of ancillary privilege (Gatley 14.71) or any principle of its having been reasonable to take the risk of publication to persons not having a sufficient interest (Gatley at 14.73).
 I am, accordingly, of the opinion that the defence of qualified privilege at common law fails in relation to the distribution of the agenda to the members of the public and the representatives of the media. However, the defence succeeds in relation to the distribution of the agenda to the councillors and the members of Council staff. As explained in Gatley in footnote 436 on p 505 the publication between the Council and the councillors and the members of the Council staff remains privileged, notwithstanding the excessive publication to persons not having a sufficient interest.
 So far in this part of my judgment I have not considered the extension to qualified privilege at common law created by the High Court in Lange, whereby qualified privilege extends to a communication made to the public on a government or political matter, including discussion of government or politics at a local government level.
 The High Court in Lange held that a condition of this extended category of common law qualified privilege is that the defendant's conduct in publishing the defamatory matter should have been reasonable in all the circumstances. In discussing this condition the High Court referred to <case> of the New South Wales [Defamation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/), which was substantially similar to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s30.html) in the present New South Wales Act (statutory qualified privilege).
 It was common ground at the hearing before me that the condition of the extended category of common law qualified privilege in Lange is the same as the condition in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s30.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) that the conduct of the defendant in publishing the defamatory matter should have been reasonable in all the circumstances and in their submissions both counsel dealt with this condition almost entirely in relation to the defence of statutory qualified privilege. I will myself deal with it in my consideration of statutory qualified privilege.

The defence of statutory qualified privilege ([Defamation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) [s 30)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s30.html) [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s30.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) provides:- "(1) There is a defence of qualified privilege for the publication of defamatory matter to a person (the recipient) if the defendant proves that: the recipient has an interest or apparent interest in having information on some subject, and the matter is published to the recipient in the course of giving to the recipient information on that subject, and the conduct of the defendant in publishing that matter is reasonable in the circumstances." Section 30 (3) of the Act provides:- "(3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1) whether the conduct of the defendant in publishing matter about a person is reasonable in the circumstances, a court may take into account: the extent to which the matter published is of public interest, and the extent to which the matter published relates to the performance of the public functions or activities of the person, and the seriousness of any defamatory imputation carried by the matter published, and the extent to which the matter published distinguishes between suspicions, allegations and proven facts, and whether it was in the public interest in the circumstances for the matter published to be published expeditiously, and the nature of the business environment in which the defendant operates, and the sources of the information in the matter published and the integrity of those sources, and whether the matter published contained the substance of the person's side of the story and, if not, whether a reasonable attempt was made by the defendant to obtain and publish a response from the person, and any other steps taken to verify the information in the matter published, and any other circumstances that the court considers relevant." The defence of statutory qualified privilege is not subject to the requirement of reciprocity which applies to common law qualified privilege.
The statutory defence is subject to the requirement that the recipient of the publication have an interest or apparent interest in having information on a subject.
 It was submitted by counsel for the defendant that the statutory defence is available, as regards all recipients of the information, even if not all the recipients have the requisite interest, provided that the extent of the publication was reasonable. As authority for this submission counsel cited
Austin versus Mirror Newspapers Ltd [(1984) 2 NSWLR 383] at 390 per
Glass JA. However, Glass JA was relying on <case> of the 1974 [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/), which does not appear to have any equivalent in the present Act. Nevertheless, counsel for the plaintiff in his written submissions accepted that "this defence applies to widespread publication such as to the general public and/or the media".
 The submissions of both counsel were directed to whether, as required by s (1)(c), the conduct of the defendant in publishing the defamatory matter was reasonable in the circumstances. It is to be observed that the defendant who published the defamatory matter was the Council, which is the only defendant in the proceedings, and not the Code of Conduct Committee.
 Apart from referring to the factors listed in sub-s(3) of <case>, counsel referred to the judgment of Hunt AJA in Morgan versus John Fairfax & Sons
Limited [(1991) 23 NSWLR 374] at -388, a judgment on the corresponding requirement in <case>(c) of the 1974
Act at a time when there was no equivalent in the 1974 Act to <case> of the present Act, and to a part of the judgment of the High Court in Lange at p , where their Honours said:- "Whether the making of a publication was reasonable must depend upon all the circumstances of the case. But, as a general rule, a defendant's conduct in publishing material giving rise to a defamatory imputation will not be reasonable unless the defendant had reasonable grounds for believing that the imputation was true, took proper steps, so far as they were reasonably open, to verify the accuracy of the material and did not believe the imputation to be untrue. Furthermore, the defendant's conduct will not be reasonable unless the defendant has sought a response from the person defamed and published the response made (if any) except in cases where the seeking or publication of a response was not practicable or it was unnecessary to give the plaintiff an opportunity to respond." Counsel for the defendant submitted that a consideration of the various factors demonstrated that the conduct of the defendant in publishing the agenda was reasonable.
 The principal submissions made by counsel for the plaintiff in support of the general submission that it had not been established that the conduct of the defendant in publishing the agenda was reasonable, were that two members of the Code of Conduct Committee who prepared the report (Councillors Ducat and Whan) were politically hostile to the plaintiff and because they had been present at the meetings on 11 July 2005 should not have been members of the
Committee; that the report did not disclose these matters affecting
Councillors Ducat and Whan; that the defendant had denied the allegations against him but the report did not publish his denials; that the report contained a large number of adverse findings against the plaintiff; that the plaintiff may not have received the draft of the report said to have been attached to the letter of 9 October 2007 and the email of 10 October 2007 and that, in any event, there were substantial differences between that draft and the final report; and that the report, at the time it was published, was merely a report to the Council, which Council would have to consider and might reject.
 As to the factors in [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s30.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) I find that:- 
The matter published was of public interest 
The matter published related to the performance by a Mayor of a Council of his public functions 
The defamatory imputations in the matter published were serious 
The matter published did distinguish between allegations and facts which the Committee considered had been proved 
There was not a pressing need in the public interest for the matter to be published before it was considered by the Council 
This factor was not applicable 
The sources of the information in the matter published were the large number of persons who had supplied information to the Code of Conduct
Committee, the integrity of many of whom was not challenged 
I will defer this factor for separate consideration 
The Code of Conduct Committee had taken many steps over a number of months to verify the information which was contained in the matter published As to the factors identified in the passage in the judgment of Lange which I have quoted, I find that the members of the Code of Conduct Committee and the Council had reasonable grounds for believing that the imputations were true, had taken proper steps to verify the accuracy of the material and did not believe the imputations to be untrue. I will defer for separate consideration the remaining requirements in the passage from the joint judgment.
 A further factor relied on by counsel for the defendant, which I accept, is the restrained nature of the language in the report (confining the terminology used for adverse findings to the precise words of the Code of
Conduct). Although I have rejected, in part, the defence of qualified privilege at common law, I consider that the matters referred to by counsel for the defendant in his submissions about the requirements of the [Local
Government Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) and the Local Government (General) Regulation constitute a factor supporting the making of a finding that the conduct of the defendant in publishing the agenda was reasonable.
 As to the matters relied on by counsel for the plaintiff, I have found that the draft report said to have been attached to the letter of 9 October and the email of 10 October 2007 was in fact attached. Although there were some differences between that draft report and the final form of the report, the differences were not substantial.
 Messrs Ducat and Whan should not have been members of the Committee, because they had personal knowledge of what had happened at the meetings on 11
July 2005. On the other hand, there were two independent members of the
Committee Mr Werren and Mr Singh, who did most of the drafting of the
Committee's report. I accept and take into account that the report made a large number of adverse findings against the plaintiff, all of which were based on the same subject matter, and that the report was a report to the
Council which the Council would have to consider and might reject.
 Matters which were particularly the subject of controversy at the hearing were par (h) of <case> and the last sentence in the passage from the judgment of the Court in Lange.
 I find that the Code of Conduct Committee made a number of attempts, which were reasonable attempts, to obtain from the plaintiff a response setting out his "side of the story", for example in its letters of 6 June 2007 and 4
September 2007, but the plaintiff did not provide any such response.
Accordingly, it was not possible for the Code of Conduct Committee to include the substance of any version from the plaintiff in its report.
 It is true that on about three occasions the plaintiff wrote to Mr Ducat as chairman of the Committee, saying that he denied or rejected the allegations against him. On each occasion the denial or rejection was a bald statement by the plaintiff, unsupported or only slightly supported by any evidence or reasoning. In my opinion, the fact that the Code of Conduct
Committee did not include in its report a sentence to the effect that the plaintiff denied the allegations against him would not prevent the conduct of the Council in publishing the agenda being reasonable in the circumstances.
 Having considered all the factors, I have concluded that the conduct of the defendant in publishing the agenda was reasonable in the circumstances and that the defence of statutory qualified privilege has been made out.

The defence of fair comment at common law It was common ground at the hearing that the defence of fair comment at common law relates to imputations rather than to the defamatory publication generally. Both counsel made submissions about the conditions of a defence of fair comment. These conditions include:-
The imputation is an expression of opinion (a comment) and not a statement of fact. This depends on whether the ordinary, reasonable recipient of the publication would understand that an opinion was being offered, as distinct from a statement of fact being made. Channel Seven Adelaide versus Manock <case>; <case> 264 per
Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ.
The facts on the basis of which the comment is made must be expressly stated in the same publication as that in which the comment appears or, if not expressly stated, be clearly referred to or be notorious (Channel Seven
Adelaide versus Manock especially at [49] 272 and [72] 283-4).
The opinion and the facts on which it is based must not be so mixed up in the publication that a recipient could not distinguish between them.
Australian Defamation Law and Practice par (13015) at p 8554.
The facts on which the comment is based must be true: Australian
Defamation Law and Practice par (13055) at p 8567.
The comment must relate to a matter of public interest: Australian
Defamation Law and Practice par (13035) at p 8560.
The opinion must be one which an honest or fair-minded person might reasonably form on the facts: Channel Seven Adelaide versus Manock at [90] 290.
The opinion expressed must be genuinely held: Australian Defamation Law and Practice par (13075) at p 8575.
 In the present case the conditions of the defence to which most of the parties' submissions were directed were the first and second conditions I have stated, that is that an imputation should be an expression of opinion and not a statement of fact and that the facts on the basis of which the opinion was formed (or the comment made) should be expressly stated or clearly referred to.
 In a letter of 12 April 2010 the defendant's solicitors provided particulars of which parts of the Code of Conduct Committee's report the defendant alleged were statement of fact. In this letter the defendant's solicitors said that the following parts of the report were statements of fact.

All of pages 8 to 12 
On p 13 -- the first, second and third paragraphs (the first two paragraphs having bullet points) and the text of clause 5.1 of the Code of
Conduct.

On page 14 -- the text of clause 5.5 of the Code of Conduct and the first two paragraphs under the heading "Pt 3: Cr K. Waters complaint" 
On page 15 -- the text of clause 5.1 of the Code of Conduct, the text of clause 5.5 of the Code of Conduct and in the paragraph commencing "Cr Chetwynd misled councillors...", the second and fourth sentences.

On page 16 -- the text of clause 8.1 of the Code of Conduct and the paragraph commencing "The Committee also notes under <case>..." It was the defendant's case that all the other parts of the report were expressions of opinion. The other parts of the report are the Committee's findings on pp 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the report and the Committee's conclusion on p 16 of the report.
 Counsel for the defendant submitted that the Committee's findings and conclusion were expressions of opinion, that the facts on the basis of which the opinions had been expressed were sufficiently stated or referred to in the report, that the other conditions of the defence were satisfied and that the defence of fair comment was established.
 It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the findings stated in the report were not expressions of opinion but statements of fact and would be so regarded by the ordinary, reasonable reader and that, even if the findings were expressions of opinion, the facts on which the opinions were based were not sufficiently stated or referred to in the report. The facts stated in the report were insufficient to form a basis on which a fair-minded person might reasonably have formed the opinions.
 It is often difficult to determine whether an imputation is a statement of fact or an expression of opinion. As pointed out in Gatley at par 12.6 on p :- "A statement which might be regarded as one of fact but which is an inference from other facts stated or referred to may be a comment for the purposes of the defence. Though "comment" is often equated with "opinion" this is an over-simplification. More accurately it has been said that the sense of comment is "something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, remark, observation, etc"." At [35] 263-264 of the joint judgment in Channel Seven Adelaide versus Manock their Honours said in part, omitting some citation of authority:- "A "discussion or comment" is to be distinguished from "the statement of a fact". "It is not the mere form of words used that determines whether it is comment or not; a most explicit allegation of fact may be treated as comment if it would be understood by the readers or hearers, not as an independent imputation, but as an inference from other facts stated"... Cussen J described the primary meaning of "comment" as "something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark, observation, etc": Clarke versus Norton <case>; [[1910] VLR 494] at 499. It follows that a comment can be made by stating a value judgment, and can also be made by stating a fact if it is a deduction from other facts. Thus, in the words of Field J: O'Brien versus Marquis of
Salisbury [(1889) 6 TLR 133] at 137: ... [C]omment may sometimes consist in the statement of a fact, and may be held to be comment if the fact so stated appears to be a deduction or conclusion come to by the speaker from other facts stated or referred to by him, or in the common knowledge of the person speaking and those to whom the words are addressed and from which his conclusion may be reasonably inferred. If a statement in words of a fact stands by itself naked, without reference, either expressed or understood, to other antecedent or surrounding circumstances notorious to the speaker and to those to whom the words are addressed, there would be little, if any, room for the inference that it was understood otherwise than as a bare statement of fact. [Emphasis added.]." In my opinion, the findings and the conclusion stated in the report are not independent imputations standing alone but inferences, conclusions or judgments drawn from other facts and would be so understood by the ordinary reasonable reader and are, accordingly, "comments" for the purposes of the defence of fair comment. This conclusion is assisted by the use in the report of the words and expressions "finding", "the Committee was of the view", "it would seem", "the Committee determined", "the Committee found", "the
Committee's conclusion" and "the Committee's view". Where a finding involved the making by the Committee of a value judgment, for example the finding that the plaintiff's conduct was improper or unethical, the Committee's finding is even more clearly an expression of opinion.
 I have already referred to the defendant's solicitor's letter identifying which parts of the report the defendant asserted were statements of fact.
These parts of the report include the "factual scenario" on pages 10 to 13 of the report. The factual scenario included the following assertions of fact:- that the delegations conferred on the plaintiff did not extend to operational issues; that Ms Healy gave advice on the telephone to the plaintiff against summarily dismissing Dr Lally and that there was a prospect of having to pay out the full term of Dr Lally's contract, if she was summarily dismissed; that the plaintiff understood that there were not sufficient grounds to summarily dismiss Dr Lally; that the plaintiff received a letter from the Council's solicitors advising against summarily dismissing Dr Lally and advising that Dr
Lally should be accorded procedural fairness; that the plaintiff told a
Council staff member that, while the letter of advice might not have provided solid legal grounds for summarily dismissing Dr Lally, the plaintiff had received verbal, that is oral, advice that there were grounds for dismissing
Dr Lally but that the verbal advice could not be put in writing; that at the meeting on 11 July 2005 Councillor Waters asked what was Council's exposure to a claim, if Dr Lally was dismissed, and what was the legal advice about any possible claim by Dr Lally and the plaintiff answered that it was highly unlikely that Dr Lally would make a claim and, if she did, the Council would win; and that at the meeting on 11 July 2005 Councillor Maher asked whether sufficient natural justice had been given to Dr Lally and whether the
Council's solicitors considered that sufficient natural justice had been given to her and that the plaintiff answered "Yes" to both questions.
 In my opinion, the facts stated in the report provided a sufficient basis for the Committee to make the findings it did. In my opinion, it was not necessary for the Committee to set out in the report the contents of all of the documents considered by the Committee in the course of its investigation.
A list of the documents was set out in an attachment to the report and, accordingly, these documents were clearly referred to.
 I consider that all of the other conditions for a defence of fair comment are satisfied and I hold that the defence of fair comment is established in relation to those parts of the report which were comment, being the
Committee's findings on pages 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the report and the
Committee's conclusion on page 16 of the report.

Malice In his amended reply the plaintiff alleged that the defendant its servants and agents were actuated by malice in the publication of the matter complained of. Thirty-two particulars of alleged malice were provided. If malice is established by the plaintiff, it would defeat the defences of qualified privilege at common law, statutory qualified privilege and fair comment at common law.
 The onus is on a plaintiff to prove that the publication of the defamatory matter complained of was actuated by malice. In Roberts versus Bass, a case concerning qualified privilege, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at [75] :- "An occasion of qualified privilege must not be used for a purpose or motive foreign to the duty or interest that protects the making of the statement. A purpose or motive that is foreign to the occasion and actuates the making of the statement is called express malice. The term "express malice" is used in contrast to presumed or implied malice that at common law arises on proof of a false and defamatory statement. Proof of express malice destroys qualified privilege. Accordingly, for the purpose of that privilege, express malice ("malice") is any improper motive or purpose that induces the defendant to use the occasion of qualified privilege to defame the plaintiff." At [76] 31 their Honours said:- "But, leaving aside the special case of knowledge of falsity, mere proof of the defendant's ill-will, prejudice, bias, recklessness, lack of belief in truth or improper motive is not sufficient to establish malice. The evidence or the publication must also show some ground for concluding that the ill- will, lack of belief in the truth of the publication, recklessness, bias, prejudice or other motive existed on the privileged occasion and actuated the publication." I do not propose to traverse all of the numerous and somewhat repetitive particulars of alleged malice. I will refer to some only of them, which appear to me to include the particulars which were actually pressed.

It has not been established that the agenda was otherwise than the usual or normal type of agenda.

I accept that the report contained a large number of defamatory imputations.

I do not accept that the imputations were false or known to be false.

It has not been established that the agenda was published as part of a vendetta against the plaintiff.

I do not accept that the plaintiff was not accorded procedural fairness.
He was supplied with detailed information about the allegations against him and given numerous opportunities to respond.

I do not accept that the report was produced, published and distributed by a "Kabal" consisting of Messrs Burns, Ducat, Whan, Waters, Werren and Singh.

I accept that no apology was made to the plaintiff. I note, however, that the only actual finding in favour of the plaintiff which was made by the second Code of Conduct Committee was that the letter of 11 July 2005 had been provided to the councillors.

I have held that the defence of truth should succeed.

Councillor Waters in his evidence provided an explanation, which I accept, for the apparent delay in the making of his complaint.

The respects in which the Code of Conduct Committee failed to comply with the Code of Conduct were, in my opinion, minor. In his correspondence with
Councillor Ducat the plaintiff was assiduous in taking points that the
Committee was not complying with the Code.

The agenda was distributed only to the persons to whom Council agendas were usually distributed.

As the documents in exhibit 2 demonstrate, it was quite a common practice for reports of Code of Conduct Committees containing adverse findings against a councillor to be included in an agenda which was made public.

The position taken by the plaintiff about whether the report had been placed on the Internet fluctuated during the hearing.
 (aa) (bb) I accept that there was some ill-will between the plaintiff and some of the other councillors. However, ill-will is not sufficient by itself to constitute malice. It has not been established that Mr Burns was hostile to the plaintiff.

I accept that neither Councillor Ducat nor Councillor Whan should have been members of the Code of Conduct Committee, having themselves been present at the meetings on 11 July 2005. However, each gave evidence, which I accept, that he believed that he was obliged to be a member of the Committee. Other members of the Committee were Mr Werren and Mr Singh, who were lawyers and who were quite independent of any factions in the Council.

Generally, I consider that the communications between the Code of Conduct
Committee and the plaintiff and other persons over a period of several months in 2007, some of which I have summarised or referred to earlier in this judgment, show that the Committee approached its task of investigating the complaints in a patient, conscientious, diligent and fair manner. The
Committee was at pains to determine whether the allegations about the plaintiff were true.
 I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the publication by the Council of the agenda was actuated by malice. Because I am not satisfied that any individual was actuated by malice, I have not found it necessary to rule on a submission made by counsel for the plaintiff, that "the malice of one infects the others", a submission said to be based on Webb v Bloch <case>; [(1928) 41 CLR 331] and a submission which I would be inclined to reject.

Damages I have upheld in whole or in part a number of the defendant's defences.
Accordingly, there will be a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff has no entitlement to damages. Although I have decided that the plaintiff should not succeed, it would be in accordance with usual practice for me to assess what damages I consider the plaintiff should have recovered, had he been successful, in case I am subsequently held to have been wrong in holding that the plaintiff should not succeed.
 However, in the present case it appears to me that there would be serious practical difficulties in my attempting to make an assessment of damages.
These difficulties stem from the number of imputations, the number of defences, the impossibility of predicting on what imputations the plaintiff might succeed and the fact that many of the findings I have made are on matters which are relevant to both the determination of a defence or defences and the assessment of damages. In the circumstances, I propose to collect what appears to me to be the most important evidence relating to damages and to make findings about that evidence.
 An important matter in any assessment of damages would be the extent of the publication of the defamatory matter, that is the agenda.
 Earlier in this judgment I referred to an answer by the defendant to an interrogatory which showed that the agenda was distributed to six individuals and bodies described as "members of the public", eight individuals representing ABC Television or local newspapers, the members of the Council and ten members of the Council staff (including the Works Coordination
Centre). Almost all of the hard copies distributed to councillors and about a dozen of the hard copies distributed to other recipients were returned and shredded in 7 December 2007.
 In cross-examination the plaintiff conceded that, so far as he was aware, there had not been any publication in any newspaper or any broadcast on television or radio of the report of the Code of Conduct Committee. If there had been any such publication or broadcast, it is likely that the plaintiff would have become aware of it.
 The plaintiff said in his evidence in chief that the report had been published on the Internet at the Council's website, so that it could be read "anywhere in the world". The plaintiff said that the report had been on the
Internet for about ten days after the initial publication. Mrs Roobol said in her evidence that more than one person had told her that they had seen the report on the Internet.
 However, Mr McLachlan, an employee of an information technology firm, gave evidence that he had searched the database of documents that had been made available for public view on the website of the Council. Mr McLachlan gave evidence that his search disclosed that there had been two documents entitled "Agenda Ordinary Council Meeting 26/11/07" on the website, namely:- 
A document first uploaded on 21 November 2007 and removed on 29 November
At the time it was removed this document included in the index a reference to the Code of Conduct complaint against the plaintiff but did not include any part of the Code of Conduct Committee's report. Mr McLachlan was unable to say whether the document had ever been in any different form between November 2007 and 29 November 2007.
A document first uploaded on 29 November 2007 and still remaining on the website, which did not contain any reference to the complaint against the plaintiff in the index and did not include any part of the Code of Conduct
Committee report.
 The plaintiff's written submissions contained inconsistent submissions about whether the report had been published on the Internet. In one part of the submissions it was complained that the report had been published on the
Internet. In another part of the submissions it was submitted, on what I consider to be a quite inadequate evidentiary basis, that an employee of the
Council had been directed not to publish the report on the Internet and this showed that a similar direction could have been given not to publish the report in the copies of the agenda which were distributed.
 I accept, as was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff, that, in addition to the distribution of the report to the persons named in the answer to the interrogatory, there would have been a "grapevine" effect, especially in a small regional town like Armidale.
 Oral evidence about damages was given in the plaintiff's case by the plaintiff himself, his wife, Mrs Roobol and a witness Mrs Wolfer, who gave her evidence by telephone.
 Evidence that the plaintiff had suffered a loss of reputation was given by the plaintiff himself, his wife, Mrs Roobol and Mrs Wolfer. The plaintiff said in evidence:- "... I was well known in the area. A lot of people knew me either to speak to personally or who know from - in my activities in the council or simply know me from media reports and whereas those people would in the normal course of events said "Hello", or perhaps stop to have a conversation and it was extremely noticeable that as the ensuing time went on people would even cross the road to avoid to say 'hello', they would walk in a different direction in the supermarket alley or simply ignore me, and I recall a circumstance only very recently with a group of people that I know very well, were associated with NERAM, were out sitting at a next table in a restaurant to myself, my wife and two other people, and they completely ignored me, walked past me, with - I looked at them and they had disdainful looks on their face." The plaintiff gave further evidence that when he had gone shopping people would avoid him or walk in a different direction, that neighbours did not speak to him unless they had to, that he no longer received invitations, including invitations to Council's functions and that he had previously often been mentioned (favourably) in the media on many occasions as Mayor or as a participant in community activities. The plaintiff said that he had received telephone calls asking whether what had been written about him was true and that he had also received anonymous telephone calls, making threats or saying that he had got his just deserts or that he was a "troublemaker".
 The plaintiff attributed his defeat in the Council elections held in 2008 to the publication of the agenda.
 The plaintiff's wife gave evidence that persons had said to her "what's all this in Council? Your husband's a trouble maker".
 Mrs Roobol gave evidence about the plaintiff's previous reputation, as follows:- "His reputation was extremely good. He was known as a community member. He actually saved Armidale's iconic collection, the Hinton collection. He spoke, gave submissions for that and spoke there. He was known as an open-door mayor where community people could go to him and he would listen to whatever they had to say. He was very popular. He had high ratings." Mrs Roobol gave evidence about the plaintiff's reputation since November as follows:- "He lost a lot of credibility in the community because that was a devastating report that found him guilty. Many people commented on it. Many people made phone calls, a lot of gossip, because we are only a small regional city and they believed that if there was a formal report there and he was found guilty, that he would be guilty." Mrs Wolfer gave evidence that "the general consensus around town was that he was doing a great job as Mayor" but from the end of 2007 "the general feeling of the community is just a demise of him and his character".
 I accept that the plaintiff formerly had a high reputation and that he suffered a serious loss of reputation, that the serious loss of reputation was largely connected with the dismissal of Dr Lally and that the publication of the report with its many adverse findings contributed to the plaintiff's loss of reputation.
 However, I do not consider that all of the plaintiff's loss of reputation should be attributed to the publication of the agenda. I am satisfied that the plaintiff had already suffered some loss of reputation before the publication of the report. The summary dismissal of Dr Lally had aroused deep concern among members of the Armidale community (see the letters of complaint from Bob
Baxter and Jane Hall). The plaintiff was perceived as having in large measure been responsible for the dismissal of Dr Lally (see for example recommendation of the Department of Local Government Report). It is likely that the facts that Dr Lally had brought court proceedings against the Council for breach of contract, that the plaintiff had declined to make a statement for the purpose of the Council defending the proceedings and that the proceedings had been settled on terms favourable to Dr Lally became well known in the Armidale community.
 Evidence about injury to the plaintiff's feelings was given by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's wife.
 The plaintiff gave the following evidence about his reaction when he first read the Code of Conduct Committee report on or about 23 November 2007:- "I was absolutely devastated. I was very upset. All I could think about was all of the work I'd done over many years and that someone or some people could go to the extent of putting such lies forward and I just was shaking, and I thought about the effort and the time that I'd put into Local
Government, 5 years as mayor, the business I had in the community which I'd been there for 25 years. I had a good reputation and in one swoop it was killed, it was gone." The plaintiff confirmed early in his cross-examination that the publication of the report in November 2007 had been quite unexpected by him.
 The plaintiff gave further evidence that the Committee's findings in the report were "absolutely false", "just lies". He had asked the Committee to treat him fairly but "they ignored everything, they went ahead and they produced this document in the public arena". His denials had not been published and he had not been given any opportunity to provide a defence.
 The plaintiff gave evidence that he had suffered further upset because of the way in which the defendant had conducted itself since the publication of the agenda, in pleading and maintaining that the imputations were true and in declining to tender an apology after the termination of the equity proceedings and after the report of the second Code of Conduct Committee.
 The plaintiff's wife gave evidence that when the plaintiff read the report:- "He was absolutely horrified. He's really never been the same since. He couldn't believe that he'd been - that someone could write those things, and since then he just is a different person." The plaintiff's wife added:- "Physically he couldn't care less what he looked like. He's got broken teeth. He's got long hair. He couldn't care less." I accept that the plaintiff has suffered severe injury to his feelings.
However, as in the case of the claim for loss of reputation, I do not consider that all of the injury to the plaintiff's feelings should be attributed to the publication of the agenda.
 It is untrue that the findings by the Committee in its report were quite unexpected by the plaintiff. As referred to earlier in this judgment, I am satisfied that the plaintiff had, notwithstanding his denials, received a copy of a draft report in an advanced state of preparation containing the principal findings which were made against him in the final report, as an attachment to the letter of 9 October 2007 and the email of 10 October 2007. In these circumstances, I do not accept that the publication of the report on or about November 2007 had such a dramatic impact on the plaintiff as he claimed.
 I would reject, unconditionally, some of the matters said by the plaintiff to have increased the injury to his feelings. It is not true that the
Committee "ignored everything" or that the plaintiff was not given an opportunity to provide a defence.
 Some of the other matters said by the plaintiff to have increased the injury to his feelings depend on the imputations against him being false.

Conclusions I have held that all of the imputations pleaded were conveyed and were defamatory. I have upheld the defence of justification. I have upheld the defence of common law qualified privilege in relation only to the publication to councillors and members of the Council staff. I have upheld the defence of statutory qualified privilege. I have upheld the defence of fair comment in relation to the matters I have identified as being comment. I have rejected the defences under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s27.html) and [28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s28.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/). I have not as yet made any order for costs.

Schedule attached.
