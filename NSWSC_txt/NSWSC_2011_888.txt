EX TEMPORE Judgment  
HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Originating Process for an order under [s 447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)") which provides that the Court may make such order as it thinks appropriate about how this Part is to operate in relation to a particular company. The order will have the effect of extending the period for the holding of the adjourned second meeting of creditors in circumstances set out in the affidavit of the voluntary administrator, Mr Farnsworth. 
The order will have the effect that despite the operation of Reg 5.6.18(2) of the [Corporations Regulations 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/cr2001281/) (Cth) , [s 439B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439b.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) will operate as if the section provides that the meeting convened under [s 439A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and held on 20 June 2011 will be adjourned to a date not later than 22 November 2011. 
There is undoubtedly jurisdiction to make such an order given the wide operation of [s 447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) which enables the Court to make any order it thinks appropriate as to how [Pt 5.3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is to operate in relation to a particular company; see Re Porter and Another as Joint Administrators of Priceright Construction Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [[2006] NSWSC 324] per Barrett J. In that case his Honour made an order to the same effect as the one sought here. 
The basis for the present application is that on 20 June 2011 the creditors resolved to adjourn the second meeting to a date on or before 22 August 2011. There will be no utility in holding the meeting on or before that time because there is at present an insurance claim which is the subject of correspondence and which will not be resolved or the position of the parties will not be resolved before that date. It is accordingly appropriate that the order sought should be made. 
However, his Honour made an additional order, given that the application was brought ex parte, reserving leave to any person claiming to be interested to make an application to vary the substantive order upon 24 hours notice to the plaintiffs. As his Honour thought there, I think this is a sensible precaution and one which should, despite the fact that it is unlikely to be availed of, be taken in the present case. 
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Originating Process. 
In addition, any person claiming to be interested has leave upon 24 hours notice to the plaintiffs to apply to vary those orders. 
The orders are to be taken out forthwith. * * *
