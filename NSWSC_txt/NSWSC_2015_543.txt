JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
By Originating Process filed by leave on 2 March 2015, the Plaintiffs, Messrs Merryweather, England and Honner ("Administrators") in their capacity as joint and several administrators of Belmont Sportsmans Club Co-Operative Limited (administrators appointed) ("Club") apply to extend the convening period for a meeting of creditors of the Club under <case> and [s 447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth). They also seek an order, which is common in applications of this kind, that [Pt 5.3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) then be modified such that the second meeting of creditors may be held at any time on or before the date to which the convening period is extended or within five business days after that date. They also seek an order, again common in applications of this kind, that any director, creditor or contributory of the Club have liberty to apply on three days' notice to vary or amend the order extending time.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Mr William Honner, one of the Administrators, sworn 2 March 2015. Mr Honner sets out the background to the application, and the nature of the Club's activities, and I should refer to his evidence before turning to the applicable legal principles. The Administrators were appointed on 3 February 2015. Mr Mackay, who appears for the Administrators, has indicated from the bar table that that appointment took place in the context of a winding up application that had been brought by the Australian Taxation Office in respect of the Club in respect of an outstanding tax debt. The Club operates from premises at Belmont, New South Wales, near Lake Macquarie. It owns those premises, and there is evidence as to the facilities that are erected upon them, which include a clubhouse containing a gaming area with 67 gaming machines and other facilities. The Club has approximately 28 employees, as well as using external security staff and cleaners, and a bistro is currently operated by an external party. The Club has also received, and has in place, development approval from Lake Macquarie City Council for the construction of self-care senior residences on its site, and for the subdivision of that site, with one portion of the property being used for the proposed development and the remaining portion of the property being used by the Club.
Mr Honner's affidavit evidence is that there are a significant number of creditors known to the Administrators, which presumably include the Australian Taxation Office to which I have referred. Two parties are, or claim to be, secured creditors, the first being Perpetual Nominees Limited as trustee for Australian Unity High Yield Mortgage Trust which is a lender, secured by a registered mortgage, to the Club and the second of which is Stevens Constructions Pty Ltd which claims to be a secured creditor in respect of a development agreement entered into with the Club in February 2014. The Administrators note that there are approximately 105 creditors in addition to those two identified secured creditors. There is evidence that significant amounts are owed by the Club, both to the secured and the unsecured creditors.
The Club is presently obliged to convene its second meeting of creditors tomorrow, 3 March 2015, so that the second meeting of creditors would be held on or before 10 March 2015. The Administrators now seek an extension of the convening period for a period of 90 days to 1 June 2015. Mr Honner's affidavit, appropriately, sets out the work which has been undertaken by the Administrators since they were appointed which includes, relevantly, dialogue with the employees of the Club, who continue to be paid their wages; the appointment of a valuer to undertake a valuation of the Club's property and the Club; the continuance of a marketing and sales campaign for a possible amalgamation of the Club or the sale of its property and the Club, which had commenced prior to the Administrators' appointment; and the usual activities which would be undertaken in respect of an administration, including communication with secured creditors of the Club.
Mr Honner's evidence is that the Administrators require more time to form a view about the best recommendation to creditors with respect to the future of the Club, as it is not yet clear what sale strategy in respect of its assets, including the property, will provide the best return for creditors. They point out that, prior to their appointment, the Club had already been engaged in developing a proposal for an amalgamation with a potential partner under the provisions of the [Registered Clubs Act 1976](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1976173/) and had received two expressions of interest in respect of that process. The Club had already commenced the marketing of that part of the property on which the development is proposed in order to reduce its debt, and two parties have been identified as potential purchasers. The Administrators have progressed those activities since their appointment. They indicate that several parties have expressed interest, which is developed to a greater or lesser extent, in respect of a potential amalgamation or purchase of the Club's property, although it is not necessary to set out the detail of that interest in this judgment. They indicate they are also considering an appropriate sales strategy with respect to the poker machine entitlements held by the Club, although those entitlements would transfer to an amalgamated Club on an amalgamation.
The Administrators identify several reasons for seeking a further extension of the convening period for the 90 day period to which they have referred. First, they identify the desirability of that extension to allow the making of further offers, which they anticipate receiving in respect of an amalgamation or sale, and to allow a further opportunity for analysis of those offers, with the benefit of the valuation report which they expect to receive shortly. They note that further time would then be required to negotiate with parties in respect of the structure of any amalgamation or sale, including details such as whether a subdivision of the property is required, whether a sale of the Club as a going concern is proposed, or whether a deed of company arrangement would be required or proposed. I interpolate at that point that those possibilities indicate a degree of complexity involved in assessing the alternative courses, because the Club is a co-operative operating as a licensed club, which would not necessarily arise in respect of a company in administration, and other options may be available to deal with the Club's property which would not be available in respect of a company.
Mr Honner, appropriately, indicates that he has given consideration to parties that might be affected by such an extension. The first secured creditor, Australian Unity, has indicated that it does not object to a proposed extension of the convening period for up to 90 days. There is evidence that the second secured creditor, Stevens Constructions, has also indicated that it supports the proposed application in order to facilitate the best outcome for creditors. It does not seem to me that the extension is disadvantageous to employees, because they remain in employment and are continuing to be paid, although it defers or avoids the crystallisation of claims which might arise if the Club were to be wound up. That, from employees' perspective, may well be desirable, particularly if it affords them, or some of them, the opportunity for continued employment within any amalgamation of the Club with another club. The continuance of the administration will, of course, also continue the statutory moratorium in respect of creditors' claims. However, the proposed extension, although not short, is also not very long, and there would be a corresponding advantage to other creditors so far as the extension might maximise either the prospect of a successful amalgamation of the Club or the values achieved on realisation of its assets. The Administrators' evidence is that they have sufficient funding available to meet the Club's cashflow requirements during the period of the extension.
I turn now to the applicable legal principles. The first matter which should be noted is that the Club is not a company incorporated under the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). However, as Mr Mackay points out, the Co-Operatives National Law applies as part of the law of New South Wales, by reason of the [Co-Operatives (Adoption of National Law) Act 2012](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/conla2012373/) . The Co-Operatives National Law in turn provides that certain provisions of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) are applicable to co-operatives and, in particular, [Pt 5.3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) applies to co-operatives under <case> of the Co-Operatives National Law, and [s 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s15.html) of the Co-Operatives National Law provides for a relevant application under [Pt 5.3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a), as so applied, to be made to this Court. Accordingly, the provisions in [Pt 5.3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a), including those which initially provided for the Administrators' appointment, then for the convening of the first meeting and second meeting of creditors, and also for the Court's power to extend the time for such a meeting under [s 439A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), are also applicable to the club as a co-operative.
Mr Mackay draws attention to the well-established principles dealing with the circumstances in which a convening period should be extended. He points out, as Barrett J observed in Re Diamond Press Australia Pty Ltd <case> at <case> in a passage which has since been cited on many occasions, that the Court's function in an application of this kind is to strike a balance between the expectation of a speedy and summary administration and the requirement that undue speed not prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed to maximising the return to creditors and any return for constituents. Mr Mackay also points to the decision of Austin J in Re Riviera Group Pty Ltd (admins apptd)(recs and mgrs apptd) <case>; [(2009) 72 ACSR 352] I would add, in addition to the principles to which Mr Mackay has referred, that the authorities have emphasised that the Court will give considerable weight to the assessment reached by an administrator in respect of an application of this kind, since they are particularly well qualified to make an assessment as to whether creditors' interests, both in respect of the provision of accurate information at a second meeting of creditors, and in respect of maximising the value on a realisation of the company's assets, are likely to be facilitated by an extension of the convening period.
In the present case, as Mr Mackay points out, the extension of the convening period sought by the Administrators is necessary, in the strict sense, to allow them to obtain the further offers which they are anticipating and to undertake an assessment between those options, as to the various courses such as amalgamation or sale of property which may be available, and to negotiate with relevant parties and prepare relevant documents. Conversely, if an extension of time were not granted, the Administrators would now be required to call a second meeting, at a point at which they had not been able to explore all available options to maximise the value of the Club's property, and would not be in a position to adequately inform creditors of the options available to them at a second meeting.
For these reasons, and in circumstances that it does not seem to me that there is a significant risk of prejudice to third parties, I am satisfied that the extension of time sought by the Administrators is appropriately granted. Although the time sought is not short, I have noted above the complexity of the process which is involved, and it seems to me that the time sought is justified by the complexity of that process. As I have noted above, the Administrators seek the usual, and desirable, order permitting them to convene the second meeting of creditors earlier, if events develop such that they are in a position to do so, and also a provision which will allow any interested person, whose interests are, he or she perceives, adversely affected by this application to bring a further application to the Court. I should also add that the Administrators seek the usual order that their costs of the proceedings be paid as a cost in the administration of the Club. That order is properly made where, as in this case, the application is one that promotes the purposes of the administration and was properly brought by the Administrators on that basis.
For these reasons, I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order initialled by me and placed in the file. I note that these orders include an order that these orders be entered forthwith.
