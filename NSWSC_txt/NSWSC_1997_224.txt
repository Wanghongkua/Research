The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /97 - DOYLE versus PHILLIPS 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a summons brought by the proprietors of land at Copacabana for an injunction to prevent their neighbours from building on adjoining land a house, which is said to infringe the restrictions laid down in covenant contained in Transfer J645378. 
That transfer was made between North Coast Realty Pty Ltd as transferor and a
Miss Nott and a Mrs Plimsoll as transferees on 23 March 1964 and registered on July 1964. The covenant contained seven parts but the only relevant part is that the transferee covenanted: "(b) that no building shall be erected on the land hereby transferred or any part thereof until the design and location of such building or erection shall have been approved in writing by the Transferor its successors or assigns." 
For the purpose of <case> of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) the instrument said: "(i) the land to which the benefit of the above restrictions is appurtenant is the whole of the land in Deposited Plan No 26194 other than the land hereby transferred." 
This case has come on with some urgency and in order to deal with it expeditiously, I ordered by consent that two questions be decided as separate questions under Pt 31 of the Supreme Court Rules, namely: 
Is the covenant in Transfer J645378 affecting the defendants' land able to be enforced on the assumption that there is no common building scheme because as at the date of such transfer the transferor did not own all the land purported to be benefited? 
The question set out in para 2 of the notice of motion filed 23 May 1997.

So far as question (1) is concerned, the facts are undisputed that at the time when Transfer J645378 was executed the transferor was not the proprietor of all the land in Deposited Plan 26194. At least one lot, namely, lot 163, had been transferred from the vendor. The Deposited Plan, in fact, seems to contain over two hundred lots. The transferor, North Coast Realty Pty Ltd, has been dissolved.

The basic point put by Mr Wilson for the defendants is that one cannot take a covenant to benefit land which one does not own. It follows that if one states that one has a covenant benefiting land which is not in fact and in law benefited (because one did not own it), there has not been a clear indication of the land benefited as required by [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s88.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).

There is abundant authority for that proposition, which I will mention shortly.

A preliminary point, however, is one of construction of the covenant and that is whether the land that is to be benefited is: the whole of the land in DP 26194; or the whole of that land and each and every part thereof.

A variation on (b) is that it is not only each lot in DP 26194 which can enforce the covenant but is any partial lot into which any such lot may have been resubdivided. The plaintiffs are, in fact, the registered proprietors of only part of one of the original lots.

There is in this sort of case the Scylla of falling under the problem highlighted in Re Ballard's Conveyance [[1937] Ch 473] and the Charybdis of falling under the problem exposed in Zetland versus Driver [[1937] Ch ] at p
Ordinarily, one construes a covenant which is for the benefit of the whole of the land in a deposited plan as only being enforceable by the proprietors of the whole lot and not the proprietors of each and every part.
The problems of enforcement are great. Mr Wilson puts that in such a situation even the proprietors of the roads have to join in a suit to enforce. I do not believe any case has gone quite that far, but, certainly, the proprietors of the two hundred lots would have to join in as plaintiffs, which for practical purposes would be impossible, and even if they did, the mere fact that some part of the whole was touched and concerned by the covenant may not be sufficient to save it.

On the other hand, if one has a covenant to benefit the whole of the land in the deposited plan and each and every part of it, then if one has one of the lots which is a long way away from the burdened lot, there has been again a misstatement as to what is touched and concerned and benefited by the covenant. That dilemma is a very real problem in the instant case. It seems to me that this is a covenant which is only enforceable by the whole of the proprietors of all the lots.

However, passing by that problem, the next question is, in view of the fact that some of the land was not owned by the transferor, could the covenant be taken? In NSW Aged Pensioners Hostel and [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) [[1967] NSWR 332] at 333, LW Street J summarised the law as follows (omitting reference to authority): "It is stated in the transfer of the subject land that the benefit of this covenant is appurtenant to the whole of the land in the deposited plan. The authorities establish that the benefit of a covenant such as this cannot be regarded as apportionable amongst each of the subdivided lots...These cases are also authority for the proposition that the disposal by the transferor of lots of the total of 185 marked out on the deposited plan prior to the transfer of the land which is the subject of this application will render the covenant unenforceable within the first head of possible validity...that is to say, the covenant cannot be regarded as one which is valid for the reason that its benefit has been expressly annexed to the land to be benefited. The fact that the transferor had disposed of part of the land expressed to be benefited prior to the imposition of the restrictions upon the subject land will preclude this basis of validity from supporting the covenant." 
I cite this passage because Mr Thomson, who appears for the plaintiffs, strongly submitted that the well-known passage in Kerridge versus Foley (1964) WN [(Pt )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s1.html) 293 at 296-297, which says the same thing, was incorrect and should not be followed. With respect, Kerridge versus Foley is consistent with the authorities referred to in the passage I have quoted from the judgment of LW
Street J, and see also Re Barry [(1962) 79 WN 759.]
It is also consistent with English authority; see, for instance, Re Union of
London and Smith's Bank Ltd's Conveyance [[1933] Ch 611.] 
The Court of Appeal in Goodwin versus Papadopoulos [(1985) NSW Conv R -256] at p 56,417 endorses the views that were reached in
Kerridge versus Foley and other cases and those would be binding on me in any event.

Mr Thomson then puts that previous decisions have not taken into account the effect of [s
C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s36c.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). That subsection provides: "A person may take an immediate or other interest in land or other property, or the benefit of any condition, right of entry, covenant, or agreement over or respecting land or other property, although he may not be named as a party to the assurance or other instrument." 
Mr Thomson says that the proposition is simple and, that is, one applies the plain words of the section. Here one has a covenant. Here one has the person not named as a party in the instrument containing the covenant but a person who has an interest in the land as shown by their registered proprietorship.
Accordingly, the covenant should just be enforced on their plaint.

I cannot see, with great respect, how [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s36c.html) can assist the plaintiffs' case. There has been a considerable amount of authority as to the construction of the section, which has been in force in one form or another in England for the last one hundred and fifty years and in
New South Wales for the last sixty-five years. It is commonly accepted that the section cannot operate in favour of a person not in existence at the date of the instrument and that it does not permit a mere third party to enforce a contract made for his or her benefit. The intention of the section was to assist in the operation of technical conveyancing law and requires a covenant to be made with the people who are seeking to rely on it, even though they are not party to the deed. See for instance, Butt on Land Law, 3rd ed (LBC ) [1926].

In any event, the word "covenant" in [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s36c.html) really means a promise by deed in a lease or conveyance rather than a restrictive covenant which is enforceable in equity under the doctrine of
Tulk versus Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774; [41 ER 1143.] An interest under the doctrine of Tulk versus Moxhay is an interest in land because of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s7.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1925141/) .

The section was considered by Master Cohen, as his Honour then was, in Re
Caroline Chisholm Village Pty Ltd (1980) 1 BPR 9507 and at 9512 his Honour said that he should follow the principles governing the interpretation of the corresponding section in England, <case> of the [Law of Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lopa198/). The construction given to that section by the authorities is not that for which Mr
Thomson contends in the instant case.

The whole doctrine of restrictive covenants would be completely unnecessary if s 36C had the operation for which Mr Thomson contends. The doctrine of Tulk v Moxhay is that though the restriction imposed by the covenant does not apply at law, it is enforced in equity because it is against the conscience that a person should take the benefit of land knowing that his or her predecessor in title has made promises not to use the land in a particular way. If one could merely say that there was a deemed deed by the registered transfer with a promise that was enforceable at law by any successor in title because of <case>, there would be no need for the equitable doctrine of Tulk v Moxhay at all. It just belies belief that the Judges who have dealt with these sorts of problems over the last sixty-five years would have continued to enforce the doctrine of Tulk versus Moxhay if it had really become obsolete by the conveyancing amendment in 1930 which inserted <case> in the Act.

Mr Thomson strongly relied on Re Ecclesiastical Commissioners for
England's Conveyance [[1936] Ch 430.] That case does, I must confess, go a little way towards what Mr Thomson submits, though it is significant that the examples which are used at p 436 of the report are examples of covenants in leases, that is, covenants in the true sense of the word. Luxmoore J does seem to equate them with restrictive covenants in equity. However, that case does not persuade me that I should accede to the submissions as to <case>.

Accordingly, I must answer question 1, "No".

It is thus unnecessary to answer question 2. Because of time constraints, it was not fully argued on both sides. My present feeling is that the plaintiffs' arguments may well be correct, and if the parties wish me to determine question 2, I will reserve my decision.

I will dismiss the suit with costs, and I will publish my decision on question as soon as possible.
