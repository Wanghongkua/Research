COMMON LAW DIVISION 
PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE LIST 
Johnson J December 2009 /08 Todd Owen Dean versus Mark Phung 
JUDGMENT JOHNSON J: By Statement of Claim filed 18 December 2008, the Plaintiff, Todd Owen Dean, sues the Defendant, Mark Phung, a dental practitioner, for damages for professional negligence.  The Statement of Claim alleges that the Plaintiff suffered injuries to his teeth and jaw on 19 December 2001 when he was struck on the chin by a log in the course of his employment. It is alleged that the Plaintiff was referred to the Defendant for dental and related treatment and advice for the injury. On January 2002, the Plaintiff first attended the Defendant's dental surgery and, until July 2003, the Defendant provided treatment to the Plaintiff. It is alleged that the Defendant's treatment of the Plaintiff was negligent and that the Plaintiff has suffered injury and loss as a result of that negligence.
 On 11 March 2009, Hall J ordered that the issue of liability in these proceedings be tried at the same time as a related matter, Advanced Arbor
Services Pty Ltd versus Mark Phung (20006/08): Dean versus Phung  <case> On 25 March 2009, both matters came before me for hearing. This judgment should be read in conjunction with my judgment delivered today in Advanced
Arbor Services Pty Ltd versus Mark Phung <case> At the hearing on 26 March 2009, senior counsel for the Defendant stated that he had "instructions to consent to a judgment in respect of liability" in this case (T98). By leave, the Defendant filed in Court an Amended Defence dated 26 March 2009 in this matter (T111). The effect of those amendments was that the Defendant admitted liability for negligence, but with an outstanding issue under the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).
 In these circumstances, it was agreed by counsel for the Plaintiff and the
Defendant that this matter should be listed for directions when judgment was handed down in the related proceedings (T112; T123).
 Accordingly, I will list the proceedings for directions and for any application as to costs with respect to the hearing before me.
