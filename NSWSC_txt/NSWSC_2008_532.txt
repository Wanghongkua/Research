FRIDAY 30 MAY 2008  /08 GALES HOLDINGS [PT
LTD](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/index.html#p50td) v CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF STATE REVENUE 
JUDGMENT A notice of motion has been filed in this matter seeking two orders. First, that a notice to produce dated 14 April 2008 served by the defendant on the plaintiff be set aside and, secondly, that the action proceed by way of pleadings.
 The notice to produce is not to be called at this juncture and that limb of the notice of motion is not agitated before me today.
 The Plaintiff claims that the land in question was used for primary production and exempt from land tax under the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/), [s
AA(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s10aa.html) or [s
AA(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s10aa.html) A draft statement of claim has been handed to me. In par 3 there are assertions that the plaintiff did not use the land for primary production but the persons to whom it had granted an exclusive licence did. It was submitted that pleadings were appropriate to draw out whether or not the Defendant relied upon the activities of the Plaintiff or the activities of the licensees in denying the exemption. It was submitted that it was apparent from the documents identified in the notice to produce that the Defendant regarded the activities of the Plaintiff as being relevant.
 The practice in the Revenue List has been to rely upon facts sworn in affidavits and full written submissions that then elucidate the basis upon which relief is claimed.
 I do not see a reason to depart from that course in this case. It seems to me that the matter can be the subject of evidence adduced by affidavit on both sides augmented by the written submissions which I will order be delivered in due course. I therefore dismiss par 1 of the notice of motion.
