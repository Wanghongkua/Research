CATCHWORDS: Workers compensation - interest on awards - injuries received prior to commencement of amendments - effect of transitional provisions -s 19 [Compensation Court Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) - <case> [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) - WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act 1995 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED:RESERVED 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED:ALLOWED 
This appeal is from a decision of Burke CCJ in the Compensation Court, awarding interest to a worker in respect of awards for compensation under [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and 67 of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). The appellant argued that his Honour's discretion to award interest was restricted by the amendments made by the WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act 1995. The question for the Court was whether the effect of the transitional provisions was to provide that the limitations upon the award of interest, introduced by the amendments, applied to the ordering of interest on compensation for injuries received before the commencement of the amendments.

Held: 
Section 19 of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) continues to apply to proceedings which had commenced prior to the amendments becoming operative, but the effect of the transitional provisions is such that the restriction introduced by <case> [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), namely that interest must not be ordered on any compensation payable for any period before a claim for compensation was duly made, will be applicable in proceedings pending at the date of substitution of <case> for [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s19.html) 
Orders: 
Appeal allowed; 
Orders 4 and 5 made by Burke CCJ on 5 February 1996 be set aside; 
The proceedings be remitted to the Compensation Court to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons; 
The first respondent to pay the appellant's costs of the appeal and is to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1915 in respect of those costs.
 
JUDGMENT 
MAHONEY P: The basis of the present appeal is set forth in the judgment of Clarke JA. I shall not repeat what his Honour has said.

In order to understand the effect of the complicated provisions which the
Court must now construe, it is of assistance to have in mind the "mischief" with which the legislation was designed to deal or, more accurately, what the legislature saw to be that mischief. The award of interest upon judicial judgments is a comparatively recent phenomenon. The history of the provisions in this regard in the Supreme Court was referred to in Pheeney versus Doolan (No ) [(1977) 1 NSWLR 601] and in Marsland versus Andjelic (No 2) [(1993) 32 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20649 "View LawCiteRecord" ) .

The courts have, in general, tended to award interest from the date on which the plaintiff's cause of action or right to judgment accrued: at least, that has been the general principle which ordinarily has been applied. This has had the result that the interest component of individual judgments has often been substantial. It has been significantly higher than it was before the courts commenced to award interest in this way. It is to be inferred from the terms of the legislation that the legislature intended that, for the future, the power to award interest should be restricted.

Section 19 of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) gave that Court an unrestricted power to award interest. The new section 113 of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) envisaged that, in general, interest was not to be awarded, as far as is here relevant, "on any compensation payable under this Act for any period before a claim for the compensation was duly made ...": see <case>(b) of the [Workers
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), as amended by the Workcover Legislation Amendment Act 1995 Schedule 1 par 60.

The change effected by the enactment of <case> was effected by the substitution of <case> for <case> of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/).
Therefore it was necessary that the legislature indicate two things: what were to be the provisions governing the award of interest in respect of injuries received before the date on which the substitution took effect; and how far the change applied to proceedings pending at that date. Various provisions were made in this regard. The provisions which are immediately relevant for present purposes are paragraph [108] of Schedule 1 of the Workcover Act and paragraph [29] of Schedule 3 of that Act.

The legislation dealt first with injuries received before <case> was substituted for <case>. Stated in general terms, paragraph [108] provided that the limitations upon the award of interest (relevantly, the provision that interest could not be awarded on compensation for any period before a claim for the compensation was duly made) should not apply "to the ordering of interest on compensation for injuries received before the insertion of" <case>; but the paragraph provided that, in such cases, ie, cases of injuries received before commencement of <case>, "interest must not be ordered on any compensation payable under this Act for any period before a claim for the compensation was duly made or ...": see the part of the paragraph described as
Schedule 6 Pt 11 cl 1(a). The effect of this is, in general terms, that the restriction imposed by the new <case>, viz, that there shall be no interest on compensation for any period before a claim for the compensation has been duly made, should apply even in respect of injuries received before the commencement of <case>. The restriction upon the power to award interest was accordingly applied to such pre-section 113 injuries. (The restriction was applied only to interest on compensation "payable under this Act", ie, the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), as amended by the 1995 Act. I do not think that that affects the issues in question in this appeal).

Second, paragraph [29] of Schedule 3 provided that (as far as is here relevant) an amendment made to "this Act" (which must mean the [Workers
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)) by the Act "does not apply to proceedings in the court commenced before the commencement of the amendment ... but applies to proceedings commenced after the commencement of the amendment whenever the cause of action arose". Such amendment included the substitution of <case> for <case>. That provision therefore had the effect that the power under <case> to award interest without relevant restrictions continued to operate in respect of proceedings pending at the commencement of <case> but did not continue to operate in respect of proceedings commenced thereafter.

This leaves for determination the question whether the limitation imposed by paragraph [108] of Schedule 1 (that interest may not be ordered for any period before a claim for compensation was duly made) applies in respect of proceedings "commenced before the commencement of" <case>.

The only case in respect of which (as far as the present appeal is concerned) these two provisions possibly overlap is a case where the relevant injuries were "received before the insertion of" <case>: if the relevant injury was received after the insertion of that section, proceedings could be taken only after that date and so no problem can in practice arise.

Were there no express provision in that regard, it might have been thought that the combined effect of the two provisions was that the general rule established was that in respect of "injuries received before the insertion of" s 113, sub-par (a) applied to ensure that "interest must not be ordered on any compensation payable under" the [Workers Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) "for any period before a claim for the compensation was duly made ..."; but that by way of exception to that general principle, the general principle had no application to "proceedings in the court commenced before the commencement of the amendment ...". In other words, to proceedings which, before the commencement of <case>, had been commenced in respect of injuries received before that date, the restriction on the award of interest did not apply.

However, paragraph [108] made an express provision to the contrary. As I have indicated, paragraph (a) of that paragraph established the general principle that "... interest must not be ordered on any compensation payable under this
Act for any period before a claim for the compensation was duly made ...". But paragraph (b) of that paragraph provided: "(b) the provisions of paragraph (a) extend to proceedings pending at that commencement" [the commencement of the relevant part of the 1995 Act] "but do not affect any order for interest made before that commencement." 
Accordingly, the restriction imposed by the general principle in paragraph (a) was expressly applied to proceedings pending at the date of the substitution of <case> for <case>. Paragraph (b) operates to create an exception to paragraph [29].

I agree with the orders proposed by Clarke JA.
 
CLARKE JA: On 20 December 1995 the WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act ("the Amending Act") was passed. Its purpose was to amend a number of Acts of Parliament including the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) ("the [Compensation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)") and the [Compensation Court Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) ("the Court Act"). On the same day a Proclamation was published in Government Gazette No 155 proclaiming the commencement dates of sections of the Amending Act, being variously 20 December 1995, 1 January 1996 and 1 February 1996. Although there is an apparent peculiarity concerning the commencement dates of the presently relevant amendments to the Court Act the proclamation could not bear on the legislative intention and was not relied on in any substantive way by the parties.

This appeal, brought from a judgment by Burke CCJ given on 5 February 1996 in respect of proceedings initiated in 1994 or early 1995, concerns the awarding of interest to a worker in respect of whom his Honour made an award for compensation and awards for losses under <case> and <case> of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). His
Honour expressed the view that he had an unfettered discretion to award interest under <case> of the Court Act and made an order accordingly. The appellant employer has challenged that approach. It contends that his Honour's discretion was restricted by the amendments made by the Amending Act and that his Honour had erred in making his award of interest.

The point involved is a difficult one as is evidenced by the fact that some of the judges of the Compensation Court have divided on the issue. The reason why the question is difficult is that there is an apparent inconsistency between two of the provisions of the amending Act. That inconsistency is, I think, more apparent than real as I shall seek to explain. Before embarking on that explanation I should observe that much of the difficulty in this case arises from the transfer of the source of the Compensation Court's power to award interest on compensation awarded to a worker from the Court Act to the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) and the manner of expression of the limitations on the Compensation Court's power to award that interest in a transitional provision amending the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/).

The problems thrown up by the amending mechanism adopted have led me to reflect on the clearest way of explaining why I have concluded that the relevant provisions should be seen to be complementary rather than inconsistent. In the end I have decided that I can best achieve my object by dealing first with the Court Act and the relevant amendments to it.

The power of the Compensation Court to award interest was, prior to 1996, to be found in <case> of the Court Act which, relevantly, read: "19(1) In any proceedings in the Court, the Court may order that there shall be included, in any sum to be paid, interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the sum for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date when the sum is payable.
 ...

This section does not: authorise the giving of interest upon interest; or apply in relation to any debt upon which interest is payable as of right whether by virtue of any agreement or otherwise." 
Amendments to the Court Act were set out in Schedule 3 to the Amending Act. By cl 5 of that schedule it was provided that <case> be omitted from the Court Act.
That amendment removed from the Court Act the only provision empowering the grant of the relevant interest. But there was also a transitional provision dealing with pending proceedings. It was cl 29 which added a transitional clause to the Court Act, being Schedule 4, Pt 4, para 7 which, relevantly, read "(1) An amendment made to this Act by the WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act ("the 1995 Act") does not apply to proceedings in the Court commenced before the commencement of the amendment (except as provided by subclause (2)) but applies to proceedings commenced after the commencement of the amendment whenever the cause of action arose." (subclause (2) is irrelevant for present purposes) 
It follows, prima facie, that the repeal of <case> of the Court Act did not apply to proceedings which had been commenced before it came into force and hence did not apply to the proceedings the subject of this appeal.

Mr Maconachie QC, senior counsel for the appellant, submitted, however, that cl 29 was a general provision which had to give way to special provisions of the Amending Act with the consequence that <case> should be regarded as a spent force in respect of proceedings pending but not determined when the provisions of Schedules 1 and 3 of the Amending Act came into force.

It is necessary, therefore, to turn to cll 60 and 108 of Schedule 1 (which amended the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)) which are the provisions relied on by Mr Maconachie. The former introduced a new section into the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). This was the section which, effectively, replaced <case> of the Court Act and it empowered the Compensation Court to award interest before making an order for payment of compensation. In this section sub-ss (1) and (3) are, with one important exception, in substantially the same terms as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s19.html) of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). The difference lies in the concluding words of <case>, "subject to the limitations imposed by the section". There then appear very significant limitations in sub-s (2).

It is unnecessary to consider these limitations for it is common ground they are irrelevant for the purposes of the present appeal. The reason why the parties have agreed on this point is to be found in cl 108 which introduced a new [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p11) into Schedule 6 of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) in which there are set out a great many transitional provisions. Clause 1 of this Part is the critical provision in this appeal and reads: "1 Interest before order for payment 
Section 113(2) (as inserted by the WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act 1995) does not apply to the ordering of interest on compensation for injuries received before the insertion of that provision, but the following provisions do apply to the ordering of that interest: interest must not be ordered on any compensation payable under this Act for any period before a claim for the compensation was duly made or (where no such claim was duly made before the commencement of the proceedings in the
Court) for any period before the worker gave the employer particulars (including, in the case of a claim for compensation under section 66, a supporting medical report) sufficient to enable the employer to ascertain the nature and amount of compensation claimed, the provisions of paragraph (a) extend to proceedings pending at that commencement but do not affect any order for interest made before that commencement." 
There are a number of important observations to be made about this provision: 
There is no mention made of <case> in Schedule 6, Part 11, cl 1. Nor is there any other provision providing that that section should, or should not, be applied in respect of proceedings which had been commenced before, but not concluded by, the date on which it came into force.

That is not surprising for, by virtue of the transitional clause of the Court
Act to which I have referred, <case> continues to apply to those proceedings.

It deals specifically with the ordering of interest on compensation for injuries received before <case> of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) became law. In sub-clause (a) no distinction is drawn between pending proceedings and those commenced after [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p11) became law. It follows that the provision would, in the absence of any other provision modifying its operation, cover all cases in which interest was sought on compensation to be awarded in respect of pre-Act injuries whether proceedings had been commenced at the time it became law or not.

It provides, again expressly, that where a court is awarding interest on compensation in respect of pre-Act injuries the provisions appearing in clauses (a) and (b) apply. The consequence of the application of sub-clause is that the court must not order interest in respect of the period identified in that sub-clause.

By sub-clause (b) it provides that sub-clause (a) applies to proceedings pending at that commencement. The use of the phrase, `that commencement', is, in the light of the earlier parts of paragraph 1, somewhat odd but it is clear enough that it is referring to the date at which <case> becomes operative.
Accordingly, sub-paragraph (a) should be understood to apply to proceedings pending on 1 January 1996.

The result is, as it seems to me, that what clause 1 is saying is that, while s 113(2) does not apply to the ordering of interest on compensation for injuries received before <case> became law, the provisions of Schedule 6, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p11), clause 1 of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) do apply to the ordering of that interest. There is no mention in that clause of s (1) of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) nor of s of the Court Act. In other words, there is no reference to the source of the power to award interest but wherever the power is exercised in respect of the identified compensation (i.e. for pre-Act injuries) the clause states that the limitations in sub-clause (a) apply. In addition sub-clause (b) makes it clear that that is so whether proceedings had, or had not, been commenced when the operative amendments became law.

Consequently cl 108 of Schedule 1 and cl 29 of Schedule 3 of the Amending Act can be reconciled in this way - <case> of the Court Act continues to apply to proceedings which had been commenced prior to the operative amendments coming into force but, insofar as any such proceedings must necessarily involve claims for compensation for injuries received prior to the new provisions becoming law, the court in considering the award of interest on compensation in respect of those injuries is bound to observe and apply the instruction in cl 1(a) of Part 11 of Schedule 6 of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). In effect the latter provision modifies the continued operation of <case> of the Court
Act.

As clause 1 applies both to proceedings pending at the time <case> was inserted into the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) and proceedings instituted after it was so inserted it is not surprising that there is no mention in it of <case> of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) or <case> of the Court Act. Its provisions apply both in circumstances where <case> of the
Court Act applies (pending proceedings) and in circumstances where <case> of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) applies (new proceedings) and it would have unduly complicated the clause to include a reference to both these provisions.

The alternative approach advocated by the appellant, which is based on the proposition that the relevant transitional provision in the Court Act is in some way denied application in respect of claims of interest, cannot, in my view, be accepted. There are many reasons which lead me to that conclusion, including the specific exception in cl 2 of Schedule 4, Part 4, but the primary one is that the clause is expressed in terms which clearly do apply to the amendment to the Court Act which effectively repeals <case>.

On the other hand the respondent's approach that section 19 of the Court Act continues to operate in respect of pending proceedings without any fetters, is, in my view, similarly not acceptable. There are two main reasons which persuade me to that conclusion. One, that if it were correct the unfettered power under <case> of the Court Act and the more limited power referred to in the transitional provision in the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) would both be available to a court. Insofar as this would render the limited power otiose for all practical purposes it is hardly to be thought that the legislature intended that this be the position. Two, the transitional provision to the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (schedule , [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p11), cl 1) does not mention the power in <case> but applies the limitation in sub-clause (a) to all orders for the payment of interest where the injury in respect of which compensation is being ordered occurred before 1 January 1996.

I appreciate that this conclusion may be thought to run counter to the law relating to accrued rights, which is most clearly articulated in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), but that consideration provides no reason to deny the words used their clear meaning, particularly as the conclusion I have expressed results from the application of the only approach which reconciles the relevant provisions. I should add that, although the Court was not referred to other provisions of the Amending
Act which may bear on the interpretation problems with which I have been dealing, my approach is consistent with the scheme of the legislation, insofar as it relates to interest, to the extent that the amendment to [s
M](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151m.html) of the [Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) further limiting the power of courts to award interest in common law claims was expressed to apply to proceedings which had not been finally determined when the amendment became law.

In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
Appeal allowed; 
Orders 4 and 5 made by Burke CCJ on 5 February 1996 be set aside; 
The proceedings be remitted to the Compensation Court to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons; 
The first respondent pay the appellant's costs of the appeal and is to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1915 in respect of those costs.

COLE JA: I agree with Clarke JA.
