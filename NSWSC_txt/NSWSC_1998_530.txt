GERALD AND DENISE PROFILIO versus TNT EXPRESS WORLDWIDE (AUST) PTY LIMITED 
CA 40681/97 October 1998 
Mason P, Beazley JA, Fitzgerald AJA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: The argument today has made it plain that the contract alleged to exist between the appellant and the first respondent is governed by the Guadulahara Convention. Leave to appeal had been given because of doubt on this issue. The doubt having been removed, the basis for any view that the primary judge erred in the summary dismissal of these proceedings has fallen away. 
It is noted that the appellants do not seek leave to amend their statement of claim. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to rescind the grant of leave.

The appellants should pay the costs of the respondents.
