JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On costs relating to interlocutory rulings - T9388) HIS HONOUR: I accept the figure in Mr Potter's letter dated yesterday that I have delivered 214 interlocutory judgments in this case. That must include a series before the numbering commenced.
 In the course of preparing my reasons for judgment in the action, my attention was drawn to various interlocutory rulings in which costs expressly were reserved. I communicated with the parties in that regard, consequent upon which I have received from both Mallesons and Phillips Fox communications setting out their respective positions in relation to various judgments.
 I propose briefly to deal with them in order by reference to a letter dated June 2001 from the plaintiff's solicitors. That is purely a matter of convenience and nothing otherwise is to be taken from that.
 As to the Orders of 15 April 1999, I propose to make no orders as to costs.
Transcript page 910 clearly indicates that Mr McHugh announced his independent appearance for Carrington.
 In relation to DLJT 45, there is no need for orders to be made.
