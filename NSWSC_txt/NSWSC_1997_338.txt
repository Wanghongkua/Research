NEIL MASSON versus WEBSTERS INVESTIGATIONS PTY LIMITED 
JUDGMENT 
MEAGHER JA: In this matter the appellant was once a worker and was employed by the respondent Websters Investigations Pty Limited. He was injured on 5 May 1989. The question before us is whether at the date of the injury he was still an employee of the respondent. 
The reason for the difficulty is that in 1986 he employed a company to fulfil his operations, that company being called Jenjuna Pty Limited. There is a question of whether he did it under the threat of the respondent or not. That question does not seem to me of great importance.

After the company was incorporated he became an employee, the manager and director of that company. That having been done it is not easy to see how he could remain an employee of Websters Investigations Pty Limited. Indeed there is much evidence tending to the conclusion that he was not. There was, of course, a contractual relationship between his company Jenjuna Pty Limited and the respondent, but that is of no importance.

At the trial before his Honour Judge Davidson, who found for the present respondent, the question was whether the incorporation arrangements were, or were not, a sham. His Honour found that they were not a sham and this was the determination by his Honour of a question of fact and the appeal is limited to the question of fact. His Honour also decided the ultimate question, namely whether the present appellant is, or was, a worker within the meaning of the
Workers Compensation Act, in the negative. That result seems to me inevitable.
That result is also a question of fact and likewise one beyond challenge.

In the course of an interesting submission Mr Leslie drew our attention to some words of his Honour which could give the indication that his Honour proposed to disregard relevant considerations. To my mind this is to misread what his Honour was saying. What in fact his Honour was saying was that he would take into account whatever considerations were relevant to determine whether the arrangements were a sham or not, and he did that. Having determined that the arrangement was a reality rather than a sham there was no point in discussing outstanding issues. I might add that considerable reliance was placed by Mr Leslie on a previous decision of this Court, Pitcher v
Langford, 1991 23NSWLR, at 142. That is a case which should, in our view, be restricted to the facts of the case and not used more adventurously for any wide ratios. The correct principles of law to be applied in a case like the present are those contained in Boral Roof Tiles Limited versus O'Brien, an unreported decision of this Court of 2 December 1994. For those reasons we are of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.

COLE JA: I agree. The ultimate finding made by the trial judge was, "The parties by their actions intended that the applicant should not be the employee of the respondent, and arranged their affairs accordingly." 
That ultimate finding seems to me to result necessarily in the dismissal of the appeal. I would agree with the orders proposed.

SHEPHERD AJA: I am in agreement with the judgments which have been delivered, and I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. 
MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court, therefore, is the appeal should be dismissed with costs. * * *
