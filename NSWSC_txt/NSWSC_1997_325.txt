Francis Gary Kalyk & Ors versus Atlas Corporation Pty Ltd /93 August 1997

Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division /93 - FRANCIS GARY KALYK & ORS versus ATLAS CORPORATION 
PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Francis Gary Kalyk, Anthony John Deegan and Bruce William Hansen, were solicitors trading under the name of Kalyk Hansen & Deegan. Their practice is based in New South Wales. The defendant is a company incorporated in Papua New Guinea. 
The defendant has not appeared on the hearing before this Court. I am satisfied that it has been notified of the hearing date and indeed, a representative from the Sydney solicitors for the defendant, has attended in court but not participated in any way in the hearing.

The solicitors are suing their erstwhile client, the defendant, for moneys alleged to be due for legal work performed by them in 1988 in connection with a construction arbitration in Papua New Guinea. The defendant was suing that
State in respect of some twenty-nine claims. Apparently four of the claims were dealt with and an award was made by the Arbitrator in favour of the defendant against the State and the remainder of the claims were adjourned to be heard at a subsequent date.

In early 1988, as a result of advice communicated to the solicitors, Mr Kalyk contacted the managing director of the defendant and offered his professional services as his solicitor in connection with the intended arbitration. It is unnecessary to rehearse the details of the conversations and correspondence.
In March 1988 the parties entered into a retainer agreement.

The solicitors, between 10 June 1988 and 21 November 1988, rendered bills totalling $91,569.24. The defendant has paid a total of $47,000 and there remains a balance of some $44,569.24.

The solicitors allege that with the bills they submitted details of the work done, annexing what were described as time expended reports and matter transaction reports. It is asserted that these gave full details of all the work, so that the client could readily understand the work alleged to have been done, the time spent and the amount charged. I have not seen these reports. The solicitors say that they did not keep a hard copy of these records, that there was a "computer crash", that all the computer records relating to the Atlas matter were lost and that no hard copies of those records were available to them.

About 5 August 1988, Mr Kalyk allegedly said, in substance, to the managing director of the defendant that as he would be returning for the balance of the arbitration, there was no necessity for him to take his files back to
Australia and that he asked the managing director to keep those files for him pending his return. Those files were said to be extensive. The plaintiffs have since made demands for the return of these files and for, at least, copies of all the computer records. Those requests have been refused and that material has not been produced by the defendant in answer to a Notice to Produce.

On 2 February 1995, Master Malpass found that there had been a voluntary submission to jurisdiction by the defendant and declined to stay the proceedings. I have not seen Master Malpass' judgment but I have the computer records of this Court as to what happened before the Master. As the Master has determined that there was a voluntary submission by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Court and there has been no appeal against that order, it stands.

Subsequently the court received a letter from the managing director disputing the debt and challenging the jurisdiction of this Court. He wrote that the proper forum was Papua New Guinea. In view of the decision of Master Malpass,
I will say no more about that matter.

There is some challenge to an hourly rate of $160 but that appears to have come very late in the day. In his letter the managing director foreshadowed a cross-claim but none has been filed.

The plaintiff relied on the terms of a defence filed after the Master had ruled that there had been a voluntary submission to jurisdiction. That document does not specifically traverse the facts stated in paragraphs 3 to 8 of the Statement of Claim. Paragraphs 10 to 22 are not admitted and an issue is raised that the plaintiffs' claim is not maintainable because of the absence of an itemised Bill of Costs.

The plaintiffs' evidence before me, points to the probability of there being an itemised Bill of Costs and I am left in the situation where the only evidence is that of the solicitor as to what the records sent to the defendant show. It has refused to produce them.

On an ex-parte basis, the plaintiff has made out its claim for $44,569.24. The plaintiffs have also sought interest on the amount claimed, calculated in accordance with the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) and Rules as follows: 
Claim $44,569.24 Sep 88 - 28 Feb 89 @ 15% (181 days 3,315.21 Mar 89 - 31 Aug 89 @ 17% (184 days) 3,819.52 Sep 89 - 31 Aug 90 @ 21% (365 days) 9,359.54 Sep 90 - 28 Feb 91 @ 19% (181 days) 4,199.27 Mar 91 - 31 Aug 91 @ 17% (184 days) 3,819.52 Sep 91 - 28 Feb 92 @ 15% (181 days) 3,315.21 Feb 92 - 31 Aug 92 @ 13% (185 days) 2,928.66 Sep 92 - 31 Aug 93 @ 11.25% (365 days)5,014.03 Sep 93 - 28 Feb 95 @ 10.5% (546 days) 7,000.42 Mar 95 - 28 Feb 97 @ 12% (731 days) 10,696.62 Mar 97 - 21 Aug 97 @ 10.5% (174 days)22,230.90 $ 55,698.90 
Total $100,268.14 
Upon the basis of the evidence of the plaintiffs' claim and in particular, the relevant work having been done, the claim for interest is reasonable and ought to be allowed. This would result in a judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $100,268.14. It is a matter for the Courts of Papua New Guinea, whether they register this judgment and, if so, on what terms. I have not purported to deal with any counter claim.

The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of the action. Their costs should be those appropriate to a claim for $50,000 in the District Court and the taxing assessor should approach the assessment of costs on that basis.
