ORDER
Orders made
JUDGE1
KIRBY ACJ I remain of the view that the Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, dismiss the Crown appeal. However, having regard to the conclusion that has been reached by the majority of the Court, I will, upon that premise, join in the order which has been proposed by Allen
J.
The orders of the Court therefore are:  That the respondent Noel Keith Turner is resentenced by this Court in respect of each of the counts of the indictment on which he was convicted;  That this Court imposes upon him a fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence on 11 August 1995;  That the Court orders that each of the sentences by served by periodic detention; That the Court orders that the respondent report to the Windsor Periodic
Detention Centre on 11 August 1975 at 7pm to commence serving this sentence.
JUDGE2
ALLEN J In this matter I indicated on 26 July 1995 my opinion that the Crown appeal against sentence should be upheld and that the community service orders made by the sentencing judge should be quashed. I indicated that in my opinion the respondent should receive a custodial sentence. The sentence should reflect, however, the leniency appropriate where it is consequent upon a successful Crown appeal.
Enquiry has been made as to whether the respondent would be suitable for periodic detention.
The report is in the affirmative. I indicated on the last occasion that in my opinion in the special circumstances of this case, relating particularly to the respondent, it would be appropriate to order that the sentence imposed by this Court be served by way of periodic detention.
I am satisfied that as to each of the matters referred to in s5(1) of the
Periodic Detention of Prisoners
Act 1991. I propose that in lieu of the community service orders the respondent be sentenced in respect of each of the crimes of which he was convicted to a fixed term of penal servitude for two years commencing on 11 August 1995 but that pursuant to s5(1) of the Periodic
Detention of Prisoners Act 1991 it be ordered that each of the sentences be served by way of period detention, and that the respondent be required to report to the Windsor Periodic Detention Centre on 11 August 1995 at 7pm to commence his sentence.
The sentence which I propose is a lenient one. The leniency flows from the fact that it follows a successful Crown appeal.
It should not be treated by any sentencing judge, who is referred to this case by way of precedent, as an indication that it is the appropriate sentence to be imposed in ordinary circumstances.
JUDGE3
DOWD J For the reasons given by me on 26 July 1995 I agree with the reasons given today and the proposed orders by Allen J.
