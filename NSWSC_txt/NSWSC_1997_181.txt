CATCHWORDS: [Residential Tenancies Act, 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) [ss47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html), [64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)(2)c) and [65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) - meaning of "at any time" - meaning of "circumstances of the case" - extent of landlord's right to absolute possession.

EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: RESERVED 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: DISMISSED 
FACTS 
The first respondents were tenants of a residential house pursuant to an agreement with the appellant dated 12 August 1987 made under the [Residential
Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/). The appellant sought an order for possession from the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal, which was granted on 17 May 1994. The first respondent appealed that decision to the Supreme Court by way of a summons filed 14 June 1994, praying for relief for denial of natural justice and procedural fairness and alleged error in the application of [ss.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html), [64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)(2)c), and [65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) of the Act. Rolfe J delivered his decision on 22 March 1995 and upheld the appeal. The appellant seeks to overturn this decision.

HELD 
The [Residential Tenancies Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) is intended to balance the rights of landlords and tenants.

Hardship to a tenant is a relevant matter for consideration by the
Tribunal when considering the "circumstances of the case" for the purposes of [s.64(2)c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
These "circumstances of the case" also include any [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) applications brought by the tenant.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s69.html) of the Act enables the Tribunal to terminate a Residential Tenancy Agreement, even in the absence of a breach, so as to avoid hardship to the landlord. In this way, [s.69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s69.html) can be seen as the landlord's counterpart to [s.64(2)c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) "At any time" when used in [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) means at any time. However, no application can be brought pursuant to [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) unless the Residential Tenancy Agreement remains in force.

The trial judge did not err in finding that a proper construction of the
Act means that a landlord does not have an absolute right to orders of termination of a residential tenancy agreement and of quiet possession, even where the notice serviced on the tenant is correct in form and time.

ORDERS 
Appeal dismissed with costs.

JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Meagher JA.
 
MEAGHER JA: This is an appeal from a decision of Rolfe J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and concerns primarily the [Residential Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/)") and the processes of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal of New South Wales ("the Tribunal").

FACTS AND CASE HISTORY 
The first respondents have been tenants of a residential house, rented from the appellant ("RTA"), pursuant to a residential tenancy agreement as defined by the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/).

Proceedings were commenced in the Tribunal seeking an order terminating the agreement and an order for possession of the property. After several mentions before various Members of the Tribunal an ex tempore decision was made by Mr
G Cochrane on 17 May 1994. That Member granted the orders sought by the RTA and the Tribunal forwarded to the first respondent, by way of letter dated 30
May 1994, a transcription of the reasons for decision dated 27 May 1994. The first respondents appealed to the Supreme Court on various questions of law, s.107 of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) limiting appeals to those involving "a matter of law". They also sought relief on the basis they had been denied natural justice and procedural fairness. The first respondents' summons, filed 14 June 1994, sought orders from the Supreme
Court that the appeal be upheld, that the record of proceedings with respect to the application for termination of the tenancy be removed from the Tribunal to the Supreme Court and that the orders of the Tribunal be quashed. The first respondents' amended summons, filed 8 July 1994, sought declarations that the
Tribunal erred in law: i in declining to consider the application of [s (2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/); ii in finding that the only ground on which the Tribunal could refuse to make an order for termination was under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/); and, iii in declining the plaintiff's application on the basis it was out of time.

The Amended Summons also sought a declaration that the first respondents were denied natural justice and procedural fairness before the Tribunal on the basis that the Tribunal did not allow them to be adequately heard; refused to allow them access to subpoenaed documents; and refused to allow them to be represented or to receive assistance. The first respondents sought orders for costs and that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for a re-hearing according to law.

Rolfe J delivered his decision on 22 March 1995, granting the orders sought.
The RTA appealed to this court.
 
JUDGMENT AND REASONS OF THE TRIBUNAL 
In relation to the Tribunal's reasons as given by Mr Cochrane, Rolfe J noted that the decision set forth the following history: the residential tenancy agreement was made on 12 August 1987 and the rent was agreed at $155 per week.
The rent was increased from 14 June 1993 to $190 per week. The property had been acquired because of the proposed Hume Highway bypass at Ashfield, but became surplus to the RTA's requirements when that project was abandoned.

The RTA sent by post a termination notice dated 2 February 1994, requiring vacant possession by 6 April 1994. That termination notice was of the type specified in [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), commonly known as a "60 day [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) no grounds" notice. The proceedings in the Tribunal were lodged within the requisite 30 day period after the date seeking vacant possession, those proceedings being, pursuant to [s.64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), proceedings for termination and an order for possession.

Rolfe J noted that the first respondents' submissions to the Tribunal were to the effect that a landlord has an absolute right to give notice seeking to terminate the agreement without specifying a reason. However, if the tenant does not vacate in accordance with the notice, the landlord does not have an absolute right to orders of possession and termination of the agreement: the
Tribunal must be satisfied of certain matters before making such orders. In particular, it was submitted, the Tribunal must have regard to [s.64(2)(c):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) it must be satisfied that the orders are appropriate having considered "the circumstances of the case".

Rolfe J inferred that the Tribunal considered it was not bound to have regard to the requirements of [s.64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) and noted that this interpretation stemmed from the decisions of two judges of the Supreme Court: Badgery-Parker J in Nicholson versus New South Wales Land and
Housing Corporation ( unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 24
December 1991) and Campbell J in Spartalis & Anor versus Department of Housing and Residential Tenancies Tribunal (unreported, 10 February 1992). However, the Tribunal seems to have thought the words "the circumstances of the case", when used in [s.64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html), were limited to requiring the Tribunal to considering whether or not the notice complied with matters of form and time.

The first respondents raised with the Tribunal the fact that a garage had been demolished in April 1993, obviously depriving them of its use. Rolfe J was satisfied that Mrs Swain referred in her submissions to [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) which specifies that a tenant "may, at any time, apply to the Tribunal for an order" in certain circumstances and that she referred to [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) was not disputed by learned counsel for the appellant before this court. As
Rolfe J noted, Mr Cochrane was of the view that "complaints of reduction or withdrawal of services and/or facilities must be brought within a reasonable time". The demolition of the garage had a double significance: it founded an application under [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) and it was alleged to be a "circumstance" within the meaning of [s.64(2)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) 
JUDGMENT AND REASONS OF THE SUPREME COURT 
The [section 64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) argument 
In relation to the argument that the Tribunal erred in law in failing to consider [s.64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html),
Rolfe J said the following: "In my opinion [s 64(1)] provides that if notice of termination is given under "this Part", which is [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/index.html#p5) and in which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) is included, and the tenant fails to deliver up vacant possession on the day specified, the landlord is thereby empowered, not later than 30 days after the day specified, to apply to the Tribunal for an order terminating the agreement and for possession. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) does not bring about a termination of the agreement or an order for possession. It provides the conditions precedent for an application to be made to the Tribunal.

His Honour then went on to say that [s.64(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) empowers the Tribunal to make an order terminating the agreement if it is satisfied of certain things, being the things referred to in [s.64(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) to s.[64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)(2)(c).
Of most importance to the case was [s.64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) which his Honour thought required the Tribunal to be satisfied "having considered the circumstances of the case" to make the order sought. His Honour thought that the words went further than merely requiring the Tribunal to be satisfied that the requisite notice had been given and the necessary time periods elapsed; that is, that it went beyond matters of form and time. Rolfe
J inferred that "the Tribunal did not consider it was bound to have regard to the requirements of [s.64(2)(c)"](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) and did not in fact consider any other issue that the First Respondent wished to raise. His Honour took the view that this amounted to an error of law and did not agree with the decisions of Badgery-Parker J in Nicholson's Case and Campbell J in Spartalis's Case to the extent that those decisions are inconsistent.

During his submissions before this court, learned counsel for the appellant had occasion to refer to Second Reading Speeches in interpreting [s.64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/).
So did learned counsel for the Respondent in her written submissions. Rolfe J did likewise. It soon became apparent that the Second Reading Speeches did not elucidate the legislation, but rather raised additional complications and generated ambiguities not previously remarked. Eventually it was conceded that, as the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) was unambiguous, no recourse to the Hansard was necessary.

The scheme for the termination of residential tenancy agreements set out in the legislation is clear: A landlord may seek to terminate an agreement on the basis of a specific ground provided for in [Part .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/index.html#p5)
Also, a landlord may seek to terminate an agreement without specifying a ground: [s.58.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html)
A formally valid notice is required in both cases: [s.64(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
If the tenant fails to deliver up vacant possession on the day specified, the landlord may then apply to the Tribunal for orders for possession and termination of the agreement: [s.64(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
If the notice is not valid, the Tribunal may, if it thinks it appropriate to do so, proceed to termination notwithstanding the defect in the notice: [s.66.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s66.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s66.html) goes beyond formal defects and is broad enough to encompass defects in substance. The Tribunal is empowered to make the orders sought by the landlord if it is satisfied of certain things, being those things referred to in [s.64(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
Those things are the factual issues surrounding the particular case. [Section (2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) does not apply if the application to the Tribunal is based on a [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) notice. [Section (2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) applies both to a [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) notice and to a notice based on one of the enumerated grounds in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/index.html#p5) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/).
[Section (2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) requires the Tribunal to consider "the circumstances of the case". The
Tribunal can refuse to make an order for termination (even where that order is sought on the basis of a [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) notice) in the very limited circumstances provided for in [s.65(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) and the Tribunal can postpone the order for termination pursuant to [s.65(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) 
The question then becomes what the words "circumstances of the case" mean.
They are clear enough; they require regard to be had to the particular case before the Tribunal. If they were intended to be limited to matters of form and time, then [s.64(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) merely repeats what is said by [s.64(2)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
It is difficult to see why the words do not mean what they say.

I think it can be fairly stated that the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) is intended to balance the rights of landlords and tenants. The argument urged against accepting Rolfe J's interpretation of [s.64(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) is that it could be unduly harsh on the landlord. That argument fails as hardship to the landlord is something which the Tribunal must consider as part of the "circumstances of the case". But further, the matter is specifically addressed in [s.69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s69.html), which does not seem to have been raised at any stage of the history of the case. That section enables the Tribunal to terminate a tenancy, even in the absence of a breach, simply to avoid hardship to the landlord. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s69.html) can, in this way, be seen as the landlord's counterpart to [section (2)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
If Rolfe J's interpretation were not upheld, then a landlord could plead hardship to obtain an early termination, but the tenant, in circumstances where no breach had occurred could not plead hardship to avoid eviction; the tenant could only rely on [s.65(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) to postpone eviction or rely on the limited grounds of refusal to make an order which are provided for in [s.65(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s65.html) and which do not include hardship to the tenant.

The [section 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) issue 
The Tribunal considered that an application made under [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) had to be made within "a reasonable time". On this issue, Rolfe J made the following comment: "[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s49.html) provides that where an application is made pursuant to, inter alia, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) and, the Tribunal determines the rent is excessive, it may order from a day specified by it, not being earlier than the tenant's application to the
Tribunal that `the rent shall not exceed an amount specified by the Tribunal and may make such other orders as it thinks fit'. Such an order, pursuant to sub-s (4), has effect for such period, not exceeding twelve months, as is specified by the Tribunal in the order and `binds only the parties to the residential tenancy agreementÉ under which the rent is payable'. In my opinion the fact that the order only dates from the time the application is made, rather than from the time the facility is withdrawn, militates strongly against any implication in the words `at any time' `within a reasonable time'.
 "I should note, immediately, the submission by Miss Needham that the opening words of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) mean that the tenant can only make an application provided a residential tenancy agreement is in force. This submission is supported by sub-s (4) of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s49.html) "The significance, for present purposes, is that a circumstance, which, in my opinion, it is arguably relevant for the Tribunal to take into account, is that the tenant may have a right, after a consideration of the withdrawal of facilities, to an order that a lower rent be paid, albeit for a restricted period. There is no suggestion such an entitlement can be carried from premises to premises, nor that monetary compensation can be made in lieu of the entitlement. Accordingly, in my opinion, the tenant must be able to raise as a circumstance pursuant to [s (2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html), the right to have the rent reduced and to enjoy the benefit of continuing to occupy the property with the benefit of that reduced rent. If that is not so the landlord could withdraw facilities and, without any risk of having to accept a lesser rent, give notice pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) and, on the view which has previously been put forward about the operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html), the landlord would be entitled to terminate thus depriving the tenant of such rights the tenant may have pursuant to sz 47 and 49. This, in my respectful opinion, provides another reason why the Tribunal is bound to consider the circumstances of the case."(emphasis added).

Rolfe J concluded that the Tribunal misinterpreted the time within which and the potential effect of an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) and took the view that this amounted to an error of law.

Contrary to what Rolfe J said in that passage I have emphasised above, the relevant parts of [s.49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s49.html) state that the Tribunal may make an order, where there has been a reduction or withdrawal of goods, services or facilities, from a day specified by it, "not being earlier than the date of that reduction or withdrawal".
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) makes it clear that a tenant can only bring an application pursuant to that section when the tenancy agreement is in force. So long as the tenancy agreement is in force the tenant can bring the application at any time.
[Section (4)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s49.html) operates to prevent the Tribunal from making an order by way of rent reduction for a period greater than 12 months. Thus, if the tenant fails to make the application within 12 months of the withdrawal of the goods, services or facilities, the landlord is still only potentially liable for a 12 month period. That is another example of the balancing or rights and obligations between landlords and tenants: tenants who may not be aware of their legal rights may fail to bring an application within a reasonable time, yet there is a limit to how much a landlord should be prejudiced by a tenant's failure to exercise their legal rights.

I think a tenant must be able to raise, as a "circumstance" under [s.64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html), the circumstances surrounding the [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) application. Those circumstances form part of the circumstances of the particular case before the Tribunal which the Tribunal must consider.

In the present case it was wrong of the Tribunal not to consider the demolition of the garage as a "circumstance" under [s.64(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html), and also not to consider it in the [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) application.

CONCLUSIONS 
For the reasons outlined above, I find that Rolfe J did not err in finding that the proper interpretation of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) is that a landlord does not have an absolute right to orders of termination of a residential tenancy agreement and of quiet possession, even if the notice served on the tenant is issued in the correct form and is correct as to time.

Similarly, I do not think that Rolfe J erred in concluding that the Tribunal
Member erred in law because of the latter's misinterpretation of the time in which an application under [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) could be brought and I do not think Rolfe J erred in allowing the appeal and in remitting the matter for determination according to the law on that basis.

Lastly, I do not think that Rolfe J erred in concluding that the Tribunal
Member erred in law because of the latter's determination that the potential effect of a claim by a tenant founded upon [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s47.html) was one which it was not relevant for the Member to have regard to in considering [s.64(2)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) 
I propose that the appeal be dismissed with costs.
 
COLE JA: I agree with Meagher JA.
