JUDGMENT:  - 2 - 
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
WINDEYER J  
THURSDAY 6 NOVEMBER 2003.  /02 EDLAN NO 54 PTY LIMITED V AURO ROMANO MCINTYRE  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff seeks a declaration that certain judgments and orders obtained in the Federal Court of Australia are "ineffective judgments" within the meaning of the s4 of the Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act 1999 together with supplementary orders to enable enforcement of the judgment and orders.  While the further amended summons refers to a series of judgments and orders in the Federal Court there are only four which are of relevance. These are as follows:  
A. In proceedings No. NG 672 of 1996 an order for judgment was made on 25
February 1999 in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $566,839.88. That order was made pursuant to an earlier order and reasons for judgment given on 11 September 1998, when an order was made for payment to the plaintiff by the defendant of the sum of $505,496.43 with liberty to the plaintiff to apply for interest. It was the interest allowed of $61,363.45 which brought the figure up to $566,839.88.  
B. In proceedings No. 292 of 1998 by judgment and orders dated 29 April 1999
Beaumont J dismissed a claim by the plaintiff in these proceedings for a declaration that it was entitled to a charge or lien over a particular property on the basis of a vendor's lien for unpaid purchase moneys.  
C. In respect of both decisions the losing party appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court. That Court dismissed the appeal from the money judgment, but allowed the appeal against the dismissal of a claim for a declaration as to a vendor's lien. In lieu thereof the Full Court on 16 June 1999 made a declaration that the plaintiff, Edlan, holds an unpaid vendor's lien over a particular property known as "Riverview Lodge" which lien secures the said judgment debt. The final orders of the Full Court of the Federal Court were made on 16 June 1999, the day before the High Court of Australia gave its judgment in Re Wakim: Ex parte McNally <case>; [(1999) 198 CLR 511.]  The question then for decision is whether the money judgment upheld by the
Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia and the declaration as to a lien made by the Full Court of the Federal Court are ineffective judgments within the meaning of that term, under [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/s4.html) of the [Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/) so that the rights of the parties are the same as if the ineffective judgments had been judgments of this court and the rights and liabilities so declared enforceable as such.  There are certain collateral proceedings running with the main proceedings.
Proceedings on the lien commenced as proceedings in this Court No. 4739 of seeking an order for an extension of a caveat based upon a claimed interest pursuant to a vendor's lien for unpaid purchase moneys. These proceedings were cross-vested to the Federal Court on the basis of their being connected with the money claim against the defendant. They became proceedings
No NG 292 of 1998 in that Court. After the decision of the Full Court of the
Federal Court upholding the claim for a vendor's lien, questions relating to the form of the caveat were referred back to Beaumont J, the trial judge, and ultimately were cross-vested by Beaumont J back to this Court. Campbell J then determined that those proceedings as to the form of caveat be determined with the remaining proceedings. The parties have agreed that in the event that the plaintiff's contentions are upheld and the Federal Court judgments and orders in question are declared to be ineffective judgments then the caveats now entered will remain in force until the vendor's lien is discharged by payment of the amount secured by it. It is thus not necessary to go into the caveat proceedings any further.  The original proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia No NG 672 of 1996 were a claim by the plaintiff Edlan No 54 Pty Ltd ("Edlan") and two other persons against the defendant McIntyre and four other respondents for misleading and deceptive conduct under [s52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) said to have arisen in a transaction called a share sale agreement. It is not necessary to consider that further. An application was made to amend the statement of claim to include a claim said to have arisen three years earlier than the misleading and deceptive conduct claim under which Edlan claimed to be entitled to damages for breach of an agreement made in August 1990 under which certain property was to be transferred to McIntyre on terms that he was to pay to Westpac Banking Corporation Limited amounts secured on that property, which moneys he had failed to pay. There was claimed damages for breach of the agreement to pay the said moneys and there was also a claim for breach of duty owed by McIntyre to Edlan pursuant to s232(6) of the
Corporations Law the claim being for loss and damage in the sum of $505,476.43 in consequence of such breach of duty. The amended application so far as it is relevant claimed damages against McIntyre for breach of contract, an order that McIntyre compensate Edlan pursuant to s1317HA or s1317HD of the
Corporations Law and that McIntyre pay to Edlan an amount of $505,476.43 with interest.  In his judgment allowing the amendment Beaumont J ordered that there be a separate trial of the three causes of action, namely the Trade Practices claim, the claim for breach of contract and unjust enrichment and a further claim for $85,895.00 which need not be gone into separately. The separate trial order was later revoked but that does not matter. Beaumont J so far as the claim arising out of the 1990 transfer of property was concerned said:  
So far as the first cause of action now sought to be introduced is concerned, it is claimed on behalf of the applicants that jurisdiction is vested in this
Court to entertain the claim by reason, inter alia, of the provisions of s
HA or, alternatively, of <case> of the Corporations Law. This source of jurisdiction is not seriously challenged on behalf of the respondents. So far as the second cause of action proposed to be introduced is concerned, it is accepted on behalf of the applicants that the only possible source of this
Court's jurisdiction in this respect is the cross-vesting legislation.  
Although there would have been no accrued jurisdiction in this Court to entertain either of the causes of actions now sought to be introduced, there being no common substratum of facts or law involved in either claim vis-a-vis the existing cause of action now sued upon, it is, nonetheless, of course open to the applicants now to invoke the provisions of both the Corporations Law and the cross-vesting legislation as a basis for this Courts jurisdiction to entertain such claims.  The second cause of action referred to is that relating to the claim for $85,895.00. It does not relate to the subject matter of the judgments under consideration before me.  The judgment of Beaumont J in favour of Edlan makes no reference whatsoever to any claim under s232 of the Corporations Law or the later sections to which I have referred. The money judgment is based entirely upon the breach of a contractual term to make payments otherwise due by Edlan to Westpac Banking
Corporation. If that is the position the words "inter alia" might be thought to indicate jurisdiction under the cross-vesting legislation. Whether that is so or not, one thing is clear and it is that jurisdiction was not exercised under any accrued jurisdiction power. The argument of counsel for the defendant before me as to this must be rejected.  It does not seem to me to matter whether or not jurisdiction was purported to be exercised pursuant to the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) , or the [Corporations (New South Wales) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/), or for that matter both. If it was only the former then there can be no doubt as to the position and counsel for the defendant did not argue otherwise. It must have been the former for the lien claim.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/s4.html) of the [Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/) defines so far as is relevant the meaning of "ineffective judgment" in sub-section (1) as follows:  
A reference in this Act to an ineffective judgment is a reference to a judgment of a federal court in a State matter given or recorded, before the commencement of this section, in the purported exercise of jurisdiction purporting to have been conferred on the federal court by a relevant State
Act.  "Relevant State Act" is defined in the definition s3 of the Act as meaning any of the following Acts:  ...  [Corporations (New South Wales) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/)  ...  [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/)  ...  The Federal Court of Australia, if not exercising jurisdiction under the cross-vesting legislation must have been exercising it under the [Corporations (New South Wales) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/), [s42(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/s42.html) of which provides as follows:  (3) Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia with respect to civil matters arising under the Corporations Law of New South Wales.  As the conduct complained of all related to New South Wales then that sub- section is relevant. It would therefore appear that the judgment is an ineffective judgment because it is a judgment of the Federal Court in a State matter as defined by [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/s3.html), given in the purported exercise of jurisdiction purporting to have been conferred on the Federal Court by a relevant State Act, namely the [Corporations (New South Wales) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/), [s42.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/s42.html)
The defendant's argument against this is that the Federal Court is purporting to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to [s56(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/s56.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/) of the
Commonwealth. Thus it is argued that the judgment is invalid but not ineffective under [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/s4.html) of the [Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/).  It is not suggested there was a purported exercise of jurisdiction under any [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/) of a State other than that of New South Wales. Jurisdiction was purported to be exercised pursuant to that purportedly conferred under [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/s42.html) of the Act. [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/s56.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/) (Cth) may have purported to give the Federal Court power to exercise such purported jurisdiction but what the Court was purporting to do was to exercise the [s42(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1989172/s42.html) jurisdiction invalidly conferred.  I should add that if the defendant's argument was correct then the same result would arise from purported exercise of the cross-vesting power pursuant to the then [s4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/s4.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) because the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) (Cth) by [s9(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) purported to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court in respect of the State matter. The argument put here is not stated to have been put to the Court of
Appeal in Continental Venture Capital Ltd versus Amann Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [(2001) 53 NSWLR 687] probably because it could not be supported. The Federal Acts may have purported to give the Federal Court power to exercise the conferred jurisdiction, but in doing so the Federal Court was purporting to exercise a jurisdiction which had no basis other than the purported conferral. The Commonwealth legislation was adjectival to this. Whether or not it was argued, and whether or not the purported exercise of jurisdiction was under the Corporations legislation or the Cross-Vesting legislation, the Federal Court judgments and orders cannot be distinguished from those in Continental Venture. In any event so far as the Corporations legislation is concerned, the decision of the High
Court in Re Marks & Ors; Ex parte Saint <case>; [(2000) 204 CLR 158] determines the matter as does the following passage from the judgment of McHugh J in Gould versus Brown (1998) 193 CLR 346 at 415:  
Section 56(2) of the Commonwealth Act does not confer jurisdiction on the
Federal Court. It operates on the hypothesis that a law of a State has conferred jurisdiction on the Federal Court.  Orders  
The plaintiff is entitled to orders in its favour but those put forward are not altogether appropriate. I will stand the matter over to enable the parties to give attention to the appropriate orders. These should include any order for appointment of trustees for sale but the operation of that order should be postponed for a period of 28 days so as to give the defendant the opportunity to pay the judgment debt secured by the lien in which event that order can be discharged by consent. It will be necessary to make orders to bring proceedings No 4739 of 2002 to an end, those proceedings it seems now being limited to the forms of caveat entered to protect the vendor's lien.
