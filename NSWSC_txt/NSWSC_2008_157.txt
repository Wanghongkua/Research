EQUITY DIVISION  
BISCOE AJ  February 2008  /03 BYRON WARD THOMPSON versus JULIAN JOHN WHITE & ROMEO MEDINA LIBUT  /03 AERATED CONCRETE DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION PTY LTD ACN 070 297 291 versus BYRON WARD THOMPSON 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: I delivered judgment in this matter on 15 January 2008. At that time I listed the matter on 29 January 2008 to make final orders and gave directions for the parties to submit agreed or competing short minutes of orders. The directions were not complied with. Consequently, on 29 January the timetable was extended and the matter was listed on 12 February 2008 to make final orders. There was a slippage in the timetable, it was again extended and the matter was listed on 22 February 2008 when I heard extensive argument as to the content of final orders.
 In the meantime: 
Mr Thompson was declared bankrupt on 8 February 2008 and at the subsequent listings his trustee in bankruptcy was represented by his former solicitors. It was common ground that, notwithstanding Mr Thompson's bankruptcy and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s60.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Cth), I could make final orders to give effect to the judgment that I had delivered:
John versus Neiman Holdings Pty Ltd [(1986) 84 FLR 84.] 
On 12 February 2008 the solicitors for Aerated Concrete Design and
Construction Pty Ltd (ACDC) and Mr Libut obtained leave to withdraw.
Thereafter those parties were no longer legally represented but ACDC was represented by its director, Mr White.
 It became common ground that it was sufficient relief in both proceedings to make orders as to the amounts owing between the joint venture, on the one hand, and the participants in the joint venture and related parties, on the other.
 I make the following orders: 
Declaration that the following amounts inclusive of interest are owed by the joint venture of Byron Ward Thompson, Julian John White and Romeo
Libut: $198,735 to Australian Hebel House Superannuation Fund $338,874 to Aerated Concrete Design and Construction Superannuation Fund.
 $418,426 to Aerated Concrete Design and Construction Pty Limited.
 $301,000 to Romeo Libut $505,500 to Julian John White 
Declaration that, subject to the provisions of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Cth),
Byron Ward Thompson owes, and order that he pay, the said joint venture the sum of $561,571 inclusive of interest.
 
Declaration that the profit made by the said joint venture was $855,557.
 
Subject to the provisions of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Cth) order that Byron Ward Thompson pay the costs of the other parties.
 
Grant leave to Julian John White to arrange with the Registry for his notice of motion filed on 18 February 2008 to be listed before the Duty Judge.

The exhibits may be returned, except for the exhibits on 22 February 2008.
