EQUITY DIVISION 
AUSTIN J FEBRUARY 1999 /95 K A & C SMITH PTY LTD (trading as Uticolor Australia) V BRIAN DOUGLAS WARD & ORS 
JUDGMENT (Delivered orally on 24 February 1999 and revised on 2 March 1999) On 23 December 1998 I handed down reasons for judgment on the substantive issues in this matter. I concluded that Mr Ward, the first defendant, had breached the restraint clause in the franchise agreement between him and the plaintiff dated 6 January 1990, and the plaintiff was entitled to damages for that breach, but was not entitled to an injunction. The plaintiff's claims against the second and fourth defendants (Starcar Pty Ltd and Mrs Ward) were unsuccessful because they had not become parties to the franchise agreement and were not bound by it. I found that the cross-claim brought by the first and second defendants against the plaintiff and Mr Lindsay Smith, its managing director, failed. I stood the matter over to give the parties the chance to consider my lengthy reasons for judgment, and to make submissions on costs and other matters.
 Apart from the question of costs on the main proceedings and the cross- claim, there were two other ancillary matters relating to costs. The first of these arose out of the cross-defendants' successful application to amend their defence to the cross-claim. The second arose out of my decision of 21 October , which dealt with the plaintiff's application to restrain the enforcement of a costs order in favour of the defendants made by Santow J on 11 July 1998.
In my reasons for judgment of 23 December 1998 I invited the parties to make submissions as to costs on the former application, but I had already heard submissions as costs on the latter application and I indicated that I proposed to order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs.
 When the matter came before me again on 19 February 1999, the following issues were contested: the plaintiff's measure of damages; the proper orders for costs on the claim and cross-claim; costs on the cross-defendants' application to amend the defence to the cross-claim.
 I propose to deal with these three matters in the present judgment, and then make my orders in the proceedings.

The plaintiff's measure of damages In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I found that the first defendant failed to perform the franchise agreement during the period from approximately 27
April 1995 until approximately 16 June 1995, when the plaintiff accepted the first defendant's repudiation of the franchise agreement and brought it to an end. I held that damages for the breach of contract were properly measured by the royalty and product payments which the plaintiff was entitled to receive under the franchise agreement in respect of the North Shore Uticolor business during that period. During the period from approximately 16 June 1995 to approximately 26 April 1997 the first defendant continued to breach the restraint provision in clause 5 of the franchise agreement. I held that an appropriate measure of damages for breach of the restraint clause during that period would be to calculate the amount of royalty and product payments which the North Shore Uticolor business would have been required to pay had the first defendant remained a franchisee during that period. In other words, the measure of damages for the period from 16 June 1995 to 26 April 1997 was the same as the measure of damages for the period from 27 April 1995 to 16 June .
 The plaintiff contended that damages could be calculated as a 5% royalty based on the gross actual income of the North Shore Uticolor business during the whole period (in my judgement, the period from 27 April 1995 to 16 June ) and adding to that figure an average 21.5% mark up on all produce purchases during that period. The plaintiff handed up a document which made the calculation and showed total damages of $28,693.67. I indicated that the plaintiff's figures would need to be revised, because they had made the calculation from 1 May 1995 to 2 May 1997 rather than from 27 April 1995 to 26
April 1997. The plaintiff subsequently made that calculation, and at the further hearing on 19 February 1999, counsel for the plaintiff handed up a revised calculation document showing a total figure of $28,330.45. The plaintiff also claims interest in a total sum of $7,327.78.
 In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I took the view that the plaintiff's method of calculation of damages was undoubtedly correct with respect to the period from 27 April 1995 to 16 June 1995, when the franchise agreement came to an end. As to the period from approximately 17 June 1995 until 26 April , I found the position to be more complicated. However, I took the view that the plaintiff's method of calculating the loss was appropriate to be used for that period provided the two conditions were satisfied. The first condition was that on the facts, the first defendant's continuation of the
North Shore Uticolor business in breach of the restraint clause prevented the plaintiff from establishing a new franchise agreement in the North Shore of
Sydney or from benefiting through sales by other franchisees in the North
Shore area. The second condition was that on the facts, the gross income actually generated by Mr Ward's business and the purchases of products actually made by the business would have been generated and made by a new
Uticolor franchisee if Mr Ward's continuation of the North Shore Uticolor business in breach of the restraint clause had not prevented the appointment of a new franchisee.
 The defendants submitted at the hearing on 19 February 1999 that I erred in my finding on the second question. In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I said that there was no evidence that the business of North Shore Uticolor expanded into areas outside vinyl, leather and plastic repairs during the two years commencing April 1995. The defendants submitted on 19 February 1999 that there was evidence in the plaintiff's newsletter of 8 October 1993 that a major part of Mr Ward's business was automotive spray and spot repairs using paints which he mixed up at the shop. The defendants also referred to Mr Smith's affidavit as to damages, sworn 4 September 1998. The defendants also attacked my finding that under cl 6 of the franchise agreement the first defendant was obliged to purchase all supplies only from the plaintiff, and they referred to
Mr Smith's affidavit of 15 February 1996 in which he says he authorised the first defendant to buy certain products from someone else.
 In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I took into account the evidence that Mr
Ward engaged in some such spray-painting activities in reaching the conclusions which I expressed in my judgment. This is why I acknowledged (revised judgment page 43) that there was "room for argument about some business activities". But there was no evidence, as I said, of any expansion in Mr Ward's business during 1995-1997 into other areas - that is areas not already occupied in April 1995. I remain of that opinion.
 I do not regard Mr Smith's "damages" affidavit of 4 September 1998 as providing an alternative and more satisfactory way of calculating damages than the submissions made by the plaintiff at the hearing. The defendants successfully objected to the admissibility of large portions of that affidavit, with the result that though the deponent's assertions as to his calculations concerning estimated loss remain, most of the reasoning which he used to reach his conclusions was not admitted into evidence. The gap was not adequately filled by Mr Smith's oral evidence. I therefore find the affidavit of 4 September 1998 generally unhelpful and I prefer to adhere to the method of calculating loss which the plaintiff advocated at the hearing and which I adopted and explained in my judgment of 23 December 1998.
 In a case such as this no method of assessment of damages can avoid relying on inferences and findings of fact on the balance of probabilities from relatively thin evidence, but I am satisfied that the method which I adopted is a rational evaluation properly based on such evidence as there is.
 As to my conclusion that the first defendant was obliged to buy products only from the plaintiff, I do not regard Mr Smith's evidence as showing more than that on occasions he waived his right in order to suit the particular circumstances.
 In the result I adhere to the conclusion which I expressed on 23 December that the correct method of calculating damages for the whole period from April 1995 to 26 April 1997 is as set out in the plaintiff's written calculation handed up at the hearing. However, I agree with the defendants that the plaintiff's actual calculation is deficient in one respect. The "Amended Summary of Materials" in the document handed up on 19 February 1999 lists and adds up a series of amounts for goods purchased by Mr Ward's business during the two years from 27 April 1995, the total figure being $21,523.05. Then the plaintiff's loss of sales profit is calculated as $4,627.45, that amount being 21.5 per cent of the total figure. 21.5 per cent is the plaintiff's average mark-up. That process contains an error in mathematical logic. One should calculate the amount ($X) which, if marked up by 21.5 per cent, would produce $21,523.05; and then the loss of sales profit is that mark-up, namely $21,523.05, minus $X. According to my calculation $X is $17,714.77 and the loss of sales profit is $3,808.28. I propose to make orders on that basis.
 The plaintiff also seeks interest on the two components of its damages (loss of royalty and loss of profit on sale of materials) for the period from
March/April 1996 to 19 February 1999 and continuing. Interest was claimed in the amended Statement of Claim which is the current pleading. In my opinion there is a proper case for the award of interest under <case> of the [Supreme
Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), on the basis that the successful party ought ordinarily to be compensated for the loss of use of money of which it has been wrongly deprived by the defendant: Falkner versus Bourke [(1990) 19 NSWLR 574.] Interest should be applied at the rate set out in Sch J to the Supreme Court Rules.
It has not been contended that interest should be reduced by virtue of some such factor as a settlement offer.
 It seems to me that the plaintiff's calculation of interest which was handed up on 19 February 1999 was excessive because it assumes that the whole of the plaintiff's loss had accrued by the end of the first year of breach (that is by April 1996). At that stage only one year's loss of royalty and mark-up had occurred. The calculation must be revised to reflect that point and also (as explained above) the reduced capital figure for loss of mark-up.
 I propose to take the simple course of calculating interest on an annual basis rather than seeking to identify the point of time at which each royalty and mark-up payment would have accrued due and applying interest on the several amounts from each of those points of time. I do so in the interest of simplicity.
 In order to bring this case to a conclusion I have myself re-calculated the interest claim on an annual basis and in accordance with the principles outlined above in a total sum of $6,642.08. I shall annex my calculations to these reasons for judgment and I have handed down a copy to the representative of the plaintiff (the defendants not being represented before me today). In case either party wishes to take an issue about the method of calculation I propose to grant leave to apply. I must say that if an application is made with respect to interest it is unlikely that the successful party, if success occurs, will obtain an order for costs in view of the relatively small amounts involved.

Costs on the plaintiff's claim and the cross-claim In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to an order that its costs of the proceedings be paid by the first defendant. The plaintiff succeeded in establishing that the first defendant breached a valid contract and that it suffered loss in consequence of the breach. It is true the plaintiff also unsuccessfully claimed injunctive relief. I have no doubt that in terms of its economic significance, the claim for an injunction which would have substantially prevented the first defendant from pursuing his livelihood was a much more serious threat to the first defendant and that his success in resisting it was no small victory for him. But in my opinion that is not a sufficient basis for departing from the normal rule that costs should follow the event.
 The first defendant submits that as the plaintiff's damages are less than $75,000 the case falls within Pt 52A r 33(2)(e) of the Supreme Court
Rules. Therefore he says the plaintiff is not entitled to costs unless it appears to the Court that the plaintiff had sufficient reason for commencing or continuing the proceedings in the Court and the Court makes an order for payment. In my opinion that rule does not apply to proceedings in the Equity
Division having regard to r 33(1)(a). If it did I would take the view on balance that the plaintiff had sufficient reason to commence and continue the proceedings in this Court. Although the plaintiff has succeeded in proving its entitlement to only a relatively small amount of damages, it asserted a claim for damages which if proved would have yielded a substantially higher figure.
It also sought an injunction to enforce the restraint clause for a period of two years from the time of the hearing. Such a claim is an appropriate one for this Court.
 As to the fourth defendant's costs I propose to order that they be paid by the plaintiff. The fourth defendant was wholly successful in the proceedings and was not a party to the cross-claim. It is true that she and her husband were represented by the same counsel and solicitors at the hearing but I am not in a position to make any inferences as to how she and her husband contributed to any joint costs of representation. That may be a matter for the assessing officer to determine.
 The plaintiff has urged me to make a Bullock or Sanderson order having the effect that the fourth defendant's costs would be borne by the first defendant. Counsel relies on Lackersteen versus Jones (No 2) <case>; [(1988) 93 FLR 442]; Altamura versus Victorian Railways Commissioners <case>; [[1974] VR 33](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1974%5d%20VR%2033 "View LawCiteRecord" ) and Hall versus Wilson <case>; [[1954] VLR 576.] He relies on the following passage from the judgment of
O'Bryan J in the last mentioned case (at 577): `The plaintiff cannot tell, in advance, which of the defendants will be held to be legally responsible for his injuries, until all the evidence is heard, and it may well be that the defendants will contend against each other that the other is legally responsible. In such a case it is clearly reasonable for the plaintiff to join more than one defendant in his action, and the unsuccessful defendant can be rightly said to be the cause of the whole litigation either because of his conduct before action in not accepting sole responsibility or because his tortious conduct in the subject matter of the litigation was done in such circumstances as to make the joinder of the other defendant or defendants reasonable.' The key requirement for such an order is that at the commencement of the action it must have been reasonable for the plaintiff to join the first, second and fourth defendants as defendants. In my opinion this requirement is not satisfied in the present case. A difficulty in the present case is that the plaintiff amended its pleadings on several occasions, as outlined in my judgment of 21 October 1998. That behaviour could not be said to be reasonable even if steadfast adherence to a single pleading strategy could have been so described. Moreover, in this case the uncertainty as to the proper defendant arose out of uncertainty as to the identity of the contracting parties and the effect of the alleged "assignment". These were transactions to which the plaintiff was a party. The uncertainty was as much attributable to the plaintiff as to anyone and could have been avoided by clarity of thinking on its behalf. In other words the plaintiff itself contributed in no small measure to the difficulty which lead it to sue three defendants in circumstances where it was highly likely that it would lose against at least one of them. This is very different from a case in tort where the plaintiff is an involuntary victim seeking to establish vicarious as well as direct liability.
 In the alternative, the plaintiff submits that I should make no order for payment of the fourth defendant's costs, with the result that she must bear her costs herself. But I see no proper basis for doing so. The fourth defendant was successful in her basic submission that she was not a party to the franchise agreement on which the plaintiff sued.
 The plaintiff's third alternative is that I should make an order permitting the fourth defendant to recover from the plaintiff only the costs which are separately identifiable and attributable to her, so that the common defence costs of the defendants (which are presumably the bulk of the defendants' costs) would not be recoverable from the plaintiff.
 In my opinion there is no satisfactory basis for making such an order. The fourth defendant was successful in her defence and should be able to recover all her costs just as the plaintiff is entitled in my opinion to recover all its costs from the first defendant, even though many of its contentions failed. I might add that if it is determined that the fourth defendant's costs are approximately one half of the total costs of the defendants, so that under my orders the first defendant pays the whole of the plaintiff's costs and the fourth defendant recovers about half of the total defence costs from the plaintiff, then in my opinion the overall outcome will approximately reflect the relative success of the parties.
 In my opinion the position of the second defendant is quite different from the position of the fourth defendant. While a Bullock or Sanderson order is not appropriate for the reasons already given, it would not be fair to order the plaintiff to pay the second defendant's costs without qualification. The second defendant is a creature of the first and fourth defendants which no longer trades. The defendants submitted that the second defendant was liable under the franchise agreement and the second defendant therefore succeeded in spite of the submission made on its behalf. I do not regard it as appropriate that the second defendant's costs be recoverable from the plaintiff.
 I am concerned, however, that the effect of making no order for costs in favour of the second defendant may be that the plaintiff will be required to bear a smaller proportion of the overall defence costs than I regard as appropriate. If one third of common defence costs were allocated to the second defendant then the fourth defendant would be able to recover only one third of the common defence costs from the plaintiff rather than one half. My intention in making no order for costs in favour of the second defendant is only that the second defendant cannot recover from the plaintiff those costs which are separately identifiable as its costs. I propose to make my intentions clear by an appropriate direction in the orders which I shall make.
 As to the cross-claim, I see no reason for departing from the usual approach and so I propose to order that the cross-defendants' costs be borne by the cross-claimants, Mr Ward and Starcar.

Costs of application to amend defence to cross-claim In my judgment of 23 December 1998 I indicated that I was inclined to make no order for costs on that application with the result that each party would bear their own costs of that matter. Though counsel addressed me on this point on 19 February 1999 I believe the correct course is to follow this inclination. Whilst the cross-defendants' application succeeded it was made at an extremely late stage and in order to correct a mistake in the earlier pleadings. The cross-claimants were right to complain about the untimeliness of the application to amend. Although I decided that by allowing the amendment
I would not unduly prejudice them, they should not be required to bear the cross-defendants' costs of the application.

Orders On 19 February 1999 the plaintiff handed up draft short minutes of order. I have amended that document so that it reflects my reasons for judgment just delivered. I make the following orders:
Judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant on the Statement of
Claim in the sum of $27,511.28 together with interest thereon of $6,642.08.
Statement of Claim otherwise dismissed.
Cross-claim dismissed.
Order that the plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of its motion to restrain the enforcement of Santow J's costs order.
No order for costs of the application for leave to file a Further Amended
Defence to the Cross-claim, with intention that each party bear their own costs of that application.
Order that: the first defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the Statement of Claim; and the plaintiff pay the fourth defendant's costs of the Statement of Claim; and the cross-claimants pay the cross-defendants' costs of the cross-claim.
No order with respect to payment of the second defendant's costs of the
Statement of Claim and the Cross-claim.
Direct that all costs incurred by the defendants be treated as costs of the first and fourth defendants and not the second defendant, except to the extent that they are separately identified costs of the second defendant.
Grant liberty to any party to apply before me for re-calculation of interest ordered to be paid under Order 1, on 48 hours notice.
