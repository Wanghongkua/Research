EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
Mr Polin has tendered a copy of documents relating to the renewal of a workers compensation policy, issued by Allianz Australia Workers Compensation NSW Limited to the first defendant Park-Tec Engineering Pty Ltd in respect of the period from 4pm, 30 June 2003 to 4pm, 30 June 2004, during which period the plaintiff suffered his injury. 
Included amongst the tendered documents is a document headed "Renewal Declaration Form" and it describes the first defendant's business as including the manufacture of barbecues and heaters. In that form the first defendant declares it had a total annual wages bill, including employer contributions to superannuation, in the order of $3 million. From this no doubt it will be argued that a company that has no employees would have no need for a workers compensation policy, and that as workers compensation premiums are calculated on the past year's wages bill, subject to any expected variations, a wages bill of $3 million bespeaks a large workforce. 
In my judgment this is in no way covered by the previous ruling I have made in relation to individual wage records concerning the plaintiff and I admit the document as Exhibit 2D8.
