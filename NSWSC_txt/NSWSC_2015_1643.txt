EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: These proceedings were commenced by summons filed on 1 April 2015. On that day Campbell J made ex parte orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) , restraining the defendants from dealing with various assets in terms described in the orders.
Today the parties have approached the Court seeking a number of things: firstly, that leave be granted to amend the summons in terms filed in Court today, and secondly, that consent orders be made disposing of the proceedings in terms which the parties have also agreed.
Those orders provide for orders under [s 10B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html) of the Act in relation to reasonable legal expenses of the defendants agreed at $60,000; orders under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act for payment by the defendants to the Treasurer of the sum of $130,000 by way of a proceeds of assessment order; orders under [s 10B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html) as to sale of an interest in property of the defendants at Green Valley, the proceeds of which are to be applied in satisfaction of the proceeds assessment order, as well as for interest in accordance with [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) . The proposed orders also contain a number of notations, including as to costs.
Having regard to the circumstances in which the proceedings were commenced and orders were earlier made by the Court and what the parties have now agreed in order to finalise the proceedings, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's discretion be exercised to give effect to the agreement the parties have reached, by making further orders in terms which the parties have agreed.
For those reasons, I grant leave to amend the summons in terms agreed, and make the consent orders in terms filed, which I shall mark MFI 1.
