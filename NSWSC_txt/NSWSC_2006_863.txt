JUDGMENT  
Introduction  This matter was heard immediately following Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal
Land Council versus CKT Developments Pty Ltd & Anor <case> and these reasons should be read in conjunction with the reasons in that matter and in the prior matter involving Sanpine, Koompahtoo Local Aboriginal
Land Council versus KLALC Property & Investment Pty Ltd & Anor <case>  This matter concerned lot 11 in Fennel Bay, New South Wales. The Council acquired the land under the [Aboriginal Land Rights Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html)  Like the Sanpine matter, this matter involved a transfer of the land to the
Trustee. Unlike the Sanpine matter the transfer to the Trustee and its mortgage to LKM were not registered as the Registrar-General of New South
Wales placed a caveat over lot 11 in respect of all dealings with the land.
Like the CKT matter, this matter involved the question whether the Council authorised the transfer of lot 11 to the Trustee.  In April 2002, the Trustee entered into a joint venture agreement with
Paramount Land Pty Ltd for the development of lot 11. In the same month, the
Council transferred lot 11 to the Trustee. On 4 April 2002, the secretary of the Council issued a certificate with respect to lot 11 in identical terms to the certificate in the Sanpine matter. Thereafter, the Trustee granted a mortgage to LKM over lot 11 as security for a loan of $295,000. A loan agreement was made between LKM as lender and the Trustee and Paramount as borrowers.  The transfer and mortgage were lodged for registration but the Registrar-
General issued a requisition in respect of the transfer. Documents were not provided to LKM to satisfy the Registrar-General's requisition and on 13
December 2002 the Registrar-General rejected the transfer and the mortgage and lodged his caveat.  On 30 June 2003, the Council by its administrator lodged a caveat over lot and on 22 October 2003 LKM lodged a caveat.  The advances made under the loan agreement were repayable on 17 April 2003.
No amount was repaid on that date or since. LKM obtained judgment in these proceedings in the amount of $94,720.95 against Paramount and against the
Trustee. The judgments remain unsatisfied.  The issues are the same as those in the Sanpine matter and in the CKT matter.  
Conclusion  For the reasons set out in the Sanpine matter and, so far as authority to transfer lot 11 is concerned, in the CKT matter, the Council is not entitled to any relief in terms of its statement of claim which should be dismissed.  Under LKM's first cross claim it is not entitled to judgment in any sum against the Council. It is entitled to an order that the Council withdraw its caveat over lot 11. I will hear further arguments as to whether there should be judgment for possession against the Trustee and an order for judicial sale.
As against the Registrar-General, LKM is entitled to an order that he withdraw his caveat over lot 11. In other respects the cross claim should be dismissed.  LKM's second cross claim should be dismissed as should Paramount's third cross claim.  I will hear the parties on the terms of appropriate orders and I will hear the parties on costs. I direct the parties to bring in short minutes orders reflecting these reasons.
