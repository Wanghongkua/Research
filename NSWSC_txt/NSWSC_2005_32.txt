OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
HAMILTON J  
FRIDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2005  /05 ANTHONY GREGORY McGRATH & ORS versus HENRY WALKER ELTIN GROUP LTD (Administrators Appointed)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the CA"). It arises in circumstances where administrators were recently appointed to a group of companies and then resigned, necessitating the appointment of replacement administrators under [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s449c.html) of the CA.  Mr Oakes SC for the plaintiffs, the new administrators, submits that the course of events that has occurred means that there are two overlapping obligations in force as to meetings, one under [s
E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s436e.html) and one under [s
C(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s449c.html) of the CA. This is probably correct and certainly there is a clear argument that it is correct.  In those circumstances the plaintiffs ask for orders under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the CA that will justify meetings to meet the requirements of both sections be held next Tuesday, 8 February 2005, and that those meetings may be held concurrently, so that the statutory agenda stipulated for each may be dealt with at the same time.  This seems to me an entirely reasonable course. The orders prayed for in the originating process appear fit to achieve this result and I propose to make orders in terms of the appropriate prayers.
