Silkdale Pty Ltd versus Long Leys Co Pty Ltd Matter No 15819/90 [1995] NSWSC 9 (25 August 1995) ` 
Silkdale Pty Ltd versus Long Leys Co Pty Ltd` ` 15819/90` `25 August 1995` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division` /90 - SILKDALE PTY LTD V LONG LEYS CO PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Silkdale Pty Ltd ("Silkdale"), commenced these proceedings on 8 October 1990 by filing a statement of claim seeking ejectment. The statement of claim was amended on 22 May 1995. 
It is admitted on the pleadings that the defendant is the registered proprietor of land near Corowa, which by mortgages V48161 and T457338 was mortgaged to the State Bank of NSW. The mortgages incorporated memorandum
S709315 which is the Bank's standard memorandum of conditions which is filed with the Registrar General pursuant to <case> of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/). The plaintiff claims and I am satisfied that it is the case, that by transfer of mortgage dated 30 July 1990, the mortgages were duly transferred to the plaintiff and the transfer was duly registered Z193060.

On 14 February 1991, Master McLaughlin directed entry of judgment for the plaintiff for possession of the land after motion for judgment had been made by the plaintiff. The defendant appealed to a Judge against this decision and on 3 October 1991, the appeal was heard by Sully, J. His Honour gave a reserved judgment on 10 October 1991, dismissing the appeal. The defendant then appealed to the Court of Appeal which heard the appeal on 19 November and delivered judgment on 19 December 1991, allowing the appeal and setting aside the orders of Master McLaughlin and Sully, J and dismissing the notice of motion for summary judgment. The matter then went back into the ordinary list to await trial.

The matter did not proceed with any particular speed: I do not need to say why. However, on 16 February 1995, Hulme, J held that the [Farm Debt Mediation
Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) did not preclude the continuation of these proceedings by the plaintiff.

In May 1995, Sperling, J gave leave to the plaintiff to amend, but refused an adjournment of the trial which came on before me on 25 May 1995.

It is first necessary to give a summary of the background facts which are not in dispute.

The two mortgages in question are over a property known as "Kerwyn" which is a farm property and had the Act been in force at the relevant time, as at 30
July 1990, each of the mortgages was a farm mortgage as defined in the [Farm
Debt Mediation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/).

The plaintiff is an investor. It had the idea that it would be a good investment to purchase a mortgage, hopefully at a discount, and then obtain from the mortgagor the amount of its debt in full. The underlying strategy is that usually a bona fide purchaser of a mortgage at an undervalue is entitled to the right to be paid the full amount of the debt by the mortgagor, Davis v
Barrett <case>; [(1851) 14 Beav 542]; [51 ER 394] and see Fisher and Lightwood on Mortgages, Australian
Edition, [39.16].

The plaintiff admits that at the time of the transfer of the mortgages, it was aware that the defendant alleged that the transferor was liable in damages to the defendant and the plaintiff also admits that it had the opportunity to look at the State Bank documentation. The defendant says that the plaintiff thus took its interest in the land with notice of the position of the defendant vis a vis the Bank.

On 21 October 1985, the State Bank of NSW made a demand on the defendant under s 57(2)(b) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/). This notice,
Exhibit PX 04, appears to have been served about 30 October 1985. It would not seem that any action followed this notice. Mr Kerr, the principal of the defendant, gave evidence that in early 1985, he was seeking to refinance, but the local State Bank representative said that Head Office was putting pressure on him, but he would see if he could get more time out of Head Office. The
Bank statements show that the account was virtually frozen as at August 1985.
In November 1985, there is a note by the local manager of the State Bank that the defendant was seeking to rearrange refinancing and that the Bank was prepared to wait for a little longer, but on 26 February 1987, the Bank's solicitor wrote to the defendant indicating that it wished it to quit the property. However, the local press then evidently took up the defendant's cause and the chief manager wrote to the regional manager on 10 March 1987 that there was no advantage to the Bank in gaining widespread publicity, especially as the media had the habit of printing only half-truths and it would be best if the Bank trod carefully, with all public utterances coming from its chief information officer.

A statement of claim was filed by the defendant and Mr Kerr on 7 July 1987 out of this Court against the State Bank. The statement of claim was struck out on September 1987 and the Bank's note was "Assuming we were to proceed with sale action, it is important to consider the implications particularly adverse publicity and media involvement. ... The improvement in the rural economic climate, particularly the booming wool industry, has taken the focus away from the plight of some farmers. Favourable season, reduced interest rates and an improved market are other factors conducive to taking sale action.
 "On the other hand we should expect severe opposition from Kerr, and from past indications, media involvement. We should be prepared for this and accordingly have our strategy organised in terms of action and media statements etc." The senior officer of the Bank remarked on this submission that despite the probability that Mr Kerr would involve the media and attract the attention of "militant farmer action groups", it would be best for all concerned to proceed with the proposed action. This note is made on 8 October 1987.

In 1990, the Bank recorded that all its efforts had failed to reach a "consultative settlement" with the defendant, that the defendant was a member of a group called "Bankwatch" which was causing the Bank problems, and that the second mortgagee had offered to "sell him up and we gave them priority so they would - but a further 12 months have elapsed during which nothing happened." The Bank then recorded that they had the opportunity of selling the mortgage to Silkdale and that was the best way out for them. The Bank then lent the plaintiff money so that the plaintiff could buy the Bank's mortgage.

The matters that have been raised in the reasons so far were not matters which had been previously considered by the Judges and Master who had dealt with interlocutory aspects of this case. However, it is now necessary to move into the area which has been previously considered in interlocutory proceedings, that is the status of the plaintiff to give the 1990 notice and whether the notice constituted a valid demand.

The transfer of mortgage is dated 30 July 1990. However, it was not registered until 17 September 1990. The plaintiff's demand was made on 17 August 1990.

It is convenient to refer to the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the interlocutory stage of these proceedings by reference to the report under the name Long Leys Co Pty Ltd versus Silkdale Pty Ltd (1991) 5 BPR 11,512. The argument is summed up by Sheller, JA at p 11,517, viz: "It was submitted that an equitable assignee of a debt cannot make an effective demand for payment.
No express notice in writing of assignment of the debt had been given to the appellant. Accordingly, it was said, any demand made by the respondent, having, before registration of the transfer on 17 September 1990, only an equitable interest, was ineffective." His Honour, with whom Priestley and
Meagher, JJA, agreed, considered at 11,518 that the reasoning in Warner Bros
Records Inc versus Rollgreen Ltd [[1976] QB 430], suggests that the demand was ineffective and thus there was, at the very least, a triable issue.

The statement of claim as originally framed did not rely on the 1985 notice.
Reliance was added by paragraph 3A to the statement of claim in May 1995.

As these are proceedings in ejectment, the question for the Court is, who had the better right to possession as at 8 October 1990, the plaintiff or the defendant? 
To answer this question, one has to look at a series of subsidiary questions, viz:- 
A. Is necessary for a plaionitff to give a proper notice under <case> (2)(b) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) before seeking ejectment? 
B. Was it necessary for the plaintiff or its predecessor in title to make a demand before seeking possession? 
C. If the answer to B is "yes", was the 1985 demand valid and sufficient? 
D. Is the plaintiff barred by the [Limitation Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) from relying on the 1985 Notice? 
E. Was it competent for the plaintiff to make a demand in August, 1990? 
F. If it was not otherwise competent for the plaintiff to give a demand in
August, 1990, did the registration of the plaintiff as proprietor of the mortgage in September, 1990, remedy the problem? 
G. Did the August, 1990 demand waive the 1985 demand? 
H. Was the 1990 demand effective? 
I. Is the certificate PX05 sufficient evidence of the amount due? 
J Is it necessary for a plaintiff to re-enter land physically before bringing ejectment pursuant to <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/)? 
K. Does the [Farm Debt Mediation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) affect the plaintiff's right to possession? 
L What is the result? 
I will deal with each of these matters in turn.

A. When this present case was in the Court of Appeal, Sheller, JA said at 5
BPR 11517, that it was not clear why the plaintiff pleaded the giving of the notice <case> a notice was only necessary before sale, not taking proceedings in ejectment, unless it was necessary for the mortgagee to rely on an acceleration clause, vide ss 57(5) and Turnbull versus National Mutual Royal
Bank Ltd [(1991) 26 NSWLR 361.] 
Mr. Duncan has respectively submitted that that observation was per incuriam and should not be accepted as the law. He also submitted that the passage in
Fisher & Lightwood on Mortgages, Australian edition which relied on it misstated the law.

Mr Duncan pointed to <case> of the South Australian [Law of Property Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/). This section prescibes that "(1) A right of sale or foreclosure in respect of mortgaged land, a right to enter into possession of mortgaged land or a right to appoint a receiver in respect of mortgaged land shall not be enforceable by the mortgagee under a mortgage... by action or otherwise unless- (a) the mortgagee has served upon the mortgagor a notice in writing...". It is abundantly clear that failure to comply with [s a](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s55a.html) is a valid defence to ejectment proceedings in South Australia, see Lamshed v
Plakakis [(1988) 47 SASR 316]; Wombat
Nominees Pty Ltd versus De Tullio [(1990) 98 ALR 307] and
National Australia Bank Ltd versus Zollo [(1992) 59 SASR 76.] Mr Duncan says the same result applies in NSW.

I reject this submission for a number of reasons.

First, in my view the words of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s57.html) on the one hand and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s60.html) on the other are clear and unambiguous. [S ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s57.html) providing for a notice expressly refers to the powers in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s58.html), ie the power of sale. It does not refer to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s60.html) which is a discrete power which is expressed in clear terms, see Zanzoul v
Wespac Banking Corp NSWCA 14.6.1995 unreported. Mr Duncan argues that
Zanzoul's case was wrongly decided. Whilst it is clear that I must follow it, Mr Duncan made it clear that he wished to atatck it in the Court of Appeal or High Court should the present case go on appeal. He pointed out that if correct it leads to absurd situations where a subsequent mortgagee can have ejectment without notifying a prior mortgagee. It is also absurd, he submits that one mortgagee might give a notice under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s57.html) (b) preparatory to sale and another give no notice and obtain ejectment whilst the first notice was still being dealt with between mortgagor and first mortgagee. There are other problems with Zanzoul's case including the apparent nomn-applicability of the defence of the ius tertii in the one situation where ejectment is taken by a second or subsequent mortgagee, see
Australian and new Zealand Banking Group Ltd versus Comer (1993) 5 BPR 11748,
However, despite the fact that Zanzoul is an ex tempore decision and these criticisms, it is my duty to apply it. I have merely stated these arguments to protect Mr Duncan in any appeal.

The second reason is that the court and the textwriters have always proceded on the view that there is no need to give a notice under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/lopa1936198/s57.html) . Apart from this case in the Court of Appeal and Zanzoul's case, in
Turnbull's case the Court of Appeal held that a document which is invalid as a statutory notice prior to sale may nonetheless be a valid demand.

Thirdly, Tadgell,J in the Supreme Court of Victoris reached the same position.
In Commonwealth Bank of Australia versus Jackson [(1992) V Conv R 54-447],
His Honour upbraided counsel for making a simple case difficult by unnecesarily dealing with possible defects in a statutory notice in ejectment proceedings.

Fourthly, Sykes & Walker on Securities 5th ed p 139 concludes an examination of the various State Acts limiting mortgagees' rights except after notice by adverting to the fact that the South Australian Act "is more far- reaching in point of depth." 
B. Under the general law system of land title, the legal mortgagee was the proprietor of the legal fee simple in the mortgaged land and thus was entitled to possession independently of default, Four-Maids Ltd versus Marshall
Ltd [[1957] Ch 317], 320. In England it is said that there is a proviso where the mortgagee has contracted not to exercise that right except on the happening of certain specified events. However, there is a line of authority which draws the distinction between a mortgagee who has covenanted not to disturb the mortgagor's possession and one who has virtually sub-demised a leasehold term to the mortgagor. In the first case, the older authorities permit the mortgagee to commence ejectment straight away because he has a right to possession, but in the second case the lease must first be terminated by re-entry.

Cole on Ejectment (Sweet, London, 1857) deals with the matter at pp 462 and following. The learned author's view, which is supported by copious authority, is that even before default a common law mortgagee may have ejectment unless there has been an attornment by the mortgagor and the term of the attornment has not expired. It will not be sufficient to protect the mortgagor that the mortgagee covenants that the mortgagor might remain in possession, or that the mortgagor might remain in possession for an uncertain period. These provisions merely vest contractual rights in the mortgagor and do not operate to prevent the mortgagee from having a right of entry inherent in the mortgagee's estate; see for instance Doe d Parsley versus Day [(1842) 2 QB 148]; [114 ER 58], 62;
Gale versus Burrell <case>; [(1845) QB 850](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281845%29%207%20QB%20850 "View LawCiteRecord" ); Doe d Roylance versus Lightfoot (1841) 8 M & W 553, 564-5; <case>; [151 ER ], 1163;
Connolly versus Ryan <case>; [(1922) 30 CLR 498], 505 and 506; see also Partridge versus McIntosh & Sons Ltd <case>; [(1933) 49 CLR 453], 464. One problem about these citations is that they all depend on the doctrine of inter esse termini which was abolished in 1930 by <case> of the Conveyancing Act. This does not appear to be a fatal objection because s
A also abolished the need for having such an artificial interest by making terms of leases capable of taking effect at law or in equity without actual entry.

In the instant case there is no attornment on the mortgagor as tenant of the mortgagee, nor is there any demise for a fixed term. Accordingly, the mortgagor's only right is to seek an injunction to prevent the mortgagee from disturbing its quiet possession under the covenant. However, that injunction will only be granted provided that the mortgagor does equity, that is, seeks to comply with the mortgage so far as remains for it to be complied with on the mortgagor's part. In the instant case, the mortgagor has not paid any interest to the mortgagee since 1988. The mortgagor is thus not in a position to seek an injunction, so that the mortgagee would be entitled to commence proceedings in ejectment without any prior demand.

The mortgage in the instant case is not under the general law title, but under the Torrens system. Does this make any difference? [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s60.html) of the [Real Property Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) gives a mortgagee of land under the Torrens system, upon default in payment of the principal sum or any part thereof, or of any interest secured thereby, the same right to bring proceedings for ejectment as the mortgagee would have had if he had a conveyance of the legal estate.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s60.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) enables a
Torrens System mortgagee to bring proceedings in the Supreme Court for possession of land in the same manner in which he might have brought such proceedings if the principal sum were secured to him by a conveyance of the legal estate.

It will be noted that the statutory right given to the Torrens system mortgagee is a lesser right than that which a mortgagee had under the general law as set out in the Four-Maids case. Under the statute, the mortgagee's right to possession only arises on default. Thus, in New Zealand in Southpac
Custodians Ltd versus Bank of New Zealand [[1993] 1 NZLR 663], the Court of Appeal at page 666 declined to follow the Four-Maids case, M Hardie-Boys,
J saying, "In New Zealand a mortgagee obtains not the legal estate but a charge over it... His right to possession derives not from ownership but from contract or statute." 
The effect that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s60.html) has on the right to seek ejectment is illustrated by Zanzoul's case where the
Court of Appeal held that the statutory right to pursue ejectment is given to a second mortgagee and the right of the mortgagor to plead the ius tertii is taken away.

Thus, in my view, the plaintiff cannot rely on the authorities cited in Cole or the High Court cases which are in the same line, but must establish a default.

Accordingly, I must now turn to the question as to whether there has been a default.

Mr Gray, for the mortgagee, submits that the question of default is not a difficult one at all. He says the evidence plainly shows that the mortgagor has paid no interest for ten years and that there is conclusive evidence that it is in default under the covenant to repay the principal.

Clause Thirdly of the mortgage is as follows:- "The Mortgagor will pay to the Bank Interest on the moneys hereby secured at the rate or rates agreed upon from time to time and in default of such agreement as decided by the Bank from time to time." 
The evidence shows that the defendant has not paid interest since about 1985.
Mr Duncan, who appeared for the defendant, said that up until the assignment of the mortgage to the plaintiff, there had been no default in the payment of interest because the Bank had capitalised it as shown in the Bank statements
Ex DX 11. I will assume this to be so. However, from the time of the assignment particularly from the date of registration of the assignment until the commencement of these proceedings on 8 October 1990, there was no payment of interest nor any capitalisation. I cannot see any reason why this was not a default in payment of "any interest... secured by any mortgage" within the meaning of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s60.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). Thus, the statutory right to ejectment existed as at 8 October, 1990.

C. It is really unnecessary to discuss most of the other matters raised in argument, but, as they have been exhaustively argued, I will do so.

Mr Duncan submitted that the 1985 notice PX 04 was bad for a number of reasons, or, if good, the notice had been waived. His submissions may be summarised as follows:- 
There was no right to demand what was demanded in October 1985.

There is no evidence that the amount which was said then to be due was due.

There is a misstatement of the amount due in the notice; and 
There was an election to abandon the notice by charging fresh interest and otherwise by its conduct.

Clause 19 of memorandum S709315 is as follows:- "19. In case of default in the performance or observance of the covenants and conditions herein contained or any of them the moneys hereby secured shall at the option of the 
Bank immediately become due and payable.

The submission is that there was no prior demand or indication to the mortgagor that prior to the issuing of the notice purporting to be under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), that the
Bank had exercised its election pursuant to a default to make the moneys due and payable. Accordingly, so the argument goes, the notice falsely said that the moneys which were listed were "now due and unpaid". The reasoning behind this proposition can be drawn by analogy from cases such as Bunbury Foods Pty
Ltd versus National Bank of Australasia Ltd <case>; [(1984) 153 CLR 491.] It was reasoning that was accepted by O'Loughlin, J in State
Bank of South Australia versus Jeltes [(1988) 49 SASR 307.] 
Mr Gray puts that there is no necessity for there to be two demands. He says that the demand made in the [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) notice itself was a demand under the mortgage and the service of the notice had two effects, (1) to make the debt actually due and payable; and (2) to demand that unless the default be remedied, the Bank could proceed to sale.

In my view Mr Duncan's submission is correct. A notice under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) cannot be given until there has been a default. The notice must then specify the default which has occurred and then it gives the mortgagor the prescribed time to remedy and nullify the default; see Websdale versus S & JD Investments
Pty Ltd [(1991) 24 NSWLR 573] especially at 577.

Mr Duncan points out that it was open to the plaintiff or to the Bank to call evidence as to what amount was due and owing as at October 1985, yet there is no evidence at all on this point. Accordingly I should not infer that the amount allegedly due was in fact due.

However, the evidence of the Bank's statements is that the amount referred to in the notice was the amount currently debited to the defendant by the Bank, the defendant has never put in issue the amount and indeed, when it did take action against the Bank, it sued it for damages rather than challenge the amount. Accordingly I do not consider there is any merit on this point.

Any misstatement of the amount would seem to fall into the same category as that dealt with under heading (2).

I will deal with this matter in Section G.

Of course, the problem is not whether PX 04 is a valid notice under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), because the plaintiff is not seeking to sell, but rather merely to obtain possession.
The vital question is thus, whether that notice amounts to a demand. The notice is headed that it is a notice pursuant to [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). That notice is to be given after a default has been made. The format of the notice shows that it was intended to comply with [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) as to form. Can such a notice amount either to a demand under clause fourthly of the mortgage which provides that "the Mortgagor will upon demand... pay to the
Bank the moneys hereby secured....or an exercise of option under clause 19 of memorandum S709315? 
Whilst it may well be that under clause 19 the Bank can notify its option by showing that it has absolutely determined to call up the moneys, it can only do so if some default is proved prior to the exercise of the option. No-one from the Bank gave evidence of any such default and I do not think that I should assume it. Accordingly, I do not need to spend further time considering clause 19.

As far as clause fourthly in the mortgage is concerned, the question is whether there has been a demand? 
I have already referred to Turnbull versus National Mutual Royal Bank where the
Court of Appeal held that an invalid notice under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) may, nonetheless, be a valid demand, (see p 370). In that case, the court held that the notice clearly demonstrated that the creditor was demanding that the monies detailed in the notice be paid.

Accordingly, I must consider the actual form of the notice Exhibit PX 04. The notice commences with the words, "The STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES hereby requires payment to it...of the undermentioned moneys now due and unpaid..." .
The "undermentioned moneys" include "Costs of preparing and serving the notice". Whilst it could be argued that this is a demand for a total sum including future liabilities rather than a demand of the moneys secured under the mortgage, I consider the better view is that it is a demand for the principal and interest as well as the costs. Accordingly in my view the notice does operate as a demand under the mortgage.

D. Mr Duncan submits that by the time the amendment was made to the Statement of Claim to rely on the 1985 notice was made more than six years after the notice was given. If the right to possession or sale vested then, by [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s27.html) &
[64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s64.html) of the [Limitation Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/), the right to recover the land was extinguished in 1991.

An amendment takes effect from the date of the original pleading, Baldry v
Jackson [[1976] 2 NSWLR 415], 419. The present proceedings are to try who had the better right to possession as at 8
October, 1990. As at that datre, any right flowing from the 1985 notice had not become statute barred. Accordingly, I do not consider that this point assists the defendant.

E. Mr Duncan strongly relied on what had been said in the Court of Appeal.
Whilst this submission is understandable and the decision was given by a very strong bench, it must be remembered, as Giles, J pointed out in Showa Shoji
Australia Pty Ltd versus Oceanic Life Ltd [(1994) 34 NSWLR 548], 559, the decision was merely that there was a triable issue and does not bind a single
Judge to hold that an equitable assignee of a mortgage cannot give a demand for repayment.

The attack that Mr Gray made on this aspect of the case was rather a collateral one. It is convenient, however, first to deal with the general proposition put by the submission summarised by Sheller, JA. Since that judgment, the position has been closely analysed by Giles, J in the Showa case. There his Honour analysed the various judgments in the Warner Bros case referred to earlier, and found all three judgments to be wanting as a matter of absolute logic. However, his Honour said at p 561, that notwithstanding difficulties in the various possible analyses of the problem, "While an assignment at law substitutes the assignee for the assignor as contracting party with the opposite party, an equitable assignment operates between the assignor and assignee." Thus, the general proposition found in
Sheller, JA's judgment represents the law. See also Meagher Gummow and Lehane,
Equity Doctrines and Remedies, 3rd Ed <case>; [(1990) 71 NTR 1.] 
Mr Gray's main attack was to analyse what occurs on a transfer under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) and [52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). These provide that upon the registration of a transfer of a registered interest, the assignee has the same rights as if it had been named in the original instrument as mortgagee. As at 8 October 1990, when the proceedings were commenced, Mr Gray says that his client was a registered transferee of a mortgage and is entitled to rely on [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) and [52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) as curing any problem that there might have been under the general law. Implicit in the submission is that there is at least some retroactivity in the registration.

It does not seem to me that the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) supports that submission. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s41.html) makes it clear that until registration no dealing is effectual at law to pass any estate or interest under the Act and there is nothing in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) or [s 52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) which would affect the matter.

It has been accepted for virtually the whole history of the Torrens System, that an unregistered transfer can have no effect on a registered interest in land under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) until registered, but may have effect as an equitable assignment or may have effect because of an estoppel; see Barry versus Heider <case>; [(1914) 19 CLR 197.] 
Mr Duncan raised an allied matter. He said that there has never been any notice given to the debtor of the assignment of the mortgage. He says that s of the Conveyancing Act applies so that there is no assignment at law until notice has been given. He put that the case is anagagous to the situation I considered in Scarel versus City Loan & Credit Corp Pty Ltd (1986) 4 BPR .

Mr Gray's answer to this submission is that [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) &
[52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) are the applicable provisions and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s12.html) has no relevance. Mr Duncan puts that, if this is so, it is strange that there is no provision for notifying the mortgagor who might in ignorance of what has occurred innocently pay the assignor. However the answer to this submission is that in such circumstances the mortgagor may still pay the assignor with safety, Nioa versus Bell <case>; [(1901) 27 VLR 82.] This rule also answers Mr Duncan's other submission said to rely on Gilmour versus Pyramid Building Society NSWCA 24.2.1995 unreported.that if a mortgagor does not know who to pay, it cannot be in default of making payment. I thus uphold Mr Gray's submissions on this aspect of the case.

F. Mr. Gray submits that when the transfer of mortgage was registered, the
Bank's interest passed to the plaintiff by virtue of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) and [52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) and this included the right to sue. The acquisition of the legal title fed what had gone before.

Mr Gray's proposition was really that when there is registration, a situation occurs equivalent to feeding the estoppel at common law. He illustrated with respect to the [Sale of Goods
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/soga128/) cases such as
Lucas versus Smith <case>; [[1926] VLR 400] and Butterworth versus Kingsway Motors [[1954] 1 WLR .]
As Mr Gray pointed out, the principle extends beyond such cases into the area of landlord and tenant and mortgages. Thus in Lee versus Ferno Holdings Pty Ltd [(1993) 33 NSWLR 404], where a purported sub-lease containing an option for renewal originally took effect as an assignment because the term of the sub-lease exceeded the term of the head lease and the head lease was later renewed, the belated renewal confirmed the sub-lease in equity and the sub-lessee can exercise the option. The general principle was laid down in that case at p 412 following Smith versus Osborne <case>; [(1857) 6 HLC 375], 390; <case>; [10
ER 1340], 1347, "The doctrine of a Court of Chancery is, that if a man contracts to convey, or to mortgage, or to settle an estate, and he is not at the time of his contract entitled to the estate, but he afterwards acquires such a title as enables him to perform his contract, he shall be bound to do so ... ". See also Jones v
Kearney [(1842) 1 Dr & War 134], -160.

Thus expressed, the principle is only one of equity. If the plaintiff's right is no greater than an equitable right, then it would have no status to make the demand.

However, there is some respectable authority which suggests that the principle is a principle of law. Thus in Lucas versus Smith, Dixon AJ, as Sir Owen Dixon then was, applied the principle (though he rejected its application in the particular case), to a purely common law matter being a review of a small debts claim for sale of goods. Dixon, AJ relied on the Privy Council in
Rajapakse versus Fernando [[1920] AC 892], which, although applying Roman Dutch Law from Ceylon, seems to suggest that legal titles can be created by the doctrine. After all, what often occurs is that there has been a grant by deed of a lease for 30 years, but the grantor only had at the time of the demise a term for 25 years. There is a lease which on the face of it is for 30 years and the landlord will be estopped from denying his own deed. Of course, if some third party steps in who has a better title to the landlord, that third party may get possession as against the tenant, and the estoppel will only mean that the tenant can sue the landlord at law for damages. Indeed, even if the landlord had no title at all, he would still be estopped from denying his title to lease if he had by deed purported to grant an interest to the tenant.

However, the important thing to realise about these estoppels is that they operate only between the assignor and assignee. They do not have any effect on third parties unless, of course, the third party is, by his or her own conduct, estopped as well. I cannot see how this doctrine can avail the plaintiff because the doctrine only operates between the assignor and assignee and not as against the mortgagor. The doctrine does not operate to give retrospective effect to the registered assignment. Thus any operation at law of the doctrine of feeding the estoppel is not relevant in the instant case.

Accordingly, the plaintiff was not entitled to give a demand on 17 August .

G. I now pass to the question as to whether the 1985 notice was waived by the present plaintiff by the giving of the 1990 notice.

Mr Duncan submits that after the notice of 1985 was given, the Bank continued to charge interest and to capitalise the interest. He says that this amounted to an election not to rely on the notice. However, this very point was decided adversely to this contention by Powell, J in Sibard Pty Ltd versus AGC (Advances)
Ltd (1992) 6 BPR 13,178.

One then has to look at the whole of the conduct between the Bank and Mr Kerr or the defendant from 1985 until 30 June 1990. The question is whether the long delay in taking action on the 1985 notice must have given Mr Kerr the impression that the Bank had waived its rights under the notice.

There are a series of propositions in various textbooks based on Doe d
Brierly versus Palmer <case>; [(1812) 16 East 53]; [104 ER 1009], to the effect that generally speaking, a second notice is a waiver of the first. So far as landlord and tenant law was concerned, this proposition was virtually exploded by Denning, J in Lowenthal versus Vanhoute [[1947] KB 342.] It is, however, still adopted as a general proposition for notices to complete by Lindgren in his book "Time in the Performance of
Contracts" 2nd Edition (Butterworths 1982) [634]. It seems to me that it is probably dangerous to adopt any such general proposition, and that one has to look in each case to see whether all the facts and circumstances, including the giving of the second notice, should be held as a matter of fact to be waiver. This is consistent with the authorities which clearly say that where, in the case of a notice to quit, a landlord, or in the case of a notice to complete, a vendor, considers there are some problems with the first notice and gives a second notice on a "without prejudice" basis, the first notice remains in force. The second notice cannot amount to a waiver of the first; see as to tenancy, Allam & Co Ltd versus Europa Poster Services Ltd [[1968] 1
WLR 639](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1968%5d%201%20WLR%20639 "View LawCiteRecord" ), and as to notices to complete, Lohar Corp Pty Ltd versus Dibu Pty Ltd (1976) 1
BPR 9177. That the position is far more complicated is illustrated by such authorities as George versus Hille [[1946] VR 427.] 
Once a demand is made which makes the principal due and payable, or once a notice has been given under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/soga128/s57.html) of the Real property Act, the rights of the parties change. The parties cannot be put back to their former position by mere withdrawal of the notice,
Stanley versus Wilde [[1899] 1 Ch 747.] Thus, unless there is conduct on the part of the mortgagee which shows that the mortgagee does not intend to rely on any breach contained in the notice or acquiescence by both parties in resuming their former positions, the notice will continue to govern the parties' relationship, Martin versus Suncorp Finance Ltd [(1987) 8
NSWLR 325], 336.

In the instant case, I would find as a fact that the plaintiff knew before it issued its 1990 notice, that the earlier notice had been given. This was quite apparent on the Bank file, the plaintiff had its solicitor investigate the file and I have no doubt at all that this fact would have been brought to its attention. However, notwithstanding this, it seems to me that the mere giving of the second notice in the light of the surrounding circumstances of the difficulty that Mr Kerr was perceived to be creating, would not amount to a waiver of the first notice.

As appears from the history I have given from the Bank's files, the Bank was wary about taking possession because of commercial and political repercussions. It, however, never communicated these fears to Mr Kerr and indeed, although the fears were expressed in internal memoranda amongst the
Bank's officers, the Bank as at early 1989, had agreed that the course which it should adopt was to proceed for possession. It thought that getting the second mortgagee to take the action would be preferable, but it never communicated this feeling to Mr Kerr. In 1990, it had decided to continue on with obtaining possession, and it was only then that serendipity occurred and the plaintiff came on the scene to buy out the mortgage.

There seems no doubt that in an appropriate case, long delay in enforcing one's rights under a notice may amount to waiver. However, it must be remembered that the law requires that waiver must be clear and unequivocal and that the other party must have altered his position in reliance on it, or at least acted on it, Chitty on Contracts, 25 the Ed para 1500. There is no suggestion here that Mr Kerr or the defendant in any way made any assumption as to the Bank's conduct setting at nought the notice that it had given in
Accordingly it does not seem to me that I can find that the Bank waived its rights up to 30 June 1990.

H. For the reasons given in Sections B and C, if a demand was necessary, the demand was effective, but not the 1990 demand.

I. Exhibit PX 05 is a certificate given by Mr Austwick who was the controlling officer of the plaintiff. This certificate was tendered on the basis that it was in accordance with clause 20 of memorandum S709315. That clause is as follows "20. A statement in writing signed by any duly authorised officer of the Bank of the amount due or owing or secured by this Mortgage at the date mentioned in such statement shall be and be accepted as absolutely final and conclusive and binding upon the Mortgagor who shall not be entitled to make any objection thereto and such statement shall be prima facie evidence that such amount is due or owing or secured." 
The certificate that is required under the memorandum was a certificate by an authorised officer of the Bank. It is quite clear that [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) and [52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) only deal with the rights, powers, privileges, debts and sums of money affecting the mortgage transaction: Consolidated Trust Co Ltd versus Naylor <case>; [(1936) 55 CLR 423], 435. The sections do not operate, for instance, to give the transferee the right to sue a surety on a covenant of guarantee contained in an instrument of mortgage. The statutory transfer only operates on those terms or conditions which delimit or quantify the estate or interest or are otherwise necessary to assure the estate or interest to the registered proprietor: [PT
Ltd](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/index.html#p50td) v Maradona Pty Ltd [(1992) 25 NSWLR 643], 679. The statutory transfer does not operate to substitute the controller of the present plaintiff for an officer of the Bank as the person who can give the requisite certificate. I do not think anything in Measures versus McFadyen <case>; [(1910) 11 CLR 723], which was cited in argument takes the matter any further.

However, clause 33 of the Mortgage defines "the Bank" as meaning and including "the Bank its successors and assigns". This could mean the successors or assigns of the Bank or the successors or assigns of the mortgage.

The word "successor" is an unusual one. The primary use of the word in conveyancing was as a word of limitation to a corporation sole see Coke on
Littleton 8b and see Ex Parte Castle [[1895] 1 Ch 348], 354. In more modern times, the words usually refer to successors in business such as where a bank is absorbed into another bank or a state owned bank is privatised. The words "successors and assigns" must mean either successor or assigns of the business or successor or assigns of the mortgage. It would be absurd to read the phrase as meaning successor to the business or assign of the mortgage.
Thus the word "assign" must refer to assignee of the business of the bank.
This in any event appears to be the natural meaning of the phrase, see eg
Hinkins versus Alder (1906) 50 So Jo 258. In the instant case, the plaintiff is not the assignee of the business of the bank; it is only an assign of the mortgage. Clause 20 does not thus apply to enable it to produce a certificate which is even prima facie evidence of default.

Mr. Gray put that this analysis is erroneous. He says that one must read clause 33 as a whole. One can see a definition of "Mortgagor" or "Customer" both of which include "executors, administrators and assigns". As the Bank is a corporation, reference to executors or administrators would be out of place, so that the corresponding phrase, "successors and assigns" is employed. Mr
Gray points out that it is necessary for such a provision to be included so that the power of sale will pass to an assignee of the mortgage, Re Rumney & Smith [[1897] 2 Ch 351.] 
I appreciate the strength of this argument despite the fact that with a
Torrens system mortgage [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s51.html) &
[52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the Act will operate so that there is no need to deal with the problem raised inm the Rumney & Smith case. However, on balance, I consider the correct construction of clause 33 is the one first set out in this Section of the reasons.

Accordingly it does not seem to me that the certificate PX 05 takes the matter any further so it unnecessary to consider whether the exhibit actually complies with the requirements of clause 20.

J. Section 79 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) reads as follows:- "Where, if this Act had not been passed, any person might have brought an action of ejectment, the person may commence proceedings and claim judgment for possession of land and, subject to the rules, claim such other relief as the nature of the case requires." 
The initial question is, when, if the Act had not been passed, might a person have brought an action in ejectment? 
Mr Duncan submits that only where there is an actual entry before action can a mortgagee succeed in ejectment. Mr Gray disputes this.

To examine the submission, one has to go back into the history of the action of ejectment. This action was originally a writ of trespass de ejectione firmae. The word "firmae" meant "of the term" and accordingly it was only able to be used when there had been an ejectment from a term of years, that is, it was a lessee's action. Originally it sounded only in damages, but by the end of the 15th century the courts allowed the lessee to recover his term by the writ; see Plucknett "A Concise History of the Common Law" 5th Ed (Butterworths
London 1956) p 373. Freeholders and other non-lessees who wished to use a more modern action had to involve themselves in legal fictions and pretend that they were lessees. This lead to the famous Doe versus Roe fiction in which an imaginary John Doe pretended that he had a lease from the real plaintiff and had been ejected by Richard Roe, the casual ejector, the imaginary lessee of the real defendant. In England by ss 168 and following of the Statute 15 & Victoria Chapter 76, (the Common Law Procedure Act 1852), instead of the present proceeding by way of ejectment a writ is to be issued directed to the persons in possession by name and to all persons entitled to defend possession and the only defences allowed to be set up were those which a landlord appearing in an action of ejectment has heretofore been allowed to set up.
These provisions were enacted in identical form by ss 119 and following of the
Common Law Procedure Act 17 Victoria No 21. This was then consolidated into the Common Law Procedure Act 1899 ss 209 and following.

Despite the simplification of procedure, the new action of ejectment retained some features of the old procedure. The Doe versus Roe procedure as detailed in
Cole on Ejectment pp 1-3, and also in McKinnon versus Portelli [(1959) 60 SR (Myers], J). Essentially the fiction was that W had entered upon the land, leased the land to X, X had been evicted by Y, the casual ejector, who had leased the land to Z. This enabled there to be an action between two persons who were alleged to be lessees, X and Z. Before, however,
Z could enter into the action, the plaintiff's solicitor, purporting to be "your loving friend Y", wrote to Z telling him about the existence of the action and Z then had to apply to be joined as a defendant and in order for him to be a defendant he had to admit the entry by W and the lease to X, leaving for determination the question of which of the fictitious lessees had the better right to possession. The significance of this is that the entry by
W had to be admitted. It was held that the action under the Common Law
Procedure Act, the bringing of the action of ejectment was equivalent to entry: Grimwood versus Moss (1872) LR 7 CP 360, 364; Serjeant versus Nash, Field & Co [[1903] 2 KB 304], 311; McKinnon versus Portelli supra; NGL Properties Pty
Ltd versus Harlington Pty Ltd <case>; [[1979] VR 92](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20VR%2092 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 98. Section 79 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) gives to the current action for possession of land the same force as the old writ of ejectment and the service of the statement of claim or summons is equivalent to re-entry: Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd versus Mandalenakis, Ash, J, 26 March , unreported.

However, it does not seem to me that these technical rules avail Mr Duncan in the instant case. This is because either the entry of which he complains has not taken place is deemed to have taken place by the mere issue of the summons in conformity with the authorities to which I have already referred, or else because such entry is unnecessary.

Mr Gray also relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Mills versus Lewis BPR 9421 at 9431 and following. In that case Priestley, JA with whom
Hope and Glass, JJA agreed, referred with approval to Cole on Ejectment pp -71. It is there emphasised that a person must have a legal right to actual possession or a legal right of entry before that person could bring ejectment, see, for example, Doe d Da Costa versus Wharton (1798) 2 Term Rep 2; <case>; [101
ER 1233.] However, the Court said that in appropriate cases the court should, where there was a technical defence to formal ejectment, grant a declaration that the plaintiff had a right to possession and then order specific performance. It is clear that Mills versus Lewis is a special case because the Court of Appeal nowhere indicated that it wished to set aside the general principle that a declaratory action is ordinarily not a substitute for proceedings in ejectment, David
Jones Ltd versus Leventhal [(1927) 40 CLR 356.] 
I do not consider that this case assists Mr Gray for a number of reasons.
First there is no pleading of the case for proceeding in the Mills versus Lewis direction. Secondly, it is difficult to see the promise by the mortgagor to give up possession which can be specifically enforced. Thirdly, as ejectment is appropriate, this is not a special case where the alternative method of securing possession should be utilised.

K. As I have mentioned earlier, the point as to whether the [Farm Debt
Mediation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) operated to protect the defendant was dealt with by Hulme, J on 16 February 1995, unfavourably to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought leave to appeal to the
Court of Appeal from this decision, but I am told from the bar table that the
Court of Appeal considered that the application should be dealt with after the final hearing of the proceedings and that the matter should be further considered at the trial. In argument before me, Mr Gray submitted that Hulme,
J was correct, and Mr Duncan repeated the submissions that he had made to
Hulme, J.

The Act defines "creditor" as meaning "A person who provides financial accommodation to a farmer that creates or increases a farm debt and includes a bank ...". "Farm debt" is defined as meaning "A debt incurred by a farmer for the purposes of the conduct of a farming operation that is secured wholly or partly by a farm mortgage." Section 6 of the Act provides that an enforcement action taken by a creditor within the meaning of the Act, otherwise than in compliance with the Act, is void.

Before Hulme, J the plaintiff said that whilst the debt originally owing to the State Bank may well answer the description "farm debt", the requirement in the definition of "creditor" that the plaintiff be a person who provides financial accommodation has not been satisfied. Hulme, J agreed with that submission. The countervailing argument is that Parliament could never have intended that the whole Act could be circumvented by a person who was a creditor within the meaning of the Act assigning his debt to a person who was not.

Unless "financial accommodation" is considered as covering the situation where a person continues to leave their money at interest with the debtor, or unless it can be said that the assignee from a creditor takes subject to all the liabilities of the creditor including procedural liabilities that are foisted on the creditor by subsequent legislation, the decision of Hulme, J as a matter of logic, must be completely correct.

Whilst "financial accommodation" can mean the forbearance to recover a debt, see for instance the definition in the Queensland Stamp Duties Act considered in B & B Leasing (Vic) Pty Ltd versus Commissioner of Stamp Duties [(1993) 26
ATR 244](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2026%20ATR%20244 "View LawCiteRecord" ), I cannot see how, on the facts of the instant case, where the plaintiff is a company formed only for one purpose, namely to acquire this mortgage and which has since the date of its incorporation demanded repayment of the debt, could in any sense of the word be said to have provided financial accommodation to the defendant. As to the second point, <case> of the Act deals with people who enter into arrangements either before or after the commencement of the Act who "seek" to avoid the Act, such arrangements are void. In the instant case there was never any seeking to avoid the operation of the Act as the Act only came into force some four years after the assignment took place.

Accordingly, in my view, the decision of Hulme, J and the reasons which his
Honour gave, should be followed without further discussion.

L. To summarise, the mortgagee has a statutory right to possession under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s60.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) (see
Sections A & B). If it were necessary to prove a demand, despite its imperfections as a notice under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), the 1985 notice operated as a demand under the mortgage for the repayment of the principal moneys due under the mortgage (Section C). The 1985 notice has not been waived (Section G) and there is no technical defence under the [Supreme
Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) or the [Farm Debt Mediation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) (Sections
J and K). Thus the plaintiff is entitled to succeed.

It follows that I should make orders for the plaintiff to have possession of the land and an appropriate order for costs. Because there may need to be some detailed consideration given as to the time for issue or execution of any writ of possession and argument as to the precise form of the order for costs I should merely publish these reasons and stand the matter over for argument as to costs. I will appoint Thursday August at 9.30 am for short minutes of orders to be brought in. Counsel may at least seven days before that date contact my Associate and arrange some suitable substitute time.

In view of the history of this matter, I would expect that there may be an appeal and that when the short minutes are brought in there may be an application for a stay. I will deal with any such application on the merits.
However, I should repeat the indicatation that I made at the close of the argument, that I may very well refuse a stay except for a short period unless there is some offer by the defendant to pay at least the current interest payable under the mortgage during the period of the stay.
