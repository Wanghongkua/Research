Judgment 
HIS HONOUR : This is an application by the defendant that the plaintiff's originating process be summarily dismissed. By its originating process the plaintiff claims an order setting aside a statutory demand served on it by the defendant. In his written submissions filed in support of his application for summary dismissal the defendant contends:  " a) The Plaintiff's Application was not validly served at the address stated in the statutory demand or at all within the 21 day period required by [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ( the Act ); and b) the Plaintiff's Application does not set out any grounds or other evidence on which to properly base the allegation that a genuine dispute exists in relation to the Defendant's statutory demand ( Graywinter principle). " [Section 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) provides:  " Company may apply 
A company may apply to the Court for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on the company. 
An application may only be made within 21 days after the demand is so served. 
An application is made in accordance with this section only if, within those 21 days: an affidavit supporting the application is filed with the Court; and a copy of the application, and a copy of the supporting affidavit, are served on the person who served the demand on the company." 
The scheme of [Part 5.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.4) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) , of which [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) is part, is that applications under that Part relevant to the winding-up of a company in insolvency should be dealt with promptly. That is the self-evident rationale for the strict time limit in [s 459G.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) Whilst no time limit is imposed for the determination of applications brought under [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html), such as is imposed by [s 459R](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459r.html) for applications to wind up a company in insolvency, it is the obvious legislative intention that applications to set aside a statutory demand should be determined as promptly as they can be, consistently with the requirements of procedural fairness. There may be cases where there is a real advantage in trying the question of whether the application under [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) has been made in time in advance of other issues, but such cases will be rare. The additional costs to the parties in preparing affidavits on the question whether there is a genuine dispute or a genuine offsetting claim will rarely be such as to warrant a bifurcated hearing, still less an application for summary dismissal. By seeking summary dismissal the defendant assumes the burden of showing that there is no real question of fact or law to be tried. The issues arising on an application to set aside a statutory demand are typically whether there is a genuine dispute about the debt the subject of the statutory demand or a genuine offsetting claim, and often whether the application has been brought within time. Given the nature of those issues there is usually little to be saved in terms of delay or costs, and potentially much to be lost, by a defendant's applying for summary dismissal. In the present case I doubt that it would have taken much longer to hear the plaintiff's application under [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html), than it took to hear the defendant's application for summary dismissal. In my view the court would be justified in refusing to fix an application for summary dismissal of a [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application for hearing if the judge is of the view that that would not be a productive use of court time and would be more likely to increase delay and costs than reduce them.  
It is not clear to me that Hammerschlag J did fix only the defendant's interlocutory process for hearing. The associate's record of his Honour's order was that " the matter " be fixed for hearing. However, the parties understood that it was the defendant's interlocutory process that was fixed for hearing, and whilst the defendant said that it was ready to deal with the plaintiff's application under [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) on its merits, the plaintiff was not. It would not have been procedurally fair to force the plaintiff to a hearing of its claim when both parties had evidently proceeded on the basis that it was only the application for summary dismissal that was to be heard.  
By seeking summary dismissal of the plaintiff's application, the defendant assumes the burden of showing that the plaintiff's claim is " so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed " or " manifestly groundless ", that " there is no real question to be tried " whether of fact or law, and that the court " has the requisite material and the necessary assistance from the parties to reach a definite and certain conclusion " ( Burton versus Shire of Bairnsdale  <case>; <case>).  
Background Facts 
The statutory demand was served on the plaintiff by post. The solicitor for the defendant deposed that on 6 April 2011 she posted the statutory demand in a pre-paid envelope addressed to the plaintiff at its registered office. The demand claimed that the plaintiff owed the defendant the sum of $57,839.38. The alleged debt was described in the schedule to the demand as " unpaid wages (exclusive of tax) payable pursuant to an employment contract between Newsnet Pty Limited and Roy Patching ". Paras 5 and 6 of the statutory demand stated:  " 5. [Section
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides that a company served with a demand may apply to a court having jurisdiction under the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) for an order setting the demand aside. An application must be made within 21 days after the demand is served and, within the same period: an affidavit supporting the application must be filed with the court; and a copy of the application and a copy of the affidavit must be served on the person who served the demand. ... 
The address of the creditor for service of copies of any application and affidavit is Middletons, Level 26, 52 Martin Place, Sydney in the [S] tate of New South Wales. "
The plaintiff's originating process was filed on 3 May 2011. It stated:  " A. DETAILS OF APPLICATION 
This application is made under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). 
It is an application by the Plaintiff for orders setting aside the statutory demand, served on it by the Defendants. 
On the facts stated in the supporting affidavit the Plaintiff claims: 
An order that the statutory demand dated 5 April 2011 served by the
Defendant on the Plaintiff on 13 April 2011 be set aside. ... "
The plaintiff also filed an affidavit on 3 May 2011 by a Mr Selva Thiru. He deposed:  " 1. I am the DFO of Newsnet Pty Ltd ('the Plaintiff') and am authorized to swear this affidavit on its behalf. 
The amount claimed has been calculated incorrectly by failing to allow for payments already made to the Defendant. 
Annexed hereto marked 'A' is a letter of demand received by the Plaintiff on the day of 13 April 2011. 
I have contacted the Defendant's solicitor to obtain details of the sum claimed being $57,839.38 but it has not been forth coming. 
No response has been forthcoming to my query for particulars. 
A genuine dispute exists between Plaintiff and the Defendant in relation to the alleged debt. 
I request this honourable [sic] to make the orders sought in the
Originating Process. "
Notwithstanding paragraph 3 of the affidavit, there was no annexure "A".  
On 3 May 2011 the plaintiff's solicitor sent a facsimile addressed to Ms Rachel Carter of Middletons stating:  "Dear Rachel, 
Please find attached an Originating Process and Affidavit filed in the
Supreme Court today. 
I will send you the originals by mail. "
Ms Carter annexed a copy of that facsimile to her affidavit. The copy annexed has a heading stating " 03 May 2011 17: 41 HP LASERJET FAX ... ". The facsimile received by Middletons was a complete copy of the originating process and affidavit as filed.  
Ms Carter deposed that although the facsimile was received by her office's facsimile machine at 5.31 (sic) pm on 3 May 2011, it did not come to her attention until 4 May 2011 when it was sent to her email box by the office staff of Middletons.  
On 5 May 2011 Ms Carter received a copy of the originating process and supporting affidavit that had been sent to Middletons through the mail.  
The defendant contended that the originating process and supporting affidavit were not served until the documents that had been posted were received by Middletons which, it was said, did not take place until 5 May 2011. The defendant did not contend that service at Middletons at the place stated in the statutory demand as the address for service was not effective. However, the defendant did contend that service by facsimile was not good service, whether service was taken to be effected on 3 May 2011 when the document was received by Middleton's facsimile machine and apparently printed, or 4 May 2011, when it was actually received by the solicitor having the carriage of the matter. As the originating process admitted that the statutory demand was served on 13 April 2011, the defendant submitted that service on 5 May 2011 was outside the prescribed period of 21 days.  
The defendant also submitted that service should be presumed to have been effected on 12 April 2011, not 13 April 2011, so that service was only effected within time if effected by 3 May 2011.  
Service within 21 days 
It can be taken from the originating process that the statutory demand was not served later than 13 April 2011. The supporting affidavit of Selva Thiru does not establish that the statutory demand was served on 13 April 2011. That is so for two reasons. The first is that the affidavit did not include the annexure described as a " letter of demand ". It will be open to the plaintiff at the hearing to tender the document referred to. In any event, if the letter of demand referred to was the statutory demand, Mr Thiru's affidavit does not establish whether 13 April 2011 was the time the demand was received at the plaintiff's registered office, or whether it was the date received by a relevant officer of the plaintiff. The latter date would be irrelevant.  
The defendant submitted that service should be presumed to have been effected four business days after posting. This was said to be consistent with [s 160](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (Cth). The relevant Act to be applied is the New South Wales [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), but [s 160](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) is in the same terms. However, the presumption in [s 160](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) only arises in the absence of evidence as to when the document to be served was delivered to the address for service, or, if it is established that the demand was despatched in the ordinary course of post, in the absence of evidence as to when the document would be delivered in the ordinary course of post ( Scope Data Systems Pty Ltd versus Goman as Representative of the Partnership BDO Nelson Parkhill  <case>; <case>, 186-187). At trial it might be determined that the statutory demand was served on 13 April 2011 or prior to 13 April 2011. That is a triable question of fact. On this summary judgment application it cannot be assumed that the statutory demand was served prior to 13 April 2011.  
It follows that this ground for seeking summary dismissal of the originating process is not established if service of the originating process and supporting affidavit by facsimile on either 3 or 4 May 2011 was good service.  [Section 109X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) specifies the ways in which a document may be served on a company. The modes specified are not exhaustive. However, [s 109X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) has no application in the present case, as the person to be served was not a company, but an individual.  [Rule 10.20(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s10.20.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) requires that an originating process be personally served. Personal service is effected under r 10.20 by leaving a copy of the document with the person, or, if the person does not accept it, putting it down in his or her presence and telling the person the nature of the document. The defendant was not served personally in this way. In The Site Foreman Pty Limited versus Brand  <case> Barrett J held that personal service of an originating process to set aside a statutory demand is also effective if service is effected in accordance with [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth). That section provides:  " 28A Service of documents 
For the purposes of any Act that requires or permits a document to be served on a person, whether the expression 'serve', 'give' or 'send' or any other expression is used, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the document may be served: on a natural person: by delivering it to the person personally; or by leaving it at, or by sending it by pre-paid post to, the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to the person serving the document; or on a body corporate-by leaving it at, or sending it by pre-paid post to, the head office, a registered office or a principal office of the body corporate. 
Nothing in subsection (1): affects the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth, or any law of a State or Territory, that authorizes the service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection; or affects the power of a court to authorize service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection. "
Service was not effected on the defendant in accordance with that section. It was not delivered to him personally. Middletons' office was not his last known place of business or residence.  
In The Site Foreman Pty Limited versus Brand Barrett J also said:  "[26] It has been held in a number of cases that service of copies of a s
G application and supporting affidavit may be effected at the address specified in para 6 of a statutory demand. That, it seems, to me is axiomatic, given the terms of para 6 and the direction as to its completion set out in
Form 509H as prescribed pursuant to the [Corporations Regulations ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/cr2001281/) (Cth): 
The address of the creditor for service of copies of any application and affidavit is (insert the address for service of the documents in the State or
Territory in which the demand is served on the company, being, if solicitors are acting for the creditor, the address of the solicitors).
 [27] There is, perhaps, room for some doubt as to precisely what (short of personal service) may be sufficient to constitute service on a natural person defendant at a para 6 address if that address is not also, in terms of <case>, the defendant's place of residence or business last known to the plaintiff.
That, however, is not a matter that calls for discussion in this case." 
Section 459G(3)(b) requires a copy of the application to set aside the statutory demand and supporting affidavit to be " served on the person who served the demand on the company ". Counsel for the defendant did not dispute that a copy of the originating process and supporting affidavit would be " served on the person who served the demand on the company " within the meaning of <case>(b) if service were effected at the address for service specified in the statutory demand. That must be so. A statutory demand is required to be in the prescribed form (s 459E(2)(e)). The prescribed form is form 509H (Corporations Regulations 1.0.03(1) and Schedule 1 column 1 item 51H). The prescribed form for a Creditor's Statutory Demand for Payment of Debt includes:  " 6. The address of the creditor for service of copies of any application and any affidavit is (insert the address for service of the documents in the
State or Territory in which the demand is served on the company, being, if solicitors are acting for the creditor, the address of the solicitors). "
The necessary implication is that a copy of an application under <case> to set aside a statutory demand and a copy of the supporting affidavit can be served by the documents being served at the address for service stated in the demand. If solicitors are acting for the creditor, that address is to be the address of the solicitors. Service is not required to be made by a document being personally delivered to, or even received by, a specified individual.  
In Players Pty Ltd versus Interior Projects [(1996) 14 ACLC 918] Beaumont and Moore JJ also agreed with the conclusion of Lander J in Players Pty Ltd versus Interior Projects Pty Ltd that service of an application and supporting affidavit under <case> could be effected at the address for service stated in the statutory demand and did not have to be effected personally (at 669, 680).  
The effect of these decisions is that notwithstanding the requirement in <case>(b) that service of a copy of the application and statutory demand be made " on the person who served the demand " service will be effective if made at the place specified in the statutory demand as the address for service. As Young J said in Howship Holdings Pty Ltd versus Leslie at 544 the requirement of the regulations that the prescribed form of statutory demand include an address for service was within power and assists in the ordinary working out of the Act.  
In considering the cases dealing with the validity of service by facsimile, it is important to bear in mind the context in which the question of service fell for decision. In some of the cases the relevant process had to be served personally, and in some of those cases the validity of personal service was determined by whether a statute or rule of court prescribing a mode of service was satisfied. Thus, in Howship Holdings Pty Ltd versus Leslie the report does not state what address for service had been stated in the statutory demand. The document was served through the Document Exchange. That was not an address and presumably the plaintiff could not rely upon compliance with paragraph 6 of the statutory demand. Thus, the document had to be served personally, but Young J held that service was nonetheless valid if it was effective to bring the document into the possession of the person to be served (at 544-545). Similarly, in Dwyer & Anor versus Canon Australia Pty Ltd & Ors  <case> the question was whether an originating process seeking an extension of time under [s 588FF(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588ff.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) had been served within time. Debelle J noted that service by facsimile was not authorised by the relevant rules of court and said that the common law requirements for service would be satisfied if there were proof that the documents sent by facsimile were received in complete and legible form (at [27]). His Honour held that that had not been proved and that evidence of the sending of a document by facsimile was not sufficient proof that the document had been received in complete and legible form (at [29]-[30]).  
It is a mistake to draw from such authorities the conclusion that in all cases service by facsimile is only effective upon the document coming into the possession of the person to be served. In some cases personal service is required under rules of court. The [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) provide that personal service is effected by leaving a copy of the document with the person, or, if the person does not accept it, putting it down in his or her presence and telling the person the nature of the document (Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, r 10.21(1)). Cases such as Howship Holdings Pty Ltd versus Leslie allow for informal service if the document comes into the possession of the person to be served.  
Personal service of an application to set aside a statutory demand on an individual may also be made pursuant to [s 28A(1)(a)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) by " leaving it at " the last known place of residence or business of the person to be served. That provision was considered by Austin J in Austar Finance versus Campbell  <case> who considered it arguable that a facsimile transmission could be " left at " the place of business or residence of the defendant if a complete and legible copy of the document was received at that place by facsimile transmission (at [75]), but service was not effective in that way in that case because transmission of the copy of the filed document was incomplete.  
A third way in which service of an application to set aside a statutory demand may be effected is at the address for service specified in the demand. In Seventh Cameo Nominees Pty Ltd versus Holdway Pty Ltd Chernov J held that service by facsimile of an application to set aside a statutory demand was effective when the application and supporting affidavit was successfully transmitted. Chernov J said:  " I agree with Lander J in Players Pty Ltd versus Interior Projects [(1996) 20
ACSR 189], that the combination of s459E, the prescribed form of statutory demand under it, and s459G, shows that the legislation contemplates that the application under s459G(3) may be served on the creditor at the address shown on the statutory demand. A like conclusion was reached by Young
J in Howship Holdings Pty Ltd versus Leslie <case>; [(1996) 21 ACSR 440] at 442. 
In my view, it is sufficient for the purposes of s459G(3) if copies of the application and affidavit are served at the relevant address, that being the address nominated by the giver of the statutory notice. Thus, service may be effected if copies of the relevant documents are left at the nominated address. In a sense, how they come to be left there is irrelevant (see Young J in Howship Holdings Pty Ltd versus Leslie , at p442). For instance, the copy documents may be left by someone attending at the address in question and leaving them there. If that had occurred in this case, then in my view, proper service would have been effected of the relevant documents. The same object is achieved if the copies arrive at that address as a result of being sent by way of a facsimile transmission. What is required by <case> is that the respondent should receive copies of the relevant documents at the address nominated by it. Once that has occurred, the requirement of <case> as to service of the relevant documents is satisfied." 
In that case the facsimile transmission was received by the creditor serving the demand, but personal receipt by the creditor, as distinct from receipt at the nominated address, was not essential to the decision.  
In some of the cases the address for service specified in the statutory demand included a facsimile transmission number. Service at the number stated was good service ( Australian Underwriting Agencies Pty Ltd versus QBE Insurance Ltd ; Renegade Rigging Pty Ltd versus Hanlon Nominees Pty Ltd at [45]-[46], <case>; [(2010) 78 ACSR 468] Palmer J reviewed the authorities. His Honour summarised the principles he drew from the preponderance of authority as follows (at [44]):  " i) if a document required to be served on a company by the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) , whether or not it initiates proceedings, is served in accordance with any of the modes prescribed in [s
X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and <case> [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth) or, in the case of a <case> application, at an address for service nominated in the Statutory Demand (all of which are included in 'a prescribed mode'), the document is validly served and once service in a prescribed mode is proved, a proceeding cannot be challenged on the basis that the document did not actually come to the attention of the company: Austar Finance Group Pty

His Honour appears to treat service by email or facsimile as not being a " prescribed mode" of service and therefore only effective if brought to the attention of the relevant officer of the creditor.  
However, the regulation authorising service of an application and supporting affidavit under <case> does not prescribe any mode by which the documents can be served at the address for service. Given that personal service on an individual is not required, and there is no rule of court or statute prescribing particular modes of service, the principles about effective informal service do not arise.  
The [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) regulate the mode of service of documents in court proceedings on a party having an address for service (Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, r 10.5). Service by facsimile is an authorised mode of service only if the person's address for service is a solicitor's office and the notice advising the address for service includes a facsimile number (r 10.5(2)(b)). No reliance was placed by either party on r 10.5. Prima facie it applies only to service of documents once proceedings in the court have been commenced and the opposite party has given notice of its address for service either in the originating process or notice of appearance.  
Counsel for the defendant relied upon Opensoft Australia Pty Ltd versus Miller Street Pty Ltd  <case> In that case a copy of an unfiled application to set aside a statutory demand was delivered personally to the address for service within the 21-day period. This service was ineffective because it was not service of the documents as filed. The creditor that served the statutory demand was Miller Street Pty Limited. The address for service in the statutory demand was given as " TW Agency, 251 Elizabeth Street Sydney, NSW, 2000 or 1323 Bourke Road, Kew, Victoria, 3101 ". Later the application and supporting affidavit as electronically filed, that is, bearing the court seal and the return date for the application, were sent by email to a director of the creditor and to the principal of TW Agency, a Mr Daud. The director of the creditor did not open the email before the expiry of the 21-day period. Mr Daud did. Jagot J noted that <case>(b) requires that a copy of the application and supporting affidavit be served on the person who served the demand on the company. That was Miller Street Pty Limited. Her Honour said that the address of the creditor for service was a place, namely the office of TW Agency at 251 Elizabeth Street, Sydney and that the creditor had not specified an electronic address for service. Her Honour accepted the submission for the defendant that it was not the place of TW Agency, or of Mr Daud as its principal, to accept service by means other than those specified in the statutory demand itself. Her Honour concluded that receipt by Mr Daud (presumably at the office of TW Agency) was not effective service for the purposes of <case>(b). Her Honour concluded that service had not been validly effected.  
Unless there is something to distinguish service by email from service by facsimile, I do not think that this decision can be reconciled with that of Chernov J in Seventh Cameo Nominees Pty Ltd versus Holdway Pty Ltd . If the electronic copy of the application and supporting affidavit reached the office of TW Agency at the address specified in the statutory demand in a form that was complete and legible, in my view the copy would have been served at that address. I do not see why it would matter that the document was in electronic, and not paper, form. It would still be a copy of the application and supporting affidavit. There may be issues as to whether and when an email actually reaches the place for service. Austin J discussed this question in Austar Finance versus Campbell at [48]. It is not necessary to express a view as to whether an email which is opened from a computer at the address for service without being printed is received at the address at which the computer is located. That will depend on the evidence. It may be that the user accesses the document stored remotely through his or her computer. If, however, the email were printed at the address for service, or if it were received in electronic form at the address for service, in my view a copy of the application and supporting affidavit would have been served at that address.  
Jagot J accepted the submission for the defendant that it was not the place of TW Agency to accept service by means other than those specified in the statutory demand itself. No doubt that is right, in the sense that service would have to be effected at the address for service, namely the specified place of business of TW Agency. But the creditor is required by the form of statutory demand to specify a place for service. In my view a creditor is not entitled to limit the ways in which an application to set aside the statutory demand and supporting affidavit can be delivered to the address for service. Provided the documents reach the relevant place in complete and legible form, service is effective.  
In Austar Finance versus Campbell , Austin J said (at [49]):  " [49] Notwithstanding these differences, in my view electronic transmission, whether by facsimile or email, cannot constitute service for the purposes of s
G(3) unless either: Â* it is shown that the documents electronically transmitted have actually been received in a readable form by the person to be served; or Â* the case falls within one of the special exceptions permitted by rules of court. "
I do not understand why it would be necessary for the purpose of effective service under <case>(b) that the document be actually received by the person to be served. Service at the address for service, that is, service to a place, is effective if made within time, whether or not the document is received by a person. For this reason I do not accept that service by facsimile can only be effective as informal service and only becomes effective when the document is brought to the attention of a responsible officer (compare Woodgate versus Garrard Pty Ltd at [44(v)]). Nor do I accept that service at an address for service specified in the statutory demand can only be made in accordance with one of the ways prescribed by <case> (in the case of service on a company), r 10.21 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) or [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) . Those provisions are facultative, not exclusive.  
In this case the facsimile transmission was complete. It is a reasonable inference that the facsimile transmission was printed at the office of the defendant's solicitor on 3 May 2011. It is not necessary for the purposes of making effective service of an application to set aside a statutory demand that service be effected on a person, as distinct from being served at the place referred to as the address for service in the statutory demand. Accordingly in my view, service would be effective on the day the facsimile was received and printed at the office of the defendant's solicitor. It is a reasonable inference that that day was 3 May 2011. In any event it is clear that the facsimile was received in complete and legible form by the solicitor having the carriage of the matter on 4 May 2011. If service was not effected on 3 May 2011, it was effected on 4 May 2011.  
Accordingly, there is a real question to be tried that service of the originating process and affidavit were effected within the prescribed period.  
The Graywinter principle 
In Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd versus Gas & Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund <case>; [(1996) 70 FCR 452] An application to the High Court for special leave to appeal from that decision was refused.  
It is also established that provided a ground for setting aside a statutory demand is sufficiently identified in the supporting affidavit, further evidence can be adduced by the applicant outside the 21-day period in support of that ground. In the present case the supporting affidavit identifies as a ground for setting aside the statutory demand that the creditor failed to allow for payments already made. It would be open to the defendant to adduce evidence as to what those payments were. On this ground alone this is not a proper ground for seeking summary judgment.  
The defendant submitted that the supporting affidavit failed to specify the material facts on which this ground of dispute was based ( Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd versus Gas & Fuel Corporation Superannuation Fund at 459). However, there is a real question whether to be capable of being characterised as a " supporting affidavit " within the meaning of <case>(b), the affidavit must not only raise the grounds of dispute, but also the material facts on which those grounds are based. In Financial Solutions Australasia Pty Ltd versus Predella Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2002) 26 WAR 306], the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia did not endorse the submission that to be a supporting affidavit the affidavit must necessarily depose to the material facts on which the ground of dispute was based. As Parker J (with whom Anderson and Scott JJ agreed) said (at [34]):  " The statutory yardstick remains that the affidavit should support the application. The precise nature of the application may well influence what this requires. "
In the present case the statutory demand does not specify the period or periods for which it is claimed the defendant did not pay wages due to him. Therefore, it would have been impossible for the plaintiff to set out in the supporting affidavit what payments were relied on as a ground of dispute, whilst being sure that that answer was responsive to the claim for an unpaid debt.  
In my view, the supporting affidavit raises at least one ground of dispute that might or might not be made good by further evidence.  
The plaintiff also submitted that it would be open to the plaintiff to seek to have the statutory demand set aside on the basis that the debt had not been sufficiently particularised in the statutory demand and the affidavit that accompanied the statutory demand. In Condor Asset Management Limited versus Excelsior Eastern Limited  <case> Barrett J said (at [27]-[28]):  " [27] In the last three situations, the plaintiff would be unable to come to grips with the intended meaning of the statutory demand in the way the legislation intends. The ability of a company served with a statutory demand to understand with clarity the requirement the demanding party seeks to impose is crucial to the working of the statutory provisions. One need not go beyond s 459H(1)(a), the provision which is the most fertile source of challenges to statutory demands. That section enables the company concerned to mount a challenge on the basis of a genuine dispute about 'the existence or amount of a debt to which the demand relates'. The reference here is to 'a debt' in the singular. It follows that, where the demand is of the kind allowed by s
E(1)(b) and relates to '2 or more debts', a <case>(a) challenge may be pursued on the basis of a dispute with respect of any one of the several debts dealt with in the demand. Indeed, it may be pursued on the basis of a dispute as to all or any of the several debts. [28] Fundamental, in these circumstances, is the proposition that the company on which the demand is served must be able to identify with precision the debt - or each and every one of the several debts - upon which a statutory demand is based. Failure to provide the means of such identification means that the company is denied the ability even to begin to consider whether <case>(a) provides a ground for challenge. A company in that position suffers severe prejudice; and that prejudice must, of its nature, mean that there will be, in terms of <case>(a), 'substantial injustice' unless the demand is set aside.
"
The plaintiff contends that the statutory demand does not identify with precision the debt or debts claimed to be due.  
It is undesirable that I express any conclusion as to whether this ground of challenge is raised by the supporting affidavit. That would be a live question at a final hearing. As the matter is not an appropriate matter for summary judgment in any event (because it would be open to the defendant to adduce evidence as to payments made to reduce or extinguish the claimed debt), it is preferable that I express no view on this question.  
The defendant also submitted that the plaintiff's claim must fail because the statutory demand was not annexed to the supporting affidavit. It is undoubtedly good practice to annex the statutory demand to the supporting affidavit. But it is not necessarily an essential prerequisite. I repeat what I said in Tatlers.com.au Pty Ltd versus Davis  <case>; <case>- <case>:  " <case>, Austin J observed (at [3]) that: 'If there were no proof of the statutory demand, the plaintiff would be bound to fail, as the Court cannot set aside something which has not been proven to exist.' [32] In that case, it appears that the statutory demand was not even tendered. However, because there was sufficient evidence from which to infer both the existence and the content of the demand, and because there was a genuine dispute, the demand was set aside. In the present case, the plaintiff belatedly tendered the statutory demand. The demand was clearly relevant. I allowed the tender. ... "
For these reasons I order that the defendant's interlocutory process filed on 30 May 2011 be dismissed with costs. I repeat my dismay that the defendant should have sought summary dismissal of the application to set aside a statutory demand. Applications under <case> by their very nature are summary applications. To seek summary dismissal of such an application is likely merely to create delay and additional cost. That is what has happened in this case.  * * *
