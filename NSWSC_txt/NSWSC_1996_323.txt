JUDGE1
SANTOW J This matter arises from an earlier judgment I gave on 18 September
The relevant factual background is fully set out in that judgment, I will not attempt to repeat that factual background here except critical parts of it as bear on the matter presently before me. I should add that an order was taken out pursuant to that judgment, the parties being satisfied that the order gave effect to the judgment though there was not of course any agreement as to the underlying issues which led to that judgment. The effect of the order was that, upon the Plaintiff's usual undertaking as to damages, and the further undertaking to make certain payments, the first and second defendants were restrained from executing a judgment obtained in their favour (in the
District Court of New South Wales in proceedings number 7249 of 1994). Also until further order, the first and second defendants were restrained from execution upon that judgment.
By notice of motion dated 8 December , the first and second defendants, with the concurrence of the third defendant, though the latter was not represented by counsel at today's hearing, sought to-day the dissolution of my earlier mentioned orders insofar as they restrained the first and second defendants from executing the judgment earlier referred to. In the alternative, an order was sought pursuant to Pt 31, rule 2 of the Supreme
Court Rules that the following issue be determined as a separate issue, namely whether the said conduct of the first and second defendants described in paragraphs 12, 14, 17, 19 and 23 of the plaintiff's Statement of Claim dated August 1995 is conduct "in trade and commerce" for the purposes of [s.42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Fair Trading Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/)").
It is fair to say that when the matter came before me on 18 September 1995 the proceedings the subject of the plaintiff's
Statement of Claim were the subject of an expedition application subsequently dealt with by his Honour
McLelland CJ in Eq on 22 September
Expedition was not granted. His
Honour's reasons appear in the transcript of 22 September 1995 (though as it happened his Honour did not have at that time a copy of my earlier ex tempore judgment).
Against that background I now turn to the application made on behalf of the defendants. It is important that I emphasise at the outset that the hurdle that the defendants must clear, as was recognised, is a significantly higher hurdle than the substantive determination of the issue would entail. The defendants must demonstrate the absence of a prima facie case that the relevant representations the subject of my earlier judgment were made "in trade or commerce" within the meaning of that expression in [s.42(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/). This is to be construed by reference to the definition of that term as including "any business or professional activity" contained in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s4.html) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/).
It is necessary that I briefly turn to the background which provides the factual matrix for the claims by the plaintiff in the earlier mentioned statement of claim. That statement of claim identifies a number of representations alleged to have been made and then adds the further assertion in paragraph 21 of a failure to communicate on the part of the alleged representor. That alleged representor was the third defendant who it was contended acted for the first and second defendant in making the alleged representations to the plaintiff on their behalf.
The background to these representations was that the first and second defendant for some years commencing around 1988 had an investment in a company called Zone Technology Pty Limited ("Zone"). The plaintiff was a co-investor.
Zone had been set up by the plaintiff and the first and second defendants as a vehicle to exploit commercial inventions of the first and second defendant.
Following a dispute between the parties and involving Zone the first and second defendants left Zone
Technology in 1990 and certain deeds were entered into on 8 November 1990 between the first and second defendants on the one hand and zone on the other. The plaintiff guaranteed Zone's obligations under those deeds.
On 7 may 1992 litigation commenced against the plaintiff and Zone in the
Supreme Court and judgment was subsequently entered against the Plaintiff and
Zone, concluding that the former was liable under the guarantee. This was on 6
July 1992. Damages were however still to be assessed.
Proceedings were removed into the District Court of New South Wales on 25
November 1994. Some weeks before the date set for a hearing on damages before
Holt DCJ, it was alleged that there were discussions between the plaintiff and the two defendants in which the third defendant
Mr Scarcella, not acting as a solicitor, played the role of a go-between on behalf of the first and second defendants. According to the statement of claim, those discussions resulted, in so far as the plaintiff was concerned, in settlement of the subject matter of the impending hearing. The Plaintiff contends that agreement was reached as to the compensation to be paid by the plaintiff to the first and second defendants in substitution for the damages still to be quantified. The gravamen of the plaintiff's case is that following the representations to that effect and notwithstanding those representations, when the matter came before
Holt DCJ, the plaintiff relied on those representations and was not present, with the result that judgment was awarded unopposed for $170,866.
That judgment was entered by default.
The subsequent proceedings before me on 18 September 1995 were to deal with two motions.
The first, on behalf of the defendants, was for summary dismissal of the plaintiff's statement of claim. The second was brought by the plaintiff for an injunction. The injunction was granted, whilst summary dismissal was refused.
[Section 42(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) is in the following terms: "A person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive."
In [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s4.html) "trade or commerce" is defined as including "any business or professional activity." [Section 42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) is, apart from the extension to its terms in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s4.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), in equivalent terms to [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth).
The High court in Concrete Constructions Pty Limited versus Nelson <case>; [(1990) 169 CLR 594] gave the phrase "in trade or practice" in [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) a restricted operation. The majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) held: "It is plain that [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) was not intended to extend to all conduct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporation might engage, in the course of, or for the purpose of, its overall trading or commercial business ... the reference to conduct 'in trade or commerce' in [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) can be construed as referring only to conduct which has an aspect or element of activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character."
It should be emphasised that the High Court in that majority judgment said that, "As a matter of mere language, the arguments favouring and militating against these alternative constructions of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) are fairly evenly balanced" (at 603) -meaning the arguments favouring an extensive or narrower construction. The context in which the matter came to the High Court may also be significant. This was a case of a worker who sustained injuries on a building site who sued his employer, relying on a contravention of [s.52.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) The contravention was said to arise from allegedly incorrect information given to the worker by a foreman as to the safety of grates on air conditioning shafts.
While the conduct might be said to have occurred "in relation to" rather than "in" the course of the corporation's trade, that of constructing buildings for reward, it is important to bear in mind that the applicant was seeking to use [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) to overcome limitations on recovery imposed in relation to employment, not trade as such, by the applicable State Workers' Compensation legislation.
The Court may have considered that this was an area of liability so far removed from what might be considered breach of a statute [(section 52)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) designed to insist on the highest standard of conduct in the market place that the result sought by the applicant should be upheld only if it were clearly required by the statutory wording; see discussion in the article 'Misleading or Deceptive Conduct: The Breadth and Limitations of the Prohibition' by David
Harland in [1991 4 JCL 107] at 115.
The author of that article suggests that a different result might well have been reached if the relevant statement were made in the course of, or for the purpose of, some trading or commercial activity or dealing between a corporation and an employee.
That might be said to be closer to the facts in the present case where the dealing is between former co-shareholders relating to a commercial guarantee given by one of them in relation to the exit of the others, albeit in the context where liability under the guarantee had been subsumed in a judgment.
In Patrick versus Steel Mains [(1989) 77 ALR 133], by contrast, Wilcox J considered that a statement made by a trading corporation while negotiating variations to the conditions of employment enjoyed by an existing employee was capable of being conduct "IN trade or commerce" (my emphasis).
In Orison Pty
Limited versus Strategic Minerals Corp NL [(1987) 77 ALR 141], admittedly a decision before the High court's decision in Nelson (supra),
French J held that sending to shareholders a document relating to an extraordinary general meeting of the Company was conduct "in trade or commerce".
There have also been cases in both directions dealing with the issue of statements made which were designed either to assist or otherwise the interests of the tobacco industry. Thus, for example, Tobacco Institute of
Australia Limited versus Woodward [(1993) 32 NSWLR 559], where the relevant statement of a tobacco lobbyist was held to have been made rather in the capacity of a director of a particular company "Action on Smoking and Health Limited" than "in trade or commerce" as such, even were the activity of lobbying for reward capable of being "in trade or commerce".
The purpose of the foregoing discussion is not to suggest that a clear conclusion can be reached favouring the view that the alleged representations were made in trade or commerce. All that I need to do at this point is to consider whether, on the material before me, there is a serious question to be tried or prima facie case that the representations were made in trade or commerce for the purposes of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/).
Turning to the actual circumstances before me, there is little doubt that the original guarantee was given in trade or commerce, associated as it was with a commercial investment. But did the nexus between the relevant conduct and trade or commerce cease or become attenuated following liability under the
Guarantee being subsumed in a judgment that as a result such conduct was no longer "an aspect of activities which, of their nature bear a trading or commercial nature"? Accordingly, were the negotiations which followed judgment thus not (or no longer) in trade or commerce in the sense used by the High
Court by reason of that subsuming? It might be argued that it would be an unexpected result for negotiations in relation to the giving of the actual guarantee to be in trade or commerce for the purpose of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), whereas later negotiations which followed in relation to the liability subsumed in the earlier judgment based on the guarantee were no longer "in trade or commerce" merely by reason of that fact.
I express no final view as to whether that argument will ultimately prevail, Indeed it may depend in part on the premise that negotiations as to the guarantee prior to any judgment were in trade or commerce. Further evidence may be needed to elucidate this. All that it is necessary for the plaintiff to do at this interlocutory stage is establish there is at least an arguable or prima facie case, or a serious question to be tried, as to that matter. In the state of the authorities, I am satisfied that there is such a case.
I turn now to the second matter the subject of the defendants, notice of motion. That is, whether pursuant to [Pt 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/index.html#p31), [rule 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s2.html), this Court ought to make an order that the issue of whether the representations were made in trade or commerce for the purposes of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) be determined as a separate issue and separately from the questions otherwise requiring determination. The plaintiff seeks to resist that outcome having earlier emphasised in relation to the first matter that evidence will be needed which may be reasonably extensive in order to properly determine the matter. That evidence is said to include evidence from the third defendant covering such matters as whether he was paid for his services in 1995 and, if so, by whom. It is also said to include such materials as may exist between the third defendant on the one hand and the first and second defendants on the other as to their relationship.
The plaintiff contends that there will be a substantial overlap involving additional cost if that evidence were to be heard only in relation to the separate issue and not also in relation to the representations themselves and whether they were made. I am however not convinced that the overlap will be of such significance that this issue should not be separated. I consider that particularly given the history of this matter there is much to be said for having the issues between the parties determined with some expedition, albeit that an order for expedition as such is not justified for the proceedings as a whole. Depending on the outcome of such separate determination of the issue, it may be appropriate to consider how cost orders might be framed which could take into account any additional cost incurred by that course, so that the plaintiff were not unfairly disadvantaged. However it would be inappropriate for me at this point to do more than point to this as a possibility, since inevitably cost orders will be affected by other considerations which will be apparent to the trial judge dealing with the matter as a substantive issue.
As to costs of to-day, having had the benefit of brief argument from the plaintiff and the defendant, and noting that the plaintiff had requested but not been advised of the grounds for the first two orders sought by the defendants (though I am satisfied that second order sought by the defendant was self-explanatory), I consider that the appropriate orders are these: 
The defendant to pay 80 percent of the costs of today's hearing. 
The remaining 20 percent of the costs of today's hearing are reserved.
Finally, I have also heard brief argument on whether I should add a further order, namely that costs should be assessed forthwith. While the defendants place emphasis on the fact that they have a judgment in their favour from which they will be kept out until the statement of claim is finally dealt with, the plaintiff emphasises that the matter the subject of the first order sought could and should have been raised when originally argued before me on 18 September 1995 and thus involved costs being unnecessarily incurred. In addition, whether the defendants ultimately obtain their judgment will depend upon their success or otherwise in meeting the claims made by the plaintiff in its statement of claim. In all the circumstances, I consider that costs should be assessed forthwith and I so order.
To leave no room for doubt,
I should emphasise that these orders so far as the defendants are concerned, relate only to the first and second defendants as only they were represented today.
