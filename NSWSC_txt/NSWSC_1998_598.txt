WILLIAM JAMES BRIDGES versus KELAPOST PTY LIMITED 
CA 40622/98 September 1998 
Mason P, Handley JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: I am of the view that the leave should be refused. We do not normally give reasons, particularly since the reasons will appear from the dialogue when the various points were raised. 
The only matter I wish to address in particular is the question of the width of the restraint. I am not satisfied that an issue about width was raised. Had it been raised, then it would clearly have been open to his Honour to have invoked the Restraint of Trade Act and reformulated the injunctive relief.

I am not to be taken to be inviting any such application, but in refusing leave I am indicating that the basis as regards the question of width in refusal of leave is: 
I am not satisfied the issue was litigated below, and in any event the plaintiff had and still has the right to seek a variation if a genuine issue arises as to the scope of the restraint.

I would refuse the application.

HANDLEY JA: I agree. 
MASON P: The summons is dismissed with costs. I agree that there should be no further stay granted. The claimant's Notice of Motion for a stay in the event of leave to appeal being granted is also dismissed with costs. * * *
