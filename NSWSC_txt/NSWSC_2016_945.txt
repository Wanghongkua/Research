JUDGMENT 
INTRODUCTION
On 27 November 2015, for reasons published as C versus W <case>, I ordered that an appeal from the Guardianship Division of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of NSW ("NCAT") be dismissed. Those reasons set out the factual matrix of family disharmony of ongoing significance for the current judgment.
At heart, the proceedings concern management of the person and property of the fourth defendant, an elderly widow, now incapable of self-management. The plaintiff is her daughter. The first, second and third defendants are her sons. All siblings are adults. The sons, acting cooperatively, have management of their mother's affairs under instruments appointing an enduring guardian and bearing the character of an enduring power of attorney: C versus W <case> at <case>.
NCAT dismissed both the plaintiff's application for a financial management order and her application for an order that she be appointed her mother's guardian. She appealed to the Court from dismissal of those applications. During the course of the hearing of the appeal, she abandoned her challenge to dismissal of her application for a guardianship order. Her appeal against dismissal of her application for a financial management order was dismissed after a contested hearing.
On dismissal of the appeal, on 27 November 2015, I reserved all questions of costs and adjourned the proceedings until 22 February 2016 for consideration of the question of costs and any incidental business.
As mentioned in C versus W <case> at <case>- <case>, the "incidental business" I had in mind was preparation by the first, second and third defendants of a summary form of accounting by them of their stewardship of the affairs of the fourth defendant. Optimistically, I hoped that provision of such a summary would provide a firm, practical footing for ongoing management of the fourth defendant's affairs unaccompanied by earlier rancour between her four children.
My optimism was misplaced. The first, second and third defendants did not, in a timely fashion, take up my invitation that they provide a summary form of accounting. Not until 19 February 2016 did they provide to the plaintiff, in an unverified form, detailed financial information about their stewardship of the fourth defendant's estate and its current size and composition.
That led to an adjournment of the proceedings on 22 February 2016 with directions designed to have the parties engage in a dialogue. By orders made in chambers, by consent, on 18 March 2016, those directions were varied, bringing the proceedings back before the Court on 4 April 2016. On that date, with fresh directions providing for further written submissions, the parties agreed that what remained of the proceedings be referred to chambers for my consideration.
The result of this procedural history is that: * (a) the parties are at issue as to the costs of the proceedings generally; * (b) the plaintiff invites the Court to make an order (under [section 41(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) NSW) that the fourth defendant's estate be managed by the NSW Trustee as a protected estate; and * (c) the first, second and third defendants invite the Court to make an order (under [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) of the [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) NSW or otherwise) relieving them of any liability they might otherwise have for breaches of fiduciary obligations owed to the fourth defendant.

THE [TRUSTEE ACT 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) NSW, [Section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) [Section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) of the [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) provides that where a trustee is or may be personally liable for a breach of trust the Court may relieve the trustee, wholly or partly, from personal liability for the breach if satisfied that the trustee has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach and for omitting to obtain the direction of the Court in the matter in which the trustee committed the breach. Via definitions of "trustee" and "trust" found in [section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s5.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) operates in favour of a constructive trustee.
No submission has been made to the effect that [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) has no application to the present case. The plaintiff contends that her siblings, and another family member acting under their direction, are constructive trustees of property of the fourth defendant. Her submissions have been confined to contentions that the statutory criteria for an order under the section have not been satisfied. There is no need, in these proceedings, to explore the implications for [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) of authoritative judicial statements to the effect that, although "guardianship" involves fiduciary obligations of a distinctive character, it does not involve a relationship of trustee and beneficiary in the strict sense: Clay versus Clay <case>; [(2001) 202 CLR 410] at 428-433, especially 430[40] citing Countess of Bective versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1932) 47 CLR 417 at 420-421
The inherent protective jurisdiction of the Court having been invoked, a determination of the question whether there should be an order relieving any person of personal liability they might otherwise have, vis-a-vis the fourth defendant as a person in need of protection, requires consideration of principles broader in scope than those found in the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html); but ultimately, something analogous to the section.
On an exercise of protective jurisdiction, an application to be relieved of personal liability for a breach of fiduciary obligations vis-a-vis a person in need of protection may be dealt with by reference to criteria substantially similar to those encapsulated in [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) provided that a reading of the words "acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused" found in the section is informed by principles governing an exercise of protective jurisdiction, particularly the foundational requirement that the welfare and interests of the person in need of protection be afforded paramount consideration.

FACTUAL CONTEXT
A mass of material has been placed before the Court bearing on the questions identified for determination. The plaintiff, in particular, has taken an opportunity to re-agitate the case she unsuccessfully advanced in the NCAT proceedings.
Despite irregularities attending management of the affairs of the fourth defendant by or under the direction of her co-defendants as, and for some time after, they took over control of her affairs, I am not satisfied that their management of her affairs has been other than for her benefit, and in her interests. On the contrary, I am satisfied that the fourth defendant's sons have, at all times, endeavoured and, in substance, have succeeded in their endeavours, to do right by her.
Any irregularities attending management of the fourth defendant's affairs stem from two features of the case. First, her sons delegated day-to-day management of her affairs to another family member working voluntarily, as families do, under their general supervision. Secondly, they did not ensure that funds of the fourth defendant remained at all times separate; there was, for a time, an intermingling of personal funds and those of the fourth defendant that, innocent and well-meaning though it was, ought not to have occurred.
I am satisfied that, under imperatives arising from the pendency of these proceedings, all irregularities have been appropriately addressed, inter alia, in a detailed affidavit sworn on 18 March 2016 by the family member to whom the fourth defendant's sons delegated day-to-day management of their mother's affairs. That affidavit, adopted in contemporaneous affidavits sworn by the fourth defendant's sons, provides (in paragraphs 9-14) a summary of those affairs that can be taken as a foundation for future assessments of the fourth defendant's financial circumstances. I accept that management of her estate has been regularised.
If, in breach of fiduciary obligations, the sons of the fourth defendant (or their delegate) diminished the estate of the fourth defendant in circumstances (applying principles discussed in Re Dawson (deceased) [1966] 2 NSWLR 211; 84 WN [(Pt 1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s1.html) 399; Maguire versus Makeronis <case>; [(1997) 188 CLR 449] in which they might have been required to restore property to the fourth defendant, they have, in substance, made good the estate (by separating funds earlier mixed and by apportioning interest to allow the fourth defendant her due), bearing in mind principles that govern an exercise of protective jurisdiction and equitable principles governing the obligation of a guardian, or the like, to account for the property of a person under his or her care.
The fourth defendant's estate is not, by any means, large. In substance, it comprises a nursing home bond of $350,000; cash deposits of the order of $112,000; and an entitlement to income, and occasional payments out of capital if needed, from a $400,000 trust fund established by her late husband. She is secure in her nursing home accommodation.

COSTS ORDERS: APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES
The costs of the current proceedings, including but not limited to the appeal from NCAT determined on 27 November 2015, can be dealt with in accordance with the principles identified in CCR versus PS (No 2) [(1986) 6 NSWLR 622] at 640E-G. In short, the question is: In all the circumstances, what are the proper orders for costs?
In approaching that question, account should be taken of the present, and prospective, financial circumstances of the fourth defendant as a person who, incapable of self-management, is entitled to the protection of the Court. There can have been no justification for these proceedings, or the NCAT proceedings preceding them, but for competing claims to be acting in the interests of the fourth defendant as a person in need of protection.

THE PROTECTIVE JURISDICTION AND THE LIABILITY TO ACCOUNT
The business transacted by the Court, through the vehicle of the current proceedings, following dismissal of the appeal from NCAT, has engaged the general jurisdiction of the Court including, principally, the Court's inherent, protective jurisdiction and the power of the Court under [section 41(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) to appoint a protected estate manager.
That a person involved in management of the affairs of a person incapable of self-management (whether as guardian, attorney, financial manager or carer of the incapable person) generally owes a fiduciary duty to the incapable person is unremarkable and, in the circumstances of this case, can be taken as a given: GE Dal Pont, Powers of Attorney (LexisNexis Butterworths, Australia, 2nd ed, 2015), para 2.30.
So too can the proposition that such a fiduciary is, generally, in the abstract, liable to account for his or her dealings with property of the incapable person: Dal Pont, op. cit. paras 8.51-8.58. As Countess of Bective versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1932) 47 CLR 417 at 420-423 demonstrates, the nature of that liability may vary according to the nature of the particular fiduciary relationship.
Whether a fiduciary can be held liable to account referrable to a breach of duty depends upon the scope of his or her fiduciary duty, a question that may require close attention to the nature of the particular relationship between fiduciary and beneficiary, and is inherently fact-sensitive.
The question whether a person involved in management of the affairs of an incapable person should be granted an order of the Court relieving him or her of personal liability for a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the incapable person requires, at the outset, consideration of the nature and purpose of the Court's protective jurisdiction, and the nature of the liability to account to which a person involved in management of the affairs of an incapable person may be subject.
The nature of the Court's inherent protective jurisdiction is authoritatively elaborated in Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services versus JWB and SMB (Marion's Case) <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 218] at 243. In short, the Court has an inherent, protective jurisdiction to do what is for the benefit of an incapable person, a person in need of protection because incapable of taking care of himself or herself. The jurisdiction is governed by its protective purpose.
Similar principles inform an exercise of the Court's jurisdiction under the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) by reference, inter alia, to a statement of general principles found in [section 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s39.html) of the Act. The first stated of those principles is that the welfare and interests of a protected person should be given paramount consideration.
What is done, or not done, upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction must be measured against what is in the interests, and for the benefit, of the person in need of protection: Holt versus Protective Commissioner <case> and 540 [150].
The protective jurisdiction, so applied, recognises that voluntary allowances might reasonably be made from the estate of a person under the protection of the Court in favour of the incapable person's family or carers: Ex parte Whitbread in the Matter of Hinde, a Lunatic <case>; [(1816) 2 Mer 99]
Although a person entrusted with management functions referrable to the affairs of an incapable person, or a person who takes upon himself or herself the role of a manager of such affairs, has the obligations of a fiduciary (towards the incapable person as his or her "beneficiary"), not necessarily those of a trustee, to account for dealings with the property of the incapable person, what is required by way of an accounting in such a case must take into account the nature of the particular relationship between "fiduciary" and "beneficiary" and the purposive character of an exercise of protective jurisdiction. Different considerations may apply in the context of a family, one member of which is incapable of self-management, than those that may apply in the context of management services provided by a commercial manager. The present case falls within the former category, not the latter.
Equitable principles governing the obligation of a fiduciary to account operate in sympathy with those governing an exercise of protective jurisdiction, as one would expect from their common historical foundations in decisions of the Lord Chancellor.
The Court's insistence that those engaged in the care of the person or estate of an incapable person (loosely, a "guardian") owe the obligations of a fiduciary to that person (loosely, a "beneficiary"), and that those obligations may be strictly enforced if a need to do so arises, is coupled with an appreciation that the law in operation is governed by the purpose it serves: protection of a person in need of protection because of an incapacity for self-management. The law endeavours to give due recognition to the particular circumstances of an incapable person as an individual, recognising the community in which he or she lives, and respecting his or her autonomy as a member of that community.
A seminal statement of the principles to be applied in this context can be found in the judgement of Dixon J in Countess of Bective versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1932) 47 CLR 417 at 420-423: "... an obligation to apply moneys in the maintenance of children or others does not involve the liability which arises from an ordinary trust. It is a general rule that guardians of infants, committees of the person of lunatics and others who are entrusted with funds to be expended in the maintenance and support of persons under their care are not liable to account as trustees.
They need not vouch the items of their expenditure, and, if they fulfil the obligation of maintenance in a manner commensurate with the income available to them for the purpose, an account will not be taken. Often the person to be maintained is a member of a family enjoying the advantages of a common establishment; always the end in view is to supply the daily wants of an individual, to provide for his comfort, edification and amusement, and to promote his happiness. It would defeat the very purpose for which the fund is provided, if its administration were hampered by the necessity of identifying, distinguishing, apportioning and recording every item of expenditure and vindicating its propriety. Although these considerations furnish an independent foundation for the general rule yet, after all, it is a doctrine regulating the application of moneys payable under an instrument, whether a will, a settlement or an order of a Court of equity, and the operation of the doctrine must depend upon the provisions contained in the instrument, both express and implied. But the effect of the instrument will often be governed by the circumstances to which it was intended to apply, and, in particular, by a consideration of the nature of the actual abode, the condition of the household and the state of the family of the infant or other person to be maintained. Courts of equity have not disguised the fact that the general rule gives to a parent or guardian dispensing the fund an opportunity of gaining incidental benefits, but the nature and extent of the advantages permitted must depend peculiarly upon the intention ascribed to the instrument. ... 
A guardian is not permitted to receive moneys for maintenance without liability to account except upon the condition that he discharges his duty adequately to maintain and not otherwise. Upon his default the Court will administer the fund or intercept the payments and has jurisdiction to order an account or an inquiry... . Where, however, the condition is performed the
Court does not inquire whether the moneys has been completely expended or whether the recipient has spent small sums for his personal benefit but, nevertheless, it remains an allowance to a person in a fiduciary capacity and for a definite purpose."
These observations were endorsed in Clay versus Clay <case>; [(2001) 202 CLR 410] [37]) also endorsed the following extract from Scott and Fratcher, The Law of Trusts (4th ed, 1987, vol 1, para 7): "A guardian of the property of a person who is under an incapacity is a trustee in the broad sense of the term. He is under a duty to his ward to deal with the property for the latter's benefit. Like a trustee, a guardian is a fiduciary. He is not, however, a trustee in the strict sense. He is entrusted with the possession and management of his ward's property but he does not take title to it. Actions against third persons with respect to the property are brought in the name of the ward, whereas trustees sue in their own names."
The Court's observations at [202 CLR 432[46]] - 433[49] also bear repetition (omitting some footnote references and incorporating others in the text): "Breach of fiduciary duty  . We should add that, in any event, we do not accept the reasoning whereby the Full Court concluded that Mrs Clay acted in breach of her fiduciary duties as guardian in acquiring Queenslea Drive from the estate of her late husband to provide a home for herself and the children. It is a truism that the scope of her fiduciary duty was, to adopt the words of Mason J <case>; [(1984) 156 CLR 41] at 102; see also Maguire versus Makaronis <case>; [(1997) 188 CLR 449] at 463-464], to be "moulded according to the nature of the relationship and the facts of the case". His Honour also observed that, in some cases, "the so-called rule that the fiduciary cannot allow a conflict to arise between duty and interest... cannot be usefully applied in the absolute terms in which it has been stated" <case>; [(1984) 156 CLR 41] at 102-103].  . Further, it is as well here to bear in mind the statement by Deane J in Chan versus Zacharia [(1984) 154 CLR 178 at 205]: "[O]ne cannot but be conscious of the danger that the over-enthusiastic and unnecessary statement of broad general principles of equity in terms of inflexibility may destroy the vigour which it is intended to promote in that it will exclude the ordinary interplay of the doctrines of equity and the adjustment of general principles to particular facts and changing circumstances and convert equity into an instrument of hardship and injustice in individual cases. There is 'no better mode of undermining the sound doctrines of equity than to make unreasonable and inequitable applications of them'." . The passage in the judgment of Dixon J in Countess of Bective [(1932) CLR 417 at 420-421], set out earlier in these reasons, illustrates the application to the relationship of guardian and ward of the points made by
Mason J in Hospital Products Ltd versus United States Surgical Corporation and
Deane J in Chan versus Zacharia. In the present case, the Full Court correctly explained <case>; [(1999) 20 WAR 427] at 454] that, at the relevant time, the children, as residuary beneficiaries of the unadministered estate, neither beneficially owned nor had beneficial interests in Queenslea Drive. This was not a case of a guardian buying either the property of the ward or the beneficial interest of the ward in property.  . The result is that neither of the special rules, identified as the "self-dealing rule" and the "fair-dealing rule", applied in the circumstances of this litigation. ..."
In Ability One Financial Management Pty Ltd & Anor versus JB by his Tutor AB  <case> at <case> and [328] I found assistance in Brown versus Smith [(1878) 10 ChD 377] at 386, I took into account an assessment that, had the manager applied for an order for remuneration at the time of its appointment, the likelihood is that such an order would have been made. I also found that the manager had generally acted "honestly and reasonably", to paraphrase the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), [section 85.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html)
In Woodward versus Woodward, White J held a financial manager liable to account to the executor of the deceased estate of the protected person in circumstances in which, in purported performance of his duties as manager of the protected estate, he had (to paraphrase Brown versus Smith [(1878) 10 ChD 377] at 381-382 recognition was given to the need (expressly noticed in Countess of Bective versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1932) 47 CLR 417 at 420-423) not to impose upon a guardian, operating in a close family relationship with an incapable person, a strict obligation to account for expenditure to the dollar: one must look at the whole circumstances of the case, making a fair allowance for performance of the protective function. In a family context, in which shared experience not uncommonly involves communal use of personal property, there is no invitation to licence or unconscionable conduct in acknowledgement that accounting for property does not in every case allow, or require, a precise mathematical exercise of the type expected in a commercial context.
Resonance, if not guidance, may be found in the seminal judgment of Lord Eldon in Ex Parte Whitbread in the matter of Hinde, a Lunatic <case>; [(1816) 2 Mer 99] at 550; Nock versus Austin (1918) 25 CLR 519 at 529-530.
Thus it is that the Court does not seek to impose upon a guardian, protected estate manager or the like (including, in the present case, an enduring guardian and an enduring attorney) an accounting obligation unmindful of that person's particular relationship with the person under his or her care and of a need to assess whether the person in need of care has been, is and will be properly cared for by the fiduciary. This does not absolve a fiduciary from the foundational duty of a fiduciary to act, in the interests of the person under care, in good faith. Nor does it absolve a fiduciary from consequential duties, to avoid conflict between duty and interest and not to obtain an unsanctioned profit, or gain, from the office of the fiduciary. But it does require careful reflection by the Court, upon what is appropriate to the circumstances of the particular case, with an eye to the future as well as the past, in deciding whether there should be any (and, if so, what) curial intervention in the conduct of the affairs of an incapable person.

THE PROTECTIVE JURISDICTION: EXCUSABLE BREACHES OF DUTY
Drawing the threads of discussion together I venture to record (as a non-exhaustive statement of applicable principles) that, upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction involving an application by a guardian, or the like, to be relieved of personal liability for a breach of fiduciary obligations in management of the affairs of an incapable person: * (a) The purposive character of the jurisdiction must be constantly borne in mind; an exercise of protective jurisdiction is governed by the purpose for which the jurisdiction exists (protection of those not able to take care of themselves): Marion's case <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 218] at 228B-C and 241A-B and F-G; [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/), [section 39.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s39.html) * (c) Consideration must be given (as illustrated by Countess of Bective versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1932) 47 CLR 417 at 420-423) to whether the fiduciary whose conduct is sought to be excused has, generally and as a matter of substance, discharged his or her obligation to take care of the person in need of protection, relative to: * (i) the terms of any formal instrument of appointment of the fiduciary to any office materially occupied by the fiduciary; * (ii) the basis upon which the fiduciary, formally or informally, assumed his or her fiduciary role vis-a-vis the person in need of protection; * (iii) the resources available for performance of the fiduciary's obligations; and * (iv) any impediments to due performance of those obligations * (d) Consideration might be given (as Brown versus Smith <case> and 540 [150].
* (f) Whatever is to be done, or not done, must be measured against what is in the interests, and for the benefit, of the person in need of protection: Holt versus Protective Commissioner at [31 NSWLR 238D-F] at 879.
* (h) Consideration should also be given to whether any loss, cost or other detriment, to the estate of the incapable person suffered, or likely to be suffered, as a consequence of conduct sought to be excused is of an order that falls within, or goes beyond, a dimension that can reasonably be accounted for on the ground of friendship, relationship, charity or other motives on which ordinary people act: Spong versus Spong <case>; [(1914) 18 CLR 544] at 550; Nock versus Austen (1918) 25 CLR 519 at 529-530.
* (i) An assessment of what is appropriate to the particular case requires that an eye be kept on the future, not directed only to the past.
These factors have a bearing on whether (to adapt the language of [section 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s85.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/)) a person "ought fairly" to be relieved, in whole or part, of personal liability for a breach of a fiduciary obligation, a question to which characterisation of the person's conduct as "honest" and/or "reasonable" may have significance.
Whether or not the conduct sought to be excused is "honest and reasonable", important though this may be, is not necessarily decisive upon an exercise of protective jurisdiction because, even if the conduct concerned was not both honest and reasonable, it may, exceptionally, be in the interests, and for the benefit, of the incapable person that it be excused and (as recognised in Marion's case at [175 CLR 258)] the limits and scope of the protective jurisdiction have not been, and cannot be, defined save by reference to the purpose for which it exists.

APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES TO FACTS
In the present case, the interests of the fourth defendant were best served by her co-defendants taking over management of her affairs, leading to recovery of property from the plaintiff, regularisation of her financial affairs and, in due course, her admission to residency in a nursing home. Although steps were taken, in the course of taking control of her property and in rationalisation of her affairs, that were irregular and should have been avoided, I am satisfied: first, that, in substance, what has been done has been done for her benefit and in her best interests; secondly, that the first, second and third defendants, and the family member to whom day to day tasks were delegated under their supervision, have acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for any breach of trust involved in steps taken in assuming management of the fourth defendant's affairs; and, thirdly, it is for the benefit, and it serves the interests, of the fourth defendant to bring to an end the litigation between her children that has engulfed her as its subject, its focal point.
Having formed this view, I decline to make protective estate management orders under [section 41(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s41.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/). I am satisfied, as was NCAT, to leave management of the affairs of the fourth defendant (her person and her estate) in the hands of her sons, instruments chosen by her as an enduring guardian and enduring attorneys.
With a view to bringing some peace to management of the fourth defendant's affairs I propose, also, to make an order relieving her sons (and their delegate) of any personal liability they might otherwise have for breaches of fiduciary obligations in management of her affairs in the period preceding the date (15 February 2016) to which accounts were prepared in support of the formal statement of her financial circumstances verified on 18 March 2016.
Given that this order is made upon an exercise of the Court's protective jurisdiction, it is no impediment to the making of the order that the family member to whom the fourth defendant's sons delegated tasks has not been joined as a party in the proceedings. The Court's order operates as a direction in management of the fourth defendant's estate. It binds her and her privies.

THE "PROPER ORDERS" FOR COSTS
Had irregularities in management of the fourth defendant's affairs by her sons, and their delegate, not occurred or had they been promptly and simply explained, an order that the plaintiff pay the whole of the defendants' costs of the proceedings (on the ordinary basis) would have been a proper order. The plaintiff's adversarial pursuit of her brothers, using her mother as a proxy, went beyond the reasonable, a fact illustrated by her abandonment of her "guardianship" appeal during the course of the proceedings and by her subsequent endeavour to re-agitate her NCAT case after dismissal of her appeal.
The plaintiff appears not to have appreciated a fundamental difference in the dynamics of an exercise of (managerial) protective jurisdiction, as distinct from those attending an exercise of (adversarial) equity jurisdiction. As Theobald put it (in The Law Relating to Lunacy at page 382), an important distinction must be borne in mind: "Chancery practice is directed to litigation ... [practice in the protective jurisdiction] should be directed to administration without strife in the simplest and least expensive way".
In all the circumstances of the case, the proper orders as to costs appear to me to be orders that provide, first, for the plaintiff to bear her own costs of the proceedings; secondly, for the costs of the first, second and third defendants up to and including 27 November 2015, assessed on the indemnity basis (which costs are said to be of the order of $37,500.00) to be paid by the plaintiff or charged against so much, if any, of the estate of the fourth defendant as may survive her, in equal proportions; thirdly, for the order for costs of the first, second and third defendants to be charged against the estate of the fourth defendant to be stayed during the lifetime of the fourth defendant; and fourthly, for the first, second and third defendants otherwise to pay or bear their own costs of the proceedings.
Having defended the appeal, in effect, as representatives of the fourth defendant, her sons should have their costs of the appeal borne by the plaintiff (as the unsuccessful moving party in the proceedings) or the fourth defendant, in whose interests they defended the appeal. Their delays in the provision of an accounting for their stewardship of the fourth defendant's affairs were sufficient to warrant no orders for costs being made referrable to that phase of the proceedings, following dismissal of the appeal.
Although the plaintiff's conduct of the appeal was largely adversarial in character - sufficiently so to warrant an order that she bear a proportion of her brothers' costs of the appeal - and attended by a belated abandonment of a substantial part of her case, her conduct of the proceedings was not purely adversarial in character. I cannot say that her sole motivation for the appeal was pursuit of self-interest, or personal vindication, as opposed to protection of the fourth defendant. For that reason, I venture that an appropriate order is that the plaintiff bear one half of the burden of her brothers' costs of the appeal. Some allowance should be made for the fact that, by conducting proceedings in the Court, she moved beyond a "no costs" forum: cf, Re Kerry (No 2) - Costs  <case> at <case>.
The advanced age of the fourth defendant; the size, nature and composition of her assets; and her nursing home residence, provide grounds for confidence that a charge of part of her sons' costs against her deceased estate is unlikely to have any practical effect upon management of her estate in the meantime or, in any way, to influence her family's decision-making about what is to be done in management of her affairs generally. If the position were otherwise, a case for appointment of the NSW Trustee as her protected estate manager could emerge from the embers of these proceedings. An order, in effect, charging costs against her deceased estate is not to impede an application of her estate, for her benefit, in the meantime. The full amount of her estate remains available for her maintenance, if required.

ORDERS
Accordingly, I make orders to the following effect: * (1) ORDER that the first, second and third defendants (and their delegate) jointly and severally be relieved from any personal liability they might otherwise have for any breach of trust committed in management of the affairs of the fourth defendant up to and including 15 February 2016.
* (2) ORDER that the plaintiff pay or bear her own costs of these proceedings.
* (3) ORDER that the first, second and third defendants' costs of the proceedings up to and including 27 November 2015, assessed on the indemnity basis, be paid (as to one half) by the plaintiff and (as to the balance) be charged against so much, if any, of the estate of the fourth defendant as may survive her.
* (4) ORDER that the first, second and third defendants otherwise pay or bear their own costs of the proceedings.
* (5) ORDER that Order 3 be stayed during the lifetime of the fourth defendant insofar as it operates as a charge on the estate of the fourth defendant, but not otherwise.
