HIDDEN J: 
The Appellant, Francis Xavier McGoldrick, was tried in the Parramatta District
Court on two charges of supplying heroin and a charge of possessing an unlicensed firearm. He was found guilty of all three charges and was sentenced effectively to imprisonment for nine years, comprising a minimum term of six years and nine months and an additional term of two years and three months. He appeals against his convictions and seeks leave to appeal against sentence.

At the relevant time the appellant was working at a car yard at Homebush where mobile homes and cars were sold. (As it happens, he was a prisoner on a works release programme.) The first count charged the supply of heroin between 1
June and 29 November 1993, and alleged a course of dealing over that period.
The Crown relied upon evidence derived from police surveillance of the premises, including video tapes of various activities there and recordings of conversations obtained through a listening device. The behaviour observed and the terms of the conversations recorded were said to be consistent with the supply of drugs.

On 29 November 1993 police went to the premises. A black bag was found, said to be in the possession of the appellant, which contained a blender, scales and revolver cartridges. Some years later (apparently at the request of the
Director of Public Prosecutions) the scales and blender were examined and traces of heroin were found on them. In another part of the premises police found a revolver for which the cartridges found in the black bag were suitable, and this gave rise to the count of possession of an unlicensed firearm.

The appellant was arrested at the premises by Detective Senior Sergeant
Chidgey in company with Detective Sergeant Riddle. He was later conveyed to
Flemington police station where he was taken to an interview room and searched. The Crown case was that Chidgey told the appellant that he intended to search him and asked him to remove his clothes. The appellant did so, handing his clothes to Riddle. Riddle found three bags of white powder, later established to contain heroin, in the pocket of the appellant's jeans. Chidgey said, "I believe that this powder substance is heroin and I intend to ask you some further questions about it." He then cautioned the appellant who declined to answer questions. It was this evidence which gave rise to the second count of supplying heroin, based upon the deeming provision in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s29.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/).

In his unsworn statement to the jury the appellant denied any knowledge of those bags of heroin, suggesting that they had been "planted". He said that, when he took his jeans off and handed them to the police, he was given his shirt back. As he was putting his shirt on he heard Riddle say, "Hello, what have we got here?" He looked up and saw that Riddle had "a handful of plastic bags". He went on, "I just knew I was getting stitched up and I wasn't saying another word. I knew I didn't have it in there. ... so when he pulled the heroin out, well I just knew straight off it was a load." 
Ground 1 
Cross-examination of Sergeant Chidgey.

Counsel for the appellant at the trial (who did not appear in the appeal) wished to cross-examine Sergeant Chidgey about material which emanated from Mr
Trevor Haken, a former police officer who gave evidence in the Wood Royal
Commission. The effect of that evidence was that Chidgey had been a party to the receipt of a bribe from a suspected drug offender. It suggested that another police officer had received money from the suspect and passed it, or some of it, on to Chidgey who in turn gave it to Haken.

The line of cross-examination began with the question: "Now, your name has been mentioned in the Royal Commission hasn't it?" That question was objected to by the Crown prosecutor at the trial (who also did not appear in the appeal) and there is no doubt that the objection was well founded: R v
Beattie [(1996) 40 NSWLR 155], per
James J at 162-3. However, in the absence of the jury, the trial judge determined that the line of cross-examination was inadmissible even if questions were put in proper form. His Honour understood that counsel wished to put the matter to Chidgey as material going to his credit but held that it was not of "substantial probative value" within the meaning of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s193.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). In his reasons His Honour put it this way: "Here the allegation sought to impugn Detective Senior Sergeant Chidgey's evidence is not, as I see it, one of him accepting money from the accused or via an intermediatory (sic) policeman or otherwise and passing on to another policeman a sum of money from the accused. The allegation is that, it seems to me from what I have been able to glean from the evidence and from what I have been told by counsel, that the falsity of the evidence of Mr Chidgey is to be characterised in him being a party to, at the highest, party to planting the evidence upon the accused.

Accordingly, it seems to me that the evidence sought to be put...does not in those circumstances have substantial probative value and therefore I would rule that the questions are not allowable." 
His Honour referred to the judgment of James J in Beattie but, with respect, appears to have misunderstood it. In that case a new trial was ordered because the trial judge had prevented counsel for the accused from putting to a police witness certain material arising from evidence in the Wood
Royal Commission suggesting that the witness was corrupt. It seems that the trial judge did so because that material did not bear directly upon any issue in the trial. James J, with whom Grove J and Hamilton AJ agreed, said: "The trial judge appears to have rejected the questions on the ground that they were irrelevant and did not relate to the present case. However, in my opinion, an affirmative answer to either of the questions would have related to the credibility of the witness. Under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to the credibility of a witness. There is no need for evidence which is capable of affecting the credibility of a witness to be evidence about the facts in issue in the proceeding in which the witness is giving evidence. Under [Pt .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), there is a general rule that evidence which is relevant only to a witness' credibility is not admissible but this rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross- examination, if the evidence has substantial probative value. In my opinion, an admission made by the witness in an answer to either of the questions I am now dealing with would have had substantial probative value on the question of the witness' credibility and the fact that the witness might have been unlikely to make any such admission did not affect the admissibility of the questions." 
In Reg versus Hasencamp (CCA, unreported, 24th February 1988) James J referred to this passage in Beattie and emphasised that cross- examination of a police officer about complaints or allegations made in the
Royal Commission might have substantial probative value even though the material was not connected with the subject matter of the trial in which the officer was giving evidence. Indeed, it is clear from Hasencamp that it is not necessary to show that the conduct to be put to the witness is of the same general nature as that alleged in the trial: see the judgment of James J at pages 7-11.

It is in this respect that his Honour appears to have fallen into error in the present case. In effect, his Honour appears to have equated the test of substantial probative value under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s103.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) with that of tendency evidence under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) To do so is to give [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s103.html) far too narrow a focus. Clearly, material suggesting that a police officer has been guilty of corrupt conduct of any kind could have substantial probative value on the question of his or her credibility.

In this Court the Crown prosecutor did not submit to the contrary. However, he submitted that the evidence did not have substantial probative value because it was Riddle, not Chidgey, who claimed to have found the bags of heroin, and the circumstances were such that Chidgey would have had no opportunity to have planted them. The sad reality, however, is that the concoction of evidence against a suspect usually involves the co-operation of two or more police officers. At the trial it was put to Chidgey and Riddle that each had acted in concert with the other to fabricate evidence of the finding of the drug.

Of the two officers Chidgey was the more senior. If they were bent on fabricating evidence of this kind they might have secreted the drug in the interview room and one of them might have concealed it upon his person. It was not necessary for such a fabrication for the drug actually to have been placed into the pocket of the appellant's jeans. It is to be borne in mind that on the appellant's account he was not looking at Riddle at the time the drug was said to be found and he did not see anything taken from his pocket.
Significantly, when the drug was produced it was Chidgey who said that he believed the substance was heroin and that he wished to question the appellant about it. In my view, the fact that it was Riddle who claimed to have found the drug in no way lessened the importance of material touching upon the credit of Chidgey.

Grounds 2 and 3 
Refusal to grant certificate under [s 128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to Trevor Haken and to permit a voir dire examination in relation to that matter.

At the trial the appellant had further material with which to attack Sgt
Chidgey's evidence, emanating from a statutory declaration made by Mr Trevor
Haken in April 1997. It recounted two incidents during a period when Mr Haken worked with Chidgey and another officer in the drug squad. In the first incident Chidgey was alleged to have been party to the fabrication of evidence that a man in their custody was in possession of drugs, including the preparation of false statements to that effect. In the second Chidgey was said to have been involved in placing a pound of Indian hemp in the garden shed of a suspect and later purporting to find it during a sham search. Again, false statements were prepared which included a fabricated admission by the suspect of possession of the drug. Haken himself gave perjured evidence at the man's trial and he believed that Chidgey and the other officers did the same.

Counsel for the appellant at the trial was permitted to put this material to
Chidgey, who denied it vehemently. Mr Haken was called in the defence case. In examination-in-chief he was taken to the first of the incidents described in the statutory declaration (the man in custody being one Joe Russo). At that point the following exchange occurred: "Q. Can you please tell the court what happened in relation to Joe Russo? 
A. Your Honour, before I can answer that question this matter hasn't been dealt with by way of indemnification." 
Asked by his Honour whether he was willing to answer the question Mr Haken described himself as being "in an awkward position". Counsel for the appellant then sought a certificate under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and the
Crown prosecutor supported that application.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) provides as follows: "(1) This section applies if a witness objects to giving particular evidence on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the witness: has committed an offence against or arising under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country; or is liable to a civil penalty.

Subject to subsection (5), if the court finds that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the court is not to require the witness to give that particular evidence, and is to inform the witness: that he or she need not give the evidence; and that, if he or she gives the evidence, the court will give a certificate under this section; and of the effect of such a certificate.

If the witness gives the evidence, the court is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the evidence.

The court is also to cause a witness to be given a certificate under this section if: the objections has been overruled; and after the evidence has been given, the court finds that there were reasonable grounds for the objection.

If the court is satisfied that: the evidence concerned may tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or is liable to a civil penalty under, an
Australian law; and the evidence does not tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or is liable to a civil penalty under, a law of a foreign country; and the interests of justice require that the witness give the evidence; the court may require the witness to give the evidence.

If the court so requires, it is to cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the evidence.

If any proceeding in an Australian court: evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given; and evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person having given evidence; cannot be used against the person. However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence.

In a criminal proceeding, this section does not apply in relation to the giving of evidence by a defendant, being evidence that the defendant: did an act the doing of which is a fact in issue; or had a state of mind the existence of which is a fact in issue.

A reference in this section to doing an act includes a reference to failing to act." 
In the absence of the jury, Haken explained, in answer to questions from his
Honour, that he did not believe that such indemnity from prosecution has had been granted to him for the purpose of the Wood Royal Commission extended to the matters about which he was to give evidence. The Crown prosecutor again informed his Honour that he did not oppose the grant of a certificate.
Nevertheless, his Honour declined to do so on the basis that he was not satisfied that there were reasonable ground for Haken's objection to giving evidence: [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) 
His Honour's reasons for this decision appear to be twofold: firstly, on the face of the statutory declaration Haken did not implicate himself in the first incident involving Mr Russo and, secondly, Haken was unable to say with any certainty that he was not already indemnified in respect of the matter. As to the first matter, I must say that the statutory declaration conveys to me that
Haken was a party to the fabrication of evidence and himself prepared a statement in furtherance of that fabrication. However, that matter and the question of the extent of his indemnity could have been clarified by his examination on the voir dire. An application by counsel for the appellant to do just that was refused.

What happened thereafter is puzzling. According to the transcript, after expressing his conclusion that a certificate should not be granted his Honour said, "In that event, I can only reject the question." If that is what his
Honour said, the "question" could only have been the one set out above which led to Haken's objection to giving evidence. However, in the light of his
Honour's ruling that there were no reasonable grounds for that objection Haken should have been compelled to answer that question (and any others bearing upon the matter at hand).

It may be that the word "question" is a mis-transcription, and that what his
Honour said in fact was that he rejected "the application". This would make more sense of what then ensued. His Honour asked counsel for the appellant what was to be "the next position" and counsel said that he proposed to ask
Haken some further questions. The transcript then contains the laconic notation "In the presence of the jury - no cross examination - witness retired." What actually happened at that point we shall never know. Suffice it to say that that is the last the jury saw of Mr Haken.

Again, in this court the Crown prosecutor did not attempt to defend what had occurred. Clearly, his Honour should have acceded to the joint application of counsel at the trial for the grant of a certificate under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) At the very least, he should have allowed Mr Haken to be examined on the voir dire about matters touching on that discretion. The Crown prosecutor's argument was, however, that the evidence of Mr Haken was inadmissible. This, I might add, had been the position taken by his colleagues at the trial in argument before Mr Haken was called. His Honour considered the evidence admissible under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s106.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). That section provides that, in certain circumstances, evidence may be led to prove a matter going to the credibility of a witness when that matter has not been admitted by the witness in cross-examination. However, it does not appear that the material to be led from Mr Haken falls into any of the categories set out in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s106.html) As the Crown prosecutor submitted in this court, the evidence was admissible, if at all, as tendency evidence under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) 
To be admissible on that basis the evidence had to have "significant probative value": [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and see Reg versus Lockyer [(1996) 89 A Crim R 457] at
The Crown prosecutor submitted that it did not have the probative value in the light of the matters which he raised in opposition to the previous ground of appeal: that it was not Chidgey who claimed to have found the drugs and he would have had no opportunity to place them in the pocket of the appellant's jeans. For the reasons I expressed in relation to that previous ground, I reject that argument. What was being suggested was that Chidgey was a party to the planting of drugs on a suspect. Evidence that he was involved in exactly the same kind of activity on two previous occasions would clearly have significant probative value.

Ground 4 
His Honour's directions to the jury in relation to the cross-examination of Sergeant Chidgey.

This ground relates to some directions given by his Honour to the jury arising from the fact that the material the subject of Mr Haken's statutory declaration had been put to Chidgey but Haken himself gave no evidence about it. His Honour was merely giving the usual direction where a matter has been put to a witness and denied, and no evidence has been produced to establish it. No redirection was sought at the trial. The complaint about these directions was barely pressed in argument before us any is, in any event, without substance.

Grounds 5 and 6 
Evidence about a firearm other than that the subject of count 3 and directions about that evidence.

In one of the taped conversations, admitted over objection, the appellant is heard to speak to a man referred to as Sam about his "new gun". He is also heard to say, "I'm just gunna load it up, fuck these Arabs up, the fucken bastards ...". The weapon is referred to in the conversation as either a
Beretta or a Browning. Clicking sounds can be heard suggesting that some part of the gun is being manipulated. Evidence was led from a ballistics expert that those sounds are consistent with the mechanism of a self loading pistol (of which Beretta and Browning are common brands) rather than revolver. The gun the subject of the third count is a revolver, and it follows that that is not the gun being discussed in the taped conversation.

His Honour held the evidence of that conversation admissible on the basis "that it is probative and I think it outweighs the prejudice involved", although it does not appear that the argument of counsel for the appellant was confined to the balancing exercise required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). From the final address of the Crown prosecutor at the trial (which was recorded) it seems that it was relied upon merely to show that something far more serious than the sale of vehicles was going on at the car yard. Before us, the Crown prosecutor argued that possession of any gun was consistent with the need for protection of a man engaged in an illicit and dangerous trade.

I must say that I consider it, at best, of tenuous relevance: cf Driscoll v
The Queen <case>; [(1977) 137 CLR 517] per Gibbs J at 530-4. It certainly portrayed the appellant as a man capable of violence, and even if it were relevant, the proper exercise of the statutory discretion compelled its rejection in the light of its prejudicial effect.

For the appellant it was argued that the portion of summing up in which this evidence was referred to could have conveyed to the jury that the gun being discussed in the taped conversation was the gun the subject of the third count. In my view, his Honour's observations cannot fairly be read in that way and, again, no redirection was sought at the trial. This complaint also is without substance.

The Proviso 
It is clear, then, that the trial was affected by a number of error. However, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the convictions should stand because those errors had not led to a substantial miscarriage of justice. He argued that the
Crown case on the first count was strong, noting that it emanated from surveillance, including video and audio tapes, and certainly did not turn on the credibility of Snr Sgt Chidgey. Further, he argued that the strength of the evidence on the first count lent support to the second and third counts: particularly the second, which was founded upon evidence of the appellant's possession of heroin at the time of his arrest. Sgt Chidgey was not involved at all in the finding of the revolver the subject of the third count.

I have given the evidence careful consideration and there is no doubt that there was a strong case against the appellant on the first count.
Nevertheless, it was a circumstantial case and one of the circumstances upon which the Crown relied was the alleged finding of heroin on the person of the appellant the subject of the second count. The evidence of Mr Haken, and the cross-examination of Sgt Chidgey which was disallowed, might have affected the jury's assessment of the evidence in respect of both of those counts. Further, the wrongful admission of the taped conversation concerning the self loading pistol could have prejudiced the jury in their consideration not only of the third count but of the other counts as well.

Accordingly, I am not persuaded that, despite the identified errors, there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice. I would propose that the appeal be allowed and a new trial ordered.
