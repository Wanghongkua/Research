EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: The Court is dealing with an objection by the Crown to the tender of a document by the accused. The accused seeks to tender documents, that he says are exculpatory. Amounts, the Crown says, are undeclared income of the accused are treated as loans in these documents. I allow the tender.
I do so on the basis that the document is a business record.
While the veracity of the contents of the documents may ultimately be the subject of contest because they were compiled by persons seeking to exculpate the accused, nevertheless they are matters that can properly and fairly be dealt with in submissions to the jury.
It seems to me that the document, notwithstanding that it dates from a time after the offences in question, could rationally affect directly or indirectly the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, being the relationship between the accused, the companies, and the purchase of the property. I will admit the document.
Lastly, the Crown relies on [s 135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). While the weight or acceptability of the material is ultimately a matter for the jury, in a sense, I consider the probative value is not outweighed by any unfairness that cannot be dealt with appropriately by the Crown.
