EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
By summons filed in the Registry of this Court on 6 August 2015 the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, seeks an order pursuant to [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) ("the Act") in relation to assets and other property interests which are owned or controlled by Bernhard Stevermuer. He is the defendant in the proceedings.
Before the Court in support of the application there is a bundle of evidentiary material including Ex A, which is an affidavit of John Patrick Egan sworn 17 August 2015. In his affidavit Mr Egan deposes that on 6 August 2015 at about 11.30 in the morning Mr Egan met with the defendant at a location in Fairy Meadow and served him with a bundle of documents relevant to the proceedings. The documents included a letter of 6 August 2015 addressed to the defendant from a solicitor with the Crime Commission, a copy of an affidavit of Jonathan Spark of the Crime Commission which is Ex B, a sealed copy of the summons which the Court is now addressing, and a sealed copy of the Statements of Facts and Circumstances filed as part of the evidentiary material which is before the Court, with a copy of the draft orders that the New South Wales Crime Commission seeks from the Court pursuant to this application.
On the basis of that evidence from Mr Egan I am satisfied that the defendant has been served with the relevant process and is aware of the proceedings which are listed today. Indeed the defendant has been a party to consent orders when the matter has been listed before the Registrar on previous occasions - 10 August, 25 August and 8 September of 2015. It was indicated on those occasions before the Registrar that the defendant intended to consent to the orders sought by the Crime Commission.
Although I am satisfied that the defendant is aware of today's proceedings, he has not attended; nor has any solicitor or other legal representative attended on his behalf. [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act gives the Court power to proceed on an ex parte basis and I propose to proceed in accordance with [s 10A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html)
The evidence upon which the Crime Commission relies is principally the affidavit of Mr Spark sworn 5 August 2015, and a bundle of evidentiary material Ex JLS1 before the Court. Mr Spark is employed by the New South Wales Crime Commission as the Director of Financial Investigations and he is an authorised officer within the meaning of [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). He is a person authorised in writing by the Crime Commission to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) and [Pt 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/index.html#p4) of the Act.
As part of his duties Mr Spark has access to various computerised records including records held by the New South Wales Police Force by Land Property Information New South Wales, that being a unit of Finances and Services within the Treasury. He has access to the records of the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services and, through Crime Commission staff, access to the ASIC data base.
Mr Spark deposes that the defendant, who uses a number of spellings of both his first name and surname, is a person who he believed to have been engaged in serious crime related activity within the meaning of that phrase as defined in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the Act.
The defendant is charged with an offence of knowingly participating in a criminal group contrary to [s 93T(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s93t.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), that being an offence which falls within the definition of "serious criminal offence" pursuant to [s 6(2)(g1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). The basis of the suspicion held by Mr Spark as to the defendant's engagement in serious criminal activity is based upon the inquiries of the New South Wales Police. Those inquiries have determined that the defendant was charged with a series of criminal offences including dealing with the property being suspected of proceeds of crime, and knowingly participate in a criminal group.
On the evidence before the Court the defendant was charged with these criminal offences by the New South Wales Police on 8 July 2014. In brief, the facts of the charge against the defendant are these. In April 2014 police from the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad commenced a particular Strike Force which had the task of investigating a criminal group believed to be supplying prohibited drugs in the Sydney area. During the course of the investigation by that Strike Force it became apparent to the police that there were two criminal groups in operation, one operating within Australia and one operating from an international location. The defendant was identified as a person who was a participant in the international leg of the operation. The police investigations revealed that the defendant and persons associated with him internationally were responsible for the importation of prohibited drugs, and the precursor materials with which to manufacture prohibited drugs in Australia.
There were related activities relevant to the laundering of money obtained through drug supply and that money laundering operation took place by the purchase, and operation of an aircraft and training maintenance business. Indeed more than one such business was in operation.
The defendant is a person qualified to fly aircraft and he holds a commercial pilot's licence. He is the sole director of a company known as Always Airborne. The object of the business was to purchase airplanes which were then leased or sold on for profit.
The defendant was contacted by persons engaged in drug supply and importation activities principally it appears, because of the nature of the business that he operated, and his access to and ability to fly aircraft. Subsequently a number of aircrafts were purchased with the defendant operating as something of a conduit between persons engaged in criminal activity and financiers. There were some significant financial transactions discovered by police investigators including the transfer of money between a number of persons located in China and Hong Kong.
On 14 February 2014 a particular aircraft was purchased and the defendant was enlisted to fly the aircraft to the Philippines, with the defendant returning from the Philippines on a commercial flight. Subsequently the defendant returned to the Philippines, collected the aircraft and flew it to a location in Malaysia. From Malaysia the defendant flew the aircraft to Coffs Harbour having come from the west of the country to the east coast. Subsequent to that the defendant was involved in the purchase of another aircraft in Malaysia, of a flight training and charter business in New South Wales, and other associated assets. There was some considerable activity in acquiring assets connected with the conduct of these various businesses and substantial amounts of money appear to have changed hands.
On 8 July 2014 the police executed a search warrant upon the defendant's residential premises at an address in Fairy Meadow. The sum of $40,000 in cash was found at the residence made up entirely of $50 notes. The cash was subjected to DNA testing and that DNA testing linked the cash to the defendant. A search of the defendant's motor vehicle found a further sum of some $30,000, again made up in denomination of $50 notes. The defendant has no legitimate business or personal records which would explain his possession of such large sums of cash.
It was the view of the investigating police, substantiated by the defendant's plea of guilty to the relevant offence, and is the suspicion of Mr Spark, that the cash and other assets are the proceeds of crime, the crime being the large scale supply of drugs, and trafficking in drugs.
The defendant's role was principally to act as an aviator, a role for which he received, it would appear, substantial cash benefits together with the unrestricted use of the various aircrafts purchased by the criminal syndicate.
As noted, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charges against him in the Local Court at Port Kembla. He was sentenced by Magistrate Stoddart on 22 May 2015 in relation to firstly, an offence of dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime and secondly, the offence of knowingly participate in a criminal group.
With respect to the first of the offences he received a term of imprisonment of eight months to commence on 22 May 2015 and expiring on 21 January 2016 with a non-parole period of six months specified.
In relation to the second of the offences the defendant was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 19 months to commence on 22 May 2015 expiring on 21 December 2016 with a non-parole period of nine months specified.
The Court result, which is at tab 4 of Ex JLS1, makes a reference to an appeal which was at 9 July 2015, pending. Ms Goh has indicated from the bar table, and it appears at least possible, that the defendant has obtained a grant of appeals bail prior to the determination of his appeal against severity of sentence in the District Court.
The investigations by both the police and the Crime Commission have established that the defendant owns a number of assets and it is his assets which are suspected of being the proceeds of crime which are sought to be restrained in the summons before the Court.
The defendant is a registered proprietor of premises at Fairy Meadow. He is the registered proprietor of two trailers each of which are listed in Schedule Two of the summons. He holds a number of share assets in both the companies he established, Always Airborne and another company called New South Wales Air Engineering Pty Limited held in the defendant's name, and shares in a company known as Cessnock Aircraft Maintenance Pty Limited. Those shares are specified in Schedule Three to the summons. Schedule Four refers to the defendant's ownership of shares in a company called Oregon Aero Club. Schedule Five refers to the sum of $750,000 which was paid by the defendant's company Always Airborne for the purchase of the City of Wollongong air patrol referred to in the factual outline from the New South Wales Police.
Schedule Six relates to the two sums of cash seized from the defendant's home and motor vehicle on 8 July 2014. Schedule Seven refers to the various aircraft, some seven of them, which have been registered in the name of Always Airborne Pty Limited. Schedule Eight is a motor vehicle, a 2007 Audi which similarly is registered to All Waves Airborne. Schedule Nine refers to two further aircraft which are owned by Oregon Aero Club, that being the entity in which the defendant holds shares.
I am satisfied that the suspicion held by the authorised officer is reasonably held. I accept the evidence that the Commission has tendered to the Court and accordingly I propose to make the orders sought in the summons filed by the New South Wales Crime Commission.
