EQUITY DIVISION  
HAMILTON J  
WEDNESDAY, 7 NOVEMBER 2001  /01 SAMBAH HOLDINGS PTY LTD & 4 ORS versus JOHN FREDERICK LORD & ANOR  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: These proceedings essentially arise out of great confusion that took place at a meeting of the creditors of Builders Associated Pty Ltd (in
Liquidation) ("the company") while the company was under voluntary administration. It is not necessary for me to go into the detail of what occurred at the meeting, but substantial doubts were raised as to whether resolutions at that meeting refusing an adjournment of the meeting and for the winding up of the company were validly passed. Suffice it to say that the form of draft minutes produced after the meeting and the other evidence left grave doubts as to whether the votes had been taken on the voices or upon a poll and that led to a serious contention of the invalidity of the resolutions. It is fair to say that there is a respectable argument that the resolutions are invalid.  The parties have now come to a sensible solution under which, if a sum be provided towards the implementation of a proposed deed of company arrangement ("DCA"), the company would be taken out of liquidation and the first defendant, the liquidator, reconverted into a voluntary administrator who would conduct a meeting to see whether or not the creditors wish to accept a
DCA. The first defendant, Mr Lord, has very properly conveyed to the Court that he thinks it appropriate for this course to be followed, provided that the Court deems it appropriate to make the orders which would allow the course to be implemented.  The High Court has made it plain in Australasian Memory Pty Limited v
Brien [(2000) 200 CLR 270] that the discretion under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the CA") is very wide. It is clear to me that the resolutions in question were put to the meeting and purported to be passed in the course and for the purposes of a voluntary administration under [Part .3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) of the CA. The orders proposed may in my view be characterised as orders "about how this Part is to operate in relation to a particular company". There is therefore power to make those orders. In those circumstances, and bearing in mind that the course has Mr Lord's endorsement, subject to the Court's view as to its appropriateness, I am minded to make orders under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) which will have the effect of treating as invalid the resolutions as a result of which the company was wound up, so that [Part .3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) will again apply to the company and the DCA may be taken forward according to the provisions of [Part .3A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a)
I shall give further consideration in private Chambers to short minutes of orders appropriate to effect this result.  *
