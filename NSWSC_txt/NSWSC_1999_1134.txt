JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On admissibility of evidence "relevant harm" - [Defamation Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) - [ss 46](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46.html) & [46A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46a.html) - T2408) HIS HONOUR: A question has been asked of this witness to the effect of "What do you say as to the plaintiff's reputation after the broadcasts?" On an earlier occasion in relation to another witness a similar question was asked, and notice given of a submission to be made that [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46a.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) operates in such a way as to make admissible that kind of testimony.
 [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46a.html) states that the Court in determining the amount of damages to be awarded in any proceedings for defamation, is to ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of damages awarded.
 Upon my reading of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46a.html), nothing in it affects the ambit of relevant harm as it has been set out in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46.html) of the Act. [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46a.html) is directed to how the Court goes about its task in the assessment of damages on the basis of evidence received during the course of a given trial. It does not, in my view, change the nature of relevant harm in such a way as to affect the normally applied rules as to admissibility of evidence as to relevant harm. That is still governed by the common law and, as the common law has been affected by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s46.html) of the Act. I reject the question.
