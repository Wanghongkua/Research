JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: Pursuant to paragraph 7 of an interlocutory process filed by way of cross-claim on 6 December 2013, the applicants Pier Blue Pty Limited and Costa Koulis seek the following relief: 
Pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html), leave be granted to the first applicant to bring proceedings on behalf of LBHL against Pierce Patrick Cody, Finola Anne Burke and or Richard Charles
Ochojski; 
Declare that Pierce Patrick Cody, Finola Anne Burke and or Richard
Charles Ochojski have breached their duties to LBHL pursuant to [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html), [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html), and in breach of their fiduciary duty to LBHL; 
Pursuant to [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317.html),
Finola Anne Burke and or Richard Charles Ochojski compensate LBHL arising from their breaches of [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html), [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html), or alternatively, pay equitable compensation or account to LBHL arising from their breach of fiduciary duty; 
Pierce Patrick Cody pay damages to LBHL for breach of the agreement between LBHL and Pierce Patrick Cody.
Before the court today is only the application for the order in paragraph (a) namely, for leave pursuant to [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html), for Pier Blue to bring proceedings on behalf of the respondent LBHL against its directors Pierce Patrick Cody, Finola Anne Burke and Richard Charles Ochojski. 
Pier Blue is a shareholder in LBHL and thus has standing to apply for leave pursuant to [s 237.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html)
The preconditions to a grant of leave under [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) are set out in subsection (2) and include (a), that it is probable that the company will not itself bring the proceedings, or properly take responsibility for them, or the steps in them; and (d), that if the applicant is applying for leave to bring proceedings, there is a serious question to be tried. 
It may well be that there are serious questions to be tried for the relief claimed in paragraphs 7(b), (c) and (d) of the interlocutory process; however, the precise form that the relevant causes of action will take has not been sufficiently articulated in the form of a draft pleading or otherwise to enable the Court to conclude that there is such a serious question to be tried. Leave under [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) is granted not to bring proceedings generally, but to bring specific proceedings, and for that purpose it is necessary to know the cause of action relied on and the material facts asserted to constitute that cause of action. As I say, it may well be that there are ample serious questions to be tried; but, as presently minded, I would not be inclined to grant leave pursuant to [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) until I have seen a draft pleading articulating those causes of action. 
But the more fundamental problem at this stage is paragraph (a) of [s 237(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) As a result of the judgment I delivered on 17 February 2014, Cody versus Live Board Holdings Limited <case>, it appears to follow that the share issue by which the present first applicant ceased to be the controlling shareholder was invalid. In any event, that is the present applicant's contention, and the correspondence put before the court seems to indicate that the present directors of the company concede that to be so. In other words, Pier Blue is, or is entitled to be, the controlling shareholder of the company. 
The existing directors -Mr Cody, Ms Burke and Mr Ochojski - have indicated that they propose to resign as directors, and have invited Mr Koulis to nominate replacement directors. In other words, it seems to me that it is probable that Mr Koulis could sufficiently gain control of the company, that it would itself bring misfeasance proceedings against the former directors, either through their resignation, as they have foreshadowed, or through his using his control to remove them. 
In those circumstances, I am entirely unable to be satisfied that it is probable that the company will not itself bring the proceedings. To the contrary, it seems to me likely that Mr Koulis can bring about a situation in which the company will itself bring the proceedings. 
In those circumstances, at least on the present material, I am not disposed to grant leave pursuant to [s 237](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s237.html) for a statutory derivative action, since it seems to me that no good reason has been established why the company itself will not bring the proceedings. 
I will not at this stage formally dismiss the claim for relief in paragraph 7(a), lest it be desired to renew it at a later stage, but I am not at this stage prepared to grant that relief.
