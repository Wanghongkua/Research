JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: At all material times the defendant, Jeffrey Victor Norman Gruber, also referred to as Jeffrey Norman Victor Gruber, was a director of a commercial laundry company, Aladdin Laundry Pty. Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Company"). 
The Company was a Group Employer within the meaning of the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1936-1993 and as such obliged to make deductions of tax from the salaries and wages paid to its employees in accordance with section
C(1A) of the Act.

Under section 221F(5)(a)(ii) the Company was obliged to remit the amount of the deductions made by it from the salaries and wages of its employees to the
Commissioner of Taxation not later than the seventh day of the month next succeeding the month in which the deductions were made.

In respect of the months of July 1993-February 1994 inclusive and June -November 1994 inclusive the Company failed to remit the several amounts constituting the monthly deductions made by it to the Commissioner as required.

Division 9 of Part VI of the Act contains various Subdivisions dealing with the imposition of obligations upon directors in the event that a company fails to comply with the obligations imposed upon it under, inter alia, Division 2, which includes sections 221C and 221F.

The first section in Division 9, section 222ANA, relevantly provided:- "222ANA(1) The purpose of this Division is to ensure that a company either meets its obligations under Division 2 ... or goes promptly into voluntary administration under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law or into liquidation.

The Division imposes a duty on the directors to cause the company to do so. The duty is enforced by penalties. However, a penalty can be recovered only if the Commissioner gives written notice to the person concerned. The penalty is automatically remitted if the company meets its obligations, or goes into voluntary administration or liquidation, within 14 days after the notice is given.

A penalty recovered under this Division is applied towards meeting the company's obligations under the relevant Division. Conversely, amounts paid by the company reduce the amount of the penalty.

Sections 221R ... provide for the recovery of amounts payable under this
Division." 
Section 221R authorises the plaintiff, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, to bring these proceedings.

Sections 222AFB, 222AOA, 222AOB, 222AOC, 222AOD, 222AOE, 222AOF and 222AOG relevantly provided:- "222AFB(1) ... unless the contrary intention appears: ...
 "due date", in relation to a deduction, means the day on or before which the person making the deduction must pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the deduction, ... ; ...
 "remittance provision" means any of the following provisions: in Division 2 - section 221F (except subsection 
F(12)) ...
 ...

AOA(1) This Subdivision applies if a company incorporated under the
Corporations Law of a state or territory has made, for the purposes of
Division 2, ... one or more deductions having a particular due date.

The earliest day on which the company made for the purposes of that
Division a deduction that has that due date is called the first deduction day.

That due date is called the due date.

AOB(1) The persons who are directors of the company from time to time on or after the first deduction day must cause the company to do at least one of the following on or before the due date: comply with Division 2 ... in relation to each deduction: that the company has made for the purposes of that Division; and whose due date is the same as the due date; make an agreement with the Commissioner under section 222ALA in relation to the company's liability under a remittance provision in respect of such deductions; appoint an administrator of the company under section 436A of the
Corporations Law; begin to be wound up within the meaning of that Law.

This section is complied with when: the company complies as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a); the company makes an agreement as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b); or an administrator of the company is appointed under section 436A, 436B or
C of the Corporations Law; or the company begins to be wound up within the meaning of that Law; whichever first happens, even if the directors did not cause the event to happen.

If this section is not complied with on or before the due date, the persons who are directors of the company from time to time after the due date continue to be under the obligations imposed by subsection (1) until this section is complied with.

AOC If section 222AOB is not complied with on or before the due date, each person who was a director of the company at any time during the period beginning on the first deduction day and ending on the due date is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the company's liability under a remittance provision in respect of deductions: that the company has made for the purposes of Division 2, 3A, 3B or 4 as the case may be; and whose due date is the same as the due date.

AOD If: after the due date, a person becomes, or again becomes, a director of the company at a time when section 222AOB has not yet been complied with; and at the end of 14 days after the person becomes a director, that section has still not been complied with; the person is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the liability referred to in section 222AOC.

AOE The Commissioner is not entitled to recover from a person a penalty payable under this Subdivision until the end of 14 days after the Commissioner gives to the person a notice that: sets out details of the unpaid amount of the liability referred to in section 222AOC; and states that the person is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to that unpaid amount, but that the penalty will be remitted if, at the end of 14 days after the notice is given: the liability has been discharged; or an agreement relating to the liability is in force under section 222ALA; or the company is under administration with the meaning of the Corporations Law; or the company is being wound up.

AOF(1) If it appears from ASC documents that a person is, or has been within the last 7 days, a director of the company, the Commissioner may give the person a notice under section 222AOE by leaving it at, or sending it by post to, an address that appears from such documents to be, or have been within the last 7 days, the person's place of residence or business.

In this section: "ASC document" means a return: lodged with the Australian Securities Commission under section 242 or 335 of the Corporations Law of a State or Territory; or ..." 
Note: [Sections
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) are also relevant to giving a notice under section 222AOE.

AOG If: a penalty is payable by a person under this Subdivision; and section 222AOB is complied with at a time when the Commissioner has not yet given the person a notice under section 222AOE, or within 14 days after the Commissioner gives the person such a notice; the penalty is remitted because of this section." 
In relation to service [sections
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) relevantly provided:- "28A(1) For the purposes of any Act that requires or permits a document to be served on a person, whether the expression "served", "give" or "send" or any other expression is used, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the document may be served: on a natural person: by delivering it to the person personally; or by leaving it at, or by sending it by pre-paid post to, the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to the person serving the document; ...

Nothing in subsection (1): affects the operation of any other law of the 
Commonwealth ... that authorizes the service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection; ...
 (1) Where an Act authorizes or requires any document to be served by post, whether the expression "served" or the expression "give" or "send" or any other expression is used, then unless the contrary intention appears the service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing prepaying and posting the document as a letter, and unless the contrary is proved to have been effected at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.
 ..." 
The returns referred to in sections 242 and 335 of the Corporations Law are a return of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries (section (7)) and an annual return (section 335).

Whilst on the pleadings there was an issue as to whether the Company had made the relevant deductions, this was not tendered as an issue in the signed "joint statement of specific matters of fact and law that are really in dispute" of 16 December 1996 filed pursuant to the relevant Practice Note nor was it claimed to be in issue when the matter was opened before me. In any event, on the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Manh Do, I find that the Company made the relevant deductions.

The amounts deducted were as follows:- 
July 1993 $ 41,963.88 
August 1993 $ 32,981.50 
September 1993 $ 40,932.04 
October 1993 $ 35,760.96 
November 1993 $ 41,709.16 
December 1993 $ 33,625.13 
January 1994 $ 38,222.34 
February 1994 $ 29,009.12 ...

June 1994 $ 27,366.94 
July 1994 $ 28,961.72 
August 1994 $ 35,070.55 
September 1994 $ 30,329.02 
October 1994 $ 30,706.16 
November 1994 $ 37,177.58 
These amounts collectively total $483,816.10.

In respect of each month, the first deduction day was the first day in the month upon which a salary was or wages were paid by the Company and a deduction made by it as required by section 221C(1A) and the due date was the seventh day of the next succeeding month (see section 222AFB(1)).

Before proceeding further it is convenient to illustrate the manner in which the principal sections referred to above operate. Let it be assumed that a company XYZ Pty. Limited was a group employer which paid salaries and wages on
Thursday 5 August, Thursday 12 August, Thursday 19 August and Thursday 26
August 1993 and that on each day XYZ made deductions as required by section
C(1A) of the Act from those salaries and wages totalling $8,000.00 on each pay day.

Let it be further assumed that A was a director of XYZ between 5 August 1993 and the present time, B was a director between 5 August and 19 August 1993 and
C was a director between 19 August 1993 and the present time. Finally, let it be assumed that XYZ, like the Company in this case, was not an "early remitter" within the meaning of section 221F(5)(a)(i) of the Act.

In these circumstances: the "first deduction day" would be 5 August 1993 and "the due date" for the payment of the total amount of $32,000.00 would be 7 
September 1993 (section 222AOA).

A, B, and C would be obliged to cause XYZ to do at least one of the things mentioned in section 222AOB(1)(a)-(d) on or before 7 
September 1993 (section 222AOB(1)).

If one of those things was not done on or before 7 September 1993, 
A and C would be under a continuing obligation to cause XYZ to do at least one of those things thereafter (section 
AOB(3)); 
A, B and C would each be liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, $32,000.00 (section 222AOC).

The Commissioner would not be entitled to recover the penalty payable by A (and similarly B and C) until the end of 14 days after he had given A a notice which complied with section 222AOE (section 
AOE).

It may be noted that the Commissioner could not recover more than a total of $32,000.00 in the circumstances postulated because section 222AOH makes provision for pro tanto discharges to apply when payments are made from any source.

No evidence has been tendered as to any information that may have been revealed by any returns of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries of the company and no searches appear to have been made by the plaintiff of any such returns.

The plaintiff did carry out a series of searches by obtaining computer generated extracts from the Australian Securities Commission's database of documents lodged with it and processed by it (see section 1274B of the
Corporations Law). The product of these searches referred to as "ASCOTs", which have been tendered in evidence, bear date 9 February 1995, 11 September and 30 January 1996. Each document shows the defendant as a director of the Company with the address 157 Fullers Road, Chatswood NSW 2067 but, as a shareholder, he is shown as having the address 20 Allambie Avenue, Northmead
NSW 2152, which was in fact his residential address as at those dates.

The 1994 Annual Return dated 23 February 1995, which is in evidence, provided the same information. It is not known when the Plaintiff's copy of this document was obtained but it was on the Plaintiff's file prior to September .

The property 157 Fullers Road, Chatswood was jointly owned by the defendant and his sister Vivien Faye Shoolman until it was sold on 30 October 1995. The defendant had not lived at that property since 11 November 1988. From 29
September 1989, when the defendant's mother died, until 30 October 1995, when it was sold, the residence erected on the property was vacant.

Periodically the defendant attended the property to check on mail that may have been received and to ensure that the grounds were properly maintained.

The business records of the plaintiff contain representations which establish that on 10 February 1995 Marilyn Mehmel, an officer in the Australian Taxation
Office posted certain documents which she considered to be "penalty notices" under section 222AOE of the Act to the defendant at 157 Fullers Road,
Chatswood and to his co-director, until 26 October 1994, Anne Frances
Carragher at 24 Fergusson Street, Glenfield.

The defendant's evidence is that he never received the original of the 10
February 1995 documents which were posted to him on that day. However, it may be presumed, in accordance with [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (Cth) that the envelope containing the originals of the documents was received at 157
Fullers Road, Chatswood on 16 February 1995.

The defendant presented as a truthful witness in the witness box and I accept his evidence as to non-receipt, notwithstanding that the business records of the plaintiff contained representations by Joanne Littlefield that she spoke with the Defendant on 16 February 1995, her file note reading "I SPOKE WITH
JEFF GRUBER THE DIRECTOR OF ALADDIN LAUNDRY, HE WILL BE COMING IN TOMORROW TO
COLLECT APPLICATIONS FOR DEFERMENT OF LEGAL RECOVERY ACTION FOR THE BUSINESS
AND THE 2 INDIVIDUAL'S." 
The defendant says he telephoned Joanne Littlefield because Anne Carragher received a notice and rang him up expressing concern about the matter. He responded "Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it straight away." 
The defendant concedes that he received a copy of the 10 February 1995 documents directed to him after a meeting which he had with representatives of the plaintiff in March 1995.

On 12 September 1995 the plaintiff posted further documents to the defendant at 157 Fullers Road, Chatswood which are claimed to constitute a penalty notice under section 222AOE of the Act. The defendant's evidence, which I also accept, is that he did not receive the original of the 12 September 1995 documents even though under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) it may be presumed that the envelope containing same was received at 157 Fullers Road,
Chatswood on 18 September 1995.

The defendant concedes that at some stage after 9 October 1995 he received a further copy of the 10 February 1995 documents and a copy of the 12 September documents. The Statement of Claim in these proceedings was filed on 5
October 1995.

The plaintiff contends that each of the documents constituted a valid notice to the defendant under section 222AOE of the Act. The 10 February 1995 documents refer to the non-payment by the company of deductions in respect of the months of July 1993-February 1994, June-September 1994 and November 1994.
No mention was made of October 1994 and the amount said to have been deducted and which remained unpaid in respect of September 1994 was the wrong amount.
Furthermore, the total of the several monthly amounts was shown as $582,662.81 which was plainly incorrect.

The 10 February 1995 documents took the form of a letter to the defendant and an attached formal notice. The letter, on the letterhead of the Parramatta office of Australian Taxation Office was signed on behalf of the plaintiff and read as follows:- "Dear Mr Gruber 
Please find enclosed a notice of your liability to pay a penalty equal to the amounts the company that you are or were a director of failed to pay to the
Commissioner. You automatically became liable to the penalty when the company failed to remit the amounts set out in the notice by the due date.

Action to recover the penalty from you will be taken without further notice if, after fourteen days from the date the notice is sent to you:- the company's liability has not been discharged; or an agreement to pay the liability is not in force; or the company is not under administration within the meaning of the
Corporations Law; or the company is not being wound up.

The penalty will be remitted if any one of these options is adopted within 14 days from the date the notice was sent to you.

If you wish to discuss a payment agreement, you should contact the officer listed above, but you should keep in mind that you will continue to be liable to a penalty if any one of the options has not been adopted at the end of 14 days after you are given the notice (that is, any agreement would need to be signed before the expiration of the 14 days).

You are entitled to be indemnified by the company, or to obtain a contribution from anyone else who the Commissioner could have sued, for any payment you make by way of penalty. A company's liability and the penalties for directors are parallel liabilities. When an amount is paid to discharge one of the liabilities, each of the other liabilities is discharged by the same amount." 
The accompanying notice dated 10 February 1995 was also signed on behalf of the plaintiff and was in the following terms:- " Section 222AOE [Income Tax Assessment Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/)

ALA of the Act; or the company is under administration within the meaning of the Corporations
Law; or the company is being wound up.

Dated this tenth day of February 1995" 
The 12 September 1995 documents were in the same form as the 10 February 1995 documents. In the case of the notice attached to the 12 September 1995 letter reference was made to the months of September and October 1994 alone. It corrected the amount said to have been deducted by the company for September (from $30,706.16 to $30,329.02) and included the amount said to have been deducted by the company in October 1994 ($30,706.16). It may be seen that in the earlier notice the October amount had been wrongly attributed to the month of September.

Neither within 14 days after the dates which the two sets of documents bear nor within 14 days after the envelopes containing the originals of the documents were presumed to have been received at 157 Fullers Road, Chatswood were the statutory requirements of sections 222AOB or 222AOE met. The
Company's liability to remit the amounts deducted was not discharged, no agreement was made with the Commissioner under section 222ALA, no administrator of the Company was appointed under section 436A of the
Corporations Law and the winding up of the Company did not begin.

An administrator was appointed to the Company under section 436A of the
Corporations Law on 23 October 1995.

In these proceedings the plaintiff seeks to recover by way of penalty from the defendant, as a director of the Company at all material times, an amount equal to the total of the unpaid amounts of the Company's several liabilities to remit moneys to the Commissioner in accordance with section 221F(5)(a)(ii) of the Act in respect of the 14 months in question i.e. $483,816.10.

In the parties signed joint statement of specific matters of fact and law that are really in dispute dated 16 December 1996 the issues were defined as follows:- "1. Whether notices served under s.222AOE were valid.
Whether the defendant was properly served (with) the notices pursuant to the provisions of the Act." 
In the DCM Judge's brief filed 28 July 1997 by the plaintiff's solicitor a
Detailed Statement of Issues remaining listed the following:- "2.1 The amounts of the monthly group tax deductions made by the company between 1 July 1993 and 30 November 1994.
 .2 Whether the documents posted on 10 February 1995 to the defendant were served on him and if so when.
 .3 Whether the covering letter posted to the defendant is inconsistent with section 222AOE of the Act. If so what is the effect of any such inconsistency.
 .4 Whether the notice posted to the defendant on 10 February 1995 complied with section 222AOE of the Act.
 .5 Whether the individual monthly liabilities claimed in a notice under section 222AOE are individually severable from the notice.
 .6 Whether a further notice can be issued for a liability already referred to in a Section 222AOE notice containing a corrected amount of the liability for a particular month.
 .7 Whether section 222AOB of the Act was complied with at a time to entitle the defendant to a remission of his directors penalties under section 222AOG of the Act." 
In relation to paragraph 2.1 I have already found that the Company made the relevant deductions.

At the hearing before me paragraph 2.7 was not pressed. At the commencement of the hearing Mr. McMillan of Counsel who appeared for the defendant stated, and
I did not understand Mr. O'Brien of Counsel who appeared for the plaintiff to demur, that the issues between the parties were:-
Was the defendant validly served.
From what date did the 14 days under section 222AOE of the Act run.
Did the notice accord with the requirements of the Act.
Were the notices misleading.

In relation to the Commissioner's entitlement to wrap up in one document notices in respect of penalties for a number of discrete months Mr. McMillan has drawn my attention to the provisions of sections 222AGA and 222AGB and in particular subsection 222AGB(3) which expressly authorises the Commissioner to make an estimate of a person's liability for, inter alia, "group tax" payments and allows a single notice to be given relating to two or more such estimates.
He points out that no such comparable provision is to be found in section
AOE of the Act. Section 222AGB(3) provides as follows:- "222AGB(3) To avoid doubt, a single notice may relate to 2 or more estimates, but must comply with subsection (2) in relation to each of them." 
Whilst the subsection is an important one it is plain that this is not a clear case of expressio unius, exclusio alterius given the prefatory words in section 222AGB(3) namely "To avoid doubt".

The sufficiency of the "Section 222AOE Notices" 
The first issue which I propose to address is the sufficiency of the documents bearing date 10 February 1995 and 12 September 1995 as notices in accordance with section 222AOE of the Act.

As I see it the following observations may be made about the 10 February 1995 notice:-
The notice does not nominate that the addressee (the defendant) was a director of the Company between the first deduction date and the due date in respect of any of the deduction periods referred to. The simple answer to this is that this is a matter which would have to be proved in penalty recovery proceedings but is not an express requirement for a valid notice under section
AOE.
The notice does not specify the due date in respect of each liability, or any of the liabilities, of the Company in respect of the several deduction periods. One of the requirements for a notice under section 222AOE is that it must set out "details of the unpaid amount of the liability referred to in section 222AOC". This is a shorthand reference to the "unpaid amount of the company's liability under a remittance provision in respect of deductions: that the company has made for the purposes of Division 2 ...; and whose due date is the same as the due date." 
In my opinion a valid notice will only set out details in accordance with section 
AOE(a) and section 222AOC if the relevant due date in respect of the unpaid amount of the company's liability is specified.

It may be observed that in the second sentence of the letter enclosing the notice it was suggested that there was one due date for each of the 13 separate amounts which was plainly erroneous.
The notice fails to nominate that the Company's liability in respect of the several unpaid amounts arose in respect of deductions that the Company made under 
Division 2 (or section 221C(1A)) of the Act i.e. demonstrating that they were deductions made for the purposes of Division 2 as opposed to deductions made for the purposes of Divisions 3A, 3B or 4. In my opinion for a valid notice to set out details of the unpaid amount of the liability referred to in section 222AOC it is necessary to specify the Division under which the deductions giving rise to the liability were made.
The statement at the conclusion of the notice includes as paragraph (b) words which do not strictly accord with section 222AOE(b)(ii) of the Act. Reference is made to "an agreement relating to that unpaid amount" whereas the Act required reference to be made to "an agreement relating to the liability" in respect of the relevant unpaid amount. However, it does not seem to me that the effect of the words used is sufficiently at variance with the requirements of the Act to render the notice invalid on this account.
The notice erroneously specified $30,706.16 as the unpaid amount of the company's liability in respect of the September 1994 deduction period.
The notice erroneously asserted a liability on the part of its addressee (the defendant) to pay by way of penalty a total of $582,662.81 which exceeded the sum of the several amounts specified, including the erroneous amount for
September 1994, by over $100,000.
The notice states a liability of the addressee to pay the unpaid amount of separate liabilities of the company to the Commissioner in one document.

In respect of point 6 the plaintiff submitted "that any overstatement of the unpaid amount of the company's liability or amount of the penalty does not render the notice invalid. When regard is had to the scope and purpose of the provision in the context of the provisions as a whole, it is to give a director notice of a failure of a company to remit deducted tax and the director a further opportunity to meet his continuing obligations to ensure the company meets its obligations, or takes one of the other options specified. The effective exercise of one of the listed options is not dependant upon the amount specified as the liability of the company or the penalty imposed being correct." I disagree. The relevant Subdivision of the
Act works to visit liability upon, inter alia, persons who may only have been directors for part of a deduction period (section 222AOC) or may only have become directors after the due date for payment by a company of the unpaid amount in question (section 222AOD). They have the right to know precisely what liability of the company is being visited upon them to enable them to know what action to take. (cf Clyne v. Deputy Federal Commissioner of
Taxation (1982) 82 ATC 4349 at 4351-2; Kleinwort Benson Australia Limited v.
Crowl <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 71] at 77-8, -2).

In respect of points 5 and 6 above the plaintiff submits that "At any hearing to enforce the penalty the director is entitled to dispute the amount of the penalty. If the amount of the penalty is successfully disputed this should not mean that the Commissioner must reinstitute proceedings on the basis that the original Section 222AOE Notice was in error and therefore did not constitute a valid notice entitling the Commissioner to commence the action to recover the penalty." Once again I disagree. If a notice under section 222AOE is erroneous in amount the error significantly affects the ability of the addressee to avoid liability for the penalty alleged by having same remitted in accordance with section 222AOG. Especially in the cases of directors appointed after the relevant due date or directors who have ceased to hold office during a relevant deduction period the precision of the section 222AOE notice will be a matter of critical importance. As I see it the Act cannot have a differential application for different categories of directors.

In relation to point 7 I do not consider that a notice can be said to be invalid simply because in the one document several separate notices are given.
Section 222AGB(3) does not require such a conclusion.

The plaintiff submits that the notice may be construed distributively and with this broad submission I agree. However, a combined notice will only be valid if, in respect of each unpaid amount for which a company may be liable, the relevant details are discernible and it is clear that the addressee's liability by way of penalty is a separate liability in respect of each such unpaid amount.

In respect of errors in the amount claimed the plaintiff sought to rely upon cases dealing with comparable errors in notices by mortgagees chargees or covenant chargees that are served upon mortgagors chargers or covenant chargers under [section (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) . In my opinion these cases have no application to the circumstances of the present case. In the case of a mortgagor who has allegedly defaulted in paying moneys to a mortgagee the mortgagor is privy to the transaction and has some reasonable opportunity to discern the correctness or otherwise of the allegation of the mortgagee who alleges default in the payment of moneys due under the mortgage.

In the case of a director who may become liable by way of penalty to the
Commissioner under subdivision B of Division 9 of the Act one may encounter many situations where the director will have no way of testing the correctness of the Commissioner's allegations, for example, where the director ceased to be a director two days after the first deduction day in respect of a relevant deduction period. (cf Bunbury Foods Pty. Limited v. National Bank of
Australasia Limited <case>; [(1984) 153 CLR 491] at 503-4; Clarke v. Japan Machines (Australia) Pty. Limited [(1984) 1 Qd.R. 404] at 413 and Websdale v. S. & J.D. Investments Pty.
Limited [(1991) 24 NSWLR 573] at -9).

In my opinion the notice bearing date 10 February 1995 was invalid.

This brings me to the plaintiff's letter of 10 February 1995 which enclosed the relevant notice. In the instant case, I do not consider that the letter forms part of the notice but the validity of the notice may be judged in part by reference to inconsistencies which exist between the terms of the letter and the terms of the notice.

I have already drawn attention to the fact that it suggests that there was only one due date for the several unpaid amounts referred to in the notice.

Whilst the requirement of section 222AOE(b) is that the notice must contain a statement that the relevant penalty will be remitted if "at the end of 14 days after the notice is given" one or other of the four matters listed occurs and the notice of 10 February 1995 accorded with this provision, the covering letter said "The penalty will be remitted if any one of these options is adopted within 14 days from the date the notice was sent to you." It should be noted that in the following sentence of the letter it is stated, correctly, that "you will continue to be liable to a penalty if any one of the options has not been adopted at the end of 14 days after you are given the notice ...".

The defendant argues that there is a difference between the date upon which a notice is sent to an addressee and the date upon which the notice is given or at least there may be, especially where, as in this case, the notice is sent by pre-paid post.

I am disposed to accept the plaintiff's submission that in the context "sent to you" means "received by you" and, in any event, the terms of the letter taken as a whole do not render the notice misleading.

The defendant has submitted that the letter renders the notice misleading by the fact that it suggests that any agreement under section 222ALA "would need to be signed before the expiration of the 14 days". Two points are made, firstly, there is no requirement in section 222ALA for signature and, secondly, there is no requirement that there be an agreement before the expiration of the 14 days or, as stated earlier in the letter, "within 14 days".

In my opinion there is no substance in either of these points. For an agreement to meet the requirements of section 222ALA it must be a "written agreement". The Act does not speak of an agreement for which there is a memorandum in writing. In my opinion a written agreement will invariably be a signed or executed agreement and the relevant expression in the letter does not render the enclosed notice misleading.

In relation to the second point it seems to me that a statement that a penalty will be remitted if, at the end of 14 days after a notice is given, an event has occurred is no different from saying that it will be remitted if, within days after the notice is given, the event occurs. After all, the remission provision (section 222AOG) expressly provides that "If ... section 222AOB is complied with ... within 14 days after the Commissioner gives the person" a section 222AOE notice, the penalty is remitted.

Turning to the 12 September 1995 notice, the observations which I have made in relation to the 10 February 1995 notice in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 above are equally applicable.

I do not consider that the 12 September 1995 notice is irregular because it repeats a claim for September 1994 but in a different amount from that specified in the 10 February 1995 notice nor do I consider that the notice is defective because the total amount claimed by way of penalty duplicates, at least in part, the amount earlier claimed for the September 1994 deduction period in the notice of 10 February 1995.

Whilst the 12 September 1995 notice is free from the defects referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of my observations in respect of the 10 February 1995 notice it remains an invalid notice for the reasons advanced by me in paragraphs 2 and 3 of my observations in relation to the 10 February 1995 notice.

Were the Notices given to the defendant? 
I turn now to the question of service. I have already held that the defendant did not receive the originals of the notices of 10 February 1995 and 12
September 1995 which were posted to him but after his March 1995 meeting with representatives of the plaintiff he received a copy of the 10 February 1995 notice which was directed to him. He later received a further copy of the 10
February 1995 notice and a copy of the 12 September 1995 notice but these copies were not received until after 9 October 1995, the filing of the statement of claim having occurred on 5 October 1995. Accordingly, their receipt is of no relevance in respect of the current proceedings.

The questions which remain are whether, notwithstanding the defendant's non- receipt of the originals of the notices of 10 February 1995 and 12 September , notice was sufficiently given to him by the Commissioner in accordance with section 222AOE of the Act and, if not, whether his receipt of a copy of the 10 February 1995 notice in or shortly after March 1995 constituted the giving by the Commissioner of that notice to him.

In my opinion the originals of the notices of 10 February 1995 and 12
September 1995 cannot be taken to have been given to the defendant by virtue of them being posted to him at 157 Fullers Road, Chatswood on those dates. In this case section 222AOF(1) of the Act was not invoked. That section requires a contemporaneous search to be made by the Commissioner of a company's return of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries or of its annual return. So much is indicated by the use of the words "is" and "or has been within the last 7 days" in the expression "if it appears from ASC documents that a person is, or has been within the last 7 days, a director of the company ...". Clearly, the relevant information must "appear" to the
Commissioner. The fact that it may be available is irrelevant if it does not "appear" to the notice giver.

Whilst the Commissioner clearly effected searches of ASCOTs under section
B of the Corporations Law on 9 February 1995 and 11 September 1995, these searches did not allow the plaintiff to claim the benefit of section 222AOF(1) of the Act. I would also observe that the ASCOTs showed two different addresses for the defendant without any indication that either was his place of residence or place of business.

As noted above, the Commissioner had a copy of the company's 1994 annual return dated 23 February 1995 prior to September 1995 but there was no evidence before me that it was obtained for the purpose of the 12 September notice and it certainly wasn't obtained within 7 days prior to 12
September 1995.

Turning to section 28A of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ia191/), Mr. Harman's evidence as an Administrative Services Officer of the Australian Taxation
Office was that he put on the 12 September 1995 notice the address that appeared from the 11 September 1995 ASCOT to be the defendant's place of residence. That ASCOT in fact disclosed the two different addresses for the defendant. The one selected by Mr. Harman was the one indicated in respect of the defendant's listing as a director. His correct address was that given for him as a shareholder.

In any event, there was no evidence that the address selected by Mr. Harman was the address of the place of residence or business of the defendant last known to the Commissioner. As I see it, more is required than the selection of an address for a person out of information contained in an ASCOT to justify the conclusion that the address selected was the place of residence or business of that person last known to the Commissioner.

No evidence was offered in respect of the selection of the address for the defendant for the 10 February 1995 notice but it may be inferred that this was simply by reference to the 9 February 1995 ASCOT which also showed the two different addresses for the defendant.

In relation to the copy of the 10 February 1995 notice which the defendant received after his meeting with representatives of the plaintiff in March , I do not consider that its receipt, probably via his accountant, constituted the giving by the Commissioner to him of the notice. The giving of a section 222AOE notice has considerable significance in terms of its timing and effect and I do not consider the informal receipt of a copy to be capable of having such effect.

If I were in error in respect of my findings on service then it would seem to me that the dates from which the 14 days allowed under sections 222AOE and
AOG would run were 16 February 1995 and 18 September 1995 respectively (see [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)).

Conclusion 
In all the circumstances, the plaintiff fails for want of sufficient notices to meet the requirements of section 222AOE in respect of the company's liabilities in question and also for want of sufficient service of the requisite notices. Accordingly, there will be judgment for the defendant with costs.
