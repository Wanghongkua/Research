JUDGMENT EX TEMPORE - REVISED
In the course of hearing submissions from counsel prior to the commencement of the Crown's final address, the Crown submitted that the jury should be directed as to the nature of a circumstantial case, on the basis that the various pieces of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown are what are generally described as "strands in the cable".
Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, opposed that course and submitted that the appropriate direction was that the matters relied upon by the Crown were "links in a chain" or, in other words, that there were one or more indispensable intermediate facts, in the absence of proof of which the jury would be compelled to return a verdict of not guilty against the accused.
The indispensable intermediate facts identified by Mr Thomas were as follows: * (1) Rogerson's alleged complicity in the purchase of vehicle BV67PX; * (2) the fact that the deceased was alive at the time that Rogerson entered storage unit 803; * (3) the fact that Rogerson was alleged to have had a gun in his possession whilst at McNamara's apartment on the afternoon/evening of 20 May 2014; * (4) the fact that Rogerson threatened Jessica McNamara on 20 May 2014; and * (5) the fact Rogerson was aware of meetings taking place between McNamara and the deceased, and was aware of the purpose of those meetings.
The submission put by Mr Thomas attracts consideration of the decision in Shepherd versus R <case>; [(1990) 170 CLR 573] where Dawson J (at [5]) considered the rationale behind a direction of the kind which is now sought by Mr Thomas.
In my view, the present is not a case of the kind which lends itself to such a direction being given. Broadly speaking, the Crown case encompasses evidence of three general areas, namely: * (1) the events leading up to 20 May 2014, including the contact between the deceased and McNamara and telephone contact between the two accused; * (2) the events of 20 May 2014; and * (3) the events after 20 May 2014.
It is not necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion about one area of evidence before proceeding to consider another: see Shepherd (supra) at [16]. In my view, none of the suggested indispensable facts (or links) are, on a proper assessment of the Crown case, indispensable facts at all. Even if each and every one of them were removed from the Crown case, there would remain a Crown case sufficient to go to the jury. It is also worthy of note that in Shepherd, Dawson J expressly recognised (at [15]) that even if indispensable facts of the kind articulated by Mr Thomas were identified, a direction of the kind proposed may in some circumstances not be helpful.
In this latter respect Spigelman CJ in Davidson versus R <case>; [(2009) 75 NSWLR 150]
For the reasons I have outlined, none of the matters identified by Mr Thomas are indispensable intermediate facts. Even if they were, the nature of the Crown case is such that to give a direction of the kind sought would be unnecessarily confusing. Accordingly the jury will be directed that the various matters relied upon by the Crown form part of an overall circumstantial case which should be viewed as "strands in a cable".
