JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)
HIS HONOUR: The Figtree Reserve Superannuation Fund was established by trust deed made on 10 May 1999 between Millerview Constructions Pty Ltd as employer and Millerview Constructions Pty Ltd as trustee. As trustee of the Figtree Reserve Superannuation Fund, Millerview Constructions Pty Limited acquired Lot 1 in Deposited Plan 1094055, Lot 2 in Deposited Plan 1094055 and Lot 5 in Deposited Plan 1008379. Millerview Constructions Pty Limited retired as trustee of the superannuation fund on 14 June 2007, when it was replaced by Figtree Reserve Pty Limited. Subsequently, Figtree Reserve Pty Ltd retired as trustee of the superannuation fund on 2 April 2010 when it was replaced by the plaintiff, Argyle Gravel & Concrete Pty Ltd, as trustee. 
To this date, however, each of the three lots remains registered in the name of Millerview Constructions Pty Ltd. Millerview Constructions Pty Ltd was wound up by order of the Supreme Court of Queensland on 13 March 2008, when Mr John Cunningham was appointed its liquidator. 
On 1 November 2006, Millerview executed a mortgage debenture to Rochgate Pty Limited of all its assets and undertakings, as security for sums advanced by Rochgate. It does not appear that in so doing it was acting in its capacity as trustee of the superannuation fund. Millerview, on 20 February 2007, demised the three properties to Antiquaire Pty Limited by lease registered number AG592507, apparently for a term of ten years with five options to renew. Millerview contends, but it is not necessary to resolve for present purposes, that that involves some rectifiable error.
In the course of the liquidation, the plaintiff sought to have the three properties to which I have referred transmitted to it as new trustee of the superannuation fund. The liquidator opposed this course, because it was apparently opposed by Rochgate. Eventually, on 20 February 2013, the liquidator gave notice of disclaimer pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 568A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568a.html) of the disclaimer of the subject properties on the footing that they were property that may give rise to a liability to pay money or some other onerous obligation, within the meaning of [s 568(1)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html)
By originating process filed on 5 March 2013, the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the property is held upon trust for the Figtree Reserve Superannuation Fund, and an order setting aside the disclaimer. The court can set aside the disclaimer under [s 568B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html) if satisfied that the disclaimer would cause to persons who have or claim to have interest in the property prejudice that is grossly out of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the disclaimer would cause to the company's creditors. That section applies if the application is made within fourteen days after notice of the disclaimer is given. Alternatively, under [s 568E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568e.html) the court can set aside the disclaimer on the same grounds and if it is also satisfied that the prejudice to the claimants would be grossly out of proportion to that to persons who have changed their position in reliance on the disclaimer taking effect. 
In the circumstances of this case, I need not be too troubled with whether the application was made within or outside the fourteen day period, as there is no suggestion that persons have changed their position in reliance on the disclaimer taking effect. In either case, I would be satisfied that the prejudice that would be occasioned to Argyle as trustee of the superannuation fund would be grossly out of proportion to that which setting aside the disclaimer would cause to creditors or to persons who have changed their position in reliance on it. 
However, [s 568F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568f.html) provides that the Court may order that disclaimed property vest in a person entitled to the property, and to proceed under that section would, it seems to me, avoid the need for further proceedings and difficulty, both in connection with the liquidation and in connection with the administration of the superannuation fund. 
Notice of the disclaimer was given to Rochgate, and does not appear to have elicited any response. In circumstances where the liquidator has disclaimed the property and Rochgate has manifested no interest in applying to set aside the disclaimer or have it vest in Rochgate, it seems to me that the evidence suffices to enable a vesting order to be made in favour of Argyle. 
Pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) [s 568F(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568f.html), I order that the property described in the schedule vest in the plaintiff Argyle Gravel and Concrete Pty Ltd as trustee for the Figtree Reserve Superannuation Fund. Schedule: Lot 1 in Deposited Plan 1094055, Lot 2 in Deposited Plan 1094055, Lot 5 in Deposited Plan 1008397. 
I direct that this order be entered forthwith.
