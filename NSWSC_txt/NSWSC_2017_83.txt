JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of an assessment in relation to an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act. [Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act says that the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person whose interests in property is sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime-related activity, stating the ground on which the suspicion referred to therein is based, and the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 10 February 2017. Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the Defendants are engaged in serious crime-related activity or activities, being the supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of methyl amphetamine contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . Those offences fall within the definition of "serious criminal offence" under [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading the facts sheet prepared by the police after the arrest of the Defendants. Ms Bourne sought confirmation from the officer, who she believed prepared the facts sheets, of the fact that the officer had done so, that the facts sheet was true to the best of his knowledge and belief and that the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation. The officer replied in the affirmative to those enquiries.
Ms Bourne has also had regard to the searches conducted by a financial analyst of the Commission in relation to the charging of the Defendants and the property found in their possession. I have read the facts sheet and I am satisfied that Ms Bourne's suspicion that those offences that have been committed, is reasonably held.
The Plaintiff seeks that the orders be made without prior notice to the Defendants. It does so based on what Ms Bourne says in paragraph 7 of her affidavit that she is aware from her experience that, in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to dispose of property very quickly, including entry into unregistered mortgages and the backdating of motor vehicle transfer forms in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act.
I am satisfied that the orders should be made without prior notice to the Defendants. They have their rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review of those orders. 
I note that the usual undertaking as to damages is given by the solicitor for the Plaintiff. On that basis, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1-5, 7 and 8, and 11 and 12 of the draft order. I grant the leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 6 and 9. I stand the matter over for directions before the Common Law Registrar at 9 am on Monday, 8 May 2017. These orders may be entered forthwith.
