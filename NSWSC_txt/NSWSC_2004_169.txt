JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
Master Malpass  
Wednesday 10 March 2004  of 2002 Theodora Gunn versus ING Life Limited  
JUDGMENT - Application for directions pursuant to defendant's Notice of Motion filed 5 December 2003.  MASTER: The defendant seeks an order or directions that both parties be directed to serve statements of lay evidence by affidavit. This issue is apparently a matter that has been before a Registrar on a number of occasions, presumably in the context of a status conference. I am informed that the
Registrar has refused to deal with this matter because there was a dispute as to the order or direction sought. As a consequence, without regard to jurisdictional considerations, the application has been referred to and fixed for hearing before a Master for determination. This has put the parties to a lot of additional trouble and expense.  As I earlier said, this is a matter which could have been and should have been dealt with by the Registrar. The Registrar has more than ample powers to deal with such an issue (inter alia, [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p26) r 1).  I have heard argument from both sides on the disputed issue. In my view, I am left unsatisfied that the orders sought should be made at this stage. It may be that in the future there could be a change of circumstances which could see a different result. However, in the present circumstances I do not see that justice is best served by making the order a direction that is sought.  I dismiss the Notice of Motion filed on 5 December 2003. The defendant is to pay the costs of that Notice of Motion.
