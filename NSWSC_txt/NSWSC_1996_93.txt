BOYD versus HUMMELSTAD and another /92 May 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
Brownie J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In 1988 the plaintiff, MS BOYD, and the first defendant, MS HUMMELSTAD, bought some land near Evans Head (THE LAND), in equal shares as tenants in common. They also entered into a partnership in respect of the use of that land, and they mortgaged the land to the second defendant, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ). The relationship between Ms Boyd and Ms Hummelstad soured, and in 1992 Ms Boyd commenced these proceedings against Ms Hummelstad alone, seeking orders for the appointment of trustees for the sale of the land. 
Later, ANZ was added as a second defendant, but then Ms Boyd discontinued the action, as against it. In 1994, ANZ sold the land as mortgagee, and paid into
Court the net proceeds of sale, after satisfying the various debts due to it, secured by the mortgage. Ms Hummelstad brought a cross-claim against ANZ, seeking relief under the Contracts Review Act in relation to the mortgage, but she withdrew that cross-claim during the course of the hearing, so that the only remaining issues are those between Ms Boyd and Ms Hummelstad (THE
PARTIES).

Ms Boyd appeared in person on the hearing. Consistently with some pre-trial directions, the parties had served upon each other lengthy lists of objections taken to each other's affidavits, but soon after the hearing began, they agreed to withdraw all the objections not then ruled upon. This sensible agreement resulted in a great saving of time and money, although the result is that some of the evidence is in a rather unconventional form.

In final address Ms Boyd formulated her claim in these terms: 
Claim "A": half of various expenses incurred by her or on her behalf during the financial year 1991-92, together with some further payments in
September 1992, as listed in a document marked "A". The items claimed included payments made in respect of the land, payments made to ANZ for principal and interest, lease and other payments in respect of a car, ordinary living expenses, and other items that are not accurately identified by the evidence.

Claim "B": compensation concerning a mare and foal that she said she owned.

Claim "C": costs incurred in relation to the maintenance and preservation of the land.

Claim "D": half of the costs of advertising the land for sale, and the cost of hiring a motor vehicle.

Claim "E": further costs of the same type as in Claim "C", but including money paid to ANZ.

Claim "F": damages arising from Ms Hummelstad excluding Ms Boyd from the land.

Legal costs incurred by Ms Boyd.

Damages flowing from the termination of the relationship between the parties.

Ms Hummelstad submitted, and I accept, that a good part of this should be put out of consideration: some of the claims were not raised until final address; others are not supported by evidence; and others are not available as a matter of law.

I will proceed on the basis that the relevant law is as stated in Forgeard v
Shanahan [(1994) 35 NSWLR 206] at 221 -
Thus, in the absence of some particular contract between parties, the mere fact that the parties were co-owners of the land does not justify the conclusion that one co-owner has a right to be reimbursed by the other in respect of repairs or maintenance to the land, as distinct from improvements;
Ms Boyd's claims arising from expense incurred in relation to the improvement to the land must be dismissed, in the absence of evidence that they resulted in an increase in the value of the land; and Ms Boyd cannot make a claim against Ms Hummelstad for occupation of the land unless Ms Hummelstad ousted or excluded Ms Boyd from the land. That is, the claims in respect of these items cannot be justified by reference to the fact of co-ownership, without more.

The parties lived together for some time, and there was a good deal of evidence led as to the contributions each had made towards their shared living expenses, and to the possible effect upon their respective interests in the land, as a result of an inequality of the contributions towards living expenses. However, in the end, it was common ground that there was no agreement between the parties that they would share equally in their ordinary living expenses, or that they would adjust their interests in the land, so as to reflect the result of any inequality in their contributions towards these expenses. Rather, the parties agreed that they would hold the land in equal shares, and nothing happened that changed this position, as a matter of law.
It follows that I should put aside the evidence and submissions as to inequalities in contributing to their ordinary living expenses.

Expenses relating to motor vehicles appear to fall into the category I have been calling ordinary living expenses, that is, the kind of expense incurred by people living together, where there was no agreement as to how the expenses would be shared. Similarly, the legal expenses incurred by Ms Boyd are not recoverable from Ms Hummelstad, in the absence of some contract between them dealing with that topic, or except as an incident to any judgment Ms Boyd might now recover in this case.

Ms Hummelstad brought a cross-claim asserting that she had lent Ms Boyd money on 13 separate occasions. This cross-claim raised a variety of issues, some of which were resolved in the course of the hearing. It also led to the need to examine, at least in part, a multitude of financial dealings between the parties, over a period of years.

In 1986 Ms Boyd was a film producer and writer, living in rented premises at
Whale Beach; and Ms Hummelstad worked selling life assurance and superannuation policies. There was some contact between them arising from an attempt to sell a policy, and then, in about June 1986, Ms Hummelstad commenced to live with Ms Boyd. Initially the relationship was sexual and intimate, but it later deteriorated, until the parties separated in late 1991.
For a good deal of this time, Ms Hummelstad's son lived with them.

On any view of the matter, the financial affairs of the parties became intertwined. They each contributed towards the household costs, although there are disputes about the details of this. Additionally, Ms Hummelstad made various loans to Ms Boyd, and she did some unpaid work for Ms Boyd, in Ms
Boyd's capacity as a film producer and writer; and there were other payments of money made between them, as well as what might perhaps be regarded as the usual sharing between two people living together. Most of this detail has no relevance to the issues remaining for decision now, except to the extent to which it casts light on questions of credibility, or goes to the claims for money lent.

In June 1986 the parties were relatively well off financially. Ms Boyd had steady work, whilst Ms Hummelstad was working, and had some $30,000 in the bank and some interest in other properties. Subsequently, Ms Hummelstad was unemployed for quite a long time, except to the extent that she worked with or for Ms Boyd.

In September 1986 Ms Boyd went to Western Australia in connection with her work. Ms Hummelstad says that she worked as Ms Boyd's unpaid assistant during this period, and that she lent Ms Boyd some money.

Subject to that the parties lived at Whale Beach until December 1986, when they went to live in rented premises in Evans Head. (This was a house in the township. It needs to be distinguished from the land nearby, outside the township, that the parties later bought, the subject of the litigation.) Later they lived at various places, including a property at Randwick owned by Ms
Hummelstad, until she sold it in February 1988. Ms Hummelstad then visited her father in Evans Head, when she saw that the land was for sale, and she and Ms
Boyd decided to buy it between them. The contract by which they agreed to buy it was dated 28 March 1988, and completion took place on 29 September 1988.

The parties continued to live in Sydney until September 1989, when they moved back to the rented premises in Evans Head, and then, about December 1989, they moved into a caravan on the land. In the meantime, they made another trip to
Western Australia in early 1989, in connection with Ms Boyd's work. Perhaps it is accurate to say that their relationship deteriorated from that time onwards.

The acquisition of the land 
Ms Hummelstad located the land, whilst she was in the Evans Head area. She telephoned Ms Boyd, in Sydney, and the two decided to buy the land. At about that time, they agreed to form a partnership in relation to the land, but they did not agree on any terms for the partnership agreement. At that stage, they just agreed to agree later on.

The contract price for the purchase of the land was $65,000, but a condition of the contract required the vendors, at the expense of the purchasers, to procure approval for the land to be subdivided; and the expected total cost to the purchasers was about $75,000. Ms Boyd did not have any ready funds, and she intended to borrow her half share from ANZ. On the other hand, Ms
Hummelstad had some $60,000 standing to her credit in her bank account at the date of the contract, 29 March 1988. Ms Boyd arranged to borrow $45,000 from
ANZ. It required a mortgage from both Ms Boyd and Ms Hummelstad, as the persons about to become the registered proprietors of the land, but both of them regarded the mortgage as being in the nature of a guarantee by Ms
Hummelstad of Ms Boyd's liability to ANZ; and as between themselves, the liability to ANZ was solely that of Ms Boyd. Now that the land has been sold by ANZ, and the net proceeds have been paid into Court, Ms Hummelstad asserts a right to be exonerated by Ms Boyd in respect of the amount of Ms Boyd's liability to ANZ, and I do not understand Ms Boyd to put forward any answer to this claim, except as to the measure of the exoneration. This was not the legal position as she envisaged it, but she could not suggest any answer to this claim by Ms Hummelstad, and I do not see any answer to the claim for exoneration.

At one stage Ms Hummelstad contended that when Ms Boyd borrowed $45,000 from
ANZ, only $35,000 was used on account of the purchase of the land, the remaining $10,000 being used by Ms Boyd to repay a loan made to her by Ms
Hummelstad earlier. However, Ms Boyd said without challenge that the whole of the $45,000 was paid to the solicitors acting for the parties on the purchase of the land, and applied towards the purchase price.

However, another question arose, and was contested. ANZ made subsequent advances to Ms Boyd, and to a company she controlled, Helen Boyd Productions
Pty Ltd (THE COMPANY). These advances were also secured by the mortgage granted by the parties to ANZ, so that the fund in Court has effectively been reduced by the amounts deducted by ANZ from the price realised on sale of the land, in repayment of these advances. In these circumstances, I think that it is clear that, as between the parties, Ms Hummelstad is entitled to be exonerated in respect of these sums: as between the parties, Ms Boyd was responsible for the moneys advanced to Ms Boyd by ANZ, and the value of Ms
Hummelstad's interest in the land was not to be diminished by reason of Ms
Boyd's indebtedness to ANZ.

In short, the original position was that the parties were to hold the land equally, and neither the fact of co-ownership nor the fact that the land was mortgaged by the parties to ANZ to secure Ms Boyd's debt to ANZ changed the position that the parties were co-owners in equal shares.

Ms Boyd pleaded a case in estoppel, but made no submissions as to this; and I do not think that the evidence supports such a case.

When ANZ sold the land, it received a total of $214,161.89. Half of that sum is $107,080.94, so that subject to the question of exoneration, each party is entitled to be paid that much. The amount in respect of which Ms Hummelstad is entitled to exoneration (as shown in paragraph 14 of the affidavit of Mr
Britnall) is $134,322.69. Ms Hummelstad is therefore entitled to the whole of the money in Court, together with any accumulated interest. She is also entitled to judgment for $27,241.75, being the difference between $107,080.94 and $134,322.69, together with interest on that sum under section 94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) from 27 July , the date of the payment into Court.

The agreement between the parties 
It is common ground that the parties agreed in a series of conversations that they would share equally in the costs of acquiring the land, developing it, and reselling it, in whole or in part. The conversations were in imprecise form, in terms of how the property was to be developed, and it later emerged that the parties had quite different ideas about this. Initially, they proposed selling part of it to a golf club, but nothing concrete came of this.
Various expenses were incurred in relation to proposals to develop the property, but none of those proposals progressed beyond the point of obtaining relevant approvals, before the land was sold.

I do not think anything can be spelt out of this evidence than a partnership agreement in the most general terms, that there were to be two equal partners, the land being held by them as tenants in common, and with all other terms being implied terms.

It follows that all expenses agreed upon ought to be shared equally. So far as
I can tell, this is approximately what did happen. No precise records were kept, and now that the parties are in dispute, each party asserts that she paid rather more than the other. In any event, I do not think it is possible to disentangle the threads, sufficiently to be able to say that one party contributed any precise sum of money that was greater than the other's contribution.

It is common ground that the partnership has come to an end, and since there has already been what amounts to a taking of accounts, with neither party demonstrating any right to receive any money from the other, no further declaration, order or inquiry is appropriate.

Ouster? 
Ms Boyd claims damages flowing from Ms Hummelstad ousting or excluding her from the land. Ms Hummelstad denies that there was any ouster. Some facts are in dispute, but others are not.

In November 1991 the parties had an argument, and Ms Boyd left the land. She says that thereafter she was effectively ousted, in that she feared for her safety if she returned. However, she acknowledged that she returned to an office on the land "a few times", she went back on New Year's Eve, and again with friends on New Year's Day, and then she went to Victoria for a time, reaching an agreement with Ms Hummelstad that the latter would then occupy the land, on agreed terms.

This does not amount to ouster, in the relevant sense; and this claim therefore fails.

The mare and foal 
This claim was raised for the first time in final address. There are passing references to the matter in the evidence, but so far as I can tell there never was any debate focussed on this issue. In short, I do not think it can be said that the question was fairly raised for decision, and I therefore ought not to try to decide it. In any event, the facts contended for by Ms
Boyd in part "B" of her written submissions, necessary to support the claim, are not established by the evidence. I treat this claim as not being before me.

The loans by Ms Hummelstad to Ms Boyd 
There is really no serious question about some of these. Thus, Ms Hummelstad deposed to making a number of loans to Ms Boyd, and Ms Boyd did not deny these loans: $4,000 on 13 June 1986, $3,000 and also $2,000 in August 1986, and $9,000 in June 1988. Ms Hummelstad deposed to a loan of $3,000 on 25 October , corroborated by her cheque butt and bank statement, and Ms Boyd could neither deny nor admit the transaction, in cross-examination.

Ms Hummelstad claims to have lent $13,460 to Ms Boyd in February 1989, in connection with the parties' trip to Western Australia at that time. There is no question but that Ms Hummelstad paid (through her American Express account) $4,460 on account of air fares and the hire of a motor vehicle, but the evidence that she paid a further $9,000 in cash to Ms Boyd is unconvincing.
The matter was hardly explored in evidence, and the relevant page of Ms
Hummelstad's bank statement is missing. More significantly, however, what evidence there is seems to provide some support for Ms Boyd's version, that the parties shared the expenses of this trip. I cannot say that I am particularly confident about the matter, but in the end, I do not think that
Ms Hummelstad has proved this part of her claim.

Ms Hummelstad pleaded that she had lent Ms Boyd $7,500 in 1990. Ms
Hummelstad's initial account of this, in her affidavit of 22 June 1994, was devoid of any real content. Ms Boyd responded to this affidavit, and then Ms
Hummelstad swore a further affidavit of 14 September 1994, in which she gave a detailed account of advancing, in succession between 22 August and 5 October , sums of $1,602.50, $350, $500, $445.45, $1,051, $200, $400, $300.43, $947.20, $243.98, $200, $380, $300, $216.42, $300 and $400, a total of $7,836.98. This account remains substantially unchallenged, and I accept it, although as Ms Hummelstad accepted, the claim should be limited to the amount claimed, $7,500.

Ms Hummelstad said that she lent Ms Boyd $2,500 in January 1990, and a further $1,667 later that year. Ms Boyd admits the payment to her of these sums but denies that they were loans. Given all the circumstances, including the number of payments back and forth between the parties, some of them for the purpose of persuading their respective banks that they could meet their commitments, I am not satisfied that Ms Hummelstad has proved these parts of her claim.

Next, Ms Hummelstad says that she lent Ms Boyd $7,000 in May 1991. Ms Boyd admits asking for financial assistance, and admits receiving the money in question. Initially, she denied that the money was paid to her as a loan, but in cross-examination she said she could not be sure about this. However, the financial records of the company include an entry recording a personal loan of $7,000 by Ms Hummelstad on 7 June 1991; and Ms Boyd conceded that this recorded the receipt of money as a loan.

Finally, Ms Hummelstad sued in respect of a loan of $6,500 made on 21 June ; and Ms Boyd effectively conceded this claim in cross-examination.

Earlier, Ms Hummelstad claimed to have lent Ms Boyd $10,000 on 22 June 1987, being part of the sum of $20,000 that Ms Hummelstad borrowed from a Ms
MacClelland. On Ms Hummelstad's case, this loan of $10,000 was repaid by Ms
Boyd out of the $45,000 that Ms Boyd borrowed from ANZ, at the time that ANZ advanced money to enable the parties to buy the land. However, as already stated, it seems clear that the whole of the $45,000 borrowed from ANZ was applied towards the payment of the land. Ms Hummelstad contended that Ms Boyd had repaid the loan due from Ms Boyd to her then, but I do not accept this.

The question is further complicated by the fact that Ms Boyd denies that the payment of $10,000 to her by Ms Hummelstad was a loan. Ms Boyd said that she received $10,000, but that only $5,000 of this sum was paid as a loan, and she considered that this sum had been repaid. This evidence was hardly satisfactory, or convincing. However, no doubt for sound tactical reasons, Ms
Hummelstad advanced a case that I do not accept, and I do not think that I can justifiably find in her favour on a case she did not advance, just because this part of Ms Boyd's case seems unsatisfactory.

A further loan was pleaded, for $12,000 in September 1988. On Ms Boyd's case,
Ms Hummelstad gave her $11,500, as a gift, to enable her to buy a particular painting. The parties took quite different stances in their affidavits, and there was virtually nothing said about the matter in the course of the oral evidence. In all the circumstances I do not think that the claim has been proved.

In summary, Ms Hummelstad is entitled to judgment on her cross-claim for $42,000, together with interest under Section 94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). A calculation of interest is appended. For the purposes of the calculation, I have assumed that each loan was made on the 15th day of the month mentioned, except where the precise dates of the loans have been established, and mentioned above, and
I have treated all of the loans making up the sum of $7,500 as having been made on 15 September 1990.

Credibility 
Ms Boyd seemed to me to be trying to tell the truth as she knew it, but I do not think that all of her evidence is reliable. Ms Hummelstad seemed to be relatively robust in personality, with the odd result that at times, when Ms
Boyd was cross-examining Ms Hummelstad, the former was distressed, and the latter was not. Both of them seem to have been quite upset by the break up of their relationship, and I am inclined to think that for this reason, and by reason of their reactions to these events, neither of them is a reliable historian, in relation to these matters. Except where I have indicated, I think that Ms Boyd's account of events is more likely to be reliable than Ms
Hummelstad's.

Conclusions 
I make a declaration that the partnership has been dissolved, and order that the money in Court be paid out to Ms Hummelstad. On the cross-claim I give judgement for the cross-claimant for $117,067.01 including interest. Otherwise
I dismiss the claim and the cross-claim. I order Ms Boyd to pay the costs of
Ms Hummelstad. I grant liberty to either party to apply if any question arises as to calculation.
