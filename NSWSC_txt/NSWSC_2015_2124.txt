Evidence admissible  
Catchwords: 
CRIMINAL LAW - admissibility of coincidence evidence in <case> of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/) - whether leave should be granted under <case> on Crown's failure to give reasonable notice  
JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: On 18 July 2009, crime scene officers located a blood-soaked piece of cotton cloth folded into four (that is to say, folded in half and folded in half again) on the floor of the third bedroom at 55A Boundary Road in which the bodies of the two deceased children were found. The ends of the folded cloth were secured by a red rubber band. It is not in issue that a mixture of the DNA of Min Lin (as the major contributor) and Lily Lin (as the minor contributor) was identified on samples cut from the cloth.
The cloth was examined and photographed by Ms Te, both in its original (bound) form and after the rubber band was removed and the cloth unfolded. In its bound state the cloth piece measured 2.5cm by 4cm. When the rubber band was removed and the cloth was unfolded it measured 8cm by 12cm. The cloth and the remnants of the red rubber band have been tendered in the trial as Exhibit BBB.
The cloth, both as photographed and in specie, has a puckered appearance, having apparently retained some of the creases and folds from being folded and secured with the rubber band when the cloth became soaked in blood. A symmetrical arrangement of four circular-type patterns formed in blood are also discernible on the cloth, with void areas generally centre of the round shapes with blood diffusing from them.
In her evidence Ms Te described the cloth as follows: 
The muslin-type material, once it's folded out, appears to have been folded in half and then half again and then it appears to have possibly been placed over something that was circular to produce ... those circular images.
At the time she gave her evidence, Ms Te indicated on one of the photographic images of the cloth projected on a screen, what she described as "four circles" or "round circular marks".
Dr Raymond also gave evidence that whilst the cloth was being examined and photographed by Ms Te, it appeared to her that there were "circular shapes that were visible in what appeared to be bloodstains, and which were spaced in a regular array".
It is the Crown case that the cloth was at one time wrapped around the rounded head of the "hammer-like weapon", a description utilised by Dr Irvine, forensic pathologist, to describe the object with a round surface about the size of a hammer head that was used to inflict the multiple blunt force injuries she identified on each of the deceased.
There was no challenge to Dr Irvine's evidence that a "hammer-like weapon" inflicted many, if not most, of the blunt force injuries to the head of each of the deceased.
Blunt force injuries and asphyxiation were identified by Dr Irvine as either the primary or secondary causes of death of Min Lin, Lily Lin, Henry Lin and Terry Lin. I note that although asphyxiation was the primary cause of death of both Lily Lin and Henry Lin, Lily Lin also sustained a gross deformation of her face with a depressed injury to the centre of her face which entered the sinus cavity.
It is the Crown case that the accused fashioned the weapon, with the cloth at one time secured on its rounded head by a rubber band, in order to either cushion the impact of the weapon he intended to wield at the heads of the deceased, or he fashioned it in that way for some other reason consistent with that intention.
It is also the Crown case that the accused initially fashioned the weapon by attaching a piece of rope to the handle with the loose end of the rope wrapped or looped around his hand or wrist, but that the rope became detached from his arm before Irene and the children were killed, thereby explaining the rope patterns in blood on the walls in their bedrooms as they were being struck repeatedly with the hammer, and the absence of rope patterns in Min and Lily Lin's bedroom.
Detective Harkins has given evidence that on his analysis of the crime scene, and on his analysis of the blood patterning discernible in each of the three bedrooms and the hallway connecting them (inclusive of the rope patterns in blood in Bedrooms 2 and 3), the order in which the deceased were killed was Min and Lily Lin, then Irene Lin and then the children. He also gave evidence that in his opinion the killings occurred within a short period of time of each other.
On Detective Harkins' analysis of the order of the killings, the piece of cloth, replete with the rubber band and the DNA of Min and Lily Lin, must have been implicated in some way in their murder (perhaps becoming detached after initial blows were struck) and then transported into the children's bedroom by the murderer, where it was inadvertently left or dropped, perhaps in the course of a struggle. The unchallenged evidence of Detective Harkins is that Terry Lin was engaged in a prolonged struggle with the murderer, evidenced by the spread of his blood in a range of distinct and different blood patterns throughout the bedroom.
The defence do not accept that Detective Harkins' opinion as to the order and timing of the killings is the only conclusion open on an objective analysis of the crime scene evidence. As I understand the cross-examination of Detective Harkins, it is the defence case that not only is there a reasonable possibility of more than one assailant (contrary to the Crown case that the accused acted alone in committing the murders), but there is also a reasonable possibility that at least Henry Lin may have been asphyxiated in another part of the house and then assaulted in his bedroom. Further, again as I understand the defence case, it is open on the evidence for the jury to find that there was a considerable time interval between the killings, including the reasonable possibility that when the children were dropped at home at 10.30pm on 17 July 2009, their parents and aunt were already dead or dying, which exculpates the accused as the murderer.
Finally, it is also the Crown case that the accused's various conversations with Witness A, a prison informer, after his arrest in May 2011 are capable of being interpreted by the jury as admissions that he used a hammer as the murder weapon which he disposed of the following morning en route to collect his parents-in-law after police were notified by his wife that the bodies of at least four of the five deceased had been found at 55A Boundary Road (Witness A is yet to be called). It is the accused's case that he was led into speaking with Witness A about the evidence that he understood from the service of the brief would be tendered against him and that, properly understood, he was simply reciting back, in faltering English, that evidence and his reaction to it. In summary, Mr Turnbull submitted the accused revealed nothing to Witness A that was not otherwise known to police including, in particular, his reference to a "hammer-like weapon" or a hammer as the murder weapon.

The execution of a search warrant in 2010
In the course of the execution of a search warrant at the accused's home at Beck Street on 11 May 2010, an item described as a "massage device" was located in his bedroom. In another part of the house police located a plastic container containing an assortment of rubber bands of varying sizes, the majority of which were red in colour. The device was photographed in situ and seized by police.
The finding of both items was notified to the defence some years ago. While photographs were included in the brief of evidence served prior to the committal, the Crown case statement, served as part of the case management regime in this Court, did not refer to the massage device or the container of red rubber bands as part of the evidence upon which the Crown relied in proof of its case. The Crown did not refer to either item in opening submissions to the jury in the first or second (aborted) trials. Both trials were aborted before the Crown had led any evidence as to what was found at the crime scene or any analysis of the crime scene. Dr Irvine had not given evidence.
In a statement dated 4 February 2015, Ms Te detailed her examination of the massage device which was undertaken at the request of the Crown (it would seem for the first time) some days earlier, that is, within days of the accused's trial commencing before me. Ms Te described the device as consisting of a wooden board approximately 25cm by 40cm with four pieces of wood of varying sizes nailed on top of one another. A green non-slip rubber mat adhered to one of the wooden planks on the bottom of the device. A metal bolt, approximately 90mm long, 8mm thick, with a 12mm rounded head was bolted into the top of the wooden device, over which was placed a folded hand towel with a red rubber band securing the hand towel to the bolt head. The red rubber band was wrapped around the bolt head three times. The hand towel was approximately 65cm long and 30cm wide. It had been folded at least twice lengthwise before being folded end-to-end. When the rubber band and the hand towel were removed, the towel was unfolded and laid flat. A number of 1.5-2cm circular depressions were visible on the fabric in a loose symmetrical formation, loosely corresponding with the size of the bolt head.
On 5 February 2015, before the commencement of the trial before the jury, the defence were served with Ms Te's statement and advised that the Crown proposed to tender the massage device and the plastic container of red rubber bands, and adduce evidence of Ms Te's examination of them. Although the Crown did not at that time identify the precise basis upon which it sought the admission of the evidence, it was clear to me from the general outline of the Crown's argument at that time, that it was a specie of circumstantial evidence likely to invoke the application of either [ss 97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and/or 98 of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) .
The defence indicated its objection to the tender of the evidence on the basis that for the Crown to seek to adduce it for the first time in the accused's third trial was contrary to case management orders made by Johnson J on 25 November 2013 under [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3), Div 3 of the [Criminal Procedure Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) . (Since then I have ruled that I do not regard myself as bound by the order made by Johnson J on 25 November 2013 (R versus Xie (No 8)  <case> Although that ruling was decided in a different factual context, Mr Turnbull did not seek to re-argue the point on the Crown's application to adduce the evidence as coincidence evidence.)
I directed that the Crown should not open on the items found at the accused's home and that argument directed to their admissibility should be reserved until later in the trial. The issue has been adverted to by counsel from time to time since then, including before Ms Te was called. She gave evidence over four days from 31 March 2015. It was agreed at that time that since Ms Te was to be recalled at some later point in the trial, the admissibility of her evidence as it related to the examination of the massage device, its admission as coincidence and/or tendency evidence, and the relevance of the evidence to the issues in the trial, could be dealt with at that time.

The service of notices under [ss 97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and [98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)
On 12 May 2015, notices under [ss 97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) and [98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) were served in which the Crown sought the admission of the massage device and the container of rubber bands in a composite tender as either coincidence evidence or as tendency evidence. In the course of argument on 15 May 2015 in the absence of the jury, the Crown accepted that if the evidence did not satisfy the test for admission as coincidence evidence, it would fail the test for admission as tendency evidence and, for that reason, the notice served under [s 97](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) was not pressed.
[Sections 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html), [100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html) and [101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provide: The coincidence rule 
Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and  the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html), or  the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.
 Court may dispense with notice requirements  ... 
The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the coincidence rule is not to apply to particular coincidence evidence despite the party's failure to give notice under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html)  ...  Further restrictions on ... coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 
This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section ... 98.  ... coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution, cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.  ...
As Beech-Jones J observed in R versus MR [[2013] NSWCCA 236:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/2013/236.html "View Case" ) [65] One textual difference between the former [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) and the current [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) concerns the location within the section of the reference to "similarities" between the two or more events and the circumstances surrounding the events.
Former [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) was only engaged if the evidence concerned "two or more related events", as defined in [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html)
Thus in Zhang at [140] Simpson J identified an "anterior step" to considering whether the evidence had "significant probative value", namely "determin[ing] whether two or more events the subject of the tendered evidence are substantially and relevantly similar and whether the circumstances in which they (are alleged to have) occurred are substantially similar" (see also
R versus Ceissman <case> at <case> per
Latham J).  [66] Under the current version of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) there is no longer a threshold or anterior inquiry of this kind. This reflects the apparent purpose of the amendment, which was to broaden the body of evidence that engaged [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) and subject it to the test of having significant probative value. However, although the anterior inquiry identified in Zhang at [140] is no longer applicable, it is still necessary at the outset for the tendering party to identify the reason they seek to tender the evidence in question in order to establish whether it is seeking to invoke the "basis" referred to in [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html)
As part of that process the tendering party will need to identify the "events" that are said to have occurred, the particular act or state of mind that it is said that the evidence of the events proved, the relevant similarities that are to be relied upon and the reasoning process that is sought to be engaged.
The coincidence notice served by the Crown identifies the two events which occurred and the similarities in those events (or the circumstances in which they occurred) as consisting in the accused's construction of the massage-type device, in particular that he secured a piece of folded cloth with a red rubber band around the metal bolt to operate as a cushion against the bolt being applied under pressure to his body, and the folded cloth located at the crime scene secured by a red rubber band, said by the Crown to have been at one time secured over the rounded head of the hammer-like weapon used to attack the deceased. The fact that the cloth on the massage device had circular impressions embossed on it consistent with the general shape of the head of the bolt, and that the cloth at the crime scene also had circular shapes visible in the bloodstains, consistent with it having been placed over a round object and secured in place before it came into contact with blood, was said by the Crown to be a marked similarity such that it is improbable that both events, or the circumstances in which both events occurred, occurred coincidentally.
In the Crown's written submissions, the argument in support of the tender of the evidence as coincidence evidence was developed further to draw what were said to be similar qualities between the two items. The Crown submitted that the massage device was a handmade improvised device with cloth folded and then secured to the bolt to soften its impact when applied to the accused's back, and that the hammer-like weapon used to inflict the blunt force injuries identified on the bodies of each of the deceased was also improvised by the addition of the cloth secured to its rounded head for a similar but less benign purpose. The Crown submitted that similarities in the "homemade improvised murder weapon" and "the homemade improvised massage device" focusing, in particular, on the attachment of the cloth with a rubber band to the surfaces on each item designed to be used under pressure or force was also not a matter of coincidence.
In the Crown's submission, the accused's construction of the massage device, and his use of a red rubber band in its construction, allowed for an inference to be drawn by the jury that the similarities between its construction, and the cloth bound by a red rubber band found at the crime scene, together with the appearance of both pieces of cloth when unfolded rendered it improbable that the two events (that is, the construction of the two items) occurred coincidentally. In the Crown's submission, that reasoning, when considered with all the evidence in the Crown case, provided a foundation for the jury to infer that the accused was the murderer.
The same submissions were advanced by the Crown in support of the requirement, imposed by [s 98(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html), that the evidence tendered as coincidence evidence have significant probative value, and the further requirement under [s 101(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html) that it outweigh any unfair prejudice to the accused by its admission.
The Crown submitted there is no prejudicial effect in the admission into evidence of the massage device and the red rubber bands, or Ms Te's evidence concerning them, since there is no impermissible reasoning that the jury would be likely to engage in considering its use or its construction, or any risk that the jury will accord the massage device and/or the red rubber bands, as items of circumstantial evidence, any more significance than they consider that they deserve. Further, there is no risk that the jury will engage in impermissible speculation by reason of what the Crown has identified as the legitimate inferences that may flow from the admission of the evidence.

The question of reasonable notice under [s 98(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html)
Mr Turnbull did not concede that the Crown's indication of its intention to adduce the evidence of what was found in the accused's home before the trial commenced before me, coupled with the service of the coincidence notice in the course of the trial, constituted reasonable notice for the purposes of satisfying the first statutory requirement for the reception of the evidence as coincidence evidence under [s 98(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html)
The Crown accepted that service of the coincidence notice on 12 May 2015 does not constitute "reasonable notice" and, that being so, it was necessary that it apply for a direction under [s 100(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html) that it be permitted to adduce the evidence despite the late service of the written notice.
In R versus Harker  <case> at <case>- <case>, Howie J held that the matters specified in [s 192(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) are to be considered in determining whether a direction under [s 100(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html) should be given, the most important considerations being the importance of the evidence [(s 192(2)(c))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html); the nature of the proceedings [(s 192(2)(d))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html); and and any prejudice to the accused by the failure of the Crown to give reasonable notice [(s 192(2)(b)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) I note that the matters specified in [s 192(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html)-(e) are not exhaustive.
Mr Turnbull submitted that for the Crown to be permitted to adduce the evidence as coincidence evidence at this time, in support of what he described as the Crown's entirely speculative case theory that the cloth found at the crime scene was at one time attached to a hammer (or the hammer-like weapon), and what he described as a "pseudo theory" that it was then carried into the children's bedroom and left there inadvertently by the accused, was productive of "inherent prejudice". He submitted that the general unfairness to the accused in the Crown's late service of the written notice, together with what he submitted was the lack of any sufficient evidential foundation for the Crown's assertion of a similarity in the events (or the circumstances in which they occurred) identified in the coincidence notice and developed in the Crown's written submissions, should result in the application for a direction under [s 100(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) being refused.
When invited to address the extent to which it would be unfair to the accused to allow the Crown to adduce the evidence, Mr Turnbull initially submitted that he was compromised by the late service of the coincidence notice in obtaining instructions and generally by time pressures in having to deal with another feature of the Crown's circumstantial evidence case in the course of the trial. He declined the invitation to defer the question of admissibility until his instructions were clarified. Mr Turnbull also submitted that in the passage of time since the accused's arrest and the seizure of the items from his home, and being notified of the Crown's intention to lead them in evidence under [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) of the Act, the defence have had no opportunity to undertake any useful comparison of the rubber band utilised by the accused in the construction of the massage-type device (which he conceded on the accused's behalf was designed to cushion the pressure of the bolt when he lay on the device), and the red rubber band binding the bloodstained cloth found at the crime scene, or any comparison of the cloth used in both events. The Crown's coincidence notice does not identify any relevant similarity between the type of fabric used in both scenarios. Insofar as the cloth is concerned, the similarities identified in the notice are limited to what are evident on both pieces as impressions resulting from the cloth being folded a number of times and secured on some round or circular-shaped item by a red rubber band.
The red and blue rubber bands in the container found at the accused's home were examined at the request of the Crown in April 2015 for the purposes of a comparison with the rubber band segments at one time comprising the red rubber band used to secure the blood soaked cloth found at the crime scene. In the opinion of Catherine Fleay, the team leader from the Chemical Criminalistics Unit of the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service, further examination of the segments was not considered likely to yield any meaningful results due to the inability of the analysts to conduct a "full class characteristic examination" on the segments due to their physical state on the one hand, and because the container of rubber bands found at the accused's home was not considered a "unique batched source" such that any examination of the rubber bands in the container with the segments of the rubber bands found at the crime scene, with each other, would be meaningless. Ms Fleay's opinion was disclosed to the defence.
Insofar as Ms Fleay's opinion bears upon whether a direction under [s 100(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html) should be given, it seems to me that the ubiquitous nature of red rubber bands and, as Ms Fleay recognised, the fact that those found at the accused's home were of various sizes and width and not from a "batched" source, would have been unlikely to have yielded any meaningful results either before or after the red rubber band securing the cloth at the crime scene was cut into segments.
On the question of whether a direction under [s 100(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s100.html) should issue, Mr Turnbull relied upon the tests Dr Raymond performed in an attempt to replicate the pattern or marks on the cloth from the crime scene, and her opinion that it was unlikely the cloth was attached to a hammer. Dr Raymond's opinion, coupled with Dr Irvine's evidence that the cloth was small enough to fit inside the mouth of Min Lin and Lily Lin as a makeshift gag, was also relied upon by Mr Turnbull on the separate question whether the evidence satisfied the test for admission as coincidence evidence.
Mr Turnbull submitted that Dr Raymond's evidence, coupled with Dr Irvine's evidence, deprives the Crown of the necessary evidential support for the Crown case theory that the cloth was at one time used on the rounded head of the hammer-type weapon and, for that reason, a direction permitting the Crown to adduce the evidence should not be given.
In considering that submission it is necessary to examine Dr Raymond's evidence with some care. Dr Raymond was asked by the investigating police to undertake a number of tests in order to determine whether the round circular shaped patterns in blood on the cloth from the crime scene could have been caused as a result of the fabric being wrapped around the head of a hammer with a rubber band during contact with blood or, in the alternative, as a result of the cloth simply being wrapped in a ball and blood-soaked, as it was found in situ. It is not clear from her evidence what hammer or hammers she utilised in the course of her testing.
In testing those hypotheses, she tested two variables: the first, by placing the cloth on a hammer secured by a rubber band folded on itself twice; and, secondly, by folding the cloth twice and securing the cloth with a rubber band into a ball. The various actions she then employed were dipping the cloth ball directly into blood, rolling it on its side into blood, leaving it in blood for less than 10 seconds, leaving it in blood for 5 minutes, striking a hammer with the cloth attached into a pool of blood three times on the laboratory bench, leaving the cloth on the hammer for 30 minutes prior to removing it after blood contact, and removing it immediately from the hammer after blood contact. None of these tests resulted in any replication of the impressions on the cloth found at the crime scene. The largest number of times that she struck the bench top into a pool of blood with the hammer was three times as the cloth became detached from the hammer under additional strikes. There was no evidence as to how much blood was pooled for that purpose.
Contrary to one of the submissions Mr Turnbull relied upon as supporting the alternate hypothesis that the cloth bound in rubber bands was taken to the scene by the murderer to be used as a gag, it was not Dr Raymond's evidence that the cloth had to be moist or wet (presumably with saliva on the defence case) before it could absorb blood, but rather, that when it was moistened with water, whether before or after contact with blood, the blood patterning was more diffuse through the fabric as distinct from it being less diffuse when the item was not wet or moist. It is not clear from Dr Raymond's evidence whether she used new cloth or used cloth in her experiments, whether they had different absorption capacities or whether blood, in sufficient quantities, would serve to moisten the fabric.
What Dr Raymond concluded from that regime of testing was that it was unlikely that the cloth was attached to a hammer in the way proposed (or at least to any hammer that she had access to for the purpose of the experiment) because the cloth, and I assume the rubber band, became detached, again, I assume, before any or sufficient blood penetrated the fabric. In the result, she was also unable to replicate the pattern on the cloth from rolling or dipping the cloth in its bound form into blood.
The fact that Dr Raymond was not able to replicate the pattern utilising the variables she set for testing purposes, and that she concluded, so far as the testing allowed, that it was unlikely the cloth was attached to a hammer, leaves open the question as to how the pattern on the cloth from the crime scene was formed and how Min and Lily Lin's DNA was deposited on it. That question remains to be considered in the context of all the evidence, including, for the purposes of the Crown's application to tender the evidence as coincidence evidence, what the jury may accept the accused revealed to Witness A about the hammer as the murder weapon and what they consider his motivations were in seeking, with the pretence of Witness A's complicity, to have a hammer purchased and foreign DNA placed on it, to implicate someone else as the murderer.
Having regard to the matters specified in [s 192](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), I am satisfied there is no inherent or actual prejudice to the accused in allowing the Crown to adduce the evidence at this time in the trial. I am fortified in that view by the fact that Mr Turnbull cross-examined Dr Raymond and Dr Irvine in a way that indicates to me every consideration has been given by the defence to dealing with the Crown's intention to adduce the coincidence evidence, despite late notice in the formal service of the written coincidence notice as required by [s 98(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) He will also have the opportunity to cross-examine Ms Te when she is recalled.
I am also satisfied that there is a sufficient foundation in the evidence led to date, and what I anticipate will be adduced through Witness A, for the Crown to seek to make out the Crown case theory that the hammer-like weapon was initially constructed with cloth attached to the rounded head, but that it became detached upon it being struck on or at the heads of Min and Lily Lin and that it became blood-soaked in that process.
Finally, I am satisfied that in the overall presentation of the Crown case, the evidence is of importance as part of the Crown case that the accused murdered the deceased and that a direction should be given under [s 101(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html) for that reason.

Should the evidence be admitted as coincidence evidence
As observed by Simpson J at [25] in R versus Gale; R versus Duckworth <case> (a view with which Basten JA and I agreed): 
At its heart, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) is a provision concerning the drawing of inferences. The purpose sought to be achieved by the tender of coincidence evidence is to provide the foundation upon which the tribunal of fact could draw an inference. The inference is that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. The process of reasoning from which that inference would be drawn is:  two or more events occurred; and  there were similarities in those events; or there were similarities in the circumstances in which those events occurred; or there were similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred; and  having regard to those similarities, it is improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally;  therefore the person in question did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.
Her Honour went on to emphasise that it is important to recognise that the process of reasoning and the drawing of inferences (in this case that the accused is the murderer) is for the jury. Her Honour said at [26]: ... this process of reasoning and the drawing of the inferences (that the person did the act or had the state of mind) is for the tribunal of fact ...
Part of that process involves findings of fact. Did the two (or more) events occur? Were there relevant similarities? Where the party tendering the evidence relies upon a number of asserted similarities, the tribunal of fact must identify which, if any, of those similarities have been established.
Before asking itself the penultimate question - is it improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally? - it must discard any asserted similarities not established.
The admissibility of evidence tendered as coincidence evidence under [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) requires an assessment of the following factual underpinnings: ) Is there evidence capable of establishing the occurrence of the two events identified by the Crown? ) Is there evidence capable of establishing similarities in the two events? ) Are the similarities capable of supporting a conclusion that the coincidental occurrence of the events is improbable? ) An evaluation as to whether the evidence will, either by itself or in conjunction with other evidence, have significant probative value and whether the probative value, as assessed, substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect by the admission of the evidence, the balancing exercise required by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).
As to issues 1-3 above, it is no part of my function to do more than determine whether the evidence is such that the jury, acting reasonably, might make a comparison of the similarities between the accused's construction of the massage device, and the use to which the cloth was put (or was reasonably likely to have been put) by the murderer in fashioning the murder weapon, and to conclude that they were not constructed as a matter of coincidence and whether, if a finding of that kind is made, it is capable of rationally effecting the probability that the accused is the murderer. I am satisfied the evidence has that capacity.
Issue 4 requires that I make an evaluation, and an informed prediction, of the probable weight of the coincidence evidence, taken at its highest and from its coexistence with other items of circumstantial evidence in the Crown case. That exercise is encapsulated by the approach of Whealy JA in DSJ versus R; NS versus R <case> (with whom Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreed) where, at [62], his Honour approved, subject to three qualifications, the approach of Simpson J in R versus Zhang <case>; [158 A Crim R 504:] 
It appears that Simpson J had earlier analysed the processes by which the tender of tendency evidence under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s97.html) of the Act was to be determined: R versus Fletcher <case>; <case>- <case>. In
Zhang , having referred to the earlier decision, her Honour (at [139]; p ) said: 
The analysis is no different in the case of evidence tendered under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) The principles are these:  coincidence evidence is not to be admitted if the court thinks that evidence would not, either by itself, or having regard to other evidence already adduced, or anticipated, have significant probative value;  probative value is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (see the Dictionary to the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) );  the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence is a question for the tribunal of fact - here, the jury;  the probative value actually to be assigned to any item of evidence cannot finally be determined until all of the evidence in the case is complete;  the task of the judge in determining whether to admit evidence tendered as coincidence evidence is therefore essentially an evaluative and predictive one. The judge is required, firstly , to determine whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; secondly (if that determination is affirmative) to evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer [(1996) 89 A Crim R 457)] probative value. If the evaluation results in a conclusion that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value, the evidence is admissible. If the assessment is otherwise, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) mandates that the evidence is not to be admitted.
At [72] his Honour reformulated the second part of the fifth proposition above as follows: 
As I perceive it, the point being made by her Honour is simply this: if a hypothetical jury would think it unlikely that the evidence were important in relation to the facts in issue then the trial Judge might the more readily conclude that the evidence lacks the capacity required for admissibility.
Simpson J's formulation recognises that the trial Judge has no part to play in the evaluation of the actual weight to be given to any of the evidence or to its ultimate assessment. The substance of her Honour's formulation is that the trial Judge is required to take the evidence at its highest, and to determine whether it has the capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue. In undertaking that task, the statute also requires, as her Honour recognised, that the evidence may be examined on its own account, or by having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party. As I have said, the trial Judge does not make any evaluation of the actual weight of the evidence nor does he or she make any prediction about the weight that will actually be assigned to the evidence by the jury in the trial. As stated in Mundine , what must be assessed is the role that the evidence, if accepted, would play in the resolution of the disputed fact - its capacity to contribute to that resolution.
The fact that there are, or might be, other explanations for the use to which the rubber band bound cloth found at the crime scene might have been put so as to explain its implication in the murder of Min and Lily Lin, does not, in my view, detract from what I am satisfied is the significant probative value of it as coincidence evidence.
Mr Turnbull did not submit that I should find that any alternative hypothesis inconsistent with the accused's guilt that may ultimately be formulated for the jury, including any submission that the evidence allowed for the reasonable probability that there was more than one assailant or that the murders were separated in time and in an order different from that appointed by Detective Harkins, diminished the probative value of the evidence or deprived it of the quality of being significant so as to compel its exclusion under [s 98(1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) Neither did he submit that there is any prejudicial effect in the tender of the evidence that could not be cured by appropriately formulated directions so as to compel its exclusion under [s 101.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s101.html)
Accordingly, I will permit the Crown to adduce the evidence.
