EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (REVISED)
Mr Burbidge, QC, has objected to the tender of a report of Dr Neil Adams of 1 July 2010. Dr Adams is a professional ergonomist, if I may say, well known in this area of practice. The objection from learned senior counsel is by application of what is often referred to as the "basis rule", exemplified by the decision of the High Court of Australia in Ramsay versus Watson  <case>; [108 CLR 642.] That is to say, if the assumptions made by the expert are not otherwise proved in evidence, then the opinion of the expert is, not simply of no weight, but, rather, inadmissible.
Certainly at this stage, where the objection is taken, I have heard virtually all of the lay evidence, including the extensive evidence of the plaintiff. And with great respect, there is something to be said for the argument that many of the matters assumed by Dr Adams, on the basis of the information with which he was provided, are unlikely to come fully up to proof.
Having said that, it seems to me that the question of whether the assumptions made by Dr Adams are sufficiently like the case that the plaintiff proves to validate, if I may use that expression, all of the opinions expressed by Dr Adams, is itself a question of fact: Paric versus John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd  <case>; [59 ALJR 844.] That question of fact can only be decided at the end of the case. This case, is in that regard unlike Ramsey versus Watson, where it was patently clear that the facts assumed by the defendant's medical expert could not be made good at the trial because the witnesses necessary to prove those facts were upon the statement of the defendant's counsel, not to be called to give that evidence at the trial.
There remains a question whether, despite the obvious differences between the assumptions made by Dr Adams and the general thrust of the evidence in the case, his assumptions are sufficiently like the facts as they are finally proved to be. For those reasons I think it is appropriate to admit his report into evidence, subject, however, to an order to protect the defendant's position, having the effect of excluding the operation of [s 60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) .
Accordingly, Dr Adams report of 1 July 2010 is admitted as Exhibit G. I order that the assumptions narrated by Dr Adams in his report will stand only as evidence of the assumptions he made and not as evidence of the truth of them.
