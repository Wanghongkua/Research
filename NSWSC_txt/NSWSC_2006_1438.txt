ADOPTIONS LIST  
WHITE J  
Wednesday, 20 December 2006  /05 Re S and the [Adoption Act 2000](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) (No. 2)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: There are three applications for the adoption of two children from the Philippines. The children are brother and sister. The reason there are three applications is because of uncertainty as to what law governs the adoption of children from the Philippines. The Philippines is a signatory to the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of
Intercountry Adoption (concluded 29 May 1993) (entered into force 1 May 1995) ("The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption" or "the Convention").  The first application in point of time was made by the prospective adoptive parents pursuant to Chapter 4 of the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) ("[Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)"). An application has also been made by the prospective adoptive parents pursuant to [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) of the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 . An application is also made by the Director-General of the Department of Community Services pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s107.html) of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) for an order for the adoption of the children by the prospective adoptive parents.  
The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption   Both Australia and the Philippines are signatories to the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. One of the objects of the Convention is to establish safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights as recognised in international law (Article 1(a)). The Convention applies where a child is habitually resident in one Contracting State ("the State of origin"), has been, is being, or is to be moved to another Contracting State ("the receiving State"), either after his or her adoption in the State of origin by spouses or a person habitually resident in the receiving State, or for the purposes of such an adoption in the receiving State or in the State of origin (Article 2(1)).  Chapter II is headed "Requirements for Intercountry Adoptions". It provides:  "Article 4  
An adoption within the scope of the Convention shall take place only if the competent authorities of the State of origin--  a have established that the child is adoptable,  b have determined, after possibilities for placement of the child within the
State of origin have been given due consideration, that an intercountry adoption is in the child's best interests,  c have ensured that  the persons, institutions and authorities whose consent is necessary for adoption, have been counselled as may be necessary and duly informed of the effects of their consent, in particular whether or not an adoption will result in the termination of the legal relationship between the child and his or her family of origin,  such persons, institutions and authorities have given their consent freely, in the required legal form, and expressed or evidenced in writing,  the consents have not been induced by payment or compensation of any kind and have not been withdrawn, and  the consent of the mother, where required, has been given only after the birth of the child, and  d have ensured, having regard to the age and degree of maturity of the child, that  he or she has been counselled and duly informed of the effects of the adoption and of his or her consent to the adoption, where such consent is required,  consideration has been given to the child's wishes and opinions,  the child's consent to the adoption, where such consent is required, has been given freely, in the required legal form, and expressed or evidenced in writing, and  such consent has not been induced by payment or compensation of any kind.  
Article 5  
An adoption within the scope of the convention shall take place only if the competent authorities of the receiving State--  a have determined that the prospective adoptive parents are eligible and suited to adopt,  b have ensured that the prospective adoptive parents have been counselled as may be necessary, and  c have determined that the child is or will be authorised to enter and reside permanently in that State.  Chapter III provides for the designation by each Contracting State of a
Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Convention upon such authorities. States may appoint more than one Central Authority. The
Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations provide for the establishment of a Commonwealth Central Authority (Regulations 5 and ), and State Central Authorities (Regulations 8-11). The Department of
Community Services is the relevant State Central Authority.  Chapter IV of the Convention specifies procedural requirements for intercountry adoptions. Article 14 provides that persons habitually resident in a Contracting State, who wish to adopt a child habitually resident in another Contracting State, shall apply to the Central Authority in the State of their habitual residence.  Articles 15, 16 and 17 provide as follows:  "Article 15   
If the Central Authority of the receiving State is satisfied that the applicants are eligible and suited to adopt, it shall prepare a report including information about their identity, eligibility and suitability to adopt, background, family and medical history, social environment, reasons for adoption, ability to undertake an intercountry adoption, as well as the characteristics of the children for whom they would be qualified to care.    
It shall transmit the report to the Central Authority of the State of origin.  
Article 16    
If the Central Authority of the State of origin is satisfied that the child is adoptable, it shall--  a prepare a report including information about his or her identity, adoptability, background, social environment, family history, medical history including that of the child's family, and any special needs of the child,  b give due consideration to the child's upbringing and to his or her ethnic, religious and cultural background,  c ensure that consents have been obtained in accordance with Article 4, and  d determine, on the basis in particular of the reports relating to the child and the prospective adoptive parents, whether the envisaged placement is in the best interests of the child.    
It shall transmit to the Central Authority of the receiving State its report on the child, proof that the necessary consents have been obtained and the reasons for its determination on the placement, taking care not to reveal the identity of the mother and the father if, in the State of origin, these identities may not be disclosed.  
Article 17  
Any decision in the State of origin that a child should be entrusted to prospective adoptive parents may only be made if--  a the Central Authority of that State has ensured that the prospective adoptive parents agree,  b the Central Authority of the receiving State has approved such decision, where such approval is required by the law of that State or by the Central
Authority of the State of origin,  c the Central Authorities of both States have agreed that the adoption may proceed, and  d it has been determined, in accordance with Article 5, that the prospective adoptive parents are eligible and suited to adopt and that the child is or will be authorised to enter and reside permanently in the receiving State."  The transfer of the child to the receiving State may only be carried out only if the requirements of Article 17 have been satisfied (Article 19(1)).  It should be noted that it is the Central Authority of the State of origin of the child which is responsible for determining whether the envisaged placement of the child with the prospective adoptive parents is in the best interests of the child (Article 16(1)(d)). It is the responsibility of the
Central Authority of the receiving State to be satisfied that the prospective adoptive parents are eligible to adopt the child, and are suitable adoptive parents. The Central Authority of the State of origin is required to consider its report as to the eligibility and suitability of the prospective adoptive parents.  A child may only be adopted if the "competent authorities" of the State of origin have determined that an intercountry adoption is in the child's best interests having given due consideration to the possibilities for placement of the child within the State of origin (Article 4(b)). It is also the responsibility of the competent authorities of the State of origin to ensure that the "persons, institutions and authorities whose consent is necessary for adoption, have been counselled as may be necessary and duly informed of the effects of their consent ..." and have given their consent "in the required legal form" (Article 4(c)(1) and (2)). It is thus a matter for the law of the State of origin to determine whose consent to the intercountry adoption of the child is required, and the form in which such consent must be expressed.  
The Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 (Cth)  The Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations were gazetted on 6 August 1998. The Regulations were made under [s
C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s111c.html) of the [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) (Cth).
[Section
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s111c.html) provides:  "(1) The regulations may make such provision as is necessary or convenient to enable the performance of the obligations of Australia, or to obtain for
Australia any advantage or benefit, under the Convention on Protection of
Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption signed at The
Hague on 29 May 1993.  ...  
Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (3) may, in particular:  ...  provide that the regulations do not affect the operation of laws of a
State or Territory that relate to adoptions; and  
Regulations made for the purposes of this section may:  ...  invest a court of a State with federal jurisdiction.  
Such jurisdiction is in addition to any other jurisdiction provided for under this Act."  Regulation 25 invests the Supreme Court with federal jurisdiction in matters arising in New South Wales to which a provision of Pt 4 of the
Regulation applies. Regulation 15 is included in Pt 4. Regulation 15 provides:  "15 Adoption in Australia of a child from a Convention country  
This regulation applies in relation to an adoption that is to be granted in Australia, of a child who is habitually resident in a Convention country, by a person who is, or persons who are, habitually resident in Australia, if arrangements for the adoption are made in accordance with:  the Convention; and  the laws of the Commonwealth and the State of habitual residence of the person or persons proposing to adopt the child; and  the laws of the Convention country.  
The person or persons proposing to adopt the child must apply to a court for an order that the child be adopted by the person or persons.  
The application must:  be in accordance with Form 3; and  include an affidavit in accordance with Form 2.  
At the same time as the application is made, the applicant, or applicants, must give a copy of the application to the State Central Authority for the State:  if the application is made by 1 applicant -- where the applicant habitually resides; or  if the application is made by more than 1 applicant -- where the applicants habitually reside.  
The State Central Authority:  no later than 5 working days before the court hearing, may file with the court a statement in accordance with Form 5 that sets out briefly the matters on which the Authority wishes to rely in support of the court making an order other than the order sought in the application; and  must include with that statement an affidavit in accordance with Form 2.  
As soon as practicable before the court hearing, the applicant, or applicants, may file with the court a reply to a statement filed under subregulation (2C), being a reply that:  is in accordance with Form 6; and  includes an affidavit in accordance with Form 2.  
An order made by the court must be in accordance with Form 8.  
The court may make the order only if it is satisfied that:  the Central Authority of the Convention country has agreed to the adoption of the child; and  the State Central Authority of the State in which the applicant or applicants habitually reside has agreed to the adoption of the child; and  the child is allowed to reside permanently in Australia.  
However, the court must not make the order if the child is not in
Australia.  
For paragraph (3) (c), a child is not allowed to reside permanently in
Australia if the child is affected by a law of the Commonwealth, or of a
State, or by an order of a Commonwealth or State court, the effect of which is to prevent the child from so residing.  
Note 1 This regulation does not necessarily apply to all States -- see regulation 34. 
Note 2 If a child to whom an application relates enters Australia before the application is determined, the child may be subject, while the application is being considered, to the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946.
Legislation of the State in which an application is made may also have consequences for the child concerned."  This Regulation does not apply if the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) has the same effect as, or comparable effect to, [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html)
This is the effect of [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s34.html) It provides:  "34 Application  
A provision of these Regulations, except [Regulations ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s5.html), [6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s6.html), [7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s7.html), [8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s8.html), [9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s9.html), [12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s12.html) and [13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s13.html), does not apply to a State in which there is in force a law (an intercountry adoption law) having the same effect as, or comparable effect to, that which the provision would, except for this regulation, have for the State.  
Nothing in these Regulations affects:  the jurisdiction of a court of the Commonwealth or a State, or the power of an authority, under an intercountry adoption law to entertain proceedings, make an order or take any other action in relation to an intercountry adoption; or  any such order or action; or  the operation, within a State, of an intercountry adoption law of the
State."  There is nothing in Form 3 which an applicant is required to complete which enlarges on the matters which an applicant must show before the Court may make an order under [Regulation (3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html)
An application under [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) must have attached to it, the report prepared on the applicants by the Central
Authority of the receiving State under Article 15 of the Convention, and the report prepared on the child by the Central Authority of the State of origin under Article 16 of the Convention.  The order to be made in accordance with Form 8 pursuant to [Regulation (2E)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) is an order in accordance with the Regulations that the applicants adopt in
Australia the named child from the State of origin, and that the Court approve of the forenames and surnames of the child.  The affidavit supporting the application is to be in accordance with Form
That form provides for the applicants to declare on oath that the facts stated in the document and in any attachment to the document that are within the applicants' knowledge are correct, and all other facts stated in the document or in any attachment are correct to the best of their knowledge or belief.  Accordingly, and subject only to the meaning to be attributed to the expression in [Regulation (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) "if arrangements for the adoption are made in accordance with ... the laws of the State of habitual residence of the person or persons proposing to adopt the child", the task of the Court in determining an application under [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) is not to make its own determination of whether the adoption is in the best interests of the child, but whether the requirements of the Convention (including the laws of the State of origin) have been complied with. The Court must also be satisfied that the Central Authority of the State of origin has agreed to the adoption of the child, that the State Central Authority of the
State in which the applicants reside has agreed to the adoption of the child, and that the child is allowed to reside permanently in Australia. It is not surprising that, under the Regulations, the Court is not given the task of determining whether the making of an adoption order is in the best interests of the child. That assessment should already have been made by the competent authority and the Central Authority of the State of origin of the child.
Rather, the Court's task is to ensure that the Convention, and the applicable laws of all of the States concerned, have been complied with.  
The Effect of Chapters 4 and 5 of the [Adoption Act 2000](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)   Regulation 15 does not apply if the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) is a law having the same effect as, or comparable effect to, [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html)  Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) describes the adoption process which may lead to the making of an adoption order.
[Subsection (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s23.html) provides:  "23 Jurisdiction  ...  
Subject to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2) of Chapter 5, the Court has jurisdiction, under and in accordance with this
Part, to make an adoption order with respect to the intercountry adoption of a child referred to in [Part .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2)  
Note. Child is defined in the Dictionary."  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2) of Chapter 5 is headed "Intercountry and Overseas Adoptions". [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s103.html) (in Division 1 of [Part )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2) provides:  "103 Object of Part  
The object of Divisions 1-3 is to provide for the application of provisions of State law that have effect, or comparable effect, to certain provisions of
Commonwealth law.  
Note. For the effect of doing this, see [regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s34.html) of the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 and regulation 8 of the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements--Intercountry
Adoption) Regulations 1998, of the Commonwealth."  Section 107 provides:  "107 Adoption in NSW of child from Convention country by parents from
NSW  
The Court may, on application by the Director-General or the principal officer of an accredited adoption service provider that may provide intercountry adoption services, make an order for the adoption of a child who is habitually resident in a Convention country by a prospective adoptive parent or parents who are habitually resident in the State.  
Note. Part 3 of Chapter 4 provides for assessment of the suitability, and selection, of persons to adopt by the Director-General or principal officer.  
The Court may make the order only if satisfied that:  the Central Authority of the Convention country has agreed to the adoption of the child, and  the child is allowed to reside permanently in Australia.  
The Court must not make the order if the child is not in Australia.  
For the purposes of subsection (2) (b), a child is not allowed to reside permanently in Australia if the child is affected by a law of the Commonwealth or the State, or by an order of a Commonwealth or State court, the effect of which is to prevent the child so residing.  
Note. If a child enters Australia before the order is made, the child may be subject to the [Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ioca1946337/) of the
Commonwealth. See section 77 of this Act."  Only the Director-General may apply to the Court for an order under <case>.
It may be noted that whilst <case> incorporates in substance the requirements of Regulation 15(3), it does not set out any other matters of which the Court need be satisfied before an adoption order is made under that section. In particular, there is no requirement under <case> that, before an order can be made under that section, the arrangements for the adoption of the child be shown to have been made in accordance with the Convention or the laws of the
State of origin.  Section 107 is silent as to whether it provides an avenue for the making of an adoption order separate from the requirements of Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), or whether Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) contains the substantive requirements for the making of an order under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s107.html)
If [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s107.html) is a "stand alone" provision, then it is not a provision to the same or comparable effect as [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) of the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations. The reason for that is that the substantive requirements in Regulation 15(1) are not picked up by <case>.  The Director-General submitted that:  "The note to <case> points to Chapter 4 of the NSW Act as containing the criteria to be applied in assessing the suitability of persons for adoption of children from Convention countries ... The structure adopted by the NSW Act is for the substantive criteria applicable to all applications (including
Convention applications and recognitions) to be contained within Part 4 (scil.
Ch 4) (esp <case>). For that reason, Part 4 (scil. Ch 4) should be construed as serving a dual purpose:  a. containing the substantive provisions governing non-Convention applications; and  b. containing the substantive provisions governing Convention applications such as the one before the Court."  I agree that, construing the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) as a whole, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s107.html) should not be seen as a "stand alone" provision setting out the whole of the requirements for the making of an adoption order in respect of a child from a
Convention country.  The question then is whether the effect of Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) (read with [s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s107.html) is the same as, or comparable to, the effect of [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html)  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2) of Chapter 4 deals with the matters to which a "decision maker" must have regard in placing a child (other than an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child) for adoption. The decision maker must take into account the child's culture, any disability, language, and religion, and the principle that the child's given name, identity, language and cultural and religious ties should as far as possible be preserved [(s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s32.html) A "decision maker" is defined as follows:  "decision maker in relation to a decision about the adoption of a child means the Court, the Director-General, an accredited adoption service provider, or a principal officer of an accredited adoption service provider."  Clearly, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s32.html) does not apply to a decision by a Central Authority of the State of origin of a child from a Convention country. Such an authority is not a "decision maker" within the meaning of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s32.html)
However, the substance of the matters to which a decision maker under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s32.html) is to have regard are also to be given due consideration by the Central Authority of the State of origin pursuant to Article 16 of the Convention.  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p3) of Chapter 4 deals with the selection of prospective adoptive parents. It applies whether the person or couple wishing to adopt a child proposes to adopt a child from within New South Wales, or from a Convention country, or from any overseas country. It enables the Department of Community Services, as the Central Authority of the State of New South Wales to prepare a report pursuant to Article 15 of the Convention.  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p4) of Chapter 4 deals with adoption plans. In my view, that Part is not relevant to the present proceedings.  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p5) of Chapter 4 deals with consents to adoptions. It contains significant differences from the Convention procedures. Division 1 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p5) of Chapter 4 specifies who must consent to an adoption. Unless consent is dispensed with pursuant to Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p5) of Chapter 4, the consent of each parent and of any guardian of the child is required in the case of a child who is younger than 18 and has not previously been adopted. [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s52.html)-[65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s65.html) make detailed provision, not only as to whose consent is required for the adoption of a child, but the procedures to be followed before the consent is effective. To be effective, the consent must not only be an informed consent, but must also be in a form prescribed by the Regulations (ss 58(1)(b) and (1)). The person giving consent must have been counselled by a counsellor having qualifications and functions prescribed by the Regulations (ss 57 (definition of counsellor), 61(3) and 63).  The Court can dispense with a person's consent, if satisfied that to do so is in the best interests of the child, only in a limited number of circumstances. They are prescribed by [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html)-(d).
The circumstances in which consent may be dispensed with are that a person whose consent is required cannot, after reasonable inquiry, be found or identified [(s (1)(a))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html); that such a person is in such a physical or mental condition as not to be capable of giving proper consideration to the question [(s (1)(b))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html); or, if the person is the parent or the guardian of the child, that there is serious concern for the welfare of the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to override the wishes of the parent or guardian [(s (1)(c))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html); or in certain cases where authorised carers of the child apply for adoption [(s.
(1)(d)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html)  These provisions are substantively different from the Convention procedures. Under the Convention, the competent authority of the State of origin must ensure that the persons, institutions and authorities whose consent is necessary for adoption have been counselled as may be necessary and duly informed of the effects of their consents. It is a matter for the law of the State of origin to determine whose consent is necessary to the adoption.
There is no equivalent provision that the consent of the child's parents can only be dispensed with in circumstances corresponding to [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html)-(d).  In the present case, a Filippino court found that the children had been deliberately abandoned and neglected by their parents. An order was made committing the children to the care and custody of the Filippino Department of
Social Welfare and Development as the legal guardian of the children, entitled to their legal custody and control, responsible for their support as provided by law, and, when proper, with authority to give consent to their placement, guardianship and/or adoption. The Court ordered that the rights of the biological parents were terminated.  Accordingly, I infer that the consents of the biological parents to the adoption of the children were not obtained, but that that was in accordance with Filippino law, having regard to the orders to which I have referred.
However, if Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) applied, it would not be possible to make an adoption order in respect of the children, unless a consent dispense order were made.  In the present case, such a consent dispense order could be made on the ground that the parents could not, after reasonable inquiry, be found or identified. The reasons for judgment of the Filippino Court to which I have referred recorded that the relevant social worker had been only able to find the paternal grandmother of the children, and that neither the mother nor father could be located. However, the position in other cases might be different. It could not be in accordance with Convention procedures for an adoption order to have to be refused in New South Wales because the criteria for making a consent dispense order were not satisfied, and an effective consent complying with the requirements of Division 2 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p5) of Chapter 4 had not been given, notwithstanding that the necessary consents under the law of the State of origin had been obtained from the persons, institutions or authorities whose consent was necessary, in the required legal form of the State of origin. That would be the consequence of a finding that
Chapter 4 was a law to the same effect, or comparable effect, of [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html)  I do not think there is anything in [Parts ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p6), [7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p7) and [8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p8) of Chapter 4 relevant to the present proceedings.  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p9) of Chapter 4 deals with the matters to be satisfied before an adoption order can be made. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html), which is in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p9) of Chapter 4, requires the Court to be satisfied as to certain matters. It provides:  "90 Court to be satisfied as to certain matters  (cf AC Act <case>)  
The Court must not make an adoption order in relation to a child unless the Court is satisfied:  that the best interests of the child will be promoted by the adoption, and  that, as far as practicable and having regard to the age and understanding of the child, the wishes and feelings of the child have been ascertained and due consideration given to them, and  
Note. Sections 127-129 contain provisions about ascertainment of the wishes of a child by the Court.  if the prospective adoptive parent or parents are persons other than a step parent or relative of the child--that the prospective adoptive parent or parents have been selected in accordance with this Act, and  
Note. See Part 3 of this Chapter.  that consent to the adoption of the child has been given by every person whose consent is required under this Act or that consent has been, or should be, dispensed with, and  if the child is an Aboriginal child--that the Aboriginal child placement principles have been properly applied, and  if the child is a Torres Strait Islander child--that the Torres Strait
Islander child placement principles have been properly applied, and  if the child is a non-citizen child from a Convention country or other country outside Australia--that the applicable requirements of this Act and any other relevant law have been satisfied, and  
Note. See for example, section 31.  in the case of a child (other than an Aboriginal or Torres Strait
Islander child)--that the culture, any disability, language and religion of the child and, as far as possible, that the child's given names, identity, language and cultural and religious ties have been taken into account in the making of any adoption plan in relation to the adoption.  
The Court may not make an adoption order if the parties to the adoption have agreed to an adoption plan unless it is satisfied that the arrangements proposed in the plan are in the child's best interests and are proper in the circumstances.  
The Court may not make an adoption order unless it considers that the making of the order would be clearly preferable in the best interests of the child than any other action that could be taken by law in relation to the care of the child.  
Note. Other action that could be taken in relation to a child includes a parenting order under the [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) of the
Commonwealth or a care order under the [Children and Young Persons (Care and
Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/).
[Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/index.html#p1) of Chapter 4 describes the persons who may be adopted and the persons who may adopt."  The first requirement is for the Court to be satisfied that the order would be in the best interests of the child [(s (1)(a)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html)
As I have said, there is nothing in [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s15.html) which requires that the Court be satisfied that the best interests of the child will be promoted by the adoption, unless that is the effect of [Regulation (1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s15.html)
The same is true of the matters in [s (1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html) [Section (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html) requires the Court to be satisfied that the prospective adoptive parents have been selected in accordance with the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/). In my view, the selection of the adoptive parents is part of the arrangements for the adoption to be made by the Central Authority of the receiving State under
Article 15 of the Convention. Accordingly, it is a substantive requirement to be satisfied under both [Regulation (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) and [s (1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html)  I have already commented upon [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html) which deals with consents to adoption. There is no equivalent provision in the
Regulations or the Convention authorising the Court to dispense with the requirement of the consent of every person whose consent under the Convention is required. There is no provision in the Regulations requiring the consent of the child's parents to the application, or providing for the dispensation of such a requirement.  [Section (1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html) and (f) are not relevant to the present issue. It is clear from [s (1)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html) that the New South Wales Parliament intended that applications for adoption of a child from a Convention country could be made under Chapter 4. The expression "other relevant law" in [s (1)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html) is not defined. The note refers to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s31.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s31.html) provides:  "31 Adoption of non-citizen child  
The Court must not make an adoption order in relation to a non-citizen child as referred to in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2) of Chapter 5 unless:  arrangements for adoption of the child have been made by the Director-
General or an accredited adoption service provider that may provide intercountry adoption services or the Director-General applies for the order on the basis that the proposed adoptive parent has intercountry parental responsibility for the child, and  the provisions of this Act and the regulations relating to intercountry adoptions have been complied with.  
For the purposes of this section, a person has intercountry parental responsibility for a child if the child is from a country other than a
Convention country or a prescribed overseas jurisdiction and the person, after being resident in that country for 12 months or more or being domiciled in that country, was given parental responsibility for the child under the law of that country."  Neither <case>(g), nor <case>, requires the Court to be satisfied that the arrangements for adoption were made in accordance with the Convention. Section (1)(b) refers to the Regulations relating to intercountry adoptions. The [Adoption Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ar2003198/) contains no provisions requiring that the arrangements for adoption be made in accordance with the Convention. It may be arguable that the expression "relevant law" extends to the law of the country from which the child comes, so that the Court must be satisfied that the laws of the State of origin in relation to the adoption were satisfied. However, the expression does not cover the requirements of the Convention itself. The Convention is not a law.
Neither the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), nor the
Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions) Regulations provides that the Convention is to apply as a law of New South Wales or Australia.
Accordingly, there is no requirement in <case> that, before making an adoption order, the Court be satisfied that the arrangements for the adoption were made in accordance with the Convention.  I do not consider that <case>(h) is relevant to the present proceedings as there is no requirement under the Convention for the making of an adoption plan, and an adoption plan is only mandatory under the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) in certain cases (see [ss (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s35.html), [39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s39.html)(4), and [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s47.html)(1)).  [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s90.html) provides:  "(3) The Court may not make an adoption order unless it considers that the making of the order would be clearly preferable in the best interests of the child than any other action that could be taken by law in relation to the care of the child."  Again, there is no requirement under [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) (unless it is conveyed by [Regulation (1)(b))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) that the Court be satisfied that the making of an adoption order is clearly preferable in the best interests of the child than any other action that could be taken by law in relation to the care of the child. That is a matter which it can be expected the Central Authority of the State of origin of the child would consider, pursuant to Article 16 of the Convention, in determining whether the envisaged placement was in the best interests of the child.  For these reasons, I consider that the effect of Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), so far as it applies to the adoption of a child from a Convention country, is substantially different from the effect of the Regulations.  Part of the above reasoning has assumed that [Regulation (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s15.html) does not require that Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) be complied with if an application is made by residents of New South Wales to adopt a child from a Convention country. The relevant words are that:  "This regulation applies ... if arrangements for the adoption are made in accordance with ... the laws of the State of habitual residence of the person or persons proposing to adopt the child ..."  The question is, what is meant by the expression "arrangements for the adoption"? It might be said that all of the adoption process described in
Chapter 4 describes the arrangements to be made for the adoption of a child under New South Wales law. In my view, that would not be the correct construction. The expression "arrangements for the adoption" is to be understood in the light of the Convention. The purpose of the Regulations was to enable the Convention to be implemented in Australia. The Convention provides the context for the construction of the Regulations.  The meaning of the expression "arrangements for the adoption" is not to be gleaned from the different State and Territory legislation relating to adoption. Such a process would not reveal any consistent use of that expression between the States and Territories. Some States, such as Victoria and Tasmania, deal with certain matters under the heading "Arrangement of
Adoptions" [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/aa1984107/) (Vic), [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/aa1984107/s20.html)-[32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/aa1984107/s32.html); [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) (Tas), [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s9.html)-[17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s17.html).
Those States deal with matters such as consents to adoption, and the making of adoption orders, under different headings. Some States, such as New South
Wales, do not use the expression to describe particular parts of their legislation.  In my view, the proper construction of [Regulation (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) is that it requires the Court to consider what are the requirements of the
State of habitual residence of the prospective adopting parents, so far as they are applicable under the Convention to the arrangements to be made for the adoption of the child. In particular, the determination of the receiving
State under Article 5 of the Convention that the prospective adoptive parents are eligible and suited to adopt, that they have been given counselling as may be necessary, and that the child is, or will be authorised, to enter and reside permanently in the State, must be effected in accordance with the laws of the receiving State. Likewise, any law regulating the preparation of the report by the Central Authority of the receiving State under Article 15 of the
Convention must be complied with if [Regulation (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) is to be satisfied.  However, the expression does not mean that all of the requirements of New
South Wales law for the making of an adoption order under Chapter 4 must be satisfied.  Even if this is not the correct construction of [Regulation (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html), it would not follow that Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) had a comparable effect to that of [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) Even if [Regulation (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) required satisfaction of all of the requirements of Chapter 4, nonetheless, there is nothing in the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) which requires an applicant for an adoption order for a child from a Convention country to show that the arrangements for the adoption were made in accordance with the Convention. It would follow that, on any view, the effect of the [Adoption Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) is not the same or comparable to the effect of [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html)  It is clear from <case> of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/), from the explanatory note to Chapter 5 of the Bill which became the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/), and from the Minister's Second Reading Speech, that Parliament intended that the provisions of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) should have the same effect, or comparable effect, to [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) I have set out the terms of <case> earlier in these reasons. The explanatory note to Chapter 5 of the Bill which became the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) stated:  "The Commonwealth Regulations preserved the application of provisions of
State law that have effect, or comparable effect, to the Commonwealth. Part 2 (other than Division 4) enacts such State provisions. Provision ... is made for ... adoptive parents in New South Wales to adopt a child from overseas (clause 107)."  In her second reading speech, the Minister stated:  "This bill replicates provisions of the Commonwealth's Family Law (Hague
Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 relating to administration of intercountry adoption services and will bring all adoption arrangements in New South Wales under State legislation." (Hansard, LC, 5
September 2000, p 8641.)  However, I have concluded that that objective was not achieved. It could have been achieved if <case> had incorporated both the substantive and the procedural requirements of Regulation 15 as a separate avenue for obtaining adoption orders for children from Convention countries. However, as I have explained above, while <case> substantially reflected the procedural requirements of Regulation 15(3), it did not incorporate the substantive requirements in Regulation 15(1). The substantive requirements in Chapter 4 are quite different from the substantive requirements of Regulation 15(1).  It was submitted for the Director-General that the substantive requirements of the two provisions were comparable. It was submitted that:  "20 The NSW Act, like the Commonwealth Regulation, contains procedural and substantive elements:  ...  
The substantive requirements are:  i. the arrangements accord with usual NSW practices (which in turn accord with the Convention), the adoption laws of NSW (in particular the issues to be addressed in <case>), the laws of the Convention country (via evidence as to the availability of the child for adoption in Australia as well as the approval of the relevant adoption agency in the Convention country, plus the meeting by the applicants of any criteria relating to their suitability to adopt a child from that country);  ii. The Central Authority of the Convention Country agrees to the adoption: s (2)(a);  iii. DoCS agrees with the adoption (DoCS being the State Central Authority for NSW): <case>(a) - for either the Director-General must support the application (in that either the Director-General must make the application under <case>), or he or she must agree to arrangements under <case>(a);  iv. the child is allowed to reside permanently in Australia: <case>(b).  ...  
The effect of the two schemes is the same, or comparable 
At the level of substance, it is submitted that the State regime is of the same, or comparable effect. Indeed, the most essential elements:  agreement of Central Authority of Convention country;  agreement of State Central Authority;  permanent residence of child;  compliance with the State laws which emphasise the welfare of the child,  are identical."  However, for the reasons I have given, I do not consider that the requirements are comparable. Even if the "usual NSW practices" referred to by the Director-General accord with the Convention, this would not mean that the provisions of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) are the same as, or comparable to, the Regulations. In fact, the "usual NSW practices" in many respects differ from the Convention, as is to be expected. The requirements in relation to the obtaining or (in NSW) dispensing with consents to adoption constitute a notable difference. For the reasons I have given, I do not accept that the requirements of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) are identical or similar to the requirements of the Regulations.  
Meaning of "Comparable Effect"  In Regulation 34, the expression "comparable effect" is used in the sense of similar effect. "Comparable" in this context does not mean "able to be compared", in the sense that the similarities and differences between the two sets of provisions can be assessed. Little is to be gained from how the word "comparable" has been construed in other contexts. In Australian Wheat Board v Pantaleo [[1984] 3 NSWLR 530], Kirby P said (at 540):  "That brings me to the meaning of the expression 'some comparable employment'. What does this expression mean in the present context? Dictionary definitions of comparable are not helpful, referring simply to 'able to be compared with'. Nor are definitions of the verbs 'compare' useful for the present context. They refer only to representing as similar or to liken. To give meaning to the expression 'comparable employment' in <case>(a) of the
Act requires regard to be had to its purpose in appearing there."  Nonetheless, Lindgren J made the following helpful observations on the use of the word "comparable" in Industry Research & Development Board v
Bridgestone Australia Ltd <case>; [(2001) 109 FCR 564.] There, the Full Court of the Federal Court had to construe the words "comparable bargaining power" as used in <case> of the [Industry
Research and Development Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/irada1986348/) (Cth).
Lindgren J said (at 581 [71]-[72]):  "[71] In my opinion, there is no necessary distinction between 'able to be compared' and 'similar' as dictionary meanings of 'comparable'. The reason is that the former immediately raises the question of the meaning of the transitive verb 'compare' and its first meaning given in the Oxford English
Dictionary is '1 trans. To speak of or represent as similar; to liken. Const.
to. (With negative, in such phrases as not to be compared to, usually implying great inferiority in some respect.' Similarly, The Macquarie Dictionary gives as its first meaning:'1 to represent as similar or analogous; liken (fol by to).' Accordingly, 'able to be compared' is well able to bear the dictionary meaning 'seen to be similar or alike', or, more directly and simply, 'similar' or 'alike'.  [72] I acknowledge immediately that both dictionaries also give as their second meanings, the neutral noting of similarities and differences between things, but what is presently important is that 'able to be compared' is at least equally capable of invoking the first, as it is the second, dictionary meaning of 'compare'. And in my opinion, it does mean 'seen to be similar or alike' or, more directly and simply, 'similar' or 'alike' in s39C."  The context in which the words "comparable effect" are used in Regulation is the implementation of Australia's obligations as a signatory to the
Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. In that context, the expression "having ... comparable effect", should be construed as meaning having a similar effect. The provisions of the Regulations were seen to be the appropriate mode of complying with Australia's obligations under the
Convention. The effect of State adoption laws could always be compared with the effect of the Regulations, no matter how discordant might be the operation of the two sets of provisions. Unless the provisions of State laws for the adoption of children from Convention countries are of the same or similar effect to the Regulations, there would be a risk that Australia would not meet its obligations under the Convention. Accordingly, the application must be considered under [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/irada1986348/s15.html), unless the provisions of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) have the same effect as, or similar effect to, that regulation.  
Scope of the Regulation Making Power  The Regulations were made pursuant to [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s111c.html) of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), relevant parts of which have been quoted in paragraph [11] above. It was submitted for the Director-General that the regulation-making power under [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s111c.html) was to be construed subject to [s
ZK](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69zk.html) of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/). [Section
ZK(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69zk.html) provides:  "(2) Nothing in this Act, and no decree under this Act, affects:  the jurisdiction of a court, or the power of an authority, under a child welfare law to make an order, or to take any other action, by which a child is placed under the care (however described) of a person under a child welfare law; or  any such order made or action taken; or  the operation of a child welfare law in relation to a child."  A "child welfare law" means a law of a State or Territory prescribed, or included in a class of laws of a State or Territory prescribed, for the purposes of the definition ([Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), [s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s4.html) [Regulation
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/flr1984223/s12b.html) of the [Family Law Regulations ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/flr1984223/) (Cth) provides as follows:  "Child welfare law - prescribed law of a State or Territory  
For the purposes of the definition of child welfare law in [subsection (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/flr1984223/s4.html) of the act, each of the following classes of laws is prescribed, namely, any law of:  the State of New South Wales;  the State of Victoria;  the State of Queensland;  the State of Western Australia;  the State of South Australia;  the State of Tasmania;  the Australian Capital Territory;  the Northern Territory; or  the Territory of Norfolk Island;  that relates to the imprisonment, detention or residence of a child upon being dealt with for a criminal offence.  
For the purposes of the definition of child welfare law in subsection 4 (1) of the Act, each law specified in Column 2 of an item in
Schedule 5, being a law of the State or Territory specified in Column 3 of that item, is prescribed."  Thirty-eight laws are prescribed pursuant to subregulation 12B(2), including the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/).  It was submitted for the Director-General that, by virtue of <case>, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to make an adoption order in respect of a child from a Convention country, and the operation of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) in relation to such a child, was unaffected by anything in the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), including the Regulations purportedly made pursuant to [s
C.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s111c.html)  [Subsection
ZK(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69zk.html) is not relevant to the present question. The adoption order will not be one by which "a child is placed under the care of a person". The children are already under the care of their adoptive parents. The adoption order is of a quite different character.  The question is whether the general words in [s
ZK(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69zk.html) affect the operation of the Regulations, or the consequences of inconsistency between the Regulations and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/).  It should be noted that the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) was not in force when the Regulations were gazetted. There can be no question that the
Regulations were authorised pursuant to <case>. That section made specific provision for the making of regulations to give effect to Australia's obligations under the Convention. While <case>(b) provided that the
Regulations might provide that they did not affect the operation of laws of a
State or Territory that related to adoptions, it is clear that the Regulations could do so.  In my view, there is a direct inconsistency in the case of adoptions of children from Convention countries by parents resident in New South Wales between the Regulations, and <case> and Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/). Pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), the Regulations prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.  That was the position when the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) came into operation. At that time, <case> had nothing to say on the subject. No provisions of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) were prescribed as a "child welfare law" until amendments were made in 2003 to
Schedule 5 of the [Family Law
Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/flr1984223/).
The Family Law Amendment Regulations 2003 (Cth) (No. 1) of 18 December 2003 amended Schedule 5 of the [Family Law
Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/flr1984223/) by substituting for the previous item (which referred to certain provisions of the [Adoption of Children Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aoca1965191/) ), certain sections of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/). These included <case>, but not <case> or the provisions in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/index.html#p5) of Chapter 4 dealing with the obtaining of consents to adoptions and the dispensing with consents to adoptions. On 1 July 2006, the Schedule was further amended by substituting the whole of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) as a "child welfare law" for the purposes of the definition in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s4.html) of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/).  Even if the effect of [s
ZK](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69zk.html) was that nothing done under the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), including the making of regulations under [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s111c.html), could affect the operation of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/), it would not follow that the Regulations would not take effect according to their terms. That is to say, as the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) is not a law having the same or comparable effect to [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html), [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) would operate. However, it is possible that <case> might apply to allow the operation of both the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) and the
Regulations. Whilst that could avoid the consequences of inconsistency if the ground of inconsistency were that the Regulations covered the field, it is difficult to see how such a provision could avoid the consequences of direct inconsistency.  However, it is not necessary to explore this question. Section 69ZK provides that "Nothing in this Act" affects the operation of a child welfare law in relation to a child. The section does not provide that nothing done under the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) affects the operation of such a law, except that it expressly provides that no decree under the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) has such an effect.  There is nothing in the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) itself, as distinct from the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption)
Regulations, which relevantly has such an effect. It would be a quirk of legislative drafting if the inclusion of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) as a child welfare law under a schedule to the [Family Law
Regulations](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/flr1984223/) impinged upon Australia's implementation of the Convention. In my view, it does not.  For these reasons, I conclude that the applications brought by the prospective adoptive parents under Chapter 4 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/), and by the
Director-General under <case> of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/), should be refused.  [Regulation 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) is Satisfied  However, the application under [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) of the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations should be granted. The evidence establishes to my satisfaction that, for the purposes of that Regulation, the children to be adopted are to be taken to be habitually resident in a Convention country. The expression "a child who is habitually resident in a Convention country" must refer to a child who was habitually resident in a Convention country when the Convention was invoked leading to permission being given for the child to leave his or her State of origin and to enter and reside permanently in the receiving State (Articles , 18 and 19).  The prospective adoptive parents are persons who are habitually resident in
Australia. I am satisfied that the arrangements for the adoption were made in accordance with the Convention. In particular, the Department of Community
Services prepared and supplied to the Inter-Country Adoption Board of the
Philippines the report required by Article 15. The Inter-Country Adoption
Board of the Philippines was the Central Authority for that State. Reports were also duly prepared in conformity with Article 16 by the Central Authority for the Philippines. It duly gave its approval to the "pre-adoptive placement" of the children.  I am also satisfied that the arrangements for the adoption were made in accordance with the laws of New South Wales so far as they relate to the adoption of children from a Convention country. The adoptive parents were selected in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) and the
Adoption Regulations.  I am also satisfied that the arrangements for adoption were made in accordance with the laws of the Philippines. In particular, there was before me a judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City committing the children to the care and custody of the Filippino Department of Social Welfare and Development and conferring on it the powers and responsibilities, as legal guardian of the children, the authority to give consent to their placement for adoption.  The Inter-Country Adoption Board for the Philippines gave authority in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of the Convention, and pursuant to <case> of the Philippines Inter-Country [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/) of 1995, for the Department of Community Services to entrust the children with the adoptive parents.  The evidence also establishes that the requirements of [Regulation (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) are satisfied.  The applicants also seek orders for approval of the proposed names for the children. As I have said, the order to be made pursuant to [Regulation (2E)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) includes a provision for the Court to approve of the child's names. The
Regulations contain no provision equivalent to <case> of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/). It does not appear that there is any constraint upon the Court's granting approval to the use or change of a child's name, except, presumably, the best interests of the child.  In any event, there is no issue on the present application in relation to the approval of the children's names.  For these reasons, I will make the orders sought in the application under [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/aa1988107/s15.html) of the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations.
