JUDGMENT 
GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to the authority vested by [s 100(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s100.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/) which provides: "100(5) The DPP may appeal against a forfeiture order, a pecuniary penalty order or an order under [subsection (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s28.html) or against the refusal of a court to make such an order in the same manner as if the order were, or were part of, a sentence imposed in respect of the offence in reliance on which the order was made." 
The law and practice common to Crown appeals against sentence is therefore applicable.

On Saturday 14 October 1995 the respondent, a 71 year old man and a Japanese national passed through the outbound Australian Customs and Immigration barrier with travel documents for a flight to Hong Kong. A routine check of his booked as distinguished from his cabin baggage attracted the attention of a customs officer as it passed through an x-ray scanner. The respondent was interviewed by customs officers. It is apparent that he spoke little English and they spoke no Japanese. He denied that he was carrying any money and later search established that there was $306,000 in Australian currency packed within the baggage. An explanation which he later offered was that he thought the customs officers had been asking him whether he was carrying drugs. It has to be said that such a mistake might be understandable as the prefacing questions were along the lines of enquiring as to whether the baggage belonged to the respondent and whether he had packed the baggage himself. As I shall later observe Mr Narita is a very experienced traveller.

He was charged with an offence contrary to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ftra1988308/s15.html) of the [Financial Transaction Reports Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ftra1988308/) which forbids the transfer of Australian or foreign currency out of Australia in excess of $5,000 in value unless a report in respect of the transfer had been given in accordance with the requirements of the Act. There are certain exemptions which are not presently relevant. Upon arraignment in the District
Court the respondent pleaded guilty. The maximum prescribed penalty is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both. It was explicitly stated to Mahoney DCJ the presiding Judge by the Crown
Prosecutor that custodial sentence was not suggested to be appropriate nor was it sought. A fine of $4,500 was imposed.

More significantly the Director of Public Prosecutions had given notice under [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/) that he sought forfeiture to the Commonwealth of the entire sum of $306,000. The learned District Court judge was vested with power to order such forfeiture and a discretion to order forfeiture of part of that amount if he found that appropriate to the circumstances. He did the latter. He ordered forfeiture to the Commonwealth of $15,000. This appeal is brought seeking that his Honour's discretion be disturbed to the extent of substituting an order for forfeiture of the whole amount or, alternatively, a greater portion than $15,000.

In order to be entitled to forfeiture it was incumbent upon the prosecution to show that the money was tainted property. It was shown to be tainted to the extent that it was the sum involved in the breach of the Financial Transaction
Records Act. It was not shown to be otherwise tainted as being the proceeds of crime or the sinews of any unlawful activity.

The respondent made a very poor impression on the sentencing judge in terms of credibility but he found as a fact that the respondent owned the money and that it was not tainted in its source or its destination. I am unpersuaded that his Honour's findings have been shown to be wrong and I would regard them as invulnerable in this Court. The argument advanced by the appellant centres upon an attack upon the credibility of the respondent's answers and explanations at various times of interview but as I have indicated those deficiencies were well within the purview of the sentencing judge.

One matter that should be adverted to appears in his Honour's remarks on sentence. He noted that the Crown submission to him was finally that the money was tainted and one might reach the conclusion that the respondent was a courier taking this money out of Australia. His Honour noted that if such a proposition were intended to be put it would have been appropriate to explore it with the respondent who gave evidence but it was not. I would wish to add some observations to his Honour's reasons for rejecting this Crown proposition.

The respondent has a daughter and grandchildren living in Sydney. He worked throughout his life, moving from being a teacher to what I understand to be effectively a director of a provincial education department to assuming an office as the Secretary of a teachers union. He retired at the age of 60 although he pursued some casual employment thereafter. A statement was before his Honour as to his means. At the exchange rate of 87 Yen to the Australian dollar (which was the situation advanced and current at the time of his
Honour's sentence) the respondent was, in Australian dollar terms, very comfortable indeed. There was also unchallenged evidence that he owned property in Japan and there was a significant amount of what might be adequately described as family money.

The respondent said at interview that he originally came to Australia for brief visits to his daughter and grandchildren until he ultimately retired.
Since then he has made a practice of coming and staying for almost the full extent of his six months visitor's visa. He has scrupulously kept to the terms of his visa in respect of his period of staying. The Crown produced an extract from the records of the Department of Immigration showing 18 egressions from
Australia between 1988 and 1996. The pattern is exactly as the respondent contended. The earliest trips were short but thereafter he has remained in
Australia for a number of months on each visit.

When questioned by police through an interpreter he indicated that he understood that there were restrictions upon taking money out of Australia but he believed that this applied to large amounts of money and he did not regard the amount he was carrying as large in that context. He commented that in
Japan it would not buy membership of a golf club. Whilst in Australia he indicated that it was his habit to play golf almost every day. The absence of
English was not a barrier, he said, to playing golf with Australians as eye contact and body language sufficed.

The comment I would add is that the respondent would seem to be a most unlikely professional courier of tainted money on behalf of criminals if he in fact stays in Australia for the length of time that has been indicated. I do not overlook the circumstance that one could suspect that he would therefore be an ideal person to be recruited for illicit purposes but I emphasize that there is not the slightest evidence that the money was other than owned by the respondent or that he was acting on anybody else's behalf.

The Court has been referred to a number of authorities concerning former foreign exchange statute and regulations which preceded the [Financial
Transaction Reports
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ftra1988308/). It is notorious that in the mid 8th decade of this century there was an enormous change in relation to the government control on Australian currency. It is unnecessary for this Court to explore such matters.

This appeal essentially seeks intervention to overturn a discretionary judgment by a judge at first instance. No finding made by his Honour has shown to be erroneous. It is true that his Honour was suspicious of the respondent and regarded him as uncreditworthy to a significant extent, but this did not oblige him to make an order such as now sought and I am unpersuaded that his discretion miscarried.

I propose the Crown appeal be dismissed.

MEAGHER JA: I agree.

HULME J: Subject to one reservation I also agree. The reservation concerns the possibility of his Honour's findings as to the legitimate derivation or purpose of money. In light of the evidence which was before him I am by no means persuaded that those findings could not have been challenged. That is a matter upon which I really express no opinion. The fact remains that there was no attempt to challenge those findings and in those circumstances it does not seem to me that there is any ground shown why the Court was entitled to interfere with the exercise of his Honour's discretion. The argument for the Crown seems to me, effectively, although counsel for the Crown denied this, that because the money was involved in its exportation therefore there was some, in effect, onus on his Honour to forfeit; alternatively, because the respondent to this appeal gave some false explanations to the customs authorities therefore it should have been forfeited. [S.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ftra1988308/s19.html) does not impose effectively a prima facie onus of forfeiture merely because the money is tainted by use or by being the subject of an offence such as this. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.

MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court therefore is that the appeal is dismissed.
