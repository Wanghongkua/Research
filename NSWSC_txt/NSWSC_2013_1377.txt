JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff applies for restraining orders under [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth) and orders pursuant to [ss 38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s38.html) and [39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s39.html) of the Act as well as a forfeiture order under [s 49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) and an ancillary order that the forfeited property may be dealt with under [s 69(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s69.html) The orders are put forward by consent.
I note the terms of [s 31(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s31.html) which enables the Court to make an order in respect of an application under [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) if everyone has consented whom the Court has reason to believe would be affected by the order. Sub-s 2 provides that I do not have to be satisfied or consider the matters that the Court would otherwise need to consider under [s 19.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html)
An affidavit of Morgan Verge Blunden sworn 11 September 2013 is relied upon. I have read that affidavit to satisfy myself that all parties who might be affected by the order have consented. In doing so, I have at the same time satisfied myself of the prerequisites to the making of an order without consent as [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) requires. 
I note that one of the two persons, Chong Qing Hu, is present in court with an interpreter and has indicated that he agrees to the orders. The other person who might be affected by the orders, Chang Yei Xiong, I am informed by the solicitor for the applicant has also consented to these orders and his solicitor's signature appears on the consent orders.
Accordingly, I make orders in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the short minutes of order and I note that there is no order for costs.
The orders can be entered forthwith.
