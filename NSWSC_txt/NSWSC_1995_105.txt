All three questions answered in the negative; and
Matter remitted to the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court to be dealt with according to law.
JUDGE1
GLEESON CJ These proceedings, which commenced as a bail application before
Dunford J, have been removed into this court for the purpose of enabling this court to deal with a challenge to the validity of s8A of the Bail Act -1994. It is agreed that, following this court's resolution of the questions which have been formulated to raise the points which the applicant seeks to argue, the matter will be remitted for the issue of bail to be resolved.
The applicants challenge to the validity of. s8A of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/) is made in the following circumstances.
In September 1994 the applicant was arrested in connection with an importation of heroin.
The details of the events giving rise to his arrest are not material. It suffices to say that two crates arrived in Australia on board a Vietnam Airlines flight. The consignee was the applicant. A routine examination of the crates by officers of the Australian
Customs Service revealed that articles in the crates contained approximately three kilograms of heroin. Surveillance was established, and the applicant took delivery of the crates. He was subsequently arrested and charged with offences pursuant to s233B(1)(c) and s233B(1)(d) of the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (Cth). Those offences involved being in possession of not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited import, and being knowingly concerned in the importation into
Australia of a prohibited import.
The applicant was refused bail and has been in custody since last
September. He has been committed for trial.
In June 1995 the applicant sought bail in the Supreme Court. His application came before Dunford J. The applicant's counsel informed his Honour that he desired to mount a constitutional challenge to the validity of s8A of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/) which, on its face, applies to cases such as the present.
Three questions were formulated to express the points of law which the applicant desires to argue, and the matter was removed into this court.
Notices were given to the Attorneys General in accordance with s78D of the
Judiciary Act. The Attorneys General for the Commonwealth and for the State of
New South Wales have been represented before this court.
Two of the questions are somewhat tendentious in their form, but there is no point in seeking to re-phrase them. [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) [8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8.html). [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/index.html#p2) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) contains a series of provisions described as general provisions respecting bail. That is the legislative context in which [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) appears. Examples of other provisions in the same Part are as follows.
[Section 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8.html) establishes a right to release on bail for certain minor offences.
[Section 9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s9.html) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, such as the case of persons charged with murder, and other specified offences, there is a presumption in favour of bail. This presumption is effected by a provision that a person accused of an offence to which [s9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s9.html) applies is entitled to be granted bail unless the court is satisfied that it is justified in refusing bail.
[Section 8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html), conversely, provides that there is a presumption against bail for certain drug offences. The section is in the following terms: "8A. (1) This section applies: to the following offences under the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking
Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/): an offence under [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s23.html) (2), [24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s24.html) or 25 (2) of that Act, an offence under [section 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s26.html) of that Act of conspiring to commit an offence referred to in subparagraph (i); an offence under [section 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s27.html) of that Act of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, soliciting or inciting the commission of an offence referred to in subparagraph (i); an offence under [section 28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s28.html) of that Act of conspiring to commit, or of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of, an offence under the provisions of a law in force outside New South Wales which corresponds to [section 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s23.html) (2), [24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s24.html) (2) or [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) (2) of that Act; and to an offence under [section 231](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s231.html) (1), [233A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233a.html) or 233B of the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) of the Commonwealth (but only if the goods concerned are alleged to be of a nature and quantity required for an offence referred to in paragraph (d)).

A person accused of an offence to which this section applies is not to be granted bail unless the person satisfies the authorised officer or court that bail should not be refused.

The requirement for bail cannot be dispensed with for a person accused of an offence to which this section applies and section 10 (2) does not apply with respect to any such offence".
The effect of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s8a.html) was considered by Hunt CJ at CL in R versus Kissner (unreported, 17 January 1992). His Honour's judgment was approved by the Court of
Criminal Appeal in R versus Masters [(1992) 26 NSWLR 450] at 473.
In Kissner the applicant, who was charged with drug offences, had made a series of applications for bail, one before
Wood J, and another before Hunt CJ at CL. His Honour said: "The presumption against bail expressed in [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s8a.html) imposes a difficult task upon an applicant to which the section applies. Its effect is not merely to place an onus upon the applicant to establish his entitlement to bail. He must- satisfy the court that bail should not be refused. Wood J said (and
I agree) that the presumption expresses a clear legislative intention that persons charged with the serious drug offences specified in the section should normally - or ordinarily - be refused bail. The reasons for that presumed deprivation of liberty are, as Wood J suggested: the incentive not to answer bail (created by the severity of the likely penalties) coupled with the capacity to abscond (created by the overseas contacts and financial resources which are usually found in these cases); both the incentive and the capacity to interfere with
Crown witnesses; and the very real risk to the community that further drug offences will be committed (created by the nature of the offences and the covert way in which they are committed).

Wood J also adopted (as I do) the views expressed by
Badgery-Parker J in a series of cases that, by the presumption against bail enacted by [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s8a.html), the legislature intends the courts to place less weight upon the circumstances which are common to all applicants, and more weight upon the strength of the Crown case against the applicant in the particular case under consideration. The strength of the Crown case has become the prime consideration where [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s8a.html) applies ...

Common to all bail applications are the circumstances that the applicant's continued incarceration will cause a serious deprivation of his general right to be at liberty, together with hardship and distress to himself and to his family, and usually with severe effects upon the applicant's business or employment, his finances, and his abilities to prepare his defence and to support his family. Also common to most bail applications by persons charged with the offences to which [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s8a.html) applies is the availability of sureties prepared to forfeit (with or without security) large sums of money to ensure that the applicant will answer his bail, an application would otherwise be unlikely to be considered in relation to such serious matters.

The legislature has, notwithstanding all of those particular circumstances, enacted the presumption against bail in these cases, so that such circumstances will not ordinarily be sufficient to overcome the barrier to bail which [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s8a.html) has erected. As Badgery-Parker J said, if the Crown case is a strong one, the application for bail in which they will be sufficient to do so must necessarily be somewhat special, and the task of the applicant to overcome the presumption that bail is to be refused will ordinarily be a difficult one. On the other hand, if the Crown case is not a strong one, the circumstances to which I have referred in the last paragraph will ordinarily be given greater weight, and the task of the applicant (although still a substantial one) will be correspondingly less difficult".
Thus, in various sections of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), the New South Wales Parliament has made different provisions as to the approach the court is to take to the granting of bail, depending upon the type of offence charged. In the case of some offences there is a right to bail. In the case of some offences there is a
presumption in favour of bail. In the case of offences of the kind with which the applicant has been charged, there is a presumption against bail.
Nevertheless, in such cases, the grant or refusal of bail ultimately depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion.
Provisions of this kind are not unique to New South Wales. [Section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ba197741/s4.html) of the [Bail Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ba197741/) of Victoria, for example, provides that, in the case of a person charged with certain specified drug offences of a serious kind, a court shall refuse bail unless the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the grant of bail.
 .
There is a long history of legislation affecting, and altering, the rights of persons to bail in various circumstances. It is not argued on behalf of the applicant that the provisions of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ba197741/), and in particular, s8A, do not have the character of laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of New South Wales, within the meaning of [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s5.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) Act 1902 . Rather, the argument is that certain express and implied provisions of the Commonwealth [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) operate to render s8A invalid at least in relation to persons charged with federal offences. That argument is reflected in the three questions raised for determination by this court. 
First question
Is [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth), contrary to [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of the Commonwealth of
Australia insofar as it applies to bail in relation to serious Federal narcotics offences?
Section of the Commonwealth [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) provides: "99. The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one
State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof".
What that provision has to do with [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) of New South Wales is not immediately apparent.
In order to avoid doing an injustice to the applicant's argument, I will not attempt to paraphrase it, but will state it as it appears in the applicants written submissions. The argument is as follows. In relation to serious drug offences of the kind with which we are presently concerned, the
States of New South Wales and Victoria have legislation raising a presumption against bail, and the States of Queensland, South Australia, Western
Australia, and Tasmania do not. It is, therefore, more difficult for alleged federal offenders resident (perhaps more accurately, in custody) in New South
Wales or Victoria to obtain bail than it is for such persons in the other four named States. "As a consequence, the States of New South Wales and Victoria will carry a heavier financial burden by accommodating more federal offenders in their prison population." This, it is said, gives preference to those other
States over the States of New South Wales and Victoria.
The process of reasoning by which it is argued that this supposed preference is given by the Commonwealth is based upon [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) which provides, so far as relevant, that the law of a State concerning the arrest and custody of persons charged with offences, and the procedure for holding accused persons to bail, shall apply to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred on the courts of that State.
There are two principal reasons why the applicant's argument must fail.
First, [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) is not a law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue. Second, it does not give any preference of the kind with which [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) is concerned.
The context in which [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) appears throws light on its meaning. It appears in Ch IV, dealing with the subject of finance and trade. The surrounding provisions deal with a series of issues related to that topic.
In The Commonwealth versus Tasmania [(1983) 158 CLR 1] at 153-154, Mason J, referring to [s100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s100.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), said: "The words 'of trade or commerce' relate back to 'law' as well as 'regulation'. This view is supported by similar expressions in the neighbouring sections, [ss 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s98.html), [99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html), [101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s101.html) and [102](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s102.html), which make it plain that the group of sections is dealing with laws with respect to trade and commerce. In this context the concept of laws with respect to trade and commerce signifies laws made, or perhaps capable of being made, under [ss51](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html) (i) and [98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s98.html) for that is the relevant power conferred on the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce. The prohibitions are naturally directed to laws which may be made in the exercise of that power, with the addition in the case of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of revenue laws because the exercise of the taxation power might otherwise result in the giving of a preference to a State or to part of a State".
[Section 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) is not a law with respect to revenue, and it was not made under [ss51(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html) and [98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s98.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). [Section 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) is an exercise of the power conferred by [s77(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s77.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) - (Leeth versus The Commonwealth [(1992) 174 CLR 445] at 466-467) and, perhaps, [s51(xxxix).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html)
As to the second matter, the kind of preference with which [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) is concerned is a trading or commercial preference, a tangible advantage of a commercial character. (Elliott versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1936) 54 CLR 657] at 83, 86, 92 and 96-97.)
In conclusion, it might be added that it is paradoxical that it is the
Commonwealth that is said to be giving the supposed preference to other States over New South Wales, when all that the Commonwealth has done is to enact a general law which, in its application in this instance, picks up and applies a law enacted by the New South Wales Parliament.
 .
The answer to the first question is in the negative. 
Second question
Is [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) contrary to the constitutional guarantee of fair process?
The reference in this question to "the constitutional guarantee of fair process" was explained in argument as a reference to what was said in Dietrich v The Queen <case>; [(1992) 177 CLR 292], by two members of the High Court (Deane J at and Gaudron J at 362) to the effect that, implicit in the vesting of the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the courts designated by Ch IV of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), is a constitutional requirement of the observance of judicial process and fairness. No person is to be convicted of a crime except after a fair trial according to law.
In order to deal with the applicant's argument, it is not necessary to examine the differing available views as to the existence and scope of what is said to be "the constitutional guarantee". For the purposes of the argument, and without staying to examine its correctness or its accuracy, the first premise may be assumed to be correct.
What follows from that? Let it be accepted that the applicant has a right not to be tried unfairly. Nothing in s8A infringes such a right.
 .
Many people are tried in circumstances where they have been denied bail.
No doubt it is, in certain respects, easier for a person to attend to matters involved in the conduct of a defence whilst on bail, rather than in custody.
However, it has never been, and could not be, asserted that the fact that a person is in custody means that such a person cannot be tried fairly according to law.
There is no common law right in a person who has been arrested and charged with a serious crime to be at liberty or on bail pending the resolution of the charge. (The principles applied by courts in making discretionary decisions as to bail are reviewed, for example, in R versus Watson [(1947) 64 WN 100] In any event if there were such a right, it could be modified by statute. In Sorby versus The
Commonwealth <case>; [(1983) 152 CLR 281], the High Court held that consistently with Ch
III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), a statute could abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination, whilst at the same time acknowledging (e g at 306) that the privilege was fundamental - "a maxim of our law as settled, as important and as wise as almost any other in it. If it is not inconsistent with
Ch III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) for a statute to abrogate the common law privilege against self-incrimination, it can scarcely be inconsistent with Ch III for a statute to make it more difficult for persons charged with certain types of offence to obtain bail. (See also Milicevic versus Campbell [(1968) 132 CLR 302.)]
This question should be answered in the negative. 
Third question
Is [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) WSW) as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary
Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) contrary to Ch III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) in that it offends the doctrine of separation of powers?
In Chu Kheng Lim versus Minister for Immigration [(1992) 176 CLR 1] at 27-28,
Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ said: "In exclusively entrusting to the courts designated by Ch. III the function of the adjudgment and punishment of criminal guilt under a law of the Commonwealth, the Constitution's concern is with substance and not mere form. It would, for example, be beyond the legislative power of the Parliament to invest the Executive with an arbitrary power to detain citizens in custody notwithstanding that the power was conferred in terms which sought to divorce such detention in custody from both punishment and criminal guilt. The reason why that is so is that, putting to one side the exceptional cases to which reference is made below, the involuntary detention of a citizen in custody by the
State is penal or punitive in character and, under our system of government, exists only as an incident of the exclusively judicial function of adjudging and punishing criminal guilt. Every citizen is 'ruled by the law, and by the law alone' and 'may with us be punished for a breach of law, but he can be punished for nothing else'. Ago
Blackstone wrote, relying on the authority of Coke: 'The confinement of the person, in any wise, is an imprisonment. So that the keeping (of) a man against his will ... is an imprisonment...
To make imprisonment lawful, it must either be by process from, the courts of judicature, or by warrant from some legal officer having authority to commit to prison; which warrant must be in writing, under the hand and seal of the magistrate, and express the causes of the commitment, in order to be examined into (if necessary) upon a habeas corpus.' 
There are some qualifications which must be made to the general proposition that the power to order that a citizen be involuntarily confined in custody is, under the doctrine of the separation ofjudicial from executive and legislative powers enshrined in our [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth entrusted exclusively to
Ch. III courts. The most important is that which
Blackstone himself identified in the above passage, namely, the arrest and detention in custody, pursuant to executive warrant, of a person accused of crime to ensure that he or she is available to be dealt with by the courts. Such committal to custody awaiting trial is not seen by the law as punitive or as appertaining exclusively to judicial power. Even where exercisable by the Executive, however, the power to detain a person in custody pending trial is ordinarily subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts, including the 'ancient common law' jurisdiction, 'before and since the conquest' to order that a person committed to prison while awaiting trial be admitted to bail'.
Under the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) of New South Wales, the supervisory jurisdiction of the court, including the discretionary power to order bail, is preserved.
 .
Earlier in this judgment there is set out the prevailing judicial opinion as to the manner in which the discretionary power to order bail is affected by [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/). The Act also, and in different ways, makes other provisions which affect the exercise of the power in relation to persons charged with different types of offence.
A law of general application, which seeks in some respects to govern the exercise of a jurisdiction which it confers, does not trespass upon the judicial function. (Leeth versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 455] at 470.) A law conferring a discretion on a court can determine the factors to which the court must have regard in exercising the discretion, or the relative weight to be given to different factors, or it can provide that there is a presumption that the discretion should be exercised in a particular way, save in exceptional circumstances. The current sentencing laws of the Commonwealth, and of New South Wales, provide examples.
Of course, different considerations would apply in the case of a law aimed at a particular offender; but that is not this case.
This question should be answered in the negative. 
Conclusion
All three questions should be answered in the negative.
The matter should be remitted to the Criminal Division to be dealt with according to law.
JUDGE2
KIRBY P Before the Court is an application winch challenges the validity under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) to charges laid under the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (Cth). The challenge is made by Mr Ngoc Tri Chan (the applicant) who has been charged under s233B(1)(c) and s233B(1)(d) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). It arose during an application for bail. 
Arrest, charge and bail application:
The background to the case is as follows. On September 1994, two shipping crates arrived at Sydney Airport from Vietnam aboard Vietnam Air flight VN 753. Routine checks were done which revealed, amongst other things, two large wooden model boat containing, in all, 3kg of cut heroin (1.5973 kg of pure heroin).
The following day, several Federal Police officers seized and dismantled the boats, extracted the heroin, inserted a listening device, then reassembled the boats with a smaller amount of heroin packed inside. The boats were then placed with the other goods inside the crates. The applicant, who was the consignee of the goods, was then advised by post that the crates were available for collection.
On 22 September 1995, the applicant arrived at the customs store to take delivery of the crates. According to the evidence, he answered the following standard questions, put to him by a Customs Service Officer, as follows: 
Mr Vaughan: Did you pack these packs yourself? 
Mr Chan: No, they are gifts from my family back home to my family here.

Mr Vaughan: What type of toys are they? 
Mr Chan: Bears, dolls and birds and toys like that.

The crates were then released. The applicant then drove directly home with the crates, under the surveillance of the Federal Police. The Police maintained their surveillance throughout the afternoon. On Ins arrival home, the applicant unloaded the crates from the car and took them inside. In the course of the afternoon, the applicant 'was visited by Mr Viet Dung Ong (who was also later charged under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)). Some time later, noises transmitted by the listening device suggested that the packages were being dismantled. At this stage, the
Police executed their search warrant. The resulting search revealed that the crates had been emptied. It is alleged that the packages which had been placed inside the boats had been removed and placed underneath a bed from where they were recovered.
Both the applicant and Mr Ong were arrested and charged at the Sydney
Police Centre of being in possession of not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited import and for knowingly being concerned in the importation into
Australia of such prohibited import. There, they participated in taped records of interview. No admissions were made by the applicant. He has been in custody ever since his arrest.
On 18 May 1995, both the applicant and Mr Ong were committed to stand trial in the District Court of New South Wales. On 8
June 1995, Mr Chau sought bail in the Supreme Court of New South Wales pending his trial. The application for bail was heard by Dunford
J. As the applicant challenged the constitutional validity of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) , his Honour made an order, pursuant to [s51(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s51.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and the Supreme Court
Rules, Part 12 r2(1)(b), removing the matter into the Court of Appeal.
I turn to consider the three arguments upon which the applicant based his constitutional challenges. 
The challenge under [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) The first challenge raised the following question: 
Is section 8A of the Bail Ad 1978 as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) contrary to section " of the Commonwealth [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) insofar as it applies to bail in relation to serious federal narcotics offences?
The applicant seeks to challenge the constitutional validity of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) as applied to his case by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) as being contrary to the [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). [Section 99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) provides that: 
The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one
State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.

The [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) is undoubtedly a law of trade and commerce. Consequently, it must satisfy the requirements of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) if it is to be a valid law. However, although the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), under which the applicant has been charged, is a Federal Act, by virtue of [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), prosecutions under that Act are governed by State procedural law. Section (1) provides that the State or Territory procedures for trial and conviction (including bail) on indictment shall: ... subject to this section, apply and be applied so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred on the several courts of that State or Territory ... .

As the attempted importation allegedly occurred in New South
Wales, the trial, and consequently the bail application, were required by these provisions be determined according to New South Wales law and procedure. In particular, as the alleged offence involves a commercial quantity of a prohibited import, [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) applies. That section states, relevantly, that: a person accused of an offence to which this section applies is not to be granted bail unless the person satisfies the authorised officer or court that bail should not be refused.
The effect of the section is to reverse the presumption of bail in favour of an accused. See R versus Kissner, unreported, 17 January 1992, Supreme
Court of
New South Wales (Hunt CJ at CL).
[Section 8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) is a relatively recent change in the law as to bail. It reflects an amendment apparently considered necessary to deal effectively with people accused of certain serious crimes, including the specified importation of prohibited drugs into Australia. Specifically, [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) has been devised to prevent an accused from escaping the jurisdiction (possibly with the aid of the profits gained from illegal activity of the kind being prosecuted). The only other Australian State to have enacted a similar provision is Victoria.
In the other States of Australia, the presumption of a right of bail still remains for people charged with such Federal offences.
The applicant contends that persons charged under s233B of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) in a State of Australia other than New South Wales (or Victoria) will enjoy an advantage over an accused in those two States because the presumption to bail will continue to apply to them. In those States which have maintained the general presumption, a bail application will therefore be more likely to succeed as the requirements for bail will be less stringent. The submission continues that this differentiation. amounts to a "preference" given to persons in some States, yet withheld from persons in other States.
Consequently, so it was argued, [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), is invalid as contrary to [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s68.html) would, unless struck down, permit to be achieved indirectly what [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) controls and prevents in Federal laws of trade and commerce.
The function of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) is to control the imposition of protectionist laws and to prevent the Commonwealth from giving preference to
States, or parts of
States, by affording them by law or regulation trading advantages over other States, thereby interfering with free trade within the
Commonwealth. The objective of the section (and surrounding sections) is the maintenance of national economic unit, the creation of which was one of the chief objectives of Federation. In this sense, [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) complements the prohibition in [s 92](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s92.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) against discriminatory laws which prevent the free flow of trade. See eg Cole versus Whitfield <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 360], 391-392, 393.
J Quick and R R Garran, The Annotated [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of the Australian
Commonwealth, Legal Books, Sydney, 1976, at 877, wrote of [section 99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) that: it is a limitation upon the power of Parliament to regulate trade, commerce and revenue and is intended to prevent discriminations in favour of one State against others. ... The object of (the prohibition on giving a preference) is to prevent federal favouiritism and partiality in commercial and other kindred regulations. (emphasis added)
Clearly, not only is [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) to apply to acts regulating trade and commerce but the preference to be avoided must similarly be of a trading or commercial character.
Three matters must be demonstrated in order to establish a contravention of [s99.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) First, the Federal law in question must be one of trade, commerce or revenue. As I have said, the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) is such a law. But the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) is clearly not Secondly, the Federal law must give a "preference". Thirdly, the "preference" must be given to one State, or a part of a State, over another State or a part of that State. See R D Lumb
The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of the Commonwealth of Australia, 4th Edition, Butterworths,
Sydney, 1986 at 338f.
Under the second limb, the High Court of
Australia has consistently interpreted "preference" as being a "preference" with regard to trade and commerce. Thus, Crowe versus The
Commonwealth <case>; [(1935) 54 CLR 69] concerned a constitutional attack on various sections of the Dried Fruits and Exports
Control Act 1924 (Cth). The structure of that
Act provided, so it was argued, discriminatory schemes in relation to various representatives of the Dried
Fruits Control Board, namely inequality in the number of representatives on the Board from the different States. In determining whether or not s99 had any application to the facts of the case, Starke J, at 86, held:
The preferences prohibited by s99 are advantages or impediments in connection with commercial dealings based upon distinctions of locality. 
Dixon J observed, at 92: ... the preference referred to by sec 99 is evidently some tangible advantage obtainable in the course of trading or commercial operations, or, at least, some material or sensible benefit of a commercial or trading character.
In Crowe, the differing numbers of representatives on the Board did not constitute a tangible advantage of a commercial nature given to one State and denied to another. Even if there might have been commercial consequences flowing from the differing numbers of State's representatives, the actual "preference" impugned was not of that nature. See also Elliott versus The
Commonwealth <case>; [(1936) 54 CLR 657] at 669,678,679f, 683.
More recently, the Queensland Court of Appeal in R versus Scouller unreported,
Court of Appeal, Queensland, February 1995, dealt with the suggested application of s99 to a serious Federal narcotics offence. The accused had been charged with a serious drug offence under s233B of the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) as a result of an unsuccessful attempt to import one and a half tonnes of cannabis into Australia. The point of entry was Yeppoon in the north of
Queensland. The accused was in custody in Queensland. Consequently, Queensland law applied, although the accused was ordinarily a resident of New South
Wales. The accused complained that certain features of Queensland criminal procedure put him at a disadvantage when compared to someone charged with a similar offence in New South Wales. The disadvantages complained of were two-fold. First, in Queensland, the opportunity of making an unsworn statement at the trial had been abolished by statute. If the accused had been tried in
New South Wales, at the time when he was tried in Queensland, he would not have been denied that opportunity.
Secondly, under s619 of the Criminal Code of Queensland, if evidence is adduced for the accused, the Crown is entitled to make the final address to the jury after counsel for the accused, whereas in New South Wales, the accused always has the right of final address.
As a resident of New South Wales, the accused argued that he was put at a disadvantage which, as he had been charged under a Federal
Act, was contrary to [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). In other words, it was argued that the advantage which existed for someone in being tried in New South Wales meant that a New
South
Wales accused, charged under a Federal Act, enjoyed preferential treatment. Such a situation was contrary to the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). So went Mr
Scouller's arguments.
The Queensland Court of Appeal followed the earlier treatment of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) by the High Court. It held that the "preference" referred to in [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) did not extend to complaints about variations in the criminal procedures from one Australian State to the next. [Section 99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) was concerned only with preferences of a tangible commercial character. In the judgment of the Court (Macrossan CJ, McPherson JA and Lee J) at 21, the position was put thus: 
What is essential, however, in order to attract [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html), is that there be ... a "tangible advantage of a commercial character....... It cannot be said that the privilege enjoyed by an illegal importer of narcotics, who is apprehended and prosecuted, of making a statement from the dock in New South
Wales is an advantage of a commercial character; if it is, it is scarcely one that can be described as tangible; and even if it is taken to share both of these characteristics, it remains impossible to conceive of it as an advantage given to New
South Wales over Queensland in the course of what Parliament has declared to be a prohibited trade.
In my opinion, this reasoning is sound. It applies to the present case.
The "advantage" which an accused might have in States other than New South
Wales or Victoria affecting the prospect of securing bail, self-evidently cannot be considered to be of a tangible or commercial character.
It cannot be rendered such because the bail in question is an incident to a trial of an offence alleged under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). The impugned differences in the trial procedures as between the States have no effect on the freedom of trade between States.
The High Court of Australia on 8 August 1995 refused special leave to appeal in Scouller on this point (amongst others). The transcript of argument reveals that the presiding Judges (Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ) did not consider that the point enjoyed "sufficient prospects of success to warrant the grant of special leave", (see tspt, 11).
The applicant argued that, as a consequence of recent High Court authority, which provides for express or implied guarantees of rights and immunities, such a literal interpretation of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) was no longer supportable. The applicant relied on the comments of Brennan J in
Street versus The New South Wales Bar Association <case>; [(1989) 168 CLR 461] at 522 when he said: ... the doctrine of stare decisis, never conclusive in determining the true construction of the constitution, is least cogent in its application to those few provisions which are calculated to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Without doubting for a minute the accuracy of his Honour's statement, it does not apply to the problem in hand. First, this
Court is bound by what the
High Court has held in previous constitutional cases concerning [s99.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) This means, in the present case, that this Court must follow, and apply what has been said in Elliot and Crowe (above). This is determinative of the applicant's first challenge. But, even if I were free to give effect to my own opinion, I do not believe that [s 99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) should be given so wide an interpretation as to apply to the present case. The purpose of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) is not to protect individuals as such. The third requirement of the section quite clearly states that the invalid preference is one given to a State or part of the State over another State or part thereof. [Section 99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) is concerned with the regulation of inter State trade in the interests of uniformity and anti-protectionist policies and with the maintenance of free trade as between
States not as between or with individuals. Individuals will, of course, benefit indirectly from the enactment of laws which are not inconsistent with the constitutional provision. This is the position as it has been understood in the texts (see, eg, Quick and Garran, above) and by the courts. I do not consider that [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) is a provision of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) which is concerned with questions of human rights or fundamental freedoms as such. Any challenge to the suggested restrictions, placed on such freedoms by [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), would have to be grounded elsewhere. There is certainly no basis, in the settled meaning of s99, in my understanding of the purpose of that section or the requirements of free trade within the Commonwealth, to expand the application of [s99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) to include the protection of an individual's right not of a commercial character, simply because that person is prosecuted under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). No argument was advanced based on the alternative constitutional prohibition on discrimination in [s 117](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s117.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). Accordingly, I will not consider its application.
Whatever disadvantage or discrimination there may be in the present case is a result not of any Federal law but of s8A of the State [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/). That section, in so far as it affects the application of s233B of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), may well be supported by [s120](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s120.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) which provides that each
State must make provision, pending trial for the detention of persons accused of Federal offences in that
State's prisons. [Section 120](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s120.html) expressly confers power on States to make laws for the punishment of persons convicted of
Federal offences. See Leeth versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 455] at 467. The
Federal law which makes s8A applicable to the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) is the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/). This is a law of general application to all States without discrimination. See Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd versus Irving [(1906) AC 360 ] at 367 where the Privy Council said of the last-mentioned Act: 
The rule laid down by the Act is a general one, applicable to an the
States alike, and the fact that it operates unequally in the several
States arises not from anything done by the (Federal)
Parliament, but from the inequality of the duties imposed by the States themselves.
Thus, even if a broad definition of "Preference" were accepted and applied to [s 99](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s99.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), there is no Federal law which has sought to treat States differently or preferentially. The effective disadvantage complained of in an applicant for bail in New South Wales is the consequence of a State law only.
The first constitutional challenge fails.
 
The challenge based on constitutional fair process.
The second challenge raises the following question: 
Is [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) contrary to the constitutional guarantee of fair process?
The question posed by the applicant here assumes that there is, in fact, a constitutionally entrenched guarantee as stated. The assumption is apparently based on comments of Deane J and Gaudron
J in Dietrich versus The Queen <case>; [(1992) 177 CLR 292.] Their Honours held that the right to a fair trial (or not to be tried unfairly) was guaranteed, by implication, by the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). In so holding, they went beyond the holding of the majority in Dietrich who asserted that any such right arose by the common law.
However, relying on the wider holding, the applicant contended that the constitutional guarantee of fair process, required that the judicial power of the Commonwealth should be exercised in accordance with the judicial process as traditionally understood at common law. Looked at in this light [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), when applied to
Federal offence, was in contravention of this traditional understanding.
In Dietrich an application for adjournment of a trial, made on behalf of an accused was denied. He was facing trial on a serious charge. He sought the adjournment for time to seek legal aid assistance. In the course of holding that the trial court' <case> to stay the proceedings had resulted in a miscarriage of the trial, Deane J commented at 326: 
The fundamental prescript of the criminal law of this country is that no person shall be convicted of a crime except after a fair trial according to law. In so far as the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth is concerned, that principle is entrenched by the Constitution's requirement of the observance of judicial process and fairness that is implicit in the vesting of the judicial power of the Commonwealth exclusively in the courts which Chapter
III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) designates.
The applicant relied on this statement and similar statements made by
Gaudron J. See ibid at 362. Such statements were neither expressly adopted nor rejected by the other members of the Court. The applicant's submission asserts that there is implicit in the exercise of the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth under Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), a fundamental requirement that it be performed in a uniform way so that it can be said that there is true equality of treatment
Reliance was placed on statements made by the minority in Leeth versus The Commonwealth of Australia <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 455.]
Leeth was concerned with s4(1) of the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 (the section having since been repealed). This had the effect that an offender, charged with a Federal offence in different States, could be subject to differing minimum terms of imprisonment in respect of the same Federal offence depending on the applicable State or Territory legislation. The majority established that a law of the Commonwealth is valid although it produces the result that terms of imprisonment, imposed on a Federal offender, might differ significantly according to the State in which he or she was tried.
In holding that the differing minimum terms constituted a failure to observe the constitutional guarantee of legal equality, Deane and Toohey JJ, in a joint judgment, commented at 486: 
For another thing, the doctrine of legal equality is, to a significant extent, implicit in the constitution's separation of judicial power from legislative and executive powers and the vesting of judicial power in designated "courts".

Gaudron
J, reached much the same conclusion. She observed at 499: 
It is inevitable that some differences will flow from the exercise of federal jurisdiction by State courts. ... On the other hand, it is manifestly absurd that the legal consequences attaching to a breach of a law of the Commonwealth should vary merely on account of the location or venue or of the court in which proceedings are brought. That is especially so where the liberty of the individual is at stake. Thus, no relevance attaches to the fact that some, perhaps most, Commonwealth offenders are convicted in State courts exercising invested federal jurisdiction, for ... in the exercise of that jurisdiction those courts are part of the separated and entire judicial system created by Ch
HI of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Further support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally entrenched guarantee of equality of treatment in the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth is also found in the majority opinions in Leeth.
Brennan J, at 475, stated: 
It would be offensive to the constitutional unity of the Australian people "in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth", recited in the first preamble to the Commonwealth of Australia [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) Ad 1900, to expose offenders against the same law of the Commonwealth to different maximum penalties dependent on the locality of the court by which the offender is convicted and sentenced.
However, Brennan J held that Leeth was not such a case, dealing as it did, not with maximum penalties but with minimum. terms and the power of the
Executive Government to release a prisoner before the expiry of his full sentence.
A majority of the High Court in Leeth therefore referred to, and appeared to accept the existence of, a constitutional guarantee of equality of treatment. However, they differed on the exact content of such a guarantee.
I have some sympathy for the notion of a constitutionally implied principle of equality of treatment in the application of the judicial power of the Commonwealth as discussed in Leeth. But I do not believe that current doctrine requires, or permits, me to strike down [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) on this ground. Brennan J embraced uniformity in the setting of maximum penalties
Beyond this, his Honour was prepared, as I understand his reasons, to accept that many discrepancies and even inequalities in sentencing and the application of Federal laws will occur amongst the States and Territories of
Australia. Similarly, Gaudron J, accepted that there would be differences. Her
Honour was more concerned with equality of treatment in the situation where an accused's liberty was at stake. This is evident in her focus of attention on legal consequences'. This suggests that her Honour was speaking about the trial and its aftermath. There is nothing in her words which suggests that equality of treatment extends to such areas as standards for the setting of bad.
Bail is not denied to an accused person as a punishment. See Lim v
Minister for Immigration [(1992) 176 CLR 1], 27f. Section 235 of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) provides life imprisonment as the maximum penalty for offences under [s233.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) The
Parliament has legislated so that proceeds of crime may be confiscated. It has granted wide powers to deal with the accused's assets. There are, therefore, substantial reasons why persons, in the position of the applicant, might be tempted to flee. In these circumstances, it is not entirely surprising that the New South Wales (and Victorian) Parliaments have deemed it necessary, in order to ensure that in such cases the accused comes to trial, to make the grant of bail possible, in effect, only in situations where such attendance can be guaranteed. Whatever the merits of the law, it in no way detracts from the likelihood of a fair trial. In one sense, it is an adjunct to ensuring that a trial will be held. The [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) provision certainly has no effect on the presumption of innocence or other features of the fairness of the trial.
Consequently, I do not believe that the application of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) to someone accused under a Federal law results in a relevant inequality in any of the senses envisaged in Leeth. The setting of bail is not 'a legal consequence of a breach of the law'. It is a precondition for trial according to law.
Therefore, even if there be an implied guarantee under Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), as asserted for the applicant, I cannot accept that it extends to invalidating s8A of the New South Wales [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/). There are countless examples of trials being conducted with perfect fairness although an accused has not been granted bail. The impact of a bail application, whatever its outcome, on the conduct of the trial is minimal. Thus, even if the implied constitutional right is established, as claimed, I am not satisfied that the provisions of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html), distinct as they are from the conduct of the trial itself, amount to an offence to that guarantee. It might be different if the reversal of the presumption of bail could be shown in a particular case to have a detrimental effect on the trial itself. However, this is not such a case. The setting of bail is not, as such, a comment on the guilt or lack of guilt of an accused. It cannot affect the process of the trial, the giving of evidence, the determinations of a judge or jury, the outcome of the trial or the subsequent sentence. Indeed, in the course of the trial, the grant of bail is rarely, if ever, alluded to.
Accordingly, [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) does not detract from the likelihood of a fair trial. No basis of constitutional invalidity is therefore shown. The applicant's second constitutional challenge must also be rejected. 
The challenge based on the separation of powers.
The third challenge raises the following question: 
Is [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) contrary to Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) in that it offends the inviolable doctrine of a separation of judicial from legislative and executive powers?
The applicant's submission relied on the recent High Court decision of
Brandy versus Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission <case>; [(1995) 69 ALJR 191 .] That case held invalid sections of a Federal Act which purported to invest what were found to be Chapter III judicial powers in a
Federal
Commission, non-judicial in character. The specific sections, s295Z and s295AB of the [Racial Discrimination Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/rda1975202/) (Cth) provided for the registration of decisions of the Commission under the Act, giving them the effect of an order of the Federal
Court. Although there was a judicial process which could be invoked, this was by way of judicial review in the Federal Court. However, if no review were initiated, the orders took effect upon registration. Further, the review of the Federal Court was not a rehearing de novo. Thus the
Commission, a body established under the Executive power of the Commonwealth, was held to have been invested with judicial powers reserved to Chapter III courts. Consequently, the relevant sections were held to be invalid as contrary to the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
The applicant contends that, as a result of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) as applied by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), there is a similar transgression of the separation of judicial powers in that the eventual bail application before the Court does not amount to a real rehearing de novo of the initial Executive decision to detain him. I disagree. The determination of a bail application before a judge or magistrate is completely different from the type of review discussed in Brandy. Any initial decision to detain an accused made on behalf of an officer of the Executive Government, usually a police officer, is not a decision judicial in character.
This much was recognised in Lim versus Minister for
Immigration [(1992) 176 CLR 1] at 28 where Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ observed: "... the arrest and detention in custody, pursuant to executive warrant, of a person accused of crime to ensure that he or she is available to be dealt with by the Courts ... is not seen by the law as punitive or as appertaining exclusively to judicial power."
Traditionally, after that Executive's decision is made, the accused will be brought before a court and a determination will be made to grant or refuse bail according to the criteria set out in the relevant [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) or otherwise established by law. The initial decision to detain plays no part in this determination. In this sense, quite clearly, there is a hearing de novo. The requirements of the separation of powers under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) are fully respected.
However, the applicant claimed that as a result of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), an effective rehearing was rendered impossible, as the unfettered exercise of a judicial discretion was marred, or negatived, by the action of the State
Parliament in reversing the ordinary presumption in favour of bail. I do not agree. Judicial discretions are not typically made in a vacuum. There are many instances of statutory guidance for the making of judicial discretions. I have already alluded to some of them. Such statutory guidance is clearly acceptable so long as it does not amount to a purported usurpation of the judicial function. In order for it to amount to this, there would need to be an intrusion into a specific application on behalf of one of the other arms of government. Tins is not so here. The court hearing the bail application is not limited or controlled in any way by the initial decision to detain the offender. Nor is it prevented from granting bail by the terms of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) which, as a law of general application, merely alters the weight to be given by the judicial officer to particular evidence. Its application is much the same as a statutory reversal of the onus of proof for particular offences. But this does not offend the integrity and independence of the judicial process. The section does not attempt to wrest the process of decision-making from the particular judge. To illustrate an invalid interference in the judicial process, the
Court was referred to Liyanage versus The Queen (1967) 1 AC (PC) where legislation, specific to a pending trial, was held to be invalid as it sought to influence the judicial discretion in sentencing by coercing the Judges to increase the punishment. See also Reginald Deaton versus The Attorney Generaland
Anor [(1963) IR 170 (SC)], 184. But under the [Bail Act 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), the ultimate decision to grant or deny bail rests always with the judge or magistrate concerned.
There are several instances where statutory guidance for the judiciary has been held not to usurp the powers of courts under Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). In The Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders
Labourers' Federation and Ors versus The Commonwealth of Australia and
Anor <case>; [(1986) CLR 88], the High Court held that statutes purporting to cancel the registration of an industrial organisation of employees, and to disable it from applying for re-registration within five years, were valid and consistent with the separation of powers under Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). The
Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had previously made a declaration which was the prerequisite for the Minister to deregister the organisation. The industrial union commenced proceedings in the High Court seeking to have the Minister's decision quashed. It was during those proceedings that the relevant Acts were passed-by the Parliament. Even though the rights in issue in the proceedings were clearly affected by the legislation, it was held that the Act did not offend the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) as it dealt with the substantive rights in issue without purporting to interfere with the judicial process passing on those rights.
The judges retained the last say. They simply had to apply the law, which had changed.
The decision of this Court in Director of Public Prosecutions v
Toro-Martinez [(1993) 33 NSWLR 82 (CA)] is relevant here.' That case concerned provisions of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/) (Cth) which empower the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for a restraining order on certain property of a defendant charged with an indictable offence. The confiscation was lawfully effected by the action of a police officer so long as the officer held a
reasonable belief that the property was "tainted" and was under the "effective control" of the defendant. However, notwithstanding the fact that the police officer bad to act on a belief a subjective opinion did not finally determine the rights of the defendant.
The officer could not be said to be exercising judicial power. The decision could be submitted to the independent assessment of the court which could evaluate the reasonableness or otherwise of the officer's belief, on the evidence before it. The initial decision did not intrude on the judicial determination of whether the belief was reasonable.
The court's function under the Act was not Executive in character. It was not a rubber stamp of the police officer's decision. On the contrary, the court made its own determination on the evidence before it. Parliament had clearly delineated between the functions of the Executive and the Judiciary without offending the separation of powers guaranteed under the Federal [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Similarly, [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), as applied to Federal offenders by the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), does not impermissibly impede any decision made by a court reviewing an initial decision to detain an alleged offender.
Ultimately, although the reversal of the presumption of bail is new, the section challenged in these proceedings does, not involve more than a
development of the previous common law. Before the enactment of the New South
Wales Act, the common law already applied stringent criteria for the grant of bail for the most serious offences. Bail would be granted to someone charged and committed to trial for murder only where exceptional circumstances were shown to exist. See, eg, R versus Watson [(1947) 64 WN 100 (SC)], 102. Although there is a difference between this and the present bail requirements for serious drug offences, it is more one of degree than of character. The enactment of [s8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) does not amount to a new development of, or intrusion upon, the judicial function. it is merely an extension and adaptation of what was the previous common law position as judged to be necessary for the effective functioning of criminal justice in cases such as this. In this way [s 8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s8a.html), as applied to Federal accused by [s68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s68.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), is no fetter on judicial power, nor an intrusion on the independence of the courts exercising their powers under Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). The section merely controls the way those powers are by law to be exercised. The final decision remains that of the judicial officer concerned.
Consequently, the third constitutional challenge must also be rejected. 
Conclusion: Provision of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) is constitutionally valid.
As I would answer all three questions in the negative, I too would return the matter to the Criminal
Division of the Supreme Court for the outstanding bail application to be determined conformally with this Court's decision.
