BRUNING V KINGMILL (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff in these proceedings, Mr. Bruning, has brought proceedings in the Federal Court against a number of defendants seeking relief under the Corporations Law, and also under the Trade Practices Act and on the basis of general law principles. Mr. Bruning has also brought proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission against two of the defendants in the Federal Court, seeking relief under [s.106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) of the [Industrial Relations Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/). 
In the proceedings before me, Mr. Bruning seeks an order that his proceedings before the Industrial Relations Commission be removed to this Court and assigned to the Equity Division. The defendants in the Industrial Relations
Commission, who are also the defendants in these proceedings, consent to that order.

Mr. Conti QC for the plaintiff has referred me to [s.106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) of the [Industrial Relations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/), which authorises the Industrial Relations Commission to make certain orders concerning contracts whereby a person performs work in any industry. He has also referred me to [ss.151](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s151.html)-[153](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s153.html) of that Act, and [s.163](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s163.html) of that Act, to show that in dealing with matters under [s.106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html), the Commission is made a superior court of record, required to follow the rules of evidence and other formal procedures of a superior court of record.
He has also referred me to various provisions of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/), and in particular to [ss.8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s8.html) and [9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) of that Act, which are in the following terms: (1) Where: a proceeding (in this subsection referred to as the "relevant proceeding") is pending in: a court, other than the Supreme Court, of the State; or a tribunal established by or under an Act; and it appears to the Supreme Court that: the relevant proceeding arises out of, or is related to, another proceeding pending in the Federal Court, the Family Court or the Supreme Court of another State or of a Territory and, if an order is made under this subsection in relation to the relevant proceeding, there would be grounds on which that other proceeding could be transferred to the Supreme Court; or an order should be made under this subsection in relation to the relevant proceeding so that consideration can be given to whether the relevant proceeding should be transferred to another Court.

Where an order is made under subsection (1) in relation to a proceeding, this Act applies in relation to the proceeding as if it were a proceeding pending in the Supreme Court.

Where a proceeding is removed to the Supreme Court in accordance with an order made under subsection (1), the Supreme Court may, if the Supreme Court considers it appropriate to do so, remit the proceeding to the court or tribunal from which the proceeding was removed.
 . The Supreme Court: may exercise jurisdiction (whether original or appellate) conferred on that court by a provision of this Act or of a law of the Commonwealth or a State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction; and may hear and determine a proceeding transferred to that court under such a provision.

He submitted that this case falls within [s.8(1)(a)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s8.html) and s.[8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s8.html)(1)(b)(i).
He submitted that there is a very substantial overlap in the issues as between the Industrial Relations Commission proceedings and the proceedings in the
Federal Court, and that in the interests of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings, it is most desirable that both sets of proceedings be transferred to this Court. He submitted that, when the order sought in these proceedings is made, this Court will have jurisdiction to make such orders as the
Industrial Relations Commission could have made under s.106, by virtue of [s.9(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s9.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/). He also referred me to the cases of Winron v. Shell Company of Australia [(1996) 66
IR 64],
Wood v. Boral Resources , McLelland, CJ in Eq, 28th October 1993,
Adamson v. NSW Rugby League <case>; [(1991) 27 FCR 535], and Gallagher v. Pioneer Concrete  <case>; [(1993) 113 ALR 159.] 
In the cases of Winron, Adamson and Gallagher, the matters had been cross-vested from the New South Wales Industrial Court or Industrial Relations
Commission by consent; and in Adamson and Gallagher, the Court proceeded on the basis that it had jurisdiction to make orders under provisions similar to s.106 of the 1996 [Industrial Relations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/), although, in the event, no such orders were actually made. In Wood, Justice McLelland refused an order cross-vesting a matter from the Industrial Relations
Commission. However, Mr. Conti sought to distinguish that case, because refusal was made in contested proceedings, in circumstances where there was apparently no relief which could be obtained in the Supreme Court which could not be obtained in the Industrial Relations Commission, and where there was a suggestion of forum shopping.

In my opinion, this case does fall within the provisions of [s.8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s8.html) relied on by Mr. Conti; and in my opinion, [s.9(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s9.html) does empower the Supreme Court to make orders which the Industrial Relations
Commission could made under [s.106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) of the [Industrial Relations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/). I think this is confirmed by the definition of "State matter" in [s.3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s3.html) of the Act, and by the provisions of [s.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s4.html) of the Act, which give jurisdiction with respect to State matters to various courts other than the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In my opinion, that confirms what is clearly indicated by [s.9(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s9.html), namely that the Supreme Court of New South Wales has jurisdiction in respect of matters removed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales under [s.8.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s8.html) 
In circumstances where there is a substantial overlap between the issues in the two sets of proceedings, where there is no suggestion of forum shopping, and where the order is consented to, in my opinion the matter can be distinguished from the decision in Wood.

I make Order 1 in the summons which I initial and date.

I order that those proceedings, when removed to this Court, shall be treated as a continuation of these proceedings.

I order that the costs of the application for removal be costs in the proceedings.

Messrs. Esplins undertake to attend at the Registry to pay the filing fee.
