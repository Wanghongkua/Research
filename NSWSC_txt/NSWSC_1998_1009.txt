 `
 `JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: These are two appeals against a decision of Master McLaughlin who was asked to set aside a statutory demand under <case> of the Corporations Law. 
The plaintiffs are two companies associated with a Mr Brancourt, who apparently has some vineyards in Forbes and was endeavouring to register a prospectus with the authorities in order to have members of the public invest in a speculative scheme in respect of his vineyards. The defendant was formerly a partner of a large firm of solicitors but is now practising as a sole practitioner.

The matter of the series of prospectuses had been going on between the parties since November 1995 and the plaintiffs had paid a six figure sum for legal costs. The present dispute involves the sum of less than $25,000, yet lasted three days before the Master and a further half day before me on appeal.

I should say at once that the statutory demand procedure under the
Corporations Law is to permit a summary disposal of debts alleged to be owed by companies. If the company does not appropriately react within 21 days then, subject to <case> of the Corporations Law, it cannot dispute the subject matter of a statutory demand. If the company does appropriately react within time, then the court needs to determine that application in a very short order of time.

Section 459R makes it clear that the application to wind up is normally to be made within six months after the demand, though that can be extended.

In the instant case, the statutory demands were given on 10 July 1997, the summons was filed on 30 July 1997, the matter was heard by the learned Master on 18 and 19 September and 7 October 1997 and he gave a forty page written judgment on 19 March 1998. I do not wish to express any criticism of what occurred in this particular case as there may have been some good reason for departing from proper practice, but, generally speaking, that period of delay should not be allowed to happen. One of the reasons why the hearing was so prolonged was that it would appear that there were two days of cross- examination of the witnesses. That should not take place in this sort of application. Credit is not at issue. These applications must not be used as fishing expeditions. The only question is whether there is a genuine dispute as to the existence of the debt or a genuine dispute as to quantum. Ordinarily those matters are to be determined without cross-examination or alternatively, by permitting very short cross-examination, ten, fifteen minutes, though in special cases, it may go slightly longer. If this is not adhered to then the whole purpose of the Law in having these matters determined summarily and quickly will be frustrated. What I have just said is not new, see for instance the remarks of Hayne, J in Mibor Investments Ltd versus Commonwealth Bank of
Australia <case>; [(1993) 11 ACSR 362], 364 where his Honour said that cross-examination in these cases would be rare "perhaps very rare indeed". See also Re Polaroid
Australia Pty Ltd (Santow, J - 15 December 1997, unreported).

I now turn to the problems in the instant appeals, which although heard together, need separate consideration.

The Appeal by Australian Vineyard Management Ltd 
The first appeal involves four demands made by the solicitor on the client for payment. These were dated 31 January 1997, for $177; 19 February 1997 for $750; 20 March 1997 for $3,083 and 5 May 1997 for $5,530.

The learned Master was not satisfied as to the first two demands and he directed that the statutory demands be varied by reducing the sum claimed accordingly. The Master found the other two amounts were due.

So far as the third demand is concerned, that is the one for $3,083, it would appear to me that the matter is one of genuine dispute. What appears to have happened is that the solicitor did not take a written retainer, but the work that was being done by the solicitor or his former firm had continued in tranches for some time. Each time there was a fresh tranche of work the solicitor would send out what he called, and what the Master found was, a costs agreement within the meaning of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lpa179/). He never had the client sign the agreement, but in the instant case the Master held that it was accepted by conduct.

The bill for $3,083 was said to be a revised bill. However, in revising it some errors were made in that the bill referred to a costs agreement that was made after the work was done. The bill should have referred to some earlier costs agreement. When trying to explain his client's way out of that, Mr Mark
Robinson for the solicitor put a series of propositions as to how this could be explained, but the more he endeavoured to do this the more it appeared that the matter was arguable.

There was some dispute both before the Master and before me as to whether one could have a costs agreement under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s184.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) after the work was done or at least some of the work was done. The Master, on my reading of his judgment, held that that was possible and I tend to think that may be right because if one looks at [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s177.html) and [178](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s178.html), on the one hand, and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s184.html), on the other, it would seem that the costs agreements can only be made after the retainer, whereas under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s178.html) the disclosure of the estimate is to be made before the retainer. However, this point really does not arise for decision in respect of the bill for $3,083. It would seem to me that there is a genuine dispute about that.

The Master said that when a client does not apply to have the costs assessed then the mere fact that the bill is not sufficiently detailed, or is higher than the client might have expected, does not in itself represent a genuine dispute. That, with respect to him, seems to be contrary to what was said in
Jarena Pty Ltd versus Sholl Nicholson Pty Ltd [(1996) 19 ACSR 425], 427, that a client is entitled either to have the bill assessed or he is to take the second line of defence that there has been no proper bill. Accordingly, there is no reason for him to go out of his way in having the costs assessed.

I cannot see, however, any real defence or dispute about the bill of $5,530.
It was after the costs agreement of 25 February 1997, the Master held that that was the costs agreement which had been accepted by conduct, and there is nothing to show the learned Master erred in that respect.

Mr Gelbart for the appellant says the Master misunderstood the various points, but I cannot see really how when it was found that that was a costs agreement, that the bill of $5,530 can be said to be under any genuine dispute.

I should make it plain that before the learned Master and before me there was no dispute that the defendant had actually performed the legal work and services and incurred the various disbursements which were described in the relevant demands in both appeals.

What then should follow as the result of the appeal in view of what I have just said? 
It follows that the appellant is entitled to an order that the demand at least be further modified. Section 459M of the Corporations Law gives the Court power to make conditional orders. As the jurisdiction over statutory demands is one of summary decision making, conditions may be imposed to ensure that the real dispute between the parties is determined in the most efficient and cost effective way.

I believe that the appropriate method of proceeding is to give conditional relief on the basis that the three disputed bills and indeed the fourth bill as well if the appellant still presses its objection to that bill, would be submitted to a costs assessor under the Legal profession Act, 1987. This, of course, includes possible mediation under <case> of that Act. This is preferable to having the parties recommence proceedings in a Civil Claims
Court. One reason for so saying is that, at least up to a point, Mr Robinson's comment was correct, that the way this matter was approached before the learned Master, all possible evidence has already come out. Moreover, the
Master has made findings on issues which are now determined between the parties.

Of course, if the conditions are not complied with, the statutory demand will continue to stand.

I was initially of the view that [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208c.html) of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) would not enable that to be done. However, both counsel have now convinced me otherwise.

Accordingly, in proceedings 3408/97, I allow the appeal and set aside the orders made by the learned Master. In lieu of such orders, I order that the statutory demand be set aside conditionally on (a) the plaintiff paying $5,530 to the defendant no later than 15 April 1998, and (b) the plaintiff no later than 15 April 1998 submitting the four bills referred to in the Master's judgment to a costs assessor under the provisions of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).

The Appeal by Brancourts Nominees Pty Ltd 
As to the other appeal, the real question between the parties, although a number of other questions were raised which the learned Master disposed of favourably to the defendant, was whether the work done in the three bills the subject of the demand was really comprehended and subsumed in a fixed sum quote given by the solicitor to the client on 16 April 1997.

What appears to have happened is that the solicitor gave a fixed quote of $7,500 to do work. Unfortunately, there was no written retainer, so that the exact work that the solicitor was to do is not spelt out. Mr Robinson put forward submissions which seem to involve some revolving or ongoing retainer, which I must confess I found a bit hard to compare with the law of solicitor and client as expounded in the leading text books, but it may accord with what is happening in commercial life today. However, if solicitors do not, so far as their costs are concerned, comply strictly with the rules then the consumer protection provision of the legislation will mean they will be frustrated in recovering debts.

The costs agreement, if that be what it is, of 16 April 1997 listed certain work and then indicated that that work would lead to the registration of the prospectus and that if some of the complicated work was not done then the full amount of $7,500 would be rebated.

What appears to have happened is that the solicitor found that there were unexpected and extraordinary requirements made, which involved him in a great deal of extra work. When he appreciated this he sent what he calls a costs agreements of 30 April detailing what work he would need to do in addition to what was in his quote. There was some dispute as to when three letters were received, the solicitor saying early May, the client saying just before the statutory demands were received.

It would seem that this matter was resolved in favour of the solicitor by the learned Master. The learned Master, however, says that the assertion that the subsequent work came within the costs agreement of 16 April was no more than an assertion and that the assertion was not raised until somewhere between 30
June and 9 July. He said at p 39 of his judgment that such an assertion does not constitute evidence of a genuine dispute.

With respect to the learned Master, an assertion may and often will involve a sufficient indication of a genuine dispute. This will almost always be the case where the dispute is over the interpretation of documents and one can see that the matter is arguable. The court is not to deal with the question of arguments or construction, it is merely to see whether there is a genuine dispute because if the court goes further than that then one frustrates the whole purpose of [Part .4.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p5.4) 
The learned Master was also concerned that there was no immediate protest by
Mr Brancourt on behalf of the appellant. However, that is a matter that goes to resolving the dispute and not to the vital question as to whether a dispute genuinely exists, see the Jarena case at p 426. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that all that has to appear is that a genuine dispute exists, not that the alleged debtor has a substantial chance of succeeding in having the dispute resolved in its favour, Jarena at p 427.

In my view, there is sufficient here to show that there is a genuine dispute.
Again, here I will only give relief on condition that the real remaining question between the parties, namely the question as to what was within the retainer of 16 April 1997 be dealt with by a costs assessor or mediator.

Accordingly, the second appeal must be allowed and statutory demand set aside on conditions.

Thus in the Appeal in proceedings 3409/97, I order that the appeal be allowed and the orders of the Master set aside. In lieu of such orders, I order that the statutory demand be set aside conditionally upon the three bills, the subject of these proceedings, being submitted by the plaintiff to a costs assessor under the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) on or before 15 April, 1998.

There has been discussion on the question of costs, after I delivered the above reasons. Both counsel have submitted that it might well be appropriate for each party to bear its or his own costs both here and below. I agree. Thus
I order each party pay their own costs both before the Master and before me.
