TUESDAY 22 APRIL 2008  /07 DELREE JANE TYRELL versus IAN ARTHUR NANKERVIS /07 SHELLY ANNE HODGSON versus IAN ARTHUR NANKERVIS 
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT Before the court are two related matters seeking provision under the [Family Provision Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/). The question for resolution is whether there should be further valuations of two substantial rural properties before mediation takes place.
 The properties were valued for probate purposes. One was valued in October , the other in February 2007. One was valued at $3 M, the other at $2.5 M.
 In favour of the application it is argued that the parties should be fully informed of the value of the estate before they enter upon mediation.
 The submission to the contrary is that other valuations have been taken in the past, the present valuations are sufficient for the parties to appreciate the size of the estate with sufficient precision for the purpose of the mediation and the expense of taking further valuations is unwarranted.
 I tend to agree with the latter submission. It does not seem to me that there will be much difference between valuations taken now and the valuations taken out for probate purposes. What is significant and already established by the probate valuations is that the properties are substantial and their values are substantial. It seems to me that mediation can usefully take place on the basis of the probate valuations.
 I therefore reject the application.
