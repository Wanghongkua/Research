COURT OF APPEAL
KIRBY P(1) MAHONEY(2) AND MEAGHER(3) JJA
HRNG
SYDNEY #DATE 27:2:1995 #ADD 4:9:1995
ORDER
The order which I therefore propose, on the motion, is that the Court should give a certificate to Mr Robert
Reid in respect of the costs which were, pursuant to the [Suitors' Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html), ordered by the Court, differently constituted, in respect of the appeal. The costs of this motion should be costs of Mr Reid in the appeal which was formerly before the Court.
JUDGE1
KIRBY P:  On 21 September 1994 this Court allowed an appeal in proceedings between the Sydney City Council and Mr Robert Reid. For those proceedings, the
Court was constituted by Mahoney JA, Powell JA and myself The Court has been reconstituted for the motion which is presently before the Court.
The Sydney City Council which was the successful party in the appeal, and which has no interest in the motion now before us, has not appeared on the motion.

Mr Reid, who appears by his solicitor to support the motion, makes no objection to the reconstitution of the Court. There is no reason why, for the disposition of the motion, the Court must be constituted as it was for the hearing of the appeal. Cf Cotogno versus Lamb [(1985) 3 NSWLR 221 (CA)], 645f.
 
Appeal from GREAT succeeds on point of law
The appeal to this Court was allowed on a point of law. That was necessarily so because the only ground for an appeal to this Court from the
Government and Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal) was on a point of law. The point of law concerned whether Mr Reid, being an employee of a local authority under the Local Government
Act 1919 was employed "in the service of the Crown", or not. The Tribunal held that he was. This Court held that he was not. An application to the High Court of Australia for special leave to appeal from the orders of this Court was refused by that court.
Amongst the orders which this Court made was an order that the respondent pay the appellant's costs of the appeal and: "5. Reserve liberty to the parties to apply to the Tribunal or to this Court for any further or other relief provided such application is made within 28 days of these orders."
Within the time specified, Mr Reid applied to this Court for a further order, namely that the Court should provide a certificate under the [Suitors'
Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) (the Act). That Act permits the Court, in certain instances, to provide a certificate affording an indemnity to an unsuccessful party who has lost an appeal on a point of law. The relevant provision is <case>. It reads: "6(1) If an appeal against the decision of a court to the Supreme Court on a question of law or fact ...
 succeeds, the Supreme Court may, on application, grant to the respondent to the appeal or to any one or more of the several respondents to the appeal an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal".
The only question for decision now before us is whether the appeal of the
Sydney City Council from the Government and Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal was, "against the decision of a court".
 
Conflicting Practice as to grant of [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) certificates
Applications have been made in the past in analogous circumstances for a certificate under the Act. On some occasions certificates have been granted, apparently without argument before the Court. See, for example, Baldestowe v
Brown [(1990) 19 NSWLR 459 (CA)] at 64.
However, on other occasions, where the Court has allowed an appeal from the Government and Related Employees' Appeal
Tribunal, a question has been raised by members of the Court as to whether it was competent for this Court to provide a certificate in such a case. Thus Handley JA in Clarence v
Electricity Commission of New South Wales [(1990) 20 NSWLR 1 (CA)] at 14, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, considered that no such certificates might be available in such a case. The Court has been informed that the point now before us was not specifically argued in that case.
The reservation in
Clarence was followed without further comment in
Secretary of Department of Health versus Harvey [(1990) 34 IR 58 (CA)], 63, 64,
Director-General of the Department of Corrective Services versus Mitchelson [(1992) NSWLR 648 (CA)], 396.
However, these cases are scarcely determinative of the issue which is now before the Court. They proceeded on the basis that
Clarence should be followed and on an assumption which was not apparently the subject of express argument.
By this motion we are now called on to make a decision in respect of the issue.
 
Previous authority on the purposes of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/)
Although there is no clear determination of the point in the Court one way or the other, in the case of the Government and Related
Employees' Appeal
Tribunal, there is a determination in what, for most purposes, appears to be an analogous case. In Australian Postal
Commission versus Dao and Anor (No. 2) [(1986) 6 NSWLR 497 (CA)], the Court was concerned with an appeal from the Equal
Opportunity Tribunal. The question arose, an appeal having succeeded, whether this Court could provide a certificate under the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) treating that tribunal as a "court". The Court held that it could. Reasons were given on this point by me. Samuels JA at 514 concurred in my reasons.
In respect of the matter which is now before us, I said, at 512: "It is important to confine the determination of whether the tribunal is a "court" to the question here in issue under the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). It is unnecessary, and it would be unfortunate, to determine in this costs application the large question of whether the
Tribunal is a court for the purposes of the constitution and Federal legislation. Though those questions necessarily overlap with the issue involved here, the sole consideration before the court is whether the Tribunal is a "court" for the rather special and limited purposes of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). The Court was informed that in at least three cases certificates have been granted in respect of appeals from the Tribunal and, presumably, paid under the Act. It seems that it was done (although not recorded in the reported judgment) in
Boehringer
Ingelheim Pty Ltd versus Reddrop [(1984) 2 NSWLR 13] and
Tullamore Bowling and Citizens Club Limited versus Lander [(1984) 2
NSWLR 32], The issue of a certificate is formally recorded in the decision of the court in Director-General of Education versus Breen [(1982) 2 IR 93] at 109. However, it was conceded that in none of these cases was the question argued. In none were authorities placed before the Court.
 
A number of reported cases demonstrate that bodies not designated as or titled "courts" have been held to be such for the purposes of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) [s 6(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) Thus in Oidwai versus Brown [(1984) 1
NSWLR 100] at 102, Hutley JA in respect of an appeal from a decision of the Medical Disciplinary Tribunal held that the unsuccessful respondent to an appeal was entitled to a certificate under the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). Samuels and Priestley JJA agreed with his Honour's orders, although the issue would not seem to have been specifically argued
On the other hand, in Gosford Shire
Council versus Anthony George Pty Ltd (1969) 89 WN [(Pt 1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s1.html) 350 at Hardie J held that the Board of Subdivision Appeals was not a "court" for the purposes of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). He considered that the board functioning as an arbitral body to determine disputes between councils and landowners seeking subdivisional approval, was not a "court" for the purposes of the section. He referred to the Shell case and to Rola.
 
The Court sought the assistance of the Stale Attorney-General, as the Minister administering the Act and as the person most appropriately placed to speak in defence of the fund His submissions were confined to a reference to the practice which had developed of granting certificates in respect of appeals from the
Tribunal. But in the light of the Submissions advanced during the hearing of the substantive appeal, to the effect that the tribunal was a "court" for the purposes there under consideration, it is scarcely surprising that the Attorney-General should put no contrary submission to the Court, in the context of the [Suitors'
Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
 
The matter is not free from doubt. The issues have not been refined by contested argument. Practices which have been adopted, without argument, cannot determine the issue. Much more relevant is the history and purpose of the section (mentioned briefly in
Mir Bros), the trend of recent authority toward broadening the class of tribunals which may qualify as courts (see, e.g.
R v
Trade Practices Tribunal: Ex parte Tasmanian Breweries Pty Ltd <case>; [(1971) 123 CLR 361)] and the specific provision made in the [Anti-Discrimination Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/) for appeals from the Tribunal to the
Supreme Court on a question of law; see [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/), <case>. It would seem unlikely, given the history and purpose of the [Suitors' Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), the increase since its enactment in the number and kind of statutory tribunals and the relationship established between the Tribunal and the Supreme
Court, that appeals should lie on questions of law but not attract the protection of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) because the Tribunal is not a court. It is true that specific statutory provision is not made, as it was in the case of the
Workers' Compensation
Commission, to deem the tribunal to be a court. It is equally true that it would be desirable that a class of Tribunals, intended to attract the beneficial provisions of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). should be expressly catalogued so that it is not necessary to determine whether they are in law a court or not. However that may be, there is no express provision. Instead, the court must look to the nature of the body and in the context of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), seek to derive the legislative meaning."
I concluded that the Tribunal was, by its nature, a "court" for the purposes of the Act. I ordered that a certificate be granted.
McHugh JA who was the third member of the Court in Dao, reached a similar view. Of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), which his Honour described as remedial legislation", he said, at 515: "Remedial legislation should be given a beneficial construction.
In accord with that philosophy, the Supreme Court has given a liberal construction to the word "appeal" in the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). Thus an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law in a court of petty sessions is an "appeal" for the purpose of the Act: Ex parte Parsons: Re [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) [(1952) WN 380.] So is a case stated by a court of Quarter
Sessions in the Court of Criminal Appeal on a question of law arising out of a conviction in a court of petty sessions (Ex parte
Neville: Re Suitors' Fund Act 1951-1960 (1966) 85 WN (Pt)) 3 or a case stated by an arbitrator to the Supreme Court: Mir
Bros Developments Pty Ltd versus Atlantic Constructions Pty Ltd [(1985) NSWLR 491.] Even a reference from the Prothonotary, exercising delegated jurisdiction, to a judge in chambers is an "appeal" for the purpose of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/): Onions versus Government
Insurance Office of New South Wales [(1956) 73 WN 270.] The word "court" should likewise be given a liberal and beneficial construction to accord with the purpose and policy of the Act. The correct approach is for the court to ask itself whether, bearing in mind the general purpose of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), Parliament must be taken to have intended that the Tribunal should qualify as a court? I think that that question should be answered in the affirmative.

Whether the Tribunal is a "court "for purposes other than the Act is beside the point.
What matters for the purpose of the [Suitors'
Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) is that a body which determines rights and is presided over by a judge of the District Court has made an error of law which has been corrected on appeal to the Supreme Court of New
South Wales. To grant a certificate, at the request of the respondents, is to promote the purpose of the Act. To hold that the Tribunal is a "court" for the purpose of the Act contradicts no express or implied provision of the Act. The Court should, therefore, declare that the respondents are entitled to a certificate under the Act." 
Possible reasons for withholding a certificate
Two possible problems, one substantive and one procedural, present themselves as possible reasons to refrain from applying the reasoning in Dao in the case of the Government and Related Employees'
Appeal Tribunal. The first is that the Equal Opportunity Tribunal was, in the cases mentioned, constituted of a District Court judge, whereas that is not the case in the instance of the Government and Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal.
However, if the criteria which are laid down in Shell Company of
Australia Limited versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation [(1931) AC 275 (PC)] at 297 are applied to the Government and Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal it can be seen:
The Government and Related Employees'
Appeal Tribunal provides a final decision. See <case> of the Government and Related
Employees' Appeal Tribunal Act (the
Act);
The Tribunal may hear witnesses on oath (see <case> of the Act); . The Tribunal makes findings and final determinations between disputing parties in the proceedings;
The Tribunal gives decisions which affect the rights of subjects; and
An appeal to the Supreme Court is available from a decision of the Tribunal (see <case> of the Act).
There are many other indications in the Act which appear to assimilate the Tribunal's position of a court. The senior chairperson, although not in fact a judge, may by <case> of the Act, be a Supreme Court judge or Member of the
Industrial Relations Commission. The senior chairperson who determined the subject case was a judicial officer, namely Mr J.L. Lynn, a Local Court
Magistrate.
There are various further indicia that the Tribunal is a court. See, for example: s13 - as to the constitution of the Tribunal; s31 - as to arrangements for hearing of appeals; s 34 and following as to the hearing of appeals; s41 - as to votes of members; s44 - discovery of documents; s45 - administration of the oath.
s48(3) - decisions are final s54 - appeals to the Supreme Court on a point of law.
See also Schedule 1, clause 2, sub-clause 3 and clause 3.
Therefore, although the Government and Related
Employees' Appeal Tribunal is not constituted of a judge as such, it has many other relevant indicia which appear to assimilate it to the position of a court.
There is provision in [s 2(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s2.html) of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), in the definition of a "court", envisaging the prescription of tribunals or other bodies as courts. The Court was informed that no such prescription has been made in respect of the Government and Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal. This is the point which, in my view, argues most strongly against the assimilation of that
Tribunal to the position of a "court" for the purposes of the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). It would have been open to the Executive Government, under the Act of
Parliament, to have prescribed the Tribunal to be a "court".
Nevertheless, the ommission to do so cannot be fatal for the same could have been said in the case of the Equal Opportunity Tribunal in Dao. It did not prove fatal in Dao for that tribunal. Nor, for the same reasons, should it prove fatal in this case for this tribunal.
 
It is unnecessary to secure submissions from the Attorney-General
I said that there was a second reason which is procedural in character.
In Dao, the Court, in order to secure a contradicter, required that the applicant for a certificate give notice of the application to the
Attorney-General. The report shows that not only did the Attorney-General for
New South Wales intervene (for the purpose of responding to the Court's request) but also the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth also intervened and appeared on the motion.
In this case no notice has been given to the Attorney-General for New
South Wales. He would have a theoretical interest to protect the Fund. I have considered whether the motion should be adjourned to permit notice to be given. However, I think the Court can safely assume that the Attorney-General would, in respect of the Government and Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal, advance arguments similar to those which were advanced in Dao. Essentially, these were to the point that the matter should be determined by the Court.
Although it would have been possible for the Executive to remove the doubt which existed by reason of the failure to prescribe the Government and
Related Employees' Appeal Tribunal as a "court" for the purpose of the [Suitors' Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), I do not believe that that doubt is a substantial one.
To give effect to the purposes of the [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) it is appropriate that the Court should in this case follow its authority in Dao. It should make it clear in this case that the Government and Related Employees' Appeal
Tribunal is a "court" for the purpose of the [Suitors' Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
Upon that premise, it is competent for the Court to give Mr Reid the certificate which is sought under the Act on his behalf.
There are no reasons of a discretionary kind as to why such a certificate should not be granted.
There is every reason in this case why such a certificate should be granted.
Mr Reid won his case before the Tribunal. He lost it in this Court. He lost it on a point of law. The purpose of the Act is to protect a litigant in such a case.
 
Orders: certificate granted
The order which I therefore propose, on the motion, is that the Court should give a certificate to Mr Robert Reid in respect of the costs which were, pursuant to the [Suitors' Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html), ordered by the Court, differently constituted, in respect of the appeal. The costs of this motion should be costs of Mr Reid in the appeal which was formerly before the Court.
