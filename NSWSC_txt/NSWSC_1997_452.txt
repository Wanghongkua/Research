REGINA versus Kenneth John EYLES 
JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: This is a case stated by Taylor DCJ in the District Court pursuant to the provisions of s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act. Under s5B a judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on an appeal from a Local Court to the District Court. 
For reasons that will appear, it is at least doubtful that the first of the questions submitted, in the broad form in which the question is framed, arose on the appeal to the District Court.

The appellant, Kenneth John Eyles, originally came before a magistrate charged with three offences against [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s5.html) of the [Summary Offences Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/) . That section is in the following terms: "5: A person shall not, in or within view from a public place or a school, wilfully and obscenely expose his or her person." 
The offences were alleged to have occurred on 10, 13 and 17 February 1995 respectively.

The appellant was convicted in the Local Court in respect of each offence. He appealed to the District Court. Taylor DCJ, after hearing evidence and argument, decided that he would dismiss the appeal. He was requested to state a case under s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1833 and he complied with that request.

The facts giving rise to the charges against the appellant, as found by Taylor
DCJ, may be summarised as follows.

The appellant lives at an address at Sydney Street, St Marys. At the front of the house he occupies there is a grassed footpath, and a nature strip. There is a fence around the house consisting of wooden picket palings, with a space between each paling. There are some trees and shrubs in the front yard.

At about 8.35am on 10 February 1995 a Mr Golding, who also lives in Sydney
Street, was driving his truck in a southerly direction in that street. He saw a man standing behind the picket fence of the house occupied by the appellant.
There was an issue of identification in the case but Taylor DCJ was satisfied the man seen by Mr Golding on that occasion, and the other two occasions in question, was the appellant. Mr Golding observed that the man was wearing only a white T-shirt and was otherwise undressed. He saw the man acting in a manner which led him to conclude that the man was masturbating. He did not profess actually to see the man's penis or genital area. He rang the police and complained.

At about 7.00pm on Monday 13 February 1997, Mr Golding was driving in his car north along Sydney Street. Present in the car with him were his wife and three children. When he came to the premises occupied by the appellant he saw the same man as previously. This time the man was wearing a blue T-shirt and no other clothing. The man was also wearing a mask. He was standing in much the same place as he did on the first occasion. Once again, Mr Golding saw him moving one hand in a fashion which led Mr Golding to conclude he was masturbating. Mr Golding did not profess to see the man's penis or genital area.

Mrs Golding gave similar evidence. She said she could see that the man was naked from the waist down. She did not say she saw his penis or his genital area.

On Friday 17 February 1995, a similar incident occurred when Mr Golding was driving his truck in a southerly direction along Sydney Street. Mr Golding's evidence about that incident was much the same as the evidence he gave in relation to the first occasion.

In deciding to convict the appellant, Taylor DCJ concluded that it was not necessary that there should be evidence that anyone actually saw the penis or genital area of the appellant. He inferred that, because of the physical circumstances of the locality, and in particular because of the height and construction of the fence behind which the appellant was standing, the penis or genitals of the appellant could have been seen from a public place.

It appears that, in the course of argument before Taylor DCJ, there arose a disagreement between counsel as to the precise meaning of the word "person" in [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s5.html) of the [Summary Offences
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/). The precise relevance of that disagreement is unclear. The prosecution case against the appellant was that he wilfully and obscenely exposed his penis or genitals within view from a public place. There was no suggestion that there was anything obscene about his exposure or of any other part of his body. It was not suggested, for example, that he obscenely exposed his buttocks, or his legs. We were informed by counsel that, although Mrs Golding did not see the penis or genital area of the appellant, she said she saw part of his pubic hair. The legal argument about the meaning of "person" may have arisen because of a desire on the part of the prosecution to protect itself against the possibility that the judge should take the view that he could only convict the appellant on evidence that somebody actually saw the part of the body which was obscenely exposed. At all events, the prosecution submitted to Taylor DCJ that the word "person" in [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s5.html) means or includes any part of the male or female body so long as it was wilfully and obscenely exposed within view from a public place.

The questions submitted by Taylor DCJ were as follows: "1. What is the proper meaning of the word 'person' where appearing in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s5.html) of the [Summary Offences
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/)?
Is it required to be proved by the prosecution that the penis or genitalia of the appellant could be seen by anyone in a public place on each of the three occasions the subject of the informations?
On the facts found by me, could an appellant be lawfully convicted of the offence of which he stands charged?" 
The answer to the second of those questions is not in dispute in argument before this Court. Both the Crown Advocate and counsel for the appellant agree that the question should be answered in the affirmative. What is important, however, is that neither counsel submits that the success of the prosecution, as a matter of law, depended upon the availability of evidence that someone actually saw the penis or genital area of the appellant. The question is slightly ambiguous, and the affirmative answer must be understood in the light of that qualification.

There was no evidence that Mr and Mrs Golding saw the penis or genital area of the appellant. However, Taylor DCJ concluded, in the light of their evidence, and in the light of the evidence as to the surroundings in which the appellant was standing, that the appellant's penis and genital area could have been seen from a public place and that the appellant had wilfully and obscenely exposed his penis and genital area within view from a public place.

As far as the third question is concerned, I consider that it should be answered in the affirmative. On the facts found by the learned judge, which included the observations of Mr and Mrs Golding that the appellant was naked from the waist down, and having regard to the height and nature of the fence behind which he was standing, it was well open to his Honour to reach a conclusion adverse to the appellant.

I turn now to question 1. The history of the provision in question may be summarised as follows. Section 22 of the Sydney Police Act provided for an offence against decency by the exposure by any individual of "his or her person". Section 3 of the Vagrancy Ordinance 1835 made it an offence for a person wilfully and obscenely to expose his or her person in any street, road or public highway, or in view thereof or of any place of public resort. That offence was re-enacted subsequently and was later incorporated in the Police
Offences Act 1901 as s78. That legislation provided that: "Whosoever offends against decency by the exposure of his person in, or in the view of, any street or public place shall be liable to penalty." 
The reference to "his person", in the light of ordinary principles of statutory construction, preserved the gender neutrality of the offence.

The offence as stated by s78 of the Police Offences Act 1970 was replaced in the [Summary Offences
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/) by a separate offence. Section 11 of the [Summary Offences Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/soa1970189/) related to indecent exposure of one's person in or within view of a public place or school, whilst s12 provided for an offence of wilfully and obscenely exposing one's person in or within view of a public place or school. It was the fact of the exposure that was relevant to the commission of the offence under s11, whereas the manner of exposure was the essence of the offence under s12.
Section 11 was applied in the case of a female entertainer in Maloney v
Mercer [(1971) 2 NSWLR 207.] 
Section 12 of the [Summary Offences Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/soa1970189/) was replaced by s6 of the Offences in Public Places Act 1979 , which relevantly referred to exposure of "his or her person". The Offences in Public Places
Act 1988 was replaced by the [Summary Offences
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/soa1970189/). It is s5 of that legislation which is presently in question.

The history shows that the legislation in this State relating to obscene exposure has always applied both to male and to female persons. In that respect the legislation is different from the statute in question in Evans v
Ewels [[1972] 1 WLR 671], which was the Vagrancy Act 1824 of the United
Kingdom.

The United Kingdom Vagrancy Act made it an offence for someone obscenely to expose "his person with intent to insult any female". In Evans versus Ewels the
Queen's Bench Division construed that provision as applying only to males, and said that the word "person" was a genteel synonym for "penis". Plainly, it cannot be suggested that the word "person" in s5 of the [Summary Offences
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/soa1970189/) of New
South Wales is limited to "penis". The section in terms applies to females as well as males.

In the case of both males and females, the parts of the body which are capable of being employed for the purpose of obscene exposure are limited. The concepts of obscenity and exposure in a practical sense restrict the potential operation of the provision. There is a question as to whether there is any further restriction to be found in the word "person".

The Crown Advocate has submitted that there may be circumstances in which the exposure of the breasts of a woman is capable of being regarded as obscene, and that it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which the exposure of a person's buttocks could be obscene.

It is unnecessary and inappropriate to decide in the present case whether her submissions in that regard are correct. The jurisdiction which this Court is exercising is a jurisdiction confined to determining questions of law which arise in the case before the District Court. No question arises in the present case as to whether there are any circumstances in which the exposure by a female of breasts, or by a female or male of buttocks, could involve a contravention of s5. The prosecution case against the appellant was that he obscenely exposed his penis and other genitals. It is sufficient for resolution of the present case to say that this was capable of constituting exposure of "his person" for the purposes of the proceedings against him.

I would answer the questions submitted as follows:
It is unnecessary and inappropriate for the Court to decide the full extent of the meaning of the word "person" in s5 of the [Summary Offences
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/soa1970189/). It is sufficient for the disposition of the present case to say that it includes a man's penis and other genitals.
Yes.
Yes.

The matter should be remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law.
 
SULLY J: I agree.
 
BRUCE J: I agree.
 
GLEESON CJ: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.
