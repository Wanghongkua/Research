WEDNESDAY, 21 MAY 2003  /03 NEIL SINGLETON re ORIGINAL DISPLAYS (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED (DEREGISTERED COMPANY) (FORMERLY ACN 001 988 138)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application for an order under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) that one Adrian Douglas Cran, a former administrator and liquidator of the company, file an affidavit setting out certain information. There is a somewhat confusing description of the plaintiff. It would seem that the company is specified as the plaintiff. This is incorrect. However, Neil Singleton, whose name is also mentioned in that description, being the now liquidator of the company, is an eligible applicant for the purposes of [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597a.html)
I shall order an amendment of the originating process to make it plain that Mr
Singleton is the plaintiff.  At one stage I had some doubt as to whether various of the orders sought in the document by reference to which I now propose to make orders were justified by the section. However, a little consideration makes it plain to me that those orders are appropriate: see Duke Group Limited (in liq) versus The
Corporations Law (SA); Gerah Imports Pty Limited versus The Duke Group Limited (in liq) <case>; [(1994) 68 ALJR 196] per Dawson J at 198; 404; and see also Sherlock versus Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [(1996) 22 ACSR 16] at 17 - 18 per Mahoney P; Re Chircan Holdings <case> at <case> per
Barrett J. In the Duke Corporation case, Dawson J, sitting as a single
Justice of the High Court, made it plain in relation to a company's rights:  "... that an examination of those rights under the relevant provisions was not confined to their existence but extended to their expenditure and value.
Plainly, the latter are matters of considerable moment to the liquidator of a corporation in pursuing the assets of a corporation in an economical and efficient manner."  
It is for that reason that I have granted the orders as originally asked for.
The orders extend to revealing assets of Mr Cran into which moneys from the company may possibly be traced or which potentially may be called on to satisfy a judgment against Mr Cran, if one is ever obtained.
