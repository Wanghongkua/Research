Fine Real Estate Network Pty Ltd versus Howell /94 
Wednesday, 10 April 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Presently before the Court are (1) a notice of motion filed by the plaintiff on 4 April 1996 seeking a declaration that the defendant is guilty of contempt of the Court for failing to comply with an order made by Bryson J on 19 March 1996 and consequential orders, and (2) an application by the defendant under a notice of motion filed in its amended form on 10 April 1996 seeking a variation of Bryson J's orders of 19 March 1996.

I can state my views on the matters argued in fairly summary form. In my opinion the entry into a contract for sale of the property 27 Fern Street,
Randwick by the defendant on 26 March 1996 pursuant to the auction conducted on that date was clearly in breach of the injunction granted by Bryson J on 19
March 1996. However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was, on 26 March 1996, in fact aware that the entry into such a contract was in breach of that injunction although in the circumstances shown in the evidence any such lack of awareness demonstrates, at the very least, on his part a marked casualness of approach and on the part of his legal advisers, a similar casualness of approach in relation to advising him of the obligations arising under the orders made on 19 March 1996, which, in both cases, was capable of operating to the prejudice of the plaintiff to the extent that they contributed to the failure by the defendant to comply with those orders. I should add that the assertion in the letter of 29 March 1996 from the defendant's solicitors to the plaintiff's solicitors to the effect that the order of 19 March 1996 did not prohibit any such contract is quite clearly untenable.

In connection with the defendant's state of awareness or unawareness it is of some relevance to note that the plaintiff did not comply with the terms of
Part 42 rule 8(1) and (3) of the Supreme Court Rules which, if they had been complied with, would have effectively brought home to the defendant: the precise terms of the injunctions; the fact that any contract for sale of the property would be in breach of the injunction; and the fact that the defendant was at risk of severe sanctions for breach of the injunction.

I must add that in the defendant's favour are the circumstances that the forthcoming auction of the property, 27 Fern Street, was disclosed to the
Court on 19 March 1996 and also that on 28 March 1996 the fact of the sale having been effected on 26 March 1996 was disclosed both to the Court and to the plaintiff's representatives in connection with an attempt to file on that date an application to vary the relevant injunction. I do not, however, accept the submission that the plaintiff's failure immediately to proceed for alleged contempt evidences a waiver of the breach which had occurred or of any contempt proceedings associated therewith. Furthermore, there is no adequate explanation why the defendant's application was not in fact filed prior to the plaintiff's initiation of the present proceedings.

In all the circumstances I do not think it appropriate to impose any punitive sanction on the defendant but, as foreshadowed to counsel during argument, I do think it appropriate to order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the plaintiff's appplication on an indemnity basis. The Court must always be astute to protect the integrity of its own orders and parties who draw to the Court's attention clear breaches of those orders should ordinarily be indemnified in respect of the costs of doing so.

In response to what I have described as the casualness of approach by the defendant and by the defendant's advisers to the orders earlier made by the
Court I think it is appropriate, in addition, to secure the plaintiff's position to the extent intended by the orders of 19 March 1996 by ordering the imposition of a charge over the properties, 25 Fern Street, Randwick and 2
Vicar Street, Coogee with leave to the defendant to apply to terminate or vary that charge, the charge being expressed to secure payment to the plaintiff of any money found to be owing by the defendant to the plaintiff in these proceedings, and also to impose a restraint upon the defendant from increasing the indebtedness secured by the existing mortgages over the two properties to which I have referred.

So far as the defendant's application is concerned, I think in the circumstances it is appropriate to make an order to the effect of that sought in paragraph 1 of the defendant's amended notice of motion. In combination with the other orders which I have foreshadowed it seems to me that the course contemplated by that variation will not operate to the prejudice of the plaintiff and will at least terminate for the defendant some proportion of the liability for interest under the mortgage over the properties, 25 - 27 Fern
Street, Randwick.

The orders I make are these: 
On the plaintiff's notice of motion filed 4 April 1996:
Order that: the property known as 25 Fern Street, Randwick being part of the land comprised in Certificate of Title, vol 8398, folio 75; and the property known as 2 Vicar Street, Coogee being the land comprised in folio 1/80839 of the register; each stand charged in favour of the plaintiff with the payment of the monies, if any, found in these proceedings to be payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.
 Reserve liberty to the defendant to apply to terminate or vary either or both of the said charges.
 Order that the defendant be restrained from, by himself or his agents, increasing the principal amount secured by any existing mortgage over either of the abovementioned properties without the leave of the Court.
 Order that the defendant pay to the plaintiff its costs of the application on an indemnity basis.

On the defendant's notice of motion filed 4 April 1996 as amended on 10 April :
 Order that the orders made herein on 19 March 1996 shall not operate to preclude the payment to the registered mortgagee of the property known as 27
Fern Street, Randwick of the net proceeds of sale of the said property pursuant to the contract of sale dated 26 March 1996 between the defendant and
Marjorie Howell, as vendors, and Nigel Green, as purchaser.
 No order as to costs.
