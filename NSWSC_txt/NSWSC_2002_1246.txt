EQUITY DIVISION  
BARRETT J  
THURSDAY 19 DECEMBER 2002  /02 - ADRIAN STEWART DUNCAN & ANOR IN THEIR CAPACITY AS JOINT ADMINISTRATORS OF ENVIROSTAR ENERGY LTD (ADMINISTRATORS APPOINTED) & ORS  
JUDGMENT  On 22 October 2002 I made an order pursuant to [s.439A(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) of the [[Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) ](/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) extending, until 10 January 2003, the convening period for the second meeting of creditors of Envirostar Energy limited and its two subsidiaries, Green Energy Morwell Pty Ltd and Green
Energy Stapylton Pty Ltd. The administrators now seek to have the convening period further extended.  In support of that application there has been read the affidavit of Mr
Seaton, one of the administrators, sworn on 18 December 2002. He deposes to progress that has been made with attempts to obtain buyers for the business of the companies. It is clear that the administrators have done considerable work in this direction, that more than 50 expressions of interest were received, and that some five parties may properly be regarded at this stage as potential buyers.  There has been, however, a complication in that on 6 December Energy
Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd, which is the contractor for the supply and installation of electricity generating equipment for the group's two projects, was ordered by the Federal Court to be wound up in insolvency. That is a complication because the administrators now have to consider a number of issues relevant to the prospects of successful completion of the construction and commissioning projects which were not previously in question.  Having regard to the evidence and to the potentially more favourable outcome for all concerned if the present process directed towards sale as a going concern can be progressed to a point where some meaningful and concrete proposal can be put before creditors at the second meeting, I consider it appropriate that the convening period be further extended to the date the administrators seek, which is 21 February 2003. I note that it has been said from the bar table that even though such an extension may be granted, the administrators will still proceed diligently to convene the meeting at the earliest opportunity that is both prudent and practicable.  When the matter came before me this morning, it was on the basis that the further extension was sought under [s.439A(6).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html)
The application is now put on a different basis, that is, by reference to [s.447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) which is the provision creating a far ranging jurisdiction to make orders varying the way in which provisions of [Pt .3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) are to operate in relation to a particular company.  Mr Stack has taken me to the decision in Re Western National Earthmoving
Corporation Pty Ltd [(1997) 15 ACLC 1665], where an order of this very kind was made pursuant to [s.447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html); see also Re Ricon Constructions Pty Ltd [(1997) 43 NSWLR 174] and Re
Old Papa's Holdings Ltd <case>; [(2001) 24 WAR 229.] These cases support the application of [s.447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) in the way now sought. The first two cases were decided before the decision of the High Court in Australasian Memory Pty Ltd versus Brien [(2000) 200 CLR ]
but that decision, in which the broad operation of the section was confirmed, would only serve to underwrite the correctness of the earlier cases. This was recognised by Owen J in the Old Papa's case.  Mr Stack has also referred me to the form of order under [s.447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) made for like purposes and in like circumstances in relation to Ansett
Australia Ltd in Federal Court of Australia proceedings V3079/01. That form of order seems to me to be the correct form in a case of this kind, being an order pursuant to [s.447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) that [s.439A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) operates "as if the convening period was the period ending on" the date to which the extension is to be made.  I now make the orders in the minute of order which has been handed up and which I initial and date.
