RESULT: First question in the stated case answered yes 
The appellant was charged with smuggling a Mercedes-Benz motor vehicle into
Australia under [s233(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) of the [Customs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (Cth) (the Act); knowingly or recklessly making a statement to a customs officer which was false in a material particular under [s (1)(d)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html); and evasion of duty under [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html)
The charges were dismissed by a magistrate. The Comptroller appealed to the
District Court under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the Act. This involved proceedings under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) by way of a hearing de novo.

On a hearing de novo before Nash DCJ, no oral or other new evidence was adduced, but the transcript and the exhibits from the proceedings below were tendered. The judge found, on the basis of the transcript evidence, that the appellant had contrived a sham transaction in the UK in an attempt to fix a lower Customs value in Australia, and had knowingly made a statement to
Customs officials that was false in a material particular.

On a case stated to this Court four issues arose: (i) whether Nash DCJ was entitled to make findings adverse to the appellant's credit when the appellant did not give oral testimony before him; (ii) whether the UK Alsamead transaction was a sham; (iii) whether the charges could be proved beyond reasonable doubt in the absence of evidence as to the customs value of the vehicle, and (iv) whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the offence of evasion of duty or whether it established, at most, an attempt to evade.

HELD: 
On an appeal in the nature of a hearing de novo where the only evidence relied upon is transcript and documentary evidence from the proceedings below, in circumstances where the assessment of the appellant's credit is essential to a determination of guilt or innocence of the offences charged, the appellate judge must either adhere to the findings as to credit of the trial judge, call for fresh oral testimony or at least advise the parties of the possibility that adverse credit findings may be made, so as to enable the parties to determine whether oral evidence should be called or submissions made to the court.
 
Consideration of other issues raised in the stated case.
 
ORDERS
The Court answers the stated case as follows:
Was it an error of law for [the trial judge] to: "(a) make findings of consciousness of guilt and a sham transaction by rejecting the sworn testimony of Mr. Barendse upon the depositions? 
Answer: Yes make such a finding adverse to Mr Barendse upon the written depositions and upon the evidence in the appeal by the informant against acquittal at first instance? 
Answer: Yes 
Questions 2 to 6 unnecessary to answer 
JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: This is a case stated to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) .

Mr Barendse (the appellant) was charged with the following three offences against the [Customs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (Cth): that he did on about 3 July 1989, at Sydney, smuggle goods, namely one
Mercedes-Benz 560 SEC motor vehicle (the vehicle): [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html); that he, on or about 3 July 1989, in Sydney, knowingly or recklessly made a statement to an officer of customs that was false in a material particular in that he alleged that the customs value of the vehicle was stated as being $82,411.73, whereas the total customs value was $87, 863.60: [s (1)(d)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html); and that he did, on or about 3 July 1989, evade payment of customs duty of $2,317.05 which was payable in respect of the vehicle: [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) 
The charges were heard by a magistrate. On 15 April 1993, the magistrate dismissed each of the charges. The Comptroller-General of Customs instituted appeals against those dismissals pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). Those appeals were heard by Judge Nash in the Sydney District Court on 24 and 25
November 1994. The appeals were conducted by way of a "paper appeal". No fresh evidence, oral or otherwise, was adduced. The transcript of the Local
Court proceedings and the exhibits before that court were tendered by the
Comptroller-General. On 8 December 1994, Judge Nash found that each of the offences had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. At the appellant's request, a case was stated to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

Outline of Facts 
The material findings of fact, as stated by Nash DCJ in the stated case, are as follows. The paragraph references are those that appear in the stated case.
 
The appellant was a resident of the United Kingdom (UK) and held dual citizenship of the UK and Australia.

He had imported Mercedes-Benz motor vehicles on two previous occasions, on December 1985 and 24 April 1986.

Sometime in 1988, the appellant proposed to his father, who lived in
Victoria, that he should visit the UK and whilst there, travel to Europe and take delivery of a Mercedes-Benz car from Germany, make use of the vehicle whilst he was on his holiday, and take the car back to Australia where he would be able to sell it for profit and thus pay for the holiday.

The appellant ordered the car through Mercedes-Benz in the UK and paid a deposit of [sterling]6000 on 22 December 1988.

The initial order was for a 560 SEL Mercedes-Benz made to Australian specifications 
There were no specific arrangements between the appellant and his father as to payment, although the money was paid by the appellant and the vehicle was to be purchased by the appellant's father.

In January 1989 the appellant altered the order to a 560 SEC Mercedes-
Benz.

By letter dated 17 January 1989 addressed to the appellant's father at the appellant's address in the UK, Mercedes-Benz (UK) Ltd confirmed the type of vehicle being ordered.

The appellant's father subsequently advised the appellant that due to health problems he could not travel to the UK.

The appellant then contacted Mercedes-Benz to ascertain whether the order could be cancelled or whether he could purchase the vehicle himself and was informed that if the order was cancelled the deposit would be forfeited. He was also informed that the car could not be purchased by him because he was a resident of the UK, and a car made to Australian specifications could only be sold to a resident of Australia.

The appellant came to the conclusion that he should take ownership of the vehicle from his father and bring it to Australia in order to sell it, although he was concerned about the liability for customs duty and sales tax that he would incur in following this course.

In mid-February 1989, the appellant spoke by telephone to a Customs
Officer in Australia as to how it could be perceived that he was the owner of the vehicle. He was informed that a number of documents including an invoice, receipt for purchase of the vehicle in his name and registration and insurance documents would be required.

The appellant stated that he considered purchasing the vehicle from his father but stated that he did not believe that he could fulfil the customs requirements.

There was no evidence that the appellant asked Australian Customs about an arrangement whereby he would purchase the vehicle directly from his father, and there was no evidence that he actually purchased or acquired the vehicle from his father directly.

The appellant then contacted a director of Alsamead Ltd, a UK company, and entered into an arrangement whereby the vehicle would be transferred into his name in the UK at a price of [sterling]38,750, approximately [sterling]2,000 less than the invoice price. The arrangement was that the dealer would purchase the vehicle from the appellant's father and then sell it to the appellant for which the appellant would pay the dealer around [sterling]100.

The appellant claimed that the reduction in price reflected the depreciation of the vehicle from being a new vehicle to a second-hand vehicle, and that he discussed this reduction with the principal of Alsamead Ltd and also checked advertisements in the local press.

Alsamead was to be paid a fee of [sterling]100.

Subsequently, the appellant realised that the price of the vehicle was to be increased by 2280 Deutschemarks. However, the appellant did not alter the agreement with Alsamead.

The appellant obtained an authority from his father to collect the vehicle from Mercedes-Benz in Germany.

On 15 March 1989 the appellant paid the balance due to Mercedes-Benz for the vehicle. Although the appellant's father did not pay any of the money due on the vehicle, the appellant gave evidence that there were "loose family arrangements" to deal with the matter. The total sum paid by the appellant to
Mercedes-Benz for the purchase of the vehicle was the equivalent of
A$87,863.00.

On 17 March 1989 the appellant collected the car from Mercedes-Benz in
Germany and later travelled to the UK, arriving on 31 March 1989, and received a certificate of temporary importation of a private motor vehicle.

On 4 April 1989, a receipt was prepared by Alsamead recording "Received full and final payment for MB 560 SEC, invoice No. 1224, [sterling]38,750.
Registration number available on delivery", addressed to the appellant.

On 5 April 1989, the appellant wrote a cheque payable to a director of
Alsamead in the sum of [sterling]152, being the amount due for arranging the transaction and the registration of the vehicle in the appellant's name.

On 10 April 1989, the UK Department of Transport issued a temporary visiting vehicle registration card in respect of the car in the name of the appellant.

The appellant used the car infrequently for about a total of 900 kms and in mid-May 1989, arranged for shipment of the car to Australia at a cost of approximately [sterling]2000.

On 26 June 1989, the appellant signed an Australian Customs statement for a vehicle imported by a passenger, stating inter alia, that the vehicle was purchased on 4 April 1989 from Alsamead Limited, that he took delivery of it on 10 April 1989, that it was registered in his name on 10 April 1989 and that the total price paid, including deposit and extras and delivery, was [sterling]38,750.

On 28 June 1989, the appellant faxed a letter to this Customs Agents,
Ross Fehlberg Pty Limited, in respect of Customs clearance in Australia. This company had been contacted by the appellant's father for this purpose.

From an examination of the entry form prepared by the Customs Agents and the evidence of Mr Fehlberg, it seems that if a claim for depreciation is made for duty purposes then it would be made on the entry form, but there was nothing typed on the form relating to that aspect.

In mid-1989, the appellant shipped the vehicle to Australia. On 3 July , the appellant, through his Customs Agent, lodged documents with the
Australian Customs Service to effect clearance of the vehicle into Australia.
None of the documents provided to Customs revealed in any way that the car had been purchased from Mercedes-Benz.

The entry form prepared by the Customs Agents indicated that the valuation as at 18 May 1989 was [sterling]38,750, equivalent to $82,411.73, which was stated as the total Customs value, and that Customs duty and sales tax totalled $77,302.19 together with a charge of $10.30, making a total amount payable to Customs of $77,312.49.

On 13 July 1989, an interview took place between Officer Cole of the
Customs Service and the appellant, the effect of it being that the appellant said he purchased the car from Alsamead for [sterling]38,750 without VAT and with a concessional allowance ex factory; that the car was ordered from the factory by a person unknown to him, possibly a VIP who was given a discount, that the person sold the car to Alsamead which in turn sold it to him, and that he was out of the country skiing when the car was picked up from the factory. Officer Cole said that he required documents in respect of the ex- factory price and some other documents, to which the appellant replied "I could have some trouble getting the documents from the car consultant in
Britain because of the confidentiality between the previous owner and myself." Officer Cole advised him that Alsamead could fax the documents to him in confidence and that the documents would be destroyed.

On 14 July 1989, Mr O'Neill, a Customs Inspector, endorsed on the entry form a value for duty of [sterling]38,750 less 6% depreciation, making a total of [sterling]36,425 or $77,467.03. Mr O'Neill said that he had doubts about that value but his calculation was made based on the documents which had been presented.

Mr Merceica, a Customs agent employed by Ross Fehlberg Pty Limited calculated a claim for depreciation which reduced the price of [sterling]38,750 by 7% to an equivalent amount of $76,642.91, which had the effect of reducing Customs duty by $2,451.74 and sales tax by $2,959.40. Mr
Merceica did this because he was investigating the possibility of having a depreciation allowance made.

On 18 July 1989, Officer Cole telephoned the appellant to arrange a further interview and the appellant indicated that he was having difficulty obtaining the documents "as the person who purchased the vehicle was a prominent person, possibly a diplomat, who had used their position to purchase the vehicle and was not supposed to sell the vehicle". Officer Cole requested that the documents be faxed to him and the appellant indicated that he would see what he could do.

On 18 July 1989, the appellant requested a further interview which took place on 19 July 1989 in which the appellant presented to Officer Cole various documents, being exhibits 16-21. Those documents were: an authority from the appellant's father to the appellant to collect the
Mercedes-Benz on the father's behalf (exhibit 16); a letter dated 2 March 1989 from Mercedes-Benz to the appellant's father advising that the vehicle was scheduled for completion in mid-March and that the balance of the purchase price was due (exhibit 17); 
Mercedes-Benz sales invoice in respect of the vehicle addressed to the appellant's father (exhibit 18); 
Mercedes-Benz sales invoice in respect of an electrical heating system and the cost of factory collection and insurance (total invoice cost 2,280 deutschemarks) addressed to the appellant's father (exhibit 19); and 
Mercedes-Benz credit note in the sum of 1281 deutschemarks (exhibit 20).
 (No exhibit number 21 appears in the appeal papers and neither party referred to it).

In the interview on 19 July, the appellant indicated to Officer Cole that his father ordered the car from Australia through Mercedes-Benz, Piccadilly, UK for the price shown on the invoice in deutschemarks; that there was a credit note for insurance; that the appellant picked up the car from the factory and drove it to England where he sold the car on paper to Alsamead who, in turn, sold it back to him; that the fee paid to Alsamead was [sterling]100; that the appellant said that he needed to have the vehicle registered in his name so that he could claim customs depreciation for the time that he drove the vehicle around England prior to exporting it to Australia which was worked out at about 6%; that the vehicle was insured in England for the full retail price of [sterling]52,000 because, if it was involved in a serious accident and written off, British Customs duty and VAT would have to be paid.

In evidence, the appellant said of the information provided to Officer
Cole on 13 July 1989: Question: "Now, the information you gave there was not accurate, was it?" Answer: "I think they probably interpreted his questions [sic] rather more generally than he would have liked." And that he was "concerned at the time constraints I was under. There was only about a week after that when I was due to fly back to the UK. I was hoping to have the car cleared and registered whilst I was still here. I was concerned that that may add some confusion in the minds of Customs and that that could slow down the process of clearing the vehicle".

The appellant said in evidence that he regarded himself as having purchased the vehicle on 4 April 1989 because he would only be the owner when all documentation that Customs required was available, and referred to the telephone conversation he had with the Customs officer in February 1989.

On appeal, Nash DCJ found that: from the time the appellant decided to proceed with the purchase of the vehicle from Mercedes-Benz, and that he would pay for and take delivery of the vehicle, that he was the actual purchaser of the vehicle and was its owner from the time he paid the balance due for it on 15 March 1989; the Alsamead transaction was a complete sham and it was quite unnecessary for the car to be registered in the appellant's name, and that this could and should have been done by transferring registration into the name of the appellant from that of his father; the Alsamead transaction was arranged by the appellant in an attempt to fix a lower Customs value in Australia than he knew would apply if the true facts were made known to the Customs Service; the statement made in Exhibit 5 [the entry for home consumption], that the Customs value was $82,411.73, was false in a material particular and the appellant knew it to be false; the appellant knowingly and wrongly used the Alsamead price as the basis for duty calculation in the knowledge that this would result in a lesser sum of duty payable, and it was done with the intent to avoid payment of the additional duty which was in law payable; the appellant's statements to Officer Cole of the Customs Service on 13 and 18 July 1989 demonstrated a consciousness of guilt. The incorrect statements were deliberate, he knew that they related to a material issue as to the assessment of Customs duty, namely as to the price paid for the vehicle, when and from whom it was acquired, and as to the documentation in respect thereof; the appellant's motive for giving incorrect information to Officer Cole on 13 and 18 July 1989 was a realization that if the true position was known he would be liable for a greater sum of duty; the appellant acted in a way so as to induce Customs officers to believe that the supplier of the vehicle was Alsamead Limited and that the price of the vehicle was 38,750 Pounds and that he knew this to be false, and it was false in fact, and that he thereby intended Customs officers to assess Customs duty at a lesser sum than he knew would be payable if the true facts had been known; and 
Generally speaking [the trial judge] accepted the evidence of the appellant, particular relating to the proposed visit to him by his father which was cancelled because of ill-health. However, despite his evidence, [the trial judge] was satisfied that the Alsamead transaction was a complete sham and that it was quite unnecessary for the car to be registered in his name and that this could and should have been done by transferring registration into his name from his father.

Six questions (involving a number of sub-questions) have been stated to this
Court. We will refer to each question as and when we deal with it. The issues raised by those questions, in summary form, are: whether it was open to the trial judge to make findings adverse to the appellant's credit when the appellant did not give oral testimony before him; whether the charges could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt when there was no evidence of the customs value of the vehicle; whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the offence of evading the payment of customs duty or whether it established, at the most, an attempt to evade duty; and whether the Alsamead transaction was a sham.

Was it open to the trial judge to make findings adverse to the appellant's credit? 
This issue directly relates to the first question in the stated case:
Was it an error of law for [the trial judge] to "(a) make findings of consciousness of guilt and a sham transaction by rejecting the sworn testimony of Mr. Barendse upon the depositions? make such a finding adverse to Mr Barendse upon the written depositions and upon the evidence in the appeal by the informant against acquittal at first instance? 
The determination of this question and the issue which it raises involves in the first instance an understanding of the nature of the appeal in question.

Nature of appeals under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) 
The proceedings before Nash DCJ were appeals pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), which provides: "... an appeal shall lie from any conviction order for condemnation or order of dismissal to the Court and in the manner provided by the law of the State or Territory where such conviction or order is made for appeals from convictions or orders of dismissal, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of the State or Territory, an appeal shall lie from an order of dismissal to any court to which and in the manner in which an appeal lies from a conviction".

Division 4 of [Part
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/index.html#p5) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) provides for appeals to the District Court from a conviction by a Justice.
That Division therefore governs an appeal under <case>. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) provides for a right of appeal from convictions or orders of a magistrate and specifies time limits in which an appeal must be brought. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s125.html) specifies the powers of the Court on such appeal as follows: "125(1) The Court hearing any appeal under this Division shall determine the matter of every such appeal, and may adjourn the hearing thereof, and may by its order confirm, quash, set aside, vary, increase, or reduce, the conviction, order, sentence, or adjudication appealed against, or make such other order in the matter, and as to costs to be paid by either party, including the Crown, as to the Court seems just; and may in and by any such order, exercise any power which the Justice or Justices who made the conviction or order might have exercised, and any order so made shall have the same effect and shall be enforced in the same manner as if it had been made by such Justice or Justices." [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s126.html) permits the use of depositions taken before the magistrate if, relevantly to this case, the parties consent.
 
Both parties accepted that an appeal under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) (and therefore under <case>) was by way of a hearing de novo. The nature of a hearing de novo is well settled. In Builders Licensing Board versus Sperway
Constructions (Syd) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1976) 135 CLR 616], Mason J explained at 620 that in the appeal provided for by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) "even if it be the defendant who appeals, the informant or complainant starts again and has to make out his case and call his witnesses." 
Kirby P also dealt with the nature of an appeal under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) in Parker versus DPP [(1992) 28 NSWLR 282], stating at 291: "Although called an "appeal" the adjudication in proceedings brought pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) was one in which the hearing was conducted afresh. Such hearing was thus "a completely new trial of the charge"...[references excluded]. Subject to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s126.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) (which provides for the reading of the depositions of any witness called in the Local
Court if there is consent or, in certain other limited circumstances) such appeals proceed ... as a completely fresh hearing de novo. In such circumstances it was unremarkable ... that the new decision-maker would from time to time reach a view of the facts and circumstances proved on the second hearing, that has consequences more serious for the appellant than at the first." 
However, counsel for the appellant submitted that the consequences of such an appeal being a hearing de novo were modified by any direction of the court or any agreement between the parties as to how the appeal was to be conducted.
It followed, according to counsel's submission, that in either of these circumstances, a court hearing a [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) appeal was subject to the same limitations as apply to an appellate court hearing an appeal by way of rehearing: cf <case> of the Supreme Court Act ; Warren versus Coombes <case>; [(1979) 142 CLR 531.] It was submitted that in the present case, the consequence of the matter proceeding as a "paper appeal" was that there was an implied understanding which was binding on both parties and the judge, that the matter was to proceed as if an appeal by way of rehearing. The consequence of so proceeding was that the judge hearing the appeal under <case> was confined to the magistrate's findings of fact and any findings as to credit.

In the present case, the documents available to the Court do not reveal whether the matter proceeded as a "paper appeal" because of some arrangement between the parties or whether the depositions were admitted by consent under s 126. Counsel for the respondent submitted that the latter was the case and counsel for the appellant did not directly dispute this. This logically, would appear to be the case. Whatever be the position, we do not agree with the appellant's submission that the nature of the appeal under <case> (and thereby s 248) can be altered by a direction of the trial judge or by an agreement or understanding, express or implied, between the parties. Indeed, to put the matter that way misstates the matter. The question is not whether the nature of the appeal changes but whether, if <case> is utilised (or there is an agreement of the parties to like effect), the judge hearing the appeal is constrained in the findings which can be made. That question admits of an easy answer, where, for example, the parties expressly agree to certain facts or limit the issues argued on the appeal. If that happened, the judge hearing the s 122 appeal would be entitled (although not bound) to accept that as an appropriate procedure for the disposal of the appeal. If that procedure was adopted, the trial judge's fact finding would be constrained by the agreed facts and no question of credit would be involved in respect of those facts.
Likewise, if the parties had limited the appeal to a specified issue or issues, the orders made would depend upon and flow from the determination of that issue or those issues. That did not happen here. All that happened is that, apparently by consent and presumably pursuant to <case>, the matter proceeded on the basis of a tender of the transcript of evidence and the documents tendered in the original hearing without either party expressly directing attention to the issue of the appellant's credit.

The manner in which the appeal was conducted leads directly to the first question raised on the stated case. Before the Local Court, the appellant gave oral evidence and was cross examined. The trial judge relied upon three answers given by the appellant in cross examination to come to his finding in paragraph (oo) of the stated case that the Alsamead transaction was arranged in an attempt to fix a lower customs value than would be the case if the "true facts" were made known. Those questions and answers were: "Q. And you knew by revealing to customs the Thirty eight thousand seven fifty, you would necessarily pay a lesser amount of duty in Australia than if you told them the amount you paid Mercedes Benz, didn't you? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. When you sent those documents to Fehlbergs, you intended did you not that the duty that would be paid in Australia, whatever form of duty it was, would be assessed on the basis of the Alsamead invoice and the Alsamead receipt? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Now the Alsamead receipt, Mr Barendse, states on its face, `Received full and final payment for Mercedes Benz' and has the pounds figure `Received full and final payment for Mercedes Benz 560 SEC Thirty eight seven fifty'. That's what it states on its face? 
A. Yes." 
His Honour further found (para (rr)) that the appellant's statements to the customs officer on 13 and 18 July (see paras (ee) and (hh)) demonstrated a consciousness of guilt and that although, "generally speaking", he accepted the evidence of the appellant, he was satisfied the Alsamead transaction was a sham (para vv). These findings involved a rejection of the appellant's evidence (para kk) whereby he explained why he had given false information as to the previous owner of the vehicle.

Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant's evidence could not be rejected so as to enable the trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to his guilt. This submission had, as its premise, counsel's original submission that Nash DCJ was constrained to act as if the matter was an appeal by way of rehearing. Whilst we have rejected that premise, the question remains whether his Honour erred in law in making findings of consciousness of guilt and a sham transaction by rejecting the appellant's evidence on the depositions. That issue raises, in the first instance, a matter which is central to the task of judicial fact finding - namely the assessment of a witness's credit. This topic has been the subject of recent judicial dissertation in the context of an appellate court's function in respect of findings of fact made by a trial judge: see Brunskill versus Sovereign Marine & General Insurance Co <case>; [(1985) 59 ALJR 842]; Jones versus Hyde <case>; [(1989) 63 ALJR 349] at 351; Abalos versus Australian Postal Commission <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 167] at 179; Devries versus Australian National Railways Commission [(1993) 177 CLR 479.] Those cases emphasise the advantage which a trial judge has in hearing and observing a witness and the subtle effect which a witness's demeanour may have on the determination of that witness's credit: see Jones v
Hyde per McHugh J at 351; Abalos per McHugh J at 179. In Galea versus Galea [(1990) 19 NSWLR 263], Kirby A-CJ at 266 described the trial judge's advantage in these terms: "The trial judge has advantages which simply cannot be provided to an appellate court. . .He or she is aware of interruptions, hesitations and delays in the giving of testimony which will generally be quite unknown to the appellate court. The judge at the trial will be able to observe the body language of the witnesses that can sometimes be important for interpreting communication. This is usually unrecorded in the cold page of an appeal book.
These and other reasons have led to the conventional theory, accepted by the courts of this country and of England, that a trial judge has marked advantages in the assessment of the credibility of witnesses which an appellate court, prisoner of the transcript, can rarely match." 
However, the advantage is not absolute. It is undermined and liable to be displaced if the trial judge has "failed to use or has palpably misused [that] advantage": see Brunskill; Jones versus Hyde; Abalos; and Devries; or if the findings of fact based on a witness's evidence are demonstrated to be inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence: S.S.
Hontestroom versus S.S. Sagaporack [[1927] AC 37] at 47; or such findings of fact are glaringly improbable; Brunskill at 844. The effect of these authorities is that an appellate court is bound by the findings of credit of the primary judge unless the circumstances to which we have just referred apply. The same principles operate in the case of a court hearing an appeal but in the exercise of its original jurisdiction: see Charles v
Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1954) 90 CLR 598] at 610; McCormack versus Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) <case>; [(1979) 53 ALJR 436] at 442; Uranerz (Aust) Pty Ltd versus Hale [54 ALJR 378] at 381.

In the present case, the trial judge's task was to determine the matter afresh, that is as a hearing de novo. He was required to make findings of fact and to determine whether the appellant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged. It is apparent, both from the guilty verdicts and the questions in the stated case that his Honour approached both those aspects of his task by assessing the appellant's credibility. He did so without the benefit of hearing the appellant give evidence. Clearly, his Honour took the view that the appellant's explanation was so improbable that it was a lie. The question arises whether that assessment could be made without the benefit of hearing and seeing the appellant in the witness box. A similar problem arose in McCormack versus Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1979) 53 ALJR 436.] In that case the taxpayer challenged the Commissioner's assessment to tax the profit made upon the resale of certain land. That challenge was referred to the Board of Review from which an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court and then to the Full Court of the Federal Court. The appeal to the Supreme Court involved an exercise of the Court's original jurisdiction. Subject to an exception which is not relevant, no oral evidence was taken in either the Supreme Court or Full Court of the Federal Court, those courts relying upon the transcript of evidence before the Board of
Review. The Board of Review had rejected the taxpayer's evidence. It had done so because of a misapprehension of other evidence as to the rezoning of land and of the effect on the consequent value of the subject land. The Board had not made any finding as to the taxpayer's credibility. However, once the zoning evidence was properly understood, the taxpayer's evidence as to the purpose for which the land was acquired was of vital importance. An assessment of her credit was integral to the overall assessment of her evidence. The High
Court held that the Supreme Court was wrong in proceeding as it did without the benefit of hearing the witnesses. Barwick CJ said at 439: "It was for the Supreme Court. . .itself to decide whether the appellant and her husband were witnesses of truth, and whether or not upon all the evidence an inference of the requisite purpose (of the acquisition of the property) should be drawn." 
His Honour concluded at 440 that the Supreme Court: ". . .ought to have insisted on hearing the evidence itself and thus placed itself in a position to evaluate the witnesses." 
Gibbs J (with whom Stephen J agreed) and Jacobs J were of the same view.

The need for the primary finder of fact to hear and evaluate the evidence of witnesses was the subject of further comment by the High Court in Stead v
State Government Insurance Commission <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 141] at 146: "At the trial the critical question on the issue of causation was whether Dr
Scanlon's testimony should have been accepted in preference to the appellant's expert witnesses, notably Dr Donsworth. It was an issue pre-eminently suitable for determination by the primary judge who had an advantage over the Full
Court in seeing and assessing the witnesses. We do not see how the Full Court, denied the important advantage of seeing and assessing the witnesses, could satisfactorily conclude that had the appellant's counsel been given a reasonable opportunity to present submissions on the issue, it could have made no possible difference to the result." 
In the context of that error, the Court adopted the following statement of the
English Court of Appeal in Jones versus National Coal Board <case>; [[1957] QB 55] at 67: "There is one thing to which everyone in this country is entitled, and that is a fair trial at which he can put his case properly before the judge. . .
.No cause is lost until the judge has found it so; and he cannot find it without a fair trial, nor can we affirm it." 
Similar issues have arisen in respect of a review by the Compensation Court of
New South Wales from a decision of Commissioner: <case> Compensation Court Act . A <case> review is not a hearing de novo: see Watson versus Hanimex
Colour Services Pty Limited [8 NSWLR 190]; Cockatoo Dockyard Pty
Limited versus Atamian, unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 11 August - an immediate point of distinction with a <case> appeal. Notwithstanding that the <case> review is not a hearing de novo, the Compensation Court may proceed with a complete rehearing of the evidence in which case it is entitled to make its own findings of credit. If, however, the review proceeds on the written record of the proceedings before the Commissioner, the Compensation
Court is bound by the principles in Abalos: Australian Gas Light Company v
Samuels, unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 4 November 1993;
Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Limited versus Atamian, unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 11 August 1995.

Against the background of these principles, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that, by analogy, Parker versus DPP applied to this case. In Parker,
Kirby P, with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed, stated at 296: 
Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view".

Parker involved an accused person's appeal against sentence under <case>.
Kirby P held that the trial judge was obliged to inform an accused if contemplating an increased sentence from that imposed by the magistrate, in order to afford natural justice. This was so notwithstanding that the District
Court judge had power under <case> to increase the severity of the sentence.
Kirby P identified the requirement to afford natural justice in such circumstances as being based on the principle of double-jeopardy: see Neal v
R <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 305] at 388 ff; 476 ff. One reason why the court is required to give notice in such a case is to enable the accused to withdraw the appeal. Notice is not required, of course, in the case of a Crown appeal against sentence: see 131AB of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), as the essence of such an appeal is that the Crown is seeking an increase in the sentence and the accused has no ability to withdraw the appeal. Likewise, in an appeal against acquittal, the principle of double jeopardy cannot activate principles of natural justice in the sense that their application was discussed in Parker. That does not mean, of course, that the principles of natural justice do not apply. Rather, the content of those rules must vary, their content always depending upon the circumstances of each case, including the statutory provisions which may control or affect the particular matter: see generally Kioa versus West <case>; [(1985) 159 CLR 550] per Deane J at 633.

Before dealing with the appellant's submissions on this issue, reference should be made to the decision of this Court in Superintendent of Licenses v
Ainsworth Nominees Pty Ltd [(1987) 9 NSWLR 691.] That case involved an appeal to the Full Bench of the Licensing Court. Such an appeal was by way of a hearing de novo. The Licensing Court magistrate had formed a favourable view of the credit of Mr Ainsworth, the principal of the respondent company which was seeking a licence. Before the Full Bench, the matter proceeded by way of the tender of the transcript of evidence before the
Licensing Court together with the evidence tendered in the court below and additional evidence not previously tendered.

The Full Bench, on the appeal by way of a hearing de novo did not, given the additional material, accept the licensing magistrate's findings.

On appeal to the Supreme Court, Yeldham J held that the Full Bench had erred.
He stated: "Having regard to the manner in which the appeal was conducted, and to the lack of any relevant additional evidence which would affect the conclusions of
Mr Hammond as to Mr Ainsworth's credibility, I am of the opinion that, conformably with principle, the Full Bench erred in taking a markedly different view in some respects of Mr Ainsworth's credibility from that taken by Mr Hammond." 
On appeal to this Court, Kirby P and Samuels JA, whilst acknowledging the correctness of the principle stated by Yeldham J, considered that it did not apply in circumstances where important additional evidence was tendered to the
Full Bench which affected the conclusions of the licensing magistrate as to Mr
Ainsworth's credit.

Ainsworth Nominees is, of course, distinguishable from this case, as here there was no additional evidence called by either party. The majority in
Ainsworth accepted that in those circumstances, the Court hearing the appeal, including an appeal by way of a hearing de novo, was bound by findings of credit made by the Court below.

Mahoney JA did not draw the same distinction as did Kirby P and Samuels JA between a case where no additional evidence was tendered and one where there was additional evidence. Recognising that to that extent, his Honour dissented in the case, his judgment at 707-708 contains a useful statement as to the principles which apply on an appeal by way of hearing de novo: "Where the evidence before a court which must make findings of fact is in the form of a transcript of evidence previously given, experience shows that certain problems are apt to arise and should be provided for. . . .It should be made clear whether, in determining issues of primary fact, the appellate tribunal is to have regard, and if so what, to the position of advantage that the tribunal of first instance had in assessing the demeanour and credibility of the witnesses and generally what use is to be had of the position of advantage, in the conventional sense, of that tribunal. In addition, where matters of inference from established primary facts may be in question, the parties should make clear whether the appellate tribunal is to be, as conventionally it is, in as good a position as the primary tribunal in respect of those inferences or conclusions: see generally Edwards versus Bairstow <case>; [[1956]
AC 14] at -36.
. .
 
But where the findings to be made by the appellate court, either as intermediate findings or final findings, involve that it find intention, purpose, honesty and the like, the specification of matters of this kind is, in my opinion, of particular importance. Where the issue is the purpose with which a person did certain things and that purpose is agreed to be drawn from his admitted statements and what he did, the parties may legitimately agree that the appellate court draw the appropriate inference from a transcript of evidence and the appellate court may properly accept the procedure proposed by the parties. On the other hand, if a party questions the acceptability of what the person said as to his purpose, then the acceptability of him as a witness is an issue on the appeal. That may be affected by, for example, his demeanour before the court, his general credibility, or the like. A procedure involving merely the tender of a written document should not normally be approved by the appellate court.
. .
 
In the present case the parties did not specify in terms what was their agreement in relation to matters of this kind. It was clear that the issues for the Full Bench involved matters affected by the credibility to be given to
Mr Ainsworth as a witness and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence as a whole as to matters such as honesty, fitness and the like. In these circumstances, it was, in my opinion, at the least not open to the Full Bench to make findings as to the credibility of Mr Ainsworth as a witness contrary to those made by Mr Hammond, except for reasons to which I have referred." 
The reasons to which his Honour referred were the limited circumstances in which the appellate court is not bound by the trial judge's findings as to credit: Abalos; Devries.

As we have said, it is implicit in an appeal against acquittal that the
Comptroller is seeking a conviction. Had this matter proceeded by way of a fresh hearing in the sense of all the evidence being heard again, the District
Court judge could clearly have made adverse findings of credit against the appellant. Senior counsel submitted that, where, as here the matter proceeded by way of a "paper appeal", if the judge was considering making a finding of credit adverse to the finding of the magistrate, then as a matter of natural justice, he was required to warn the party against whom such finding may possibly be made. In support of this submission, senior counsel for the appellant further submitted that in the appeal hearing before Nash DCJ, the appellant's credit was not raised as an issue. Counsel for the respondent did not dispute this, except to the extent that he pointed out that the magistrate's reasons were not before the trial judge and it was not known whether the magistrate accepted the appellant's evidence. He submitted that the acquittal could have been based on a question of law. Whilst this is so, it is strictly irrelevant to the issue. The issue is first, whether the trial judge was entitled to make the adverse findings of credit which he did or alternatively, whether he should have warned the appellant that he was, in the words of the stated case, considering making "findings of consciousness of guilt and a sham transaction by rejecting [the appellant's] sworn testimony upon the depositions" and the making of "such a finding adverse to [the appellant] upon the written depositions and the evidence in the appeal. . .".

It is apparent from the stated case that the assessment of the appellant's credit was essential to Nash DCJ's determination that the appellant was guilty of the charges against him. However, the parties had consented to the matter proceeding on the depositions. In our opinion that involved one of two consequences. Either the matter was required to be determined on the basis that there was no credit issue or Nash DCJ was bound by the findings of credit of the magistrate. However, as the decision of the magistrate was not before
Nash DCJ and therefore the magistrate's findings as to credit were not known, he was required to proceed on the former basis. This is so, even though the parties apparently assented to that course: see McCormack; Ainsworth
Nominees Pty Ltd. Whilst our preferred view is as stated, it may be that had
Nash DCJ informed the parties that there was a possibility that he would make adverse findings as to credit, so as to enable the parties to determine whether oral evidence should be called and also to make appropriate submissions to the court in respect of the credit issue the Court may not have interferred: see Stead. However, his Honour's failure to take any of these courses, means that the appellant did not get the fair trial to which he was entitled: Jones versus National Coal Board, and was thus denied natural justice.
The magistrate thus erred in law: Escobar versus Spindaleri & Anor [(1986) 7
NSWLR 51.] We should add that in Ainsworth Nominees Pty Ltd, Mahoney
JA did not identify the error as a breach of natural justice but held that the
Full Bench's failure involved an error of law for failing to follow the principles to which he had referred.

Once it is accepted that the trial judge erred in making findings of consciousness of guilt and a sham transaction by rejecting the sworn testimony of the appellant, based upon the depositions, and that the appellant is entitled to relief, the questions raised in the remainder of the stated case become irrelevant. However, as the other issues to which we have referred earlier were argued in full, it is appropriate to make some reference to them.
Before doing so, we feel obliged to comment that we regard the case to have been stated with unnecessary prolixity and at times confusion. It should have been clear from the formulation of the first question that the answer to it would affect the remainder of the questions. Notwithstanding that, the case was not stated in the alternative as, at the least, it should have been. On occasions double barrelled questions have been asked, such that had the Court considered it necessary to deal with the stated case in full, the court would have been placed in some difficulty. The case was signed on 3 August 1995.
Since then, the judgment of this Court in Comptroller-General of Customs v
D'Aguino Bros Pty Limited [(1996) 135 AR 649] has been delivered. As Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Ireland and Dowd JJ agreed) stated: "The procedure provided by [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) is intended to permit the District Court judge to obtain advice from this Court upon questions of law which will assist that judge in determining the fate of the appeal to that Court pursuant to the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). The procedure is not intended to provide a means of challenging the ultimate determination made (or to be made) by the judge upon that appeal to the
District Court, as there is no right of appeal to this court from that determination. The question asked here is in form no more than an attempt to exercise such a right of appeal. It is for that reason that this Court has said, and often repeated, that it is necessary for the particular question or requestions of law upon which advice is sought to be specifically stated." 
We consider that this case goes beyond the purpose of the <case> procedure.

Sham 
A transaction is a sham, for legal purposes if there are: ". . . acts done or documents executed by the parties to the "sham" which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing, I think, is clear in legal principle, morality and the authorities (see Yorkshire Railway Wagon Co versus Maclure [(1882) 21 Ch.D ],
CA and Stoneleigh Finance Ltd versus Phillips [[1965] 2 QB 537)], that for acts or documents to be a "sham", with whatever legal consequences follow from this, all the parties thereto must have a common intention that the acts or documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating. No unexpressed intentions of a "shammer" affect the rights of a party whom he deceived: See Snook versus London & West Riding
Investments Ltd <case>; [(1988) 18 FCR 449]; [(1988) 82 ALR 530] where
Lockhart J stated at 454; 537: "A `sham' is . . . for the purposes of Australian law, something that is intended to be mistaken for something else or that is not really what it purports to be. It is a spurious imitation, a counterfeit, a disguise or a false front. It is not genuine or true, but something made in imitation of something else or made to appear to be something which it is not. It is something which is false or deceptive." 
In order to determine whether a transaction is a sham, it is necessary to ascertain the true intention of the parties: see Sharrment per Beaumont J at ; 550. That intention may be determined by direct evidence or by inference from the circumstances of the transaction: Sharrment per Lockhart J at 457;
The fact that parties may have an ulterior motive in entering into a transaction, it is not of itself evidence of a sham: Miles versus Bull [[1969] QB ] per
Megarry J; Sharrment at 455; 538. However, a finding of an ulterior motive is relevant to the question whether the intention of the parties was that the transaction be a sham: Re La Rosa; Ex Parte Norgard versus Rocom Pty Ltd [(1990) ALR 571] per French J at 581. Nor is evidence of artificiality:
Littlewoods Mail Order Stores Ltd versus Inland Revenue Commissioners [[1963] AC ]; or complexity: Coppleson versus FCT [(1981) 34 ALR 377]; determinative of sham: see generally, Sharrment at 454-455; 537.

It is thus necessary to consider the details of the transaction. The starting point is the purchase of the vehicle from Mercedes-Benz. Initially the intended purchaser was Mr Barendse Snr and the order was placed in his name.
All correspondence from Mercedes-Benz was directed to Mr Barendse Snr. In our opinion, the evidence indicates that Mr Barendse Snr was the purchaser, notwithstanding that the appellant was always to make the payment of the purchase price to Mercedes-Benz. When Mr Barendse Snr could not travel to the
United Kingdom, the appellant sought to purchase the vehicle himself.
Mercedes-Benz rejected a purchase by the appellant and advised that if the purchase did not proceed, the deposit would be forfeited. Faced with these two alternatives, the appellant decided to "take ownership of the vehicle from his father". Presumably, by this finding, the trial judge meant that the appellant decided he would acquire the vehicle from his father, although the trial judge subsequently found that there was no evidence that the appellant actually purchased or acquired the vehicle from his father directly. His
Honour found, as was clear from the documentary evidence, that the appellant obtained an authority from his father to collect the vehicle from Mercedes-
Benz and that the appellant paid the purchase price. His Honour referred, however, to evidence of "loose family arrangements" in respect of payment for the vehicle.

The appellant arrived in the UK with the car on 31 March 1989 and was issued with a certificate of temporary importation.

The direct arrangement with Alsamead was found by the trial judge to be that: ""[Alsamead] would purchase the vehicle from [the appellant's] father and then sell it to [the appellant] for which [the appellant] would pay [Alsamead] around 100 pounds".
 
The only documentation relating to the Alsamead transaction was: an invoice dated 22 February 1989 in an amount of [sterling]38,750 (including [sterling]500 for export registration, plates and pre-delivery preparations); and a receipt dated 4 April 1989 for full and final payment in the sum of [sterling]38,750.

There were no documents relating to a sale from Mr Barendse Snr to Alsamead.

On 5 April 1989, the appellant paid the sum of [sterling]152 by cheque to
Alsamead being the amount due for arranging the transaction and registration in his name. There was no evidence of any other payment either from Alsamead to Mr Barendse Snr or the appellant to Alsamead. This was to be expected, as the appellant himself stated, that it was a sale "on paper" (see para (ii) of the stated case). In our opinion, the only inference which could be drawn from the evidence was that there was no payment of money other than the [sterling]152. The vehicle was registered in the United Kingdom in the appellant's name as a "temporary visiting vehicle" on 10 April 1989.

It can be seen from the foregoing, first, that Mercedes-Benz treated Mr
Barendse Snr as the purchaser of the vehicle and Mr Barendse Snr did not expressly terminate the purchase agreement but facilitated the collection of the vehicle by the appellant. Secondly, there was no evidence that the appellant purchased or acquired the vehicle from his father. Thirdly, there was no evidence of the intention of Alsamead in respect of the transaction.
Fourthly, there was no evidence as to whether Mr Barendse Snr intended to sell the car to Alsamead. Fifthly, the appellant considered that he purchased the vehicle only at the point that Alsamead issued its receipt "because he would only be the owner when all documentation customs required was available [(namely, an invoice and receipt, registration and insurance)]".

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there was evidence upon which it could be found that the Alsamead transaction was a sham, or perhaps more correctly was a non- transaction, that is, there was no purchase from Mr Barendse and no sale to the appellant. This is particularly so, given the appellant's evidence that there was a sale "on paper" and the terms of the receipt, which stated that there had been full and final payment. However, the trial judge's findings exhibit some confusion as to the proper principles to apply. In particular, his Honour's finding (para o) that "the arrangement was that [Alsamead] would purchase the vehicle from [the appellant's] father and then sell it to [the appellant] for which [the appellant] would pay [Alsamead] around [sterling]100" does not sit easily with a finding that there was no such transaction implicit in his finding of a sham. His Honour did not make any finding that that arrangement did not proceed, or was never intended to be the arrangement, although his finding that the transaction was a sham may involve a finding that the arrangement about which he made this finding did not represent the true intentions of Mr Barendse Snr, the appellant and Alsamead that there be a sale and purchase. His Honour's further finding at (uu) that "it was quite unnecessary for the car to be registered in his name and that this could and should have been done by transferring registration into his name from his father", also demonstrates an approach to this transaction which makes it doubtful whether his Honour applied the correct principle of law in determining whether or not the transaction was a sham and whether or not, each of the offences with which the appellant had been charged had been proved. We make these comments in passing because as we have already stated, there was evidence upon which his Honour was entitled to hold, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Alsamead transaction was a sham.
 
Customs value 
Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no evidence of the customs value of the vehicle and thus there was insufficient evidence to prove each of the three charges. Counsel for the respondent submitted that it was not necessary to prove the customs value of the vehicle as that was not an ingredient of any of the three charges. He further submitted that, in any event, the customs value of the vehicle was its "transaction value", a term defined in the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). The transaction value of the vehicle, so counsel for the respondent submitted, was the purchase price in the original transaction between Mercedes-Benz and Mr
Barendse Snr. This value was the value upon which Nash DCJ based his findings that each of the three charges had been proved. Counsel for the appellant submitted, however, that because the finding of a sham transaction could not be sustained, the basis upon which Nash DCJ determined the customs value of the goods failed. In other words, the Alsamead price was the true value of the goods. It followed, on this submission, that for the charges to have been proved, it was necessary for the respondent to prove the customs value of the goods. It was only if that was proved, and it was established that that value was different from the Alsamead price, could the prosecution make out its case.

This submission has the immediate difficulty that we have found that there was evidence upon which Nash DCJ could find that the Alsamead transaction was a sham. However, that finding does not conclude the matter. Although counsel for the respondent submitted that customs value was not an ingredient of any of the three offences, the stated case is formulated in a way which indicates that the trial judge considered that each of the charges had been proved because the appellant had declared the Alsamead price as the value of the goods for duty purposes whereas its customs value was the Mercedes-Benz price.
We shall proceed on the assumption, therefore, in the first instance, that the customs value of the goods must be proved. Was there evidence of the customs value of the vehicle before the Court? [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/s13.html) of the [Customs Tariff Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/) provides: "The value of any goods for the purposes of this Act is . . . the customs value of the goods ascertained or determined in accordance with Division 2 of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/index.html#p8) of the [Customs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)" 
The liability to pay duty on goods is imposed by <case> [Customs Tariff Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/).

Division 2 of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cta1987178/index.html#p8) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) provides a scheme for ascertaining or determining the customs value of goods. Prima facie, the customs value of goods is the value of those goods: [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html)
However, if the "transaction value" of goods can be determined by the
Collector, that value is their customs value: [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html) "Transaction value" is the value of goods as determined under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161.html)
The succeeding provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html) provide a sequential scheme for the determination of customs value if the valuation basis specified in the previous subsection does not apply. Thus, by way of illustration, subsection (3) provides that if the "transaction value" of goods cannot be determined, but the Collector can determine their "identical goods value", that value is the customs value. As one moves through [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html), the sequential valuation bases are the "similar goods value": subs 4; the "deductive (contemporary sales) value": subs 5; the "deductive (later sales) value": subs 6. Each of these terms are defined under the Act. We propose to refer only to the definition of "transaction value" as that is the value which counsel for the respondent contended was the customs value of the vehicle. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161.html) provides: "Transaction Value (1 ) The transaction value of imported goods is an amount equal to the sum of their adjusted price in their import sales transaction and of their price related costs to the extent that those costs have not been taken into account in determining the price of the goods.
 
In this section: "adjusted price" means: "in relation to imported goods, means the price of the goods determined by a
Collector who deducts from the amount that, but for this subsection, would be the amount of that price, such amounts as the Collector considers necessary to take account of the following matters: deductible financing costs in relation to the goods; any costs that the Collector is satisfied: are payable for the assembly, erection, construction or maintenance of, or any technical assistance in respect of, the goods; are incurred after importation of the goods into Australia; and are capable of being accurately quantified by reference to the import sales transaction relating to the goods; 
Australian inland freight and Australian inland insurance in relation to the goods; deductible administrative costs in relation to the goods; overseas freight and overseas insurance in relation to the goods." "Import sales transaction" and "price related costs", the concepts upon which "transaction value" is based , are both terms defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s154.html) as follow: ""Import sales transaction", in relation to imported goods, means: where there was one, and only one, contract of sale for the importation of the goods into Australia entered into before they became subject to Customs control and it was also a contract for their exportation from a foreign country - that contract; where there was one, and only one, contract of sale for the importation of the goods in Australia entered into before they became subject to Customs control and it was not also a contract for their exportation from a foreign country - that contract; or where there were 2 or more contracts of sale for the importation of the goods into Australia entered into before they became subject to Customs control - whichever of the contracts was made last; and includes: any contract, agreement or arrangement, whether formal or informal, to which the vendor, the purchaser or an agent of, or a person related to, the vendor or purchaser is a party that provides for an increase in the value of the goods the subject of the contract of sale referred to in paragraph (a), or (c) prior to their importation; and any other contract, agreement or arrangement relating to the contract of sale referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) that a Collector determines is so closely connected with that contract and to the goods the subject of that contract that together they form a single transaction;" "price related costs" means, in relation to imported goods, means: production assist costs in respect of the goods; packing costs for materials and labour paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of the purchaser in respect of the goods (including, but without limiting the generality of the goods (including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, costs of fumigating, cleaning, coating, wrapping or otherwise preparing the goods for their exportation from a foreign country or otherwise placing them in the condition in which they are imported into Australia, but not including the cost of any exempted pallet or exempted container concerned in their exportation); foreign inland freight and foreign inland insurance in relation to the goods paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of the purchaser; commission, other than a buying commission, or brokerage, paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of the purchaser in respect of the goods; or all royalties or licence fees paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of the purchaser to the vendor or to another person under the import sales transaction, not being royalties or licence fees: that do not relate to the imported goods in the condition, or substantially in the condition, in which they are imported into Australia; whose only relationship to the imported goods in the condition in which they are imported into Australia is insubstantial or incidental; that are merely for the right to reproduce the imported goods within
Australia; or that are payable for the assembly, erection, construction or maintenance of imported goods after their importation into Australia or for any technical assistance in respect of the goods after their importation; and the whole or any part of the proceeds of any subsequent use, resale or disposal of the goods, by or on behalf of the purchaser, that have accrued, or will accrue, to the vendor;" 
The responsibility for determining the customs value of goods lies with the
Collector of Customs. This is clear from the terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html), which differs from the predecessor provisions of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s156.html) and [157](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s157.html) in a way which is significant to this case. [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s156.html) and [157](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s157.html) appeared in Division 2 of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/index.html#p8) of the Act. Division 2 was repealed on 1 July 1989 and a new Division 2 substituted: see [Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/caelaa1989391/). Section had provided that the value of imported goods was their "customs value determined in accordance with Division 1 of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/caelaa1989391/index.html#p8) of the Act". Section 157 provided that, subject to <case>, the customs value of goods was their transaction value. This is to be contrasted with the provisions of the new <case>. As has been seen, under <case> the customs value of goods is the value of the goods. Section 159(2) provides, however, that the transaction value of goods will be their customs value where the
Collector can determine that value. That valuation process is not necessarily straightforward as the detailed definition provisions indicate.

Until such time as the customs value is determined, the actual entitlement of the revenue, that is the Commonwealth of Australia, is not known, although the liability to duty arises at the point of importation: see Gallagher versus Cendak <case>; [(1988) VR 731] at 741. The Collector's decision as to customs value is final, subject only to the provisions of <case> relating to refunds, rebates or remissions of duty and the appeal procedures laid down by the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/): [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) provides that if any dispute arises as to the amount or rate of duty payable in respect of any goods, the owner of the goods may pay, under protest, the sum demanded by the Collector. The sum paid under protest shall be deemed to be the proper duty payable unless the contrary is determined in an action against the Collector for the recovery of the whole or any part of the sum paid, in any Commonwealth or State Court of competent jurisdiction.

On the assumption that customs value must be proved in order for these three charges to be made out, that which must be proved is the customs value as determined in accordance with the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). It is clear from [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html) that that determination must be made by the Collector in the circumstances prescribed by the section. It is not sufficient, therefore, to provide to the court a series of facts and figures and request the court, either expressly or inferentially, to determine the customs value. The error in doing so is not only patent in that it invests in the court the executive function of determining customs value which is vested by the Act in the Collector, but is underscored by the fact that it deprives an owner of goods of their rights under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s163.html) and [167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html).

There was no evidence in this case that the Collector had ascertained that the transaction value of the vehicle could be determined. In the absence of such evidence, we are of the opinion that it was not open to the Court to determine that the transaction value of the vehicle was its customs value.

The question remains, however, whether the customs value is an ingredient of any of the 3 offences.

The Smuggling Charge [Section (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) provides that "[a] person shall not smuggle any goods". "Smuggling" is defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s4.html) to mean: "any importation .... or attempted importation with intent to defraud the revenue".
 
An intention to defraud the revenue has been described as an "intention to prevent something getting into the revenue which the revenue is entitled to get": see R versus Australasian Films Limited <case>; [(1921) 29 CLR 195] at 218.

The meaning of "defraud" was explained in Re London & Globe Finance
Corporation Limited [[1903] 1 Ch 728], Buckley J, at 732-733 as follows: "To deceive is, I apprehend, to induce a man to believe that a thing is true which is false, and which the person practising the deceit knows or believes to be false. To defraud is to deprive by deceit: it is by deceit to induce a man to act to his injury. More tersely, it may be put, that to deceive is by falsehood to induce a state of mind; to defraud is by deceit to induce a course of action. " 
This statement has "been accepted and used . . . as providing a satisfactory account of the essentials of `defrauding' on the one hand and `deceiving' on the other": Welham versus Director of Public Prosecutions [1961] AC 103 per Lord
Radcliffe, at 127.

In Balcombe versus De Simoni [(1972) 126 CLR 577], Gibbs J referred with qualified approval to Buckley J's definition. The qualification made by his Honour related to the charge of obtaining by false pretences with intent to defraud being the offence subject of consideration in that case.
Gibbs J pointed out that it was of the essence of that offence that property be obtained. It is was not sufficient, therefore, on such a charge, to merely prove an intent to bring about a course of action which did not involve the obtaining of property.

In dealing with this charge, it is also important to keep in mind that a court will not lightly find an intention to defraud: R versus Amenores [[1980] 2 NSWLR ];
Noyes Bros Pty Limited <case>; [[1988] VR 787] at 815.

It is essential to the concept of smuggling that the revenue is entitled to something. It is also essential that it be proved that there was an intention to deprive the revenue of that to which it was entitled. That "something", quite simply, is the duty payable on goods imported into the country, which, in turn, is assessed on the customs value of the goods. The question which arises, therefore, is whether the duty must have been calculated, or at least the customs value determined, before the charge of smuggling can be proved.
The evasion charge raises an identical question.

The Evasion Charge [Section (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) provides: "A person shall not: (a) evade payment of any duty, which is payable".
 "Evade" means more than a mere failure to pay an amount payable by the person charged: see Wilson versus Chambers & Co Pty Limited <case>; [(1926) 38 CLR 131] per Knox CJ at 136. It involves some blameworthy act or omission: Denver Chemical Manufacturing Co versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1949) 79 CLR 296.] In that case, Dixon J said at 313, (in the context of <case> of the Income Tax
Act 1936, which permitted the Commissioner to amend an assessment where there had been an avoidance of tax due to evasion): "I think it is unwise to attempt to define the word `evasion'. ... it means more than avoid and also more than a mere withholding of information or the mere furnishing of misleading information. It is probably safe to say that some blameworthy act or omission on the part of the taxpayer or those for whom he is responsible is contemplated." (emphasis added) 
This statement which was accepted as correct by Fullager J in Australasian
Jam Co Pty Limited versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1953) 88 CLR 23] at 37-38, has been consistently applied in the context of s (1)(a): see Ludwigs Bond Cellar Pty Limited versus Sheen [(1982) 46 ALTR ]
per Gallop J; Stitt versus CBI Constructions Pty Limited [(1990) 93 ALR ]
per Franklyn J: (Supreme Court of Western Australia); Defiance Enterprises
Pty Limited versus Collector of Customs (Qld) and Anor [(1990) 96 ALR 698] per Lee J (Supreme Court of Queensland).

The evasion which is proscribed by <case>(a) is of duty which is payable.
Duty, of course, is only payable on the customs value of goods.

The question whether customs value must be proved in prosecutions such as the present has been considered in two cases referred to in argument.

In Cendak versus Crawford [(1986) 86 FLR 190], the respondent was charged under 234(1)(d) with making an entry false in a material particular. In the entry for home consumption, the appellant had declared that the customs value of three motor vehicles was their purchase price in Hong Kong. The prosecution did not tender any direct evidence of the customs value of the vehicles, but averred that their value was the purchase price plus the cost of certain repairs. White J held that the averment of customs value was based upon the fallacy that the repairs necessarily added value to the vehicles and that the cost of the repairs represented the increase in value. There was no other evidence of customs value. Accordingly, the prosecution failed, as there was no evidence that the entry was false.

In Gallagher versus Cendak, the question arose whether the charges of smuggling, evading duty and making a false statement (being the same charges as are subject of this prosecution) could be proved if the amount of duty payable on the goods had not been determined. Vincent J held that the charges could be proved, stating at 743: "Although before any conviction could be properly entered it would be necessary for the prosecution to show that the defendant acted as it is alleged he did with the intention of defrauding the revenue of at least some duty to which it was entitled in the circumstances, I do not consider that it would be necessary for the prosecution to establish that the calculation of the actual amount of duty payable had already been made at the time he so acted, or that there was not some further act to be performed before it could be ascertained, or that the precise customs value of the goods had been determined at the time of importation".
 
Gallagher versus Cendak provides an obvious example where the charges of smuggling, evasion of duty and false statement can be proved, notwithstanding that there has been no determination of customs value, as in that case, the amount declared by the appellant on the entry for home consumption was substantially below the purchase price of the goods. Cendak versus Crawford, on the other hand, provides an example on its facts, where the absence of evidence of customs value was fatal to the prosecution. Both cases were decided when the now repealed Division 2, ss 156 and 157 was in operation.
What, then, is the position in this case? 
The appellant knew that the amount of duty would be less on the Alsamead price than it would be on the Mercedes-Benz price. That admission was not an admission of an intention to defraud the revenue or to evade duty. It was a statement of the obvious. It was also obvious from his evidence and from the trial judge's findings that the appellant wished to pay the lowest amount of duty possible. That finding does not of itself establish an intention to defraud. This is particularly so when the appellant's evidence, that the purchase price in the Alsamead transaction represented a proper value of the goods, having regard to inquiries he made in England, is taken into account.

The only other evidence was of the purchase price of the vehicle from
Mercedes-Benz and that in the normal course, customs would allow a depreciation factor of about 6% on the purchase price of goods in the calculation of duty. The appellant had not claimed any depreciation on the entry for home consumption, being the document upon which such a claim would have been specified. The reason for this, it would appear on the evidence, was that the appellant had already taken into account a factor for depreciation when calculating the "price" for the purposes of the Alsamead transaction.

In order to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had smuggled the goods or evaded payment of duty, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the value of the goods declared by the appellant on the entry, was not the value for the purposes of the assessment of duty. This it could only do, if it proved that the value of the goods for duty purposes was the transaction value of the vehicle and the transaction value was the purchase price from Mercedes-Benz. That determination, under the current form of <case>, is one which must be made by the Collector. There was no evidence that there was any such determination. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that, in this case, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove, the customs value of the goods.

In any event, proof of customs value aside, for the reasons to which we have referred, the evidence did not establish that the appellant intended to defraud the revenue or to evade duty. The effect of the appellant's evidence (which it was not open to Nash DCJ to reject) was to pay the lowest amount of duty which was possible for him to pay so that he would not lose on the transaction.

The False Statement Charge 
Section 234(1)(d)(i) provides: "A person shall not: (i) make a statement to an officer that is false or misleading in a material particular." 
As such, customs duty is not an element of the offence. However, the particularisation of the charge was that: "the total customs values was stated as being $A82,411.73 whereas in fact the total customs value was $A87,863.60 (emphasis added)." 
There was no averment of customs value and no evidence that the Collector had determined the customs value of the vehicle.

If the Collector seeks to prove that an entry is false in a material particular within <case>(d)(i) because there has been a statement of customs value which is false, it is necessary to prove the customs value. To this extent, Cendak versus Crawford and Gallagher versus Cendak are not relevant, as those decisions related to repealed provisions which were in different terms to the provisions of <case>.

Attempt 
Having regard to the foregoing, it is not necessary to deal with this issue.

We would answer the first question in the stated case yes.
