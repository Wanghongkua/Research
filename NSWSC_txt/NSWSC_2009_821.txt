MONDAY 17 AUGUST 2009  /03 ONEFONE AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED & ORS versus ONE.TEL LIMITED (IN
LIQUIDATION) & ORS 
JUDGMENT  The applicant special purpose liquidator seeks a confidentiality order in respect of the whole of his affidavit of 14 August 2009 filed in court today.
 I have taken the opportunity to review the affidavit with counsel paragraph by paragraph.
 In the result I order that the affidavit be kept in the court file in an envelope marked, "Confidential - Not to be opened without the leave of the
Judge" but that there be filed separately without any confidentiality embargo a copy of the affidavit from which have been removed paras 13, 14 and 15 and the reference to the correspondence in para 18.
 There will then be on the court file a copy which contains the vast bulk of the material in respect of which confidentiality was originally sought but for which no claim for confidentiality has been made out.
 It has become commonplace in this matter for the special purpose liquidator, upon ex parte applications such as today's, to make a blanket claim for confidentiality in respect of the evidence he files. That is not an acceptable approach. For the future the special purpose liquidator should be prepared to substantiate paragraph by paragraph the confidential nature of the evidence in the way that has happened this morning.
