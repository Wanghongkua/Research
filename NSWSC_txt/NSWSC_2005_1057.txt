TUESDAY 18 OCTOBER 2005  /05 RE N AND THE [ADOPTION ACT 2000](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application for the adoption of a baby girl, N, born in Thailand on 30 September 2002. She has been in the care of the adopting parents since 20 January 2004. The merits of their adoption application are clear. A report by a private social worker annexed to the delegate's supporting affidavit describes this as a very successful placement and says there are no concerns in any areas.  The adopting parents seek an order approving the child's forename spelt with the addition of the letter "h" to the name as it appears in her papers. This, they say, is to aid pronunciation. The Departmental delegate does not oppose the application for that order and in my view, it is consistent with the principles underlying the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) and should be made.  In the Summons the adopting parents sought orders dispensing with the consent of the child's natural parents and with giving them notice of the application. However, the delegate's affidavit puts forward the view that it may not be necessary for such orders to be made, because a child entering
Australia is a "non-citizen child" as defined in the Immigration and
Guardianship of Children Act 1946 (Cth) and under <case> of that Act the child is under the guardianship of the Federal Minister of Immigration, whose consent is annexed to the delegate's affidavit.  This matter has been considered in several recent cases: Re S and the [Adoption Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)  <case> J); Re K and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) <case> J); Re KN and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)  <case> J). The view has consistently been taken in those cases that, in light of [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s6.html), the consent of the person who was the overseas guardian before the child arrived in Australia is unnecessary. I accept that view and I shall apply it here. But according to those cases, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s6.html) does not eliminate the requirement in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s52.html) of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) that the consent of each natural parent of the child must be given, and they must be notified, unless dispensing orders are made under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html) and [72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s72.html).  In the present case a document supplied by the Department of the Public
Welfare in Thailand describing the background of the child discloses that the child was abandoned at a hospital by parents said to be Burmese. Attempts were made through the mass media and by checking with the National Police Bureau of
Thailand to trace the child's parents but those attempts were in vain. In the circumstances, I have no difficulty reaching the conclusion that the parents cannot, after reasonable inquiry, be found or identified [(s (1)(a)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s67.html)
Further, I am satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the child to make a consent dispense order if one is needed, having regard to the evidence showing that it is overwhelmingly in her interests that the adoption should proceed.  In these circumstances, the appropriate course is to make orders dispensing with consent and notification of the natural parents, on the basis that such orders are needed under the law stated in the cases to which I have referred.
There may be arguments for a contrary view, which might need to be explored in another case, if the evidence would not provide grounds for making a consent dispense order.  In the delegate's affidavit, although not in the Summons, there is a request for the court to make an order under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s131.html) of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) to release two certified copies of its orders to the Department for transmission to the
Department of the Public Welfare in Thailand. Thailand, like Korea, is not a country to which the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co- operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption applies, and it is not a prescribed jurisdiction for the purposes of Div 3 of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p2) of Cth 5 of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/): Re KN and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) at [9].
Therefore [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s131.html) of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) does not apply to the present case. I would be prepared to make an order to the same effect, however, in the exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction and under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s143.html) of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), on the basis outlined by Campbell J in Re KN and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) at [20] - [26]. I shall do so if the Department notifies the court's Client Services
Officer, Adoptions and Protective Jurisdiction, that such an order is required. I would not require a separate application.  I shall make orders for adoption and for dispensing with the consent of the natural parents and their notification, as soon as the draft adoption order is re-engrossed to include such provisions.
