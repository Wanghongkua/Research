JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff moves by Motion filed on 19 November 2013 seeking leave to amend the summons to seek an order pursuant to [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) and seeking pursuant to rule 13.1 UCPR that summary judgment be given for the Plaintiff on its claim for an order pursuant to [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). [Section 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) (2) provides that the Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was at any time not more than six years before the making of the application for the order engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity or a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. 
The Defendant was convicted on 27 July 2012 of supplying 2.228 kilograms of cannabis contrary to [s 25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) (1) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/). Under [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) that is a serious crime related activity. 
The Defendant appears this morning and asks for an adjournment of the motion. He said that he thought that what was going to be sought by the Plaintiff was an examination on oath by him and I took him to say that he was agreeable to that. 
This matter first came before me on Monday of this week. There was no appearance for the Defendant but a friend of his asked to be heard to indicate that the Defendant was ill and provided a medical certificate which expired yesterday. It was in those circumstances that I indicated I would adjourn the matter on Monday to today but that the matter would be heard today. 
The Defendant appears to have done nothing since he was served on 25 November with this notice of motion. At the present time he is formally represented by Rodney Van Houten who filed a notice of appearance on his behalf on 5 September 2011. Mr Dykyj tells me that Mr Van Houten is not in fact acting for him at the moment and I have been informed by the Plaintiff that a Notice of Intention to File a Notice Ceasing to [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) has in fact been filed by Mr Van Houten after service of the present motion upon him. 
It does not seem to me that there is any basis for adjourning the motion. The Defendant has had sufficient opportunity to engage legal assistance if he wished to do so to defend the motion. However, the terms of [s 27(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) would appear to indicate that there would be little defence that the Defendant would be able to offer in all of the circumstances. 
For that reason I decline to adjourn the Motion. I am satisfied in terms of [s 27(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) that a proceeds assessment order should be made. Leave is given to the Plaintiff to amend the Summons in the form which I will initial and date today and place on the file. 
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 2 and 3 of a draft order provided to me. I order that the Defendant pay the costs of the present application. I grant leave to the Defendant pursuant to [s 25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) and [s 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s26.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) to make application for exclusion orders on or before Thursday, 12 December 2013. These orders may be entered forthwith. * * *
