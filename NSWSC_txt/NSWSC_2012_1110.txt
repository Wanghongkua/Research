JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: By notice of motion filed 28 May 2012, the fourth defendant seeks firstly, an order that the statement of claim be struck out pursuant to [rule 14.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.28.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) (UCPR), insofar as it concerns the Fourth Defendant; secondly, in the alternative, that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to UCPR 13.4 insofar as they concern the Fourth Defendant; thirdly, further, and in the alternative, that the plaintiff provide security for the fourth defendant's costs in these proceedings in the sum of $105,000 and that until such security is provided these proceedings be stayed. 
The application in relation to security for costs will be stood over given that evidence on that application has not yet been properly considered by the parties. There is also an application in relation to access to subpoenaed documents, however the parties agreed that the application should be stood over until after the determination of the issues relating to the pleadings.
The fourth defendant relied on the affidavits of his solicitor Peter Mustaca dated 28 May 2012 and 21 June 2012. On the day of the hearing (despite being ordered to do so by 29 June 2012) the plaintiff, through his counsel, tendered a voluminous folder containing affidavits by Terry Zahos sworn 23 February 2012 and 30 July 2012, Debbie Van Wyk-Kiranov affirmed 23 February 2012, 2 March 2012 and 12 July 2012 and Richard Martyn affirmed 15 August 2012. This caused considerable difficulty for this Court and the other parties' legal representatives. This large amount of material had to be digested during the hearing. This non-compliance with court directions also considerably lengthened the hearing as objections to the affidavit material had to be addressed in court rather than being discussed between the parties prior to the hearing where resolution of some of these objections could have been reached. The only reason I allowed the filing and reading of these affidavits and material was because of the nature of the application and clearly the plaintiff would have failed without it and the claim against the fourth defendant would have been struck out or dismissed.
The plaintiff is Terry Zahos. The first defendant is Poppy Michael. The second defendant is CKZIA Pty Ltd. The third defendant is Eatstablishment Pty Ltd. CKZIA Pty Ltd and Eatstablishment Pty Ltd are entities involved in the running of two restaurants known as Twelve Restaurant and Cafe Cinque in Newtown. It is alleged that Poppy Michael is a shareholder in these companies. The fourth defendant is Anastasios ("Tass") Michael. Tass and Poppy Michael are husband and wife. For convenience, I shall refer to the parties by name.

Background
For the purposes of this application I have taken the plaintiff's case at its highest. At the hearing of this motion, there were evidential rulings as to the truth of the facts asserted in documents before this court but for the purposes of this application only I have taken such evidence at its highest.
In May 1989, Terry Zahos opened a restaurant, Zimi's, in Newtown together with three others, including his friend George Pappiamonis, Poppy Michael and her brother, Harry Hatzistergos. These premises were owned by Tom and Anna Zahos, Terry's parents.
In about 2001, Poppy Michael and Harry Hatzistergos commenced proceedings against Terry Zahos and George Pappiamonis pursuant to [s 106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) of the [Industrial Relations Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/) in the Industrial Court (IRC) (which provides for the power of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to declare contracts void or varied). They also joined Tom and Anna Zahos as defendants.
In 2005, the Court of Appeal quashed, with costs, the IRC proceedings against Tom and Anna Zahos. On 7 September 2006, Tom and Anna's costs were assessed at $134,886.83 and $73,000 (SOC at [12]). They were payable by Poppy Michael and Harry Hatzistergos.
On 17 November 2006, two certificates of judgment were issued in favour of Tom and Anna in the District Court. Interest was payable on those certificates.
Poppy Michael and Tass Michael were joint tenants of a home at Bexley North (the Bexley North property). On 27 November 2006, they executed a Contractual Agreement whereby Poppy Michael agreed to transfer her share in the Bexley North property to her husband Tass Michael in return for him paying Tom and Anna's costs referred to above. The source of Tass' funds was a $500,000 lottery win. The lottery was drawn on 17 October 2005.
In April 2007, Poppy Michael was declared bankrupt. 
On 18 May 2007, Poppy Michael's then solicitor Mr Xenos, forwarded a letter to Tom and Anna Zahos' solicitor attaching two bank cheques as payment of Tom and Anna's costs. The cheques totalled $202,886.83 (this amount did not include the interest that had accrued on the judgment debts.)
On 16 June 2007, Mr Xenos sent two further cheques to Mr Comino. One was in the sum of $73,443.41 and the other was in the sum of $143,730.23, totalling $217,173.64. 
Tass Michael's Commonwealth Bank passbook appears to show a withdrawal in May 2007 of the sum of $202,892.23.
From March 2007, there were a number of directions hearings before Marks J in the IRC. Mr Xenos appeared for Poppy Michael and Harry Hatzistergos. Terry Zahos had filed and served an application to have those proceedings dismissed. 
In August 2007, the IRC proceedings against Terry Zahos were dismissed by consent. Poppy Michael and Harry Hatzistergos were ordered to pay Mr Zahos' costs. 
On 20 August 2009, the Costs Assessor's certificate was registered as a judgment in this Court in the sum of $210,140.57 in favour of Terry Zahos against Poppy Michael and Harry Hatzistergos. To date this sum has not been paid and has now accrued interest.
On 12 October 2009, Harry Hatzistergos went into bankruptcy. On 2 April 2010, Poppy Michael's period of bankruptcy expired. 
The Bexley North property was valued at $475,000 as at 14 December 2007 by Sydney Metropolitan Valuation. A caveat had been lodged over the Bexley North property but on 20 August 2010 the caveat lapsed. On 25 November 2010 the Bexley North property was transferred solely into Tass Michael's name.
On 6 December 2010, Terry Zahos filed a notice of motion for the issue of a writ for the levy of property against Poppy Michael against the Bexley North property.
On 20 December 2011, Terry Zahos in proceedings 2009/295027, filed a notice of motion with four respondents, Poppy Michael, The Eatstablishment Trust, The Hatzistergos Family Trust and The Michael Family Trust. Terry Zahos sought orders including that Poppy Michael be restrained from dealing with her interest in the Bexley North home, her shares in two restaurants in Newtown and her shares in The Eatstablishment Pty Ltd and CKZIA Pty Ltd. That motion has been before the Court on a number of occasions. There has been consent orders made on each occasion, without admissions, restraining Poppy Michael from dealing with the specified interest/shares. On 29 June 2012, by consent, the restraint was extended until the motion filed 20 December 2011 has been heard.
On 20 February 2012, the plaintiff filed its statement of claim in these current proceedings. Tass Michael was not a party. 
On 23 February 2012, Terry Zahos filed a notice of motion seeking preliminary discovery and inspection and leave to file an amended statement of claim and sought to join Tass Michael as the fourth defendant. On 5 March 2012, at the hearing of this motion before R A Hulme J, Terry Zahos relied on the affidavit of Debbie Van Wyk-Kiranov dated 23 February 2012. Ms Wyk-Kiranov deposed that she "wished to probe, on behalf of the Applicant/Plaintiff, whether the First Defendant/Second Respondent alienated her half share of her family residence at Bexley North to her husband, Anastasios Michael, in order to defraud my client of the fruits of his IRC costs order." 
She also deposed that: "The missing pieces in the evidentiary mosaic which will either in my view, and that of my principal, Ms Nell Robertson, implicate Mr Michael in a fraudulent design...or demonstrate his innocence, are the tax invoices (i.e.
legal bills) which he says he discharged on behalf of [Ms Michael] and the surrounding primary vouchers."
At that hearing, Ms Van Wyk-Kiranov agreed in cross examination that she was not moving on the order to amend the statement of claim to make the <case> claim against Tass Michael, "because you need in your view, to examine the documents which you are seeking to obtain to form a view about there or not it is appropriate to make that amendment." (T5/3/2012 2.3-5). His Honour accepted that this being the case, it was not appropriate to deal with whether leave should be granted to file the amended statement of claim and join Tass Michael as defendant.
On 7 March 2012, R A Hulme J delivered judgment. His Honour refused the plaintiff's application for preliminary discovery. 
On 16 March 2012, the plaintiff filed his amended statement of claim joining Tass Michael as fourth defendant. The plaintiff was permitted to do so pursuant to UCPR r 19.1 which relevantly states that a plaintiff may, without leave, amend a statement of claim once within 28 days after the date on which it was filed.
On 20 March 2012, a senior case manager at the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) wrote by email to Tass Michael in relation to the bankrupt estate of Poppy Michael in the following terms: "I note that in a letter dated 12 March 2009 from Diamond Conway Lawyers, solicitors acting for Poppy Michael at the time, demonstrated to the trustee that the transfer of the bankrupt's former interest in the property to you was made pursuant to a contractual agreement dated 27 November 2006, and for consideration totalling $244,673.64, which at that time, was in excess of 50% of the estimated equity in the property. Supporting documentation was provided to the satisfaction of the trustee.

The Office Trustee was satisfied that the transfer of the interest in the property could not be challenged under the Bankruptcy Act, and therefore took no further action." 
The pleading framework
It is necessary to examine the pleading framework and in particular the pleading in the amended statement of claim that seeks to join Tass Michael as a defendant.
The amended statement of claim relevantly seeks: "5. A declaration that the execution of the Transfer (Form 01T) by the First
Defendant in respect of the Bexley North property, dated 25 November 2010 and stamped by the Office of State Revenue, constituted an alienation of property with the intention to defraud the Plaintiff, within the meaning of Section 37A [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).
A declaration that any subsequent Transfer (Form 01T) executed by the
First Defendant in respect of the Bexley North property purporting to convey it for the consideration referred to in the document styled "Contractual
Agreement" executed by the First Defendant on 27 November 2006, would constitute an alienation of property to defraud the Plaintiff within the meaning of [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)."
It relevantly pleads: "11.On 6 December 2005, the New South Wales Court of Appeal made costs orders against the First Defendant and Harry, in favour of Tom & Anna Zahos, the parents of the Plaintiff ("the CA Costs Order") in a certiorari application arising out of the said IRC Proceedings.

On the 7 September 2006, same were assessed in the sum of $134,886 83 and further sum to the order of $73.000.00.

As at 7 September 2006, the First and Fourth Defendants were the registered owners, as joint tenants, in the property (Folio XXXX) situate at Bexley
North. By document dated 27 November 2006 and styled "Contractual Agreement", the First Defendant agreed to transfer her half share in the family home at
North Bexley to the Fourth Defendant in return for him agreeing to pay the CA
Costs Order.
 .In about mid May 2007, Tom & Anna Zahos filed and served an application for bankruptcy against Harry in respect of the unpaid CA Costs Order.
 .On 18 May 2007, the CA Costs Order was paid.
 [This date is incorrect] .Tom & Anna Zahos' said bankruptcy application against Harry was withdrawn.
 ...
 .On 20 August 2009 judgment was entered, by this Honourable Court, against the First Defendant herein and Harry in favour of the Plaintiff in the assessed amount of $210,140.57.
 ...
 .On a Transfer (Form 01T) dated 25 November 2010, executed by the First and
Fourth Defendants, stamp duty was paid to the Office of State Revenue in the amount of $8,990.00 in respect of the Bexley North residence.
 .Harry asserted to his trustee in bankruptcy that he borrowed $520,000 or thereabout from the Fourth Defendant to pay for legal fees.
 .The First Defendant has asserted that Harry paid CA Costs Order."
So far as the claim against Tass Michael is concerned, it is pleaded that: "37.By letter dated 28 February 2012 the Plaintiff has requested the Fourth
Defendant to advise if what Harry asserted about the $520,000 being loaned to him, is false.
 .The Fourth Defendant has not so advised the Plaintiff.
 .The Plaintiff infers from the facts pleaded in paragraphs 34 to 37 above, that: the Fourth Defendant loaned money to Harry, for Harry to stave off the bankruptcy petition of Tom & Anna Zahos.
 that the money so loaned to Harry, when paid by him to Tom & Anna Zahos to discharge his debt, discharged Poppy's debt as well; and as such the Fourth Defendant has paid no consideration to the First Defendant in return for the alienation of her half share by virtue of the Transfer.

In the circumstances, the Plaintiff says that the aforesaid alienation by the First Defendant of her half share in the Bexley North residence to the
Fourth Defendant was with the intention of defrauding the Plaintiff of the fruits of his IRC costs order with the meaning of Section 37A [Conveyancing
Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)."
In his defence Tass Michael states that he does not plead to paragraph [35] of the amended statement of claim as it contains no allegation of fact or circumstance concerning him but denies that Harry borrowed $520,000 or thereabouts from him to pay for legal fees [D 35].
In summary, the case pleaded against Tass Michael is that Tom Zahos seeks relief against Tass Michael by way of a declaration that the transfer by Poppy Michael to Tass Michael of her half share in the Bexley North home was an alienation of the property with intent to defraud Terry Zahos within the meaning of [s 37A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/); Tom Zahos seeks an order that Tass Michael reconvey to her that half share in the home.

Summary judgment
UCPR 13.4(1) provides that the Court may dismiss proceedings generally, or in relation to any claim for relief, in three circumstances. These are, if the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, or if the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the court. UCPR 13.4(2) provides that the court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (1).
UCPR 14.28(1) provides that the Court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the whole or any part of a pleading be struck out if the pleading, firstly, discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading or, secondly, has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings or, thirdly, is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. UCPR 14.28(2) provides that the court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (1).
In Commonwealth of Australia versus Griffiths  <case>; [(2007) 70 NSWLR 268] Beazley JA (with whom Mason P agreed) said: "11The general principles relating to the summary disposal of proceedings are well-known: see General Steel Industries Inc versus Commissioner for Railways & Ors <case>; [(1964) 112 CLR 125] at 129. If it is demonstrated that there is a real question to be tried, the matter is inappropriate for the entry of summary judgment:
Dey versus Victorian Railway Commissioners  <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 62.] The tests stated in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate that a case be disposed of by the entry of summary judgment include statements such as that the matter is "so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed"; "manifestly groundless" or "would involve useless expense": see General Steel Industries at 129.

The summary disposal of proceedings or part thereof deprives a party of the right to a contested hearing. For that reason it is said that the requirement for establishing that there is no triable issue is demanding: Air Services
Australia versus Zarb (Court of Appeal, 26 August 1998, unreported). In Webster & Anor versus Lampard  <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 598], Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said at 602: '... the issue before the learned Master on the application for summary judgment was not whether [the plaintiffs] would probably succeed in their action against [the defendant]. It was whether the material before the Master demonstrated that that action should not be permitted to go to trial in the ordinary way because it was apparent that it must fail. The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with 'exceptional caution' and 'should never be exercised unless it is clear that there is no real question to be tried.' (Citations omitted)"
The third defendant relies particularly on the allegation that the amended statement of claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action and is an abuse of process. 
Counsel for Tass Michael submits that the solicitor for Terry Zahos, Ms Van Wyk-Kiranov, deposed in affidavit evidence and during cross examination before R A Hulme J stated, in effect that in the absence of preliminary discovery the allegation of intent to defraud creditors could not be satisfied. Preliminary discovery was then refused. Counsel for Tass Michael submits that, in the absence of any new facts or evidence deposed to by the plaintiff or his solicitor, the amended statement of claim should be struck out or dismissed. 
At the hearing of this motion, counsel for Tass Michael also relied on senior counsel, Mr Habib's, submissions. Mr Habib represented Poppy Michael. His submissions were to the effect that the claim against Tass Michael is not properly pleaded, discloses no reasonable cause of action and therefore it should be dismissed. The three other defendants supported Tass Michael's application that the case against him be dismissed as it is in their interests that this occur.
So far as counsel for Tass Michael's submission that there has been no explanation as to why the plaintiff is now in a position to plead a [s 37A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) case against him, Mr Jacobs, counsel for Terry Zahos referred to a letter between their respective solicitors dated 11 May 2012 where Ms Van Wyk-Kiranov provides an explanation for her change in view as to whether Terry Zahos could plead a case against Tass Michael. It is: "The significance of one line of the letter from ITSA dated 19 February 2009 to Lucas Kanakis, one of your Client's previous solicitors, was only appreciated after the hearing before Justice Hulme.

That line, tucked away in the letter, in itself one of many documents in the cases against Messrs Michael and Hatzistergos, notes that your Client's wife "has previously advised" that her "brother", Mr Harry Hatzistergos, paid the debt owed to Tom & Anna Zahos." [solicitor's emphasis added]
Counsel for Terry Zahos submits that this assertion made by an ITSA officer that Poppy Michael's brother Harry paid Tom and Anna's fees is evidence that rebuts Tass Michael's assertion that he paid those fees in accordance with the contractual agreement he had with his wife Poppy. This, according to counsel for Terry Zahos, constitutes sufficient evidence to plead a case of [s 37A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) against Tass Michael. 
Counsel for Terry Zahos also drew the Court's attention to what he submitted was other evidence supporting allegations against Tass Michael. 
They are, firstly, a letter dated 16 June 2007 where Xenos Lawyers wrote to Tom and Anna's solicitors in the matter of Hatzistergos versus Zahos forwarding cheques in the sums of $143,730.23 and $73,443.41, being settlement of "your client's claim against our client". This, Mr Jacobs, asserts is evidence that the moneys were paid by Mr Hatzistergos.
Secondly Mr Jacobs referred to [8] of Ms Van Wyk-Kiranov's affidavit dated 23 February 2012 where she deposes to a conversation between herself and Terry Zahos in which Mr Zahos said to her the following: "I attended a meeting with the trustee in bankruptcy of Mr Hatzistergos, a Mr
Wily and his assistant, Ms Fleur Evans. My counsel also attended.

I asked Mr Wily and Ms Evans what the entry of $521,179 on Harry's Notice of
Bankruptcy related to. Mr Wily said that as far as he could establish, it related to legal fees that Harry said he had incurred and Tass Michael either paid on his behalf or loan (sic) him money to pay."
Terry Zahos confirms the contents of this conversation was relayed to him by Ms Wyk-Kirnov (his aff 23/2/2012 at [3]).
Thirdly, counsel for Terry Zahos referred to a file note in ITSA's documents dated 25 June 2007, where Maryanne (the wife of Terry Zahos) states that: "Harry remitted a chq for the amount claimed. Chq was cleared. Maryanne doesn't know the exact amount."
Fourthly, counsel for Terry Zahos referred to a handwritten notation from Harry Hatzistergos' bankruptcy proceedings. A listing sheet in the Federal Magistrates Court on 12 June 2007 records: "R prep'd to pay debt & int - needs time for bank chq 
R Need week - to get cheque costs"
The notation is significant to the plaintiff because he asserts that this is evidence that Harry was to pay Anna and Tom's costs.
In a letter dated 19 February 2009, ITSA wrote to Diamond Conway Lawyers in regard to Poppy Michael's bankrupt estate, stating: "Your client had previously advised that her brother 'Harry' had paid this debt just prior to the hearing of the Creditors' Petition against him in Court to avoid the sequestration of his estate. The Official Trustee understands that the debts were jointly owed by your client and her brother 'Harry'."
Finally, counsel for Terry Zahos relied on a letter dated 20 August 2012 where ITSA wrote to Mr and Mrs Zahos (Ex 1) in relation to the bankrupt estate of Poppy Michael. It stated: "The trustee acknowledges receipt of documentation provided by you in relation to the conduct of the bankrupt and further investigations will be undertaken by the trustee in relation to same.

A further report to creditors will be issued in relation to the trustee's investigations in this matter."
It is my view that the file note of a purported conversation between Terry Zahos' wife with an unknown person in ITSA's office is an unreliable piece of evidence and its worth is negligible. Likewise the notation in Harry's bankruptcy proceedings says only "prepared to pay debt & int - needs time for bank chq". This notation is ambiguous. It does not assist Terry Zahos' case. So far as the recent letter by ITSA in relation to Poppy's estate where the conduct of Poppy Michael is to be investigated and a report to creditors will be issued, while the outcome of the investigation is not yet known, the trustee is of the view that the allegations need to be investigated.
That leaves evidence of a reported conversation between the solicitor for Terry Zahos and the trustee of Harry Hatzistergos' estate in which the trustee is purported to have said words to the effect that the entry of the sum of $521,179 on Harry's bankruptcy notice related to legal fees that Harry said he had incurred and Tass Michael either paid on his behalf or lent him money to pay and a reference in a letter by ITSA dated 19 February 2009 that Poppy Michael had advised her trustee that Harry had paid the debt to avoid sequestration of his estate.

The fourth defendant's criticism of the pleadings
Now it is necessary to determine whether the [s 37A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) pleading against Tass Michael is adequate.
[Section 37A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) relevantly reads: "37A Voluntary alienation to defraud creditors voidable 
Save as provided in this section, every alienation of property, made ...
with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.
 ...

This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property alienated to a purchaser in good faith not having, at the time of the alienation, notice of the intent to defraud creditors.
Counsel for Terry Zahos referred to Patel versus Lal <case>, where Biscoe AJ stated: [6]Section 37A should receive a liberal construction in effecting its purpose of suppressing fraud. The term "defraud" in [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) means to delay, hinder or otherwise defraud: Marcolongo versus Chen <case> ; <case>, [20], [58]. It is unnecessary to show that the debtor wanted creditors to suffer a loss or that the debtor had a purpose of causing loss. It is necessary to show the existence of an intention to hinder, delay or defeat creditors and in that sense to show that accordingly the debtor had acted dishonestly. If the debtor disposes of an asset which would be available to creditors with the intention of prejudicing them by putting it, or its worth, beyond their reach, he is in the ordinary case acting in a fashion not honest in the context of the relationship of debtor and creditor. In cases of voluntary disposition that intention may be inferred: at [32]. A person may have acted dishonestly,
Judged by the standards of ordinary, decent people, without appreciating that the act in question was dishonest: at [33]. The party seeking to avoid the disposition bears the onus of proving an intent to defraud. While the existence of the intent may be inferred from the evidence, it is to be found as a fact: at [34]. [Sections
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) does not require the intent to defraud to be the sole or predominant intent: at <case> at <case>- <case>
Austin J said (omitting most citations): ... it is not necessary for the plaintiff to bring actual proof that the debtor had in his or her mind an intention to defraud creditors; if it appears from evidence of all the circumstances that the transfer might be expected to have that effect, and has had that effect, the Court will attribute fraudulent intention to the debtor. However, the onus of proof of intent to defraud is on the plaintiff.

If the conveyance is voluntary, it is easier to infer a dishonest intention than when it is made for consideration. And if the defendant chooses not to give evidence, the Court can be bold in drawing inferences along the lines considered in Jones versus Dunkel <case>; [(1959) 101 CLR 298.] is a presumption that the transfer is voidable. This probably means no more than that a transferor and transferee being related is a factor relevant to the court's decision on the transferor's intention.

As a matter of construction of the section, the relevant intention is the intention of the transferor, although the intention of the transferee is relevant to the defence in [s
A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html), because a transferee who shares the transferor's intention to defraud creditors cannot be a purchaser in good faith without notice."
Mr Habib, senior counsel for Poppy Michael referred to Marcolongo versus Yu Po Chen <case>, where the High Court at [28] to [34] stated: "The proper mental state for [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) [28]The particular and specific course taken in the United States with the
UFCA [Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act] and the UFTA [Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act] as to the ground of constructive fraud did not represent the
English case law upon the Elizabethan Statute as it stood in 1924. That case law is summed up in the passage from Glegg versus Bromley set out earlier in these reasons. Consequently, the operation of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) was not qualified by a notion of constructive fraud. However, the reasoning of the
Court of Appeal in the present case appears to proceed otherwise. It appears to have been assumed that in order to repel an interpretation of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) that would extend its scope to cases of equitable or constructive fraud, it was appropriate to fortify the requirement of an intention to defraud by some notion of dishonesty involving a desire to "cheat" or "swindle" those prejudiced. Hamilton J then was held to have erred in law in not considering that requirement for the operation of <case> A.
 [29]In the Court of Appeal, Allsop P (with whom Giles JA agreed) began his analysis with the observation that there was a debate as to "the proper mental state for [s
A"](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) and continued: 
The cases in the 19th and 20th centuries revealed a tension between those which stated that the fraud required to be proved was "real" or "actual" and those which provided for constructive fraud based upon the consequences of the acts undertaken and impugned.

He went on to regard Ex parte Mercer; Re Wise as rejecting the proposition that a finding of intent for the Elizabethan Statute was a conclusion from the necessary effect of what was done, so that on this view "fraud may not involve deceit, but does involve dishonesty", and to treat Freeman versus Pope as a decision which looked to the "necessary effect" of a disposition.
 [30]However, at trial Mrs Marcolongo had shouldered the burden of establishing in all the circumstances that the contract and transfer were made with intent to defraud creditors with the consequence that they were voidable at her instance as a person thereby prejudiced. She did not rely upon any adverse inference based upon the absence of consideration and the alleged natural consequence of the conveyance or transfer as being to defraud creditors.
 [31]Allsop P went on to identify the "central question", which Hamilton J had not addressed, as being whether Lym "had an actual and real intention" to defraud Mrs Marcolongo, and Young JA spoke of a requirement of "some element of dishonesty". In this court, Lym, in the first of its submissions supporting the decision of the Court of Appeal, treated this as requiring "an actual intent" in the sense of an animus shown by an "awareness" that the transaction would have an effect on the ability of creditors to recover from Lym.
 [32]However, in response Mrs Marcolongo correctly relies upon a statement by
Blanchard and Wilson JJ when considering the comparable New Zealand legislation in Regal Castings Ltd versus Lightbody. Their Honours said that it was unnecessary to show that the debtor wanted creditors to suffer a loss or that the debtor had a purpose of causing loss: it was necessary to show the existence of an intention to hinder, delay or defeat creditors and in that sense to show that accordingly the debtor had acted dishonestly. Mrs
Marcolongo correctly relies also upon the observation by Russell LJ when considering <case> of the 1925 Act in Lloyds Bank Ltd versus Marcan. His
Lordship said: 
I am not sure what is meant by a perfectly innocent defeat, hindrance or delay. It must be remembered that in every case under this section the debtor has done something which in law he has power and is entitled to do: otherwise it would never reach the section. If he disposes of an asset which would be available to his creditors with the intention of prejudicing them by putting it, or its worth, beyond their reach, he is in the ordinary case acting in a fashion not honest in the context of the relationship of debtor and creditor.
And in cases of voluntary disposition that intention may be inferred. ... The intention of Mr Marcan is perfectly plain: the lease to his wife was designed expressly to deprive the bank of the ability to obtain the vacant possession to which the bank plainly attributed value, and to diminish to that extent the strength of the bank's position as creditor. To take that action at that juncture, in my judgment, was, in the context of relationship of debtor and creditor, less than honest: it was sharp practice, and not the less so because he was advised that he had power to grant the lease. It was, in my judgment, a transaction made with intent to defraud the bank within section 172, and would have been within the [Elizabethan Statute].
 [33]To that may be added the statement in the joint reasons of the court in
Farah Constructions Pty Ltd versus Say-Dee Pty Ltd: 
As a matter of ordinary understanding, and as reflected in the criminal law in
Australia, a person may have acted dishonestly, Judged by the standards of ordinary, decent people, without appreciating that the act in question was dishonest by those standards. Further, as early as 1801, Sir William Grant MR stigmatised those who "shut their eyes" against the receipt of unwelcome information.
 [34]Lym relied upon the references by Brennan CJ and McHugh J in Cannane versus J
Cannane Pty Ltd (in liq) to "the onus of proving an actual intent". But their Honours were adding the word "actual" as a periphrasis to emphasise that, while the existence of the intent might be inferred from the evidence, it was to be found as a fact. With Gaudron J and Gummow J, Brennan CJ and
McHugh J concluded that the facts of Cannane did not support the drawing of such an inference."
The Fourth Defendant's arguments in relation to the pleadings can be summarised as follows (T40-T48): 
The amended statement of claim did not properly identify the "legal fees" said to have been incurred by Harry and for which the Fourth Defendant lent him money, or paid on Harry's behalf; 
The pleadings in relation to the Fourth Defendant not responding to the plaintiff's letter dated 28 February 2012 could no longer be relied upon because the Fourth Defendant has denied the substance of the allegation (that he had lent money to Harry to repay Tom and Anna's debt) in his defence and claimed to have responded by letter. There is therefore no "absence of response" which can be relied upon by the plaintiff to draw inferences; 
There is no dispute that the money used to pay Tom and Anna originated from the Fourth Defendant's bank account and it does not matter whether Harry or
Poppy paid over that money. The plaintiffs have failed to properly plead a basis for their allegation that the Fourth Defendant has not complied with his contractual obligation to Poppy.
The plaintiff responded that the court could not look at the pleading in isolation and that there was substantial evidence in the case that suggested that Harry had paid the costs. He also noted that the defendants had filed defences to the amended statement of claim. Finally, he submitted that Tass Michael's response to the plaintiff's letter dated 28 February 2012 stated that the issues of the loan to Harry was irrelevant, when in fact it is directly relevant to the issues in this case. There is therefore a dispute and triable issue in relation to the alleged loan to Harry.
Recently in Szanto versus Bainton <case>, Ward J discussed the issue of adequacy of pleadings at [129] - [130]: "Lander J in Arthur Young versus Tieco International <case> at <case>), said the following in the context of a consideration as to the adequacy of pleadings: 'Whether the material facts and whether sufficient particulars have been pleaded must depend upon the cause of action, the complexities of the case and the whole of the circumstances of the case. None of those matters can be considered in isolation any more than each of the paragraphs of the pleading can be considered in isolation.

When the Court considers a pleading it will not consider the pleading with the same degree of scrutiny which the courts are required to give to an Act of
Parliament. With the complexities of modern litigation, a pleader can usually point to some deficiency in the opponent's pleadings. One can usually, if one approaches the matter with a critical eye, identify some failing in a pleading. But that is not the approach that in this age ought to be adopted. A court would not sit down in the manner of a nineteenth century pleader seeking to find an error capable of sending a party away to re-plead his claim or defence. Such a technical approach is inconsistent with modern litigation and inconsistent with the court's function which is to try to arrive at a just result. A successful result, if arrived at, after too great an expense may not be considered by even the successful party to be a just result. A court ought to approach a consideration of the adequacy of a pleading seeking to answer the ultimate question; does the pleading give fair notice of the case to be made against the other party at trial, thereby minimising the risk of injustice resulting from surprise.' (my emphasis) 
The above principles are reflected in the [Uniform Civil Procedure
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) (see rr .7 and 15.1). [Rule .8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.8.html) requires a pleading to be brief as the nature of the case allows. A pleading that is not precise, concise, clear and definite may be struck out (Re
Parton; Townsend versus Parton [(1882) 30 WR 287]; Hill v
Hart-Davis [(1884) 26 Ch D 470)."] at <case>. Furthermore in a statement of claim, the plaintiff must plead specifically any matter that, if not pleaded specifically, may take the defendant by surprise, meaning that the material facts must be stated in such a way that the defendant can understand the materiality of the facts, that is how they are material to an asserted cause of action: r 14.14(1); ASIC versus Rich.
It is my view that the amended statement of claim allows the defendants to understand the case that is to be brought against them. While inferences should not be pleaded, and paragraphs [37] and [38] are superfluous, the amended statement of claim nevertheless pleads the material factual allegations made by the plaintiff such that the defendants can understand what case they are answering (and indeed have already responded to in their filed defences). 
Conclusion 
I accept that to plead that Poppy and Tass Michael intended to hinder, delay or defraud creditors is a serious allegation, but I cannot say that it is doomed to failure. It is my view that the case against Tass Michael is weak but I cannot say it is hopeless. Whether or not Poppy and Tass Michael shared an intention to defraud (or at least hinder, delay or defeat) Poppy Michael's creditors depends on evidence which may be given at trial by Tass Michael, Poppy Michael and Harry Hatzistergos. 
While there is evidence that Tass Michael withdrew money to pay the debt and in return received Poppy Michael's interest in the Bexley North property, there is the statement by Poppy Michael to ITSA to the effect that Harry paid Tom and Anna's judgment debt, and there is a letter by Harry's solicitor stating that Harry was forwarding the cheques to Tom and Anna. There was a conversation to the same effect between the solicitor for Terry Zahos and the trustee of Harry's estate. 
The matters set out above can only be evaluated, and findings of fact can only be made, at trial. One central issue in my view will be whether Tass Michael lent or gave the funds to Harry (if any transaction between the two is proven at trial). Hence I refuse to grant summary dismissal of the proceedings or to strike out the amended statement of claim as it relates to the fourth defendant.
