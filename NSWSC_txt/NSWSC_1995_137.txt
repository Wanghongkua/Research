WINDEYER
J The plaintiff Jillsea Pty Ltd (Jillsea) seeks a declaration that it has a valid option granted by Mr George, the first defendant, on 6 April to purchase property 15 McKenzie Street Lismore and seeks specific performance of the agreement. It seeks rectification of the option agreement to entitle it to this result. In the alternative it seeks a similar declaration in respect of an option dated March 1995 with an alternative claim for rectification of that document. And by further amendment made during the hearing the plaintiff seeks a declaration as to the existence and performance of an agreement to amend the agreement dated 31 March 1995.
 
Facts
Mr George owned the Lismore property. The plaintiff had been negotiating to put together a development site at Lismore. It had secured options to purchase various properties. That of the first defendant, Mr George, was the final property required to enable the plan to go ahead. The second defendant either wanted to secure a development site or wanted to prevent the plaintiff's plan from going ahead. It was announced from the bar table without objection the plaintiff company was operating in the interests of Woolworths
Limited and the second defendant was operating in the interests of Coles-Myer
Limited. 
Negotiations were entered into with
Mr George for an option to purchase his property for $120000 for an option fee of $1000. That amount was paid. The solicitors for the plaintiff, one of whom held a power of attorney from the plaintiff, prepared an option agreement and forwarded it in duplicate to the solicitor for Mr George, Mr Bykowski. This was done it seems after Mr Bykowski had prepared the form of contract which was to be annexed to the option agreement and had sent that to the plaintiff's solicitors. On 28 March some negotiations were entered into for amendments to the contract document most of which were agreed. By letter of 30 March 1995 the option agreement in duplicate signed by Mr Creais under power of attorney from Jillsea Pty Ltd was forwarded to Mr Bykowski, both copies being dated 30 March.
The amendments to certain special conditions of the contract had been made and in the letter the plaintiff's solicitors confirmed that Mr Bykowski would consider the appropriateness of the certificate under [s66W](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66w.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) which they considered inappropriate and which they said should be removed from the contract and that Mr Bykowski would be seeking his client's instructions about amending the contract to provide that no land tax adjustment was required.
On 31 March 1995 it was agreed between Mrs Dimos, the solicitor then handling the matter for the plaintiff during the absence of Mrs Robinson, and
Mr Bykowski, during a telephone conversation which took place while Mr George was present in Mr Bykowski's office, that no adjustment of land tax was required. However Mr Bykowski said that the property was tenanted, that he was getting a copy of the lease, that he proposed to make the contracts subject of tenancy, and that the lease expired on 2 August. Mrs Dimos said that she would get instructions which she did and having done so informed Mr Bykowski that the contract could be made subject to the tenancy with a copy of the lease attached. I find that it was intended that a copy of the lease should be so attached. It never was. The contract was signed by Mr
George on 31 March. The agreed amendments to the land tax provisions were not inserted in both contracts and the necessary amendments making the contract subject to the existing tenancy were not included either. In so far as Mr Bykowski said that the contract was not signed until 6 April I do not accept that evidence. It was contrary to the evidence of Mr George. It was also contrary to his previous statements which I accept were made. I think it is clearly incorrect.
After it was agreed on 31 March what should be done,
Mr Bykowski became unavailable. On 3 April he told Mrs Dimos that Mr George had not signed the option and that he was going in to see him on the next day and was waiting for details of the identity of the agents so that he could obtain the lease. As I have said
I find this was not true as the document had been signed and he already had the lease. on 5 April contact was at last made with Mr
Bykowski who said that his instructions from Mr George were that "the matter with
Jillsea is to be frozen at its present level".
Another mysterious proposed purchaser, probably called McConachie or represented by a man of that name, came onto the scene sometime about 5 or 6
April. As a result of offers he apparently made, the plaintiff decided to increase the offer to $180000 as the price at which the option was exercisable. By this time Mrs Dimos had handed control of the matter back to
Mrs Robinson. There was a long conversation between Mrs Robinson and Mr
Bykowski on 6 April 1995 during which various other calls were made to Mr
Isaac representing the plaintiff, and during which time Mr George was present in Mr Bykowski's office. During this time Mrs Robinson said that her client was prepared to enter into an option to purchase the property for $180000 but would not enter into an unconditional contract. Subsequently it was said that in addition, and as a further inducement, the plaintiff was prepared to let the vendor keep the $1000 option fee and not have it treated as part of the purchase price if the option were exercised. Mr Bykowski asked that this offer be. put in writing and Mrs Robinson immediately sent a fax. Shortly thereafter
Mr Bykowski telephoned her, said that his client was agreeable, that he would make the amendments, that his client would sign them and that the option document would be delivered to Mrs Robinson later that day. She asked that she should be allowed to arrange a courier to pick it up but Mr Bykowski refused and said it would be delivered later that day. Mrs Robinson said that she did not want him to try to get out of this, coming back with a higher demand and that Mr Bykowski had said "No the document will be delivered to your office later today". Insofar as there is any contest about this evidence I accept the evidence of Mrs Robinson. On 6 April, and it would appear shortly after the facsimile
I have referred to was sent, Mr George wrote on it "I accept this option agreement. C.A. George 06 April 1995". Mr Bykowski said in evidence that he got his client to sign the letter as an indication to him that he was happy to proceed; he said that there were certain matters to be considered before the agreement could be reached including the question of the lease and the [s66W](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66w.html) certificate. I do not accept that evidence either. The lease problem had been overcome and the [s66W](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66w.html) certificate was never a problem and it was not required. 
While Mr Bykowski was in the city, on an appointment of which he gave evidence, the solicitor for the second defendant somehow made contact with him. He told that solicitor, a Mr Healy, that Mr George had made a decision and further discussions were pointless. He received a further telephone call from Mr Healy who said he had instructions to place a caveat on Mr George's property. On what basis he could possibly have claimed such an interest existed is quite unexplained.
In any event Mr Bykowski had further discussions with his client and with Mr Healy, and it was ultimately arranged they would meet for further discussions. They did and sometime around 1.30am on 7 April
Mr George entered into an unconditional contract to sell the property to the second defendant for a sum of $202500 together with an undertaking that the purchaser would indemnify Mr George against any liability in respect of any claims for costs or damages made by Jillsea. That of course protected Mr
George from the risk of an order for costs being made against him in this instant action. 
Mr Bykowski again became uncontactable explaining this in evidence by saying that the agreement with the purchaser was that any contact with Mrs
Robinson would be made by the purchaser's solicitors Mr Healy. In view of his statements made on 6 April, to put this in its kindest light, it showed a complete disregard by Mr Bykowski of his professional obligations towards a fellow practitioner. Solicitors cannot abrogate their responsibility to behave properly because their client tells them to behave improperly. That does not mean that I am saying that Mr Bykowski was bound to send the amended option documents to Mrs Robinson if his client instructed him to do otherwise. It does mean however that he should have told Mrs Robinson of the instructions he had received.
I turn now to the issues.
Apart from the statutory requirements was agreement reached?
This depends upon whether delivery of a signed copy of the option to the plaintiff was necessary for a binding agreement to be brought into existence.
This is not an easy question. The apparently unnecessary provisions of [s66ZG(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zg.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) requiring the option document to be signed in duplicate by both parties makes what used to be the simple procedure of paying the option consideration in exchange for an option document signed by the grantor insufficient to bring about a binding agreement and even exchange of counterparts is not sufficient. It is thus difficult to know when an agreement is made. But I consider the evidence of Mrs Dimos established that she considered delivery was necessary; nothing else can explain her desire to get the signed document into her hand or explain the acceptance by the grantee of the need to increase the option exercise price by $60000 and nothing else can explain the desire of Mrs Robinson on 6 April to collect the document when signed. To some extent also that is supported by the form of option which is stated to be a deed. The signature of Mr George was not witnessed so that it could not operate as a deed.
Consideration of $1000 was given for it and that would be sufficient. However delivery is required for a deed and I consider the evidence of the parties showed that delivery was a condition of a binding agreement being reached. It is of course not at all unusual for a client to sign a document in the office of a solicitor but that does not of itself show that a binding agreement has been arrived at even if the terms have been agreed upon. It was not, I think, a question of not trusting Mr Bykowski but a question of binding the parties which brought about this need for delivery.
This finding would be an end to the matter but as the case has been carefully argued I will deal with all other matters raised because if I were wrong on the first point the others make it clear that the plaintiff's claim must fail.
Claim on the option of 31 March 1995 at $120000
Whatever else is clear, I think it is clear that the parties accepted that no binding agreement came into existence on 31 March 1995. On the evidence the offer of $60000 more was not put forward as an amendment to an existing agreement but as an offer to enter into an option for the sum of $180000.
While the fax document of 6 April referred to the amending of the deed of option in the manner referred to, I think it is clear that the parties did not consider that there was an agreement binding upon them at that stage and I do not think there was. Thus the argument put forward by the plaintiff that, if the faxed letter of 6 April 1995 was ineffective to bring about a binding amendment then the initial contract continued to exist, must fail. I should add that in my view it is clear that the amending letter could not bring into force a binding agreement as it was not executed in duplicate and that I think is accepted now by the plaintiff's counsel.
Breach of [s66ZG(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zg.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)
This section requires the option document to be signed in duplicate. There are differences in the two documents which were signed by Mr George. The differences relate not to the option itself but to the contract which is annexed to it but obviously if the option agreement is to be in duplicate and a copy of the contract is to be annexed then the annexed document must be in duplicate as well.
The differences in the two documents are (1) that in
Schedule 1 one of the documents provides that a land tax adjustment is required whereas the other provides that-no land tax adjustment is required and (2) one of the documents provides that vacant possession is to be given on completion whereas the other document does not provide whether vacant possession is to be given or whether the property is sold subject to existing tenancies. Thus the two documents are not duplicates as they are not identical. Unless they are signed in duplicate they are not binding. Subject to any rectification claim that is also conclusive against the defendant as they are void.
There is a further problem as under Item 5 of the Schedule to the option the purchase price is $120000 so that without rectification the option document does not represent the agreement reached.
Breach of [s66ZG(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zg.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)
Under this section an option is void if exercisable "within 42 days after it is granted". The option which was signed by the parties provides that it cannot be exercised before the expiration of 45 days "from the date of this deed". The deed as I have said was dated 31 March. If I were to have found that an option agreement came into existence on 6 April then the argument on behalf of the defendants was that it could have been exercised after the expiration of 45 days from 31 March and yet have been exercisable within 42 days of 6 April. In my view the defendant must fail on this point. The date of the deed in my view must be the real date not some date inserted in some document which is incorrect. I would find for the plaintiff on this ground.
Breach of [s66ZH(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zh.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)
The defendant claims to have rescinded the option on the ground of non-compliance with this section.
To be effective the option is required to contain a form prescribed by the regulations relating to the cooling off period (cooling off notice). The form at the relevant date was that prescribed by clause 8 of the Conveyancing (Sale of Land) Regulation 1988. The form annexed to the contract does not comply because the words "purchaser's rights" are not in capitals in bold type at least 3mm high. If the certificate is not given as required either party may rescind. As the cooling off rights are given to the purchaser/grantee only it is impossible to explain why the grantor should be entitled to rescind if the notice of such rights is not included. No explanation is given in either of the Second Reading Speeches. It is significant that only the purchaser has the same right in respect of the cooling off statement required pursuant to s66X in regard to contracts for the sale of residential property as opposed to options for the purchase of residential property.
The plaintiff's answer to this purported rescission is to rely on [s80(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s80.html) of the [Interpretation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) and claim that there has been substantial compliance, to which the defendant responds that the [Interpretation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) applies to an instrument except in so far as a contrary intention appears in the instrument [(s5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s5.html) When a regulation descends to such particularity as requiring letters to be in capitals of a certain height it is difficult to say there is substantial compliance in anything other than infinitesimal differences. It is the same sort of problem as arose when property measurements were described down to a one quarter of an inch with the words "all measurements a little more or less" being added.
The more precise the measurements the less scope for "more or less". In the same way the more detailed the requirements of the statutory form the less scope there is for substantial compliance. I was referred to a number of cases on the question of substantial compliance in connection with s205 of the Corporations Law where questions of degree or of practical effect and prejudice were considered but those cases and that section are directed to different matters. A specific requirement of the form is that certain words be in capital letters of certain height. It is difficult to see how there could be substantial compliance if the letters are not capitals. It is not to the point that there is no prejudice to the grantor who had no rights under the notice; that is perhaps legislative folly but it is for the legislature to fix. The same sort of reasoning applies to deciding whether the "contrary intention" referred to in [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s5.html) of the [Interpretation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) exists. on this point I consider it does.
Thus the rescission was valid.
Breach of [s66ZI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zi.html) of the [Conveyancing Act, 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) [S66ZI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zi.html) requires that there be attached to the option document at the time it is granted certain documents. Failure to comply gives a right to either party to rescind. The 1st defendant has purported to rescind.
The documents to be attached are a copy of the proposed contract for the sale of the property (excluding particulars of the purchaser but including particulars of the purchase price) and the documents required by [ss52(A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s52.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) to be attached to the contract before signature by the purchaser. The defendant says that these required documents were not attached because (a) the purchase price is not included or the correct price is not included as the schedule provides for a purchase price of $120000 not $180000; the agreed terms as to land tax and the sale being subject to existing tenancies are not set out and a copy of the lease is not annexed.
These matters are all true. Unless they can be subject to a rectification claim they are fatal. Such a claim for rectification is made (perhaps not as to the price but possibly this was intended). It is said that there was no requirement under [s52A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s52a.html) to annex the lease. That is quite correct but I have found that the agreement was that a copy of the lease be annexed. Without it the contract is not the contract it was agreed should come into existence.
Without rectification the other matters are fatal to the plaintiff.
Rectification
The alterations sought by way of rectification are: altering the date of the option documents from 31 March 1995 to 6 April 1995; altering the purchase price in the option schedule to $180000; deleting the words "the total option fee and" from clause 7 of the schedule (this has the effect of not bringing the initial option fee in as part of the purchase price if the option is exercised); altering the schedule to the contract of sale annexed to the option so that no land tax adjustment is required and so that the sale is subject to existing tenancy.
The difficulty about this claim is that it is not sought to rectify a written agreement because it does not properly set out the agreement reached between the parties. What is sought is to amend a written agreement because a subsequent agreement for alteration has been made. That is not a basis for rectification and that claim must fail.
Claim for an agreement to amend
This claim is based upon the offer in the letter of 6 April 1995 and the writing on it by Mr George. But an agreement to amend an option by its terms incorporates new provisions into the option agreement. If such an agreement were made it would have had to been made in duplicate signed by both parties.
It is not in duplicate. For the other reasons I have stated this claim would fail in the event.
It follows for all these reasons that the plaintiff's claim must fail and the summons should be dismissed. The defendants have filed a cross claim seeking positive declarations in the event I should find an option came into existence. The dismissal of the summons would probably have made the cross claim unnecessary in any event but in view of my findings that no agreement for option came into being I will dismiss the cross claim. Had an agreement come into force it would have been validly terminated by notice.
 
Law Reform
In this case, in view of the decision which I have come to about there not being any binding agreement, it could not be said that there is any apparent injustice to the plaintiff brought about by the provisions of
Division 9 of [Part 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p4) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) relating to options for the purchase of residential property. Nevertheless I think it would be wrong not to say something about the problems which seem to be raised as a result of those provisions.
In Lindsay versus Balgi (unreported, 23 March 1993, Equity Division
No /93) Hodgson J referred to the desirability of reconsidering the requirement of [s66ZG(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zg.html) that option contracts be signed in duplicate by both parties. He pointed out that this created considerable inconvenience and took away the certainty of determining when a contract came into existence through a formal exchange. No action was taken as a result of that suggestion. Like
Hodgson J it seems to me that the provision should be amended as what it does is to create uncertainty when that could easily be avoided and when it is obviously desirable there should be no uncertainty. A study of the Second
Reading Speeches on the relevant legislation in the Legislative Assembly and
Legislative Council make it clear that the intention was to see that both parties to the option obtained a copy of the document and both parties signed the document but to achieve that result it is clearly not necessary that both parties sign both copies.
There is a second matter which requires legislative consideration and that is [s66ZH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zh.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). There is no explanation given in the
Second Reading Speeches of the need for a cooling off period and notice. Only grantees are given rights by this requirement yet grantees really need no protection as there is no suggestion that they are in the habit of paying too much money as consideration for the purchase of the option. The purpose of the certificate so far as contracts for the sale and purchase of residential real estate are concerned is to do something to overcome the opportunity of a purchaser being gazumped but an option situation is entirely different from that. But even if it is considered that the annexing of the cooling off notice for some reason is necessary, it seems to be quite unjust and inappropriate to give to the grantor rights of rescission if a notice under which the grantor obtains no benefit whatever is not annexed to the option agreement. What that does is to enable a grantor to take advantage of a mistake when no detriment is suffered by the grantor by reason of the mistake. This provision is unlike the provision in [s66X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66x.html) for a cooling off notice in contracts for the sale and purchase of residential property pursuant to which only the purchaser can rescind if the notice is not annexed. The legislative intention is clear enough. The efforts to reduce gazumping and the vendor disclosure requirements were not to be circumvented by the use of option agreements. But these matters were dealt with by providing that the cooling off period did not apply to contracts entered into pursuant to option agreements and by declaring void options which could be exercised within 42 days of grant and by requiring a copy of the proposed contract with the documents required under [s52A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s52a.html) of the
Act to be annexed to the option documents. No more was required. At the very least the rights under [s66ZH(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zh.html) should be restricted to the grantee, if only the grantee has rights. It is possibly relevant to note that in 27 years as a solicitor
I never came across a sorry grantee of an option but I did come across a number of sorry grantors. Their sorrow arose through offers higher than the option exercise price being made for property.
For sake of completeness I add that the right given by [s66ZI(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66zi.html) to a grantor to rescind if the required documents are not attached to the option agreement appears to give the grantor undeserved rights and should be-compared with [s52A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s52a.html)
These 3 matters should I suggest be the subject of consideration by the law making authorities.
