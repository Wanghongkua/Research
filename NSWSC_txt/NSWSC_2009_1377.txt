Friday 11 December 2009  /06 Michael Wilson & Partners Limited versus Robert Colin Nicholls & Ors 
JUDGMENT 
The state of these proceedings 
The reserved judgment The reserved judgment in these proceedings was delivered on 6 October 2009.
Bearing in mind the extensive causes of action and defences relied upon the
Court reserved to the party's liberty, should either wish to contend that the reasons had omitted to deal with a pleaded course of action or defence, to make submissions accordingly.
 
MWP's rights to elect as between remedies Additionally paragraph 649 dealt with MWP's rights to elect as between remedies: 
Outside of the finding against MWP that it is disentitled to the remedy of a constructive trust, the Court will permit MWP to address on the remedies in respect of which it contends that it is entitled to an election. That will include its entitlement to address on the so-called 'split election' option.
Naturally the defendant will also be entitled to make submissions on these matters. At the same time the parties will be permitted to address on questions relating to the propriety of provision being made for just allowances.
 Both parties have now sought to take advantage of those observations.
 
Relief-overview Before moving on it is appropriate to repeat paragraphs 371, 374 and 375 of the reasons: In the area of relief [against what used to be called equitable fraud], of which profiting from a fiduciary position is one example, the precise form of relief must be moulded to satisfy the demands of justice and good conscience in the particular case: "the court must look at the circumstances in each case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied" (Chalmers versus Pardoe [[1963] 1 WLR 677], at p 682; [[1963] 3 All ER 552], at p ; "the equity of the transaction must shape the measure of the relief":
Beatty versus Guggenheim Exploration Co [122 NE 378], at p 389.
 [Per McClelland J United Surgical Corporation versus Hospital Products at ]...
 Apart from the limited power to award damages in addition to or in substitution for equitable relief, the court has an inherent power to grant relief by way of monetary compensation for breach of a fiduciary or other equitable obligation: see Nocton versus Lord Ashburton [[1914] AC 932], at pp 946, 956, ; McKenzie versus McDonald <case>; [[1927] VLR 134], at p 146; Holmes versus Walton [[1961] WAR 96]; cf Seager v
Copydex Ltd [[1967] 1 WLR 923]; [[1967] 2
All ER 415]; [[1969] 1 WLR 809]; [[1969] 2
All ER 718.] The nature and extent of this remedy have been discussed by I
E Davidson in an illuminating article entitled "The Equitable Remedy of
Compensation" in [[1982] MelbULawRw ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/1982/4.html "View Case" ); [13 Melbourne University Law Review 349.] This remedy differs from an account of profits in that the loss to the plaintiff rather than the gain to the defendant is the measure of relief. The principles of assessment of equitable compensation do not necessarily coincide with those applicable to common law damages.
 
The plaintiff's submissions MWP has produced in excess of 46 pages of close further submissions. Certain of those submissions are unexceptional as for example seeking clarification of the meaning of certain phrases in the reasons. Other of those submissions are more substantive.
 
Paragraph 282 MWP has sought clarification of paragraph 282 iii. That sub-paragraph was intended to read: iii Work done for both Pinegrove and Roxi on the Roxi AIM admission.

The principal reasons will make this clear by a corrigendum.
 
Minor Corrections to the published reasons There are a small number of errors of a minor nature in the reasons for judgment. These matters will be corrected in the principal judgment by way of corrigendum.
 
Approach to dealing with the plaintiff's submissions I intend to deal with the plaintiff's submissions reasonably shortly and where practicable, to follow the order in which those submissions were put forward.
 There were large sections of the submissions which simply repeated sections from the reasons and of course it is generally unnecessary to repeat those.
 
Paragraph 578 of the reasons MWP has taken issue with this paragraph in the reasons. The contention is that the matter referred to was not raised against MWP at the hearing, either orally or in written submissions.
 With respect to this contention the following matters should be noted: the matter referred to in the subject paragraph was by no means an essential factor in relation to the decision that MWP had not made good any entitlement to a constructive trust: cf the other factors referred to in the reasons [at 570-576; 579-580]; to suggest that the issue was not dealt with in the proceedings where Mr Wilson was examined and re-examined for weeks is incorrect. One only example of his cross-examination in this regard may be found at transcript .1, a subject generally commenced at transcript 626. See also the reasons at 599.
 
Breaches of duties by Mr Nicholls The initial submissions dealt with the various parameters of breaches of duties found in the reasons concerning Mr Nicholls.
 In this regard it is important to tread carefully. One must not overlook of the fact that where alternative remedies for the same wrongful conduct are available, it would be inequitable to grant more than one of them. MWP's submissions from time to time fall into this error. [cf United States
Surgical Cooperation versus Hospital Products International Pty Ltd [[1982] 2
NSWLR 766] [at 819] per McLelland J; see also Meagher Gummow and
Lehane's Equity Doctrine and Remedies, fourth edition, Butterworths by Meagher
RP, Heydon JD & Leeming MJ at [5-208] observing as follows in relation to co-existence of remedies: 
It must be remembered... that a fiduciary relationship may co-exist with contract, and a fiduciary may owe its principal, duties breach of which sound in damages in tort or gives rise to other common law remedies.
 
Cf Westminster City Council versus Porter [[2003] Ch 436] [at 452] where
Hart J observed : "that the claims were claims in respect of the same essential loss based on the same conduct giving rise to that loss and that accordingly, the basic principles of compensation applicable to each of the claims was the same": referred to in the footnote at 437.
 As the principal reasons make clear [cf paragraphs 271-283] there were sundry breaches of the second limb of the rule in Barnes and Addy (1874) LR9
Ch App 244; [(1874) 43 LJ Ch 513]; treated with in relation to accessorial liability. Hence the findings concerning the breaches of duty by Mr Nicholls [and also concerning Mr Slater] identified those breaches by reference to the so-called 'no profit' and 'no conflict' rules.
 However using those labels as a mantra does not convert, what was in truth one form of wrongdoing, into more than one such form. Hence to my mind what the plaintiff has set out to achieve in its written submissions is largely: i. to pick up every reference to the no profit and no conflict rules found to have been breached; ii. to then seek to have the Court fix a disparate monetary sum to each such breach.
 
Further discovery orders MWP has observed that there is no evidence as to what profits Nicholls received as a result of the breaches of the 'no profit' duty, apart from the amounts which he received as a 'consultant'. MWP contends that equitable compensation should be awarded on the basis that the findings made should exceed the amount of profits. MWP contends that it should not be forced to make any election until a finding has been made as to what profits Nicholls did in fact receive as a result of the breaches of duty had been made, and a finding as to the amount of equitable compensation payable had been made.
 I disagree. In these particular proceedings the spectre of an interminable continuance of the litigation into the future looms large, is inappropriate and does not accord with the overriding purpose rule. A very extensive period of Court time has been taken during the hearing. There is no indication that there would be any utility in the making of further orders for the provision of information or for further discovery.
 Not to be overlooked is that section of the cross-examination of Mr Wilson [commencing at transcript 626] and continuing through many pages of close questioning as to the many sets of proceedings which had been or might still be commenced. In relation to one of the answers the question and answer went as follows: 
Question: "But the plaintiff has not commenced any proceedings against any of those parties asserting its entitlement 
Answer: No, not yet".
 In circumstances where the overriding purpose rule provides the template for the principled exercise of the sundry discretions which require to be exercised, this litigation [at least at first instance] requires to be closed off. The Court is able by moulding its appropriate orders, to cope with the circumstance where the commercial activities of the defendants left so very much to be desired in terms of the information imparted concerning their joint activities.
 In fairness to the plaintiff, Mr Walton SC accepted during argument that the question [of whether or not MWP should or should not be forced to make any election until a finding had been made as to what profits Nicholls did in fact receive as a result of the breaches of duty had been made] was a matter for the Court.
 
MWP's election Furthermore MWP positively elected for an award of equitable compensation as opposed to an account of profits.
 The principled approach in this particular circumstance is for the Court, doing the best that it can using the benefit of hindsight and notwithstanding the particular difficulties in doing so, to make findings as to the amount of equitable compensation payable to the plaintiff.
 The orders to be made in this regard draw their source from the principle 'Nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria'.
 The reasons [at 555-557] bear repeating: 
In an affirmation of that principle in which the actions of the defendant had made it "difficult to assess the compensation due to the plaintiff",
Handley JA put the matter as follows: "In my judgment the Court should assess the compensation in a robust manner, relying on the presumption against wrongdoers, the onus of proof, and resolving doubtful questions against the party 'whose actions have made an accurate determination so problematic'": Houghton versus Immer (No 155) Pty Ltd [(1997) 44 NSWLR 46], per Handley JA at 59.
 <case> at <case> et seq. There is a long line of authority to this effect [Cf. Broom's Legal
Maxims, 10th edition, Pakistan Law House, 1989 at 191 et seq., noting that this maxim, being 'based on elementary principles, is fully recognised in
Courts of law and equity, and indeed, admits of illustration from every branch of legal procedure'.] 
The principle and its application to several areas of law was discussed in the House of Lords by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle in Alghussein
Establishment versus Eton College [[1988] 1 WLR 587], with whose reasons Lord Bridge, Lord Elwyn-Jones, Lord Ackner and Lord Goff agreed. (at page 591).
 
The principle is applicable to 'various and dissimilar circumstances' [per
Broom at page 195].
 This matter is dealt with below.
 
Equitable compensation payable in respect of Mr Nicholls breach of the no- profit duty in respect of a number of disparate matters The summary table concerning elective rights [set out in the primary judgment at 653] is generally the subject of MWP's election in favour of equitable compensation as opposed to an account of profits.
 
Summary of claim for equitable compensation Shown below is a table comparing the plaintiff's claim for equitable compensation (which were largely based on Mr Schilling's expert report) against the baseline figures disclosed by legal invoices discovered by the defendants. Note that from this point forward, all dollar amounts are denoted in US dollars unless stated otherwise.

Project 
Plaintiff's claim 
Baseline figure  ---  
Chilisai (legal fees) $1,652,429.00 $218,630.00  
Chilisai (Sunkar shares) Â£9,590,000.00 Â£0.00  
Urals Gold $398,322.00 $109,292.00  
Roxi Petroleum (Schilling) $250,000.00 $250,000.00  
Karamandybas â‚¬163,992.00 â‚¬163,992.00  
Ravinnoye â‚¬124,419.00 â‚¬124,419.00  
Beibars Munai â‚¬101,817.00 â‚¬101,817.00  
Ablai $500,000.00 $31,959.00  
Lancaster $19,504.00 $19,504.00  
Kangamiut Seafoods $167,500.00 â‚¬39,750.00  In this regard their are a number of matters which required to be taken into account: 
The Chilisai (Sunkar shares) column has a baseline figure of zero.
The Sunkar shares will be dealt with below.
 
Regarding the Roxi Petroleum transaction, the plaintiff has contended that it is entitled to the face value of the receipts for the Ravinnoye and
Beibars Munai transactions in addition to an amount of $250,000.00 set out by
Mr Schilling.
 
Notably, the plaintiff has omitted any election regarding the
Karamandybas transaction (the face value of invoices being â‚¬163,992.00. There is a presumption that an election has been made regarding those invoices in line with the other transactions.
 
Dealing with the claims regarding Sunkar shares The reasons in the principal judgment are to be found between paragraphs and 427.
 It is strictly unnecessary to repeat those reasons. The essence of the matter is that the defendants concealed these continuing activities from the plaintiff.
 In consequence the plaintiff was not in a position to do otherwise than to satisfy the court that there was strong evidence to suggest that Temujin received Sunkar shares from the pre- IPO placing.
 This is a paradigm example of the need for the nullus principle to be engaged.
 
Roxi Petroleum project Regarding the Roxi Petroleum project and its three sub-transactions, the principled approach is to allow the plaintiff to claim the Euro amounts that reflect the face value of the invoices for the Karamandybas, Ravinnoye and
Beibars Munai transactions.
 However, to allow the $250,000.00 in Mr Schilling's report in addition to the face value of the invoices would effectively mean that the plaintiff is compensated twice. This is not an appropriate course.  
Unexceptional figures There are some figures in the MWP's claim for equitable compensation that are uncontroversial. These are as follows: a) The Roxi Petroleum transaction invoices yielded a total face value of â‚¬390,228.00. As such receipts are concrete evidence of benefits obtained by the defendants, the plaintiff can be compensated for this amount (plus interest) accordingly.
 b) The amount claimed by the plaintiff for the Lancaster matter is identical to the amount discovered in invoices for legal fees of $19,504.00.
 
Discounted figures The balance of the claim by the MWP to be dealt with requires a discount factor. The appropriate discount figure in all of the circumstances is 10%.
 Insofar as MWP has contended that the strict liability approach for breach of the no conflict duties might have been departed from in the reasons, that was certainly not intended. However that is not to say that there can never be a circumstance in which contingencies may not be accounted for. As was observed by the learned authors of Meagher, Gummow and Lehane - Equity
Doctrine and Remedies 4th edition [at 41-040] "equitable remedies are susceptible of adjustment to the particular case in a way which the law does not envisage".
 To an extremely limited extent these proceedings permit such an approach.
 The discounted amounts are shown below:

The non-conflict duty: remedies MWP is not entitled under the second limb of the rule in Barnes versus Addy [in respect of the "no profit duty", "duty of loyalty", "no harm" duty and "duty of confidence] to an entirely disparate and separate form of equitable compensation to that referred to earlier in these reasons. The reference to
United States Surgical has already been quoted.
 The same misconception follows in MWP's submissions where in similar fashion it seeks to now focus upon the alleged remedies in relation to be 'no conflict' duty.
 
Treating with the issue The simplest approach is to commence with identifying the areas in respect of which the Court rejects particular claims put forward by MWP namely the claim with respect to the Benkala Copper losses is rejected.
 
Conspiracy In the course of the reserved judgment the Court observed [at 582] that it was difficult to see what additional remedy, if any, might be applicable apropos the findings concerning the tort of conspiracy.
 Following the further submissions received from both parties the finding is that MWP is not entitled to any separate relief by reason of its success in having the conspiracy allegations upheld. The findings concerning the tort of conspiracy were totally intertwined with the findings in relation to the breaches of fiduciary duty and similar.
 Not only is there no principled way for the court to give additional damages for the conspiracy holding; but even if that was not the case, the majority decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Harris v
Digital Pulse Pty Ltd  <case> makes clear that the New South Wales Supreme Court has no power to make a punitive monetary award for breach of fiduciary duty where that duty arises in the context of a contractual relationship. Further as Heydon J [albeit obiter] observed, the New South Wales Supreme Court has no power to award exemplary damages for equitable loss.
 In passing I accept the defendants' contention that MWP's third further amended commercial list statement filed on 26 June 2009 did not seek exemplary damages in respect of the conspiracy count. It is inappropriate at this late stage for the Court to grant leave to seek such exemplary damages. That application is refused.
 
Returning to the 'Nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria' principle I do not understand anything in Harris versus Digital Pulse to be inconsistent with the court's power in an appropriate case to engage the nullus commodum capere potest principles set out in what follows. Harris was concerned with the rejection of the power to make a punitive monetary award in a context in which fiduciary obligations arose because of the existence of a contractual relationship of a particular character.
 As the Chief Justice observed [at 47] in certain contexts it is perfectly understandable that the conduct of the fiduciary is a relevant consideration in determining where, within the relevant range, justice between the parties indicates that a particular choice should be made. That process offered no analogy with the award of a separate and discrete remedy over and above any damage to the beneficiary or profit to the fiduciary.
 The engaging of the principal that no man can take advantage of his own wrong stands well apart from an attempt to award exemplary damages for breach of fiduciary duty. As Heydon J observed [at 441]: "the plaintiff's argument in Harris was that equity already possessed the power to award exemplary damages, or that if it did not it ought to, by fashioning or moulding its relief so as to conform to the common-law power to award exemplary damages where the factual circumstances were similar to those in which, had the plaintiff sued in tort, exemplary damages would be available".
 This is far removed from the jurisprudence which informs the principle that no man can take advantage of his own wrong.
 The reasons [at 554] made clear that these proceedings constituted an area where this maxim required to be borne in mind: 
This principle which is enlivened by way of a presumption against the wrongdoer may be invoked for the purpose of quantifying damages That finding was of course equally apt to permit the wrongdoer principle to be invoked for the purpose of quantifying equitable compensation.
 In Houghton versus Immer (No 155) [1997 44 NSWLR 46] the Court of
Appeal had occasion to apply this principle. As the headnote [at 47] makes clear: 
Because there was no direct evidence of the cost of improvements and the assessment of compensation had been made difficult by the failure of the partnership to keep accounts, the Court should assess compensation robustly, relying on the presumption against wrongdoers and resolving doubts against those whose actions had made the determination problematic.
 [Reference was made to Armory versus Delamirie as well as to LJP Investments
Pty Ltd versus Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) [(1990) 24 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2024%20NSWLR%20499 "View LawCiteRecord" )
 
In the well-known case, Armory versus Delamirie (1722) 1 Stra 505, the plaintiff chimney sweepers boy found a jewel and carried it to the defendant's shop (who was a goldsmith) to know what it was and delivered it into the hands of an apprentice, who under pretence of weighing it, took out the stones. The apprentice denying his wrongdoing delivered back to the plaintiff the socket without the stones. As to the value of the jewel, several of the trade were examined to prove what a jewel of the finest water that would fit the socket would be worth; and the Chief Justice directed the jury, that unless the defendant did produce the jewel and show it not to be of the finest water, they should presume the strongest against him, and make the value of the best jewels the measure of their damages.] [cf Black and Kellner 343 Family Law Reports as to circumstances in which those who fail to make full and substantial disclosure of relevant affairs are unable to rely on an absence of evidence to prevent the making of orders] The current circumstances and findings amply justify the Court in assessing the equitable compensation sought robustly relying on the aforesaid presumption against wrongdoers and resolving doubts against those whose actions had made the determination problematic.
 In all of the circumstances the defendants in addition to the other orders reflected in these reasons will be required to pay equitable compensation to
MWP in the sum of $AUS4,000,000.00.
 
The second defendant ("Slater") Slater stands in almost all respects in the same position as Nicholls and the orders made against Slater will be in exactly the same form as those against Nicholls.
 The sole exception is in relation to breach of Slater's contractual duties, where the period of breach in relation to the terms implied into his contract (see paragraph 41 of the pleading which replicates the plea against Nicholls) concludes on 9 January 2006 and there is no notice period in respect of
Slater's contract as is the case with Nicholls.  
The third defendant ("TSL"), the fourth defendant ("TIL") and the fifth defendant ("TFZE") Save for conspiracy, where a general finding is made in respect of all the defendants at paragraph 289 of the Reasons, no express findings of liability are made in respect of any of the corporate defendants.
 However: 
Findings are made at paragraphs 27, 52, 122, 124, 125, 127, 134, - 190, 280 iv (where TIL is equated to Slater), 281, 282, 283, 412-6, 422 and 426 of the Reasons in relation to TIL; 
At paragraphs 51, 242-3, 280 i of the Reasons in relation to
TSL. (See in particular the finding at paragraph 280 i, where there is a finding that Nicholls and Slater acted in breach of the "no profit" rule in establishing TIL and TSL.) 
The above findings implicate both TIL and TSL in breaches of fiduciary duty and the inducement of breaches of Emmott's contract.

No express finding of liability under Barnes versus Addy is made in relation to TSL, TIL or TFZE.

The evidence yields to the propriety of making a finding that all of the corporate defendants were creatures of the partnership found by the
Court to have been established by Nicholls, Slater and Emmott at paragraphs -3 and 224 of the Reasons.

Although this contention is in fact noted at paragraph 28 of the Reasons no positive finding was made in respect of it.

That further finding is made.
 Accordingly, on the above basis, the liability of TSL, TIL and TFZE in relation to accessorial liability in equity and in tort is appropriate to be made on the basis that the liability of those companies follows the liability of Slater and Nicholls, their effective controllers.
 
The seventh defendant ("THL") Findings are made with respect to THL at paragraphs 57 and 58 of the
Reasons. This company operated a bank account on behalf of TIL in circumstances that were entirely unexplained. It was not, on the evidence, a company controlled by Mr Slater or Mr Nicholls.
 During argument Mr Walton SC conceded that THL had played virtually no part in the proceedings. It is to be recalled that no appearance had been filed for
THL but leave to proceed against that entity was granted by the Court in May .
 In my view the paucity of evidence in relation to THL is such that it is simply inappropriate to grant any relief against it. Nor is it appropriate to do otherwise than to order that as between WMP and THL there is to be no orders made as to costs.
 
Costs Save as regards the approach to costs of the defendants 'abuse of process' application, the principled exercise of the relevant discretion is to order that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of pursuing its claims against the defendants. The plaintiff has succeeded in almost every aspect of its pleaded case against the defendants. The usual rule as to costs, that they follow the event, should apply: UCPR r.42.1.
 The principled exercise of the relevant discretion requires that any existing costs orders in the defendants' favour should be set off against the far greater liability that the defendants have to the plaintiff in terms of costs. This has significance for the plaintiff's application [dealt with below] to have the security it has provided for the defendants' cost released.
 
Reserved Costs MWP has produced a schedule of those occasions on which costs have been reserved over time in respect of various applications in the matter. That schedule is reproduced below.

MWP's Notice of Motion dated 26 August 2009 re subpoena to produce to Mr
Emmott
Reserve costs.  
Dealing with the issue I accept that the costs associated with these applications should form part of the general costs order in favour of MWP, being the successful party in the proceedings.
 Since the commencement of these proceedings in October 2006, fifteen separate orders have been made that costs of applications made in the proceedings be reserved.
 UCPR r.42.7(1) provides that unless the Court orders otherwise, the costs of any interlocutory application, including costs that are reserved, are to be paid and otherwise dealt with in the same way as the general costs of the proceedings.
 This means that the successful party to the proceedings is entitled to the reserved costs of the interlocutory hearing: Idoport Pty Limited versus National
Australia Bank Limited <case> at <case>.
 The relevant principles are set out in Idoport at [14]: subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful party in litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour. If the litigation had not been brought by the unsuccessful party, the successful party would not have incurred the expense which it did: Oshlack versus Richmond River Council <case>; [(1998) 193 CLR 72], per McHugh J at 97; see also Surf Road Nominees Pty
Ltd versus James <case> per Einstein J at [48].
 "the event" which costs ordinarily follow can be considered as the commercial result, so that a successful party may recover all its costs where the objective sought by the litigation is achieved, even though the party does not succeed on every issue in the litigation: see for example New South Wales
Dairy Corporation versus Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd [(1989) 14 IPR ] at ; and an analogy may be drawn with matters involving multiple issues. In these cases it is generally not appropriate for the Court to attempt to determine which issues were won by particular parties, to what extent they were won, and what was the amount of time spent on each of the issues so as to apportion costs accordingly. Such an approach would be contrary to the trend of decisions in relation to the exercise of discretion as to costs: Waters v
P C Henderson (Australia) Pty Ltd (NSWCA 6 July 1994 unreported, per Mahoney
JA at 5) (with whom Priestley JA and Kirby P agreed). In the same way, the costs of these interlocutory hearings should be determined by the result of the principal litigation of which these interlocutory hearings form but a part. As such, it is not necessary for the Court to consider the issues that arose in each of the interlocutory hearings in an attempt to apportion the costs of each of the various interlocutory hearings. In O'Keeffe Nominees Pty
Ltd versus BP Australia Ltd (No 2) <case>; [(1995) 55 FCR 591] Spender J at 598 to 599 said: 
It is not necessarily just that the costs of an interlocutory application should follow the result of that interlocutory application but rather should be determined by the result of the principal litigation of which the interlocutory application forms but a part. (Emphasis added); I accept that it would be artificial in the present case to isolate each of the interlocutory hearings and to apply any different test from that which applies to the costs of the proceedings generally: Idoport at [6]. The interlocutory hearings concerned, amongst other things, freezing orders, confidentiality undertakings, applications for leave to amend the pleadings, applications in relation to discovery and leave to rely on documents discovered and produced under Subpoenas and Notices to Produce in related proceedings.
 There are no special circumstances in this case to disturb the operation of the usual rule, such that the plaintiff is entitled to the reserved costs of the interlocutory hearings.
 
The notice of motion for abuse of process: indemnity costs against the defendants The notice of motion filed by the first to fifth defendants on 10 July 2009 relating to the defendants' claim that these proceedings were an abuse of process by the plaintiff, consistently with paragraphs 583 to 644 of the reasons for judgment, must be dismissed.
 Independently of any entitlement to costs of the proceedings generally the plaintiff is entitled to costs occasioned by the defendants' notice of motion.
The plaintiff however seeks an order under s. 98(1) [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) that those costs be paid on an indemnity basis for the following reasons.

The relief sought in the defendants' application was that the plaintiff's proceedings be struck out in limine.

The plaintiff opposed the application at the outset. The application proceeded over the plaintiff's objection when the Court decided that it would be heard in conjunction with the plaintiff's proceedings and would be determined at the conclusion of those proceedings.
 Paragraph 601 of the reasons made plain that without exception the grounds relied upon by the defendants in relation to the so-called abuse of process case failed.
 Paragraph 590 of the reasons referred to Dey versus Victorian Railways
Commissioners <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 62] where Dixon J said at 91: 
A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the Court ... [O]nce it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the Court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process.
 In General Steel Industries Inc versus Commissioner for Railways  <case>; [(1964) 112 CLR 125] Barwick
CJ, in a similar vein, said at 130: ....great care must be exercised to ensure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed tribunal.
 
See also Jago versus District Court of NSW <case>; [(1989) 168 CLR 23] per Gaudron J at 76.
 I accept that there was never any reasonable basis for the making of the application nor was there ever any reasonable prospect of it succeeding.
 The deliberate pursuit of the application added very substantially to the time taken in the conduct of the proceedings. For example almost all of the cross-examination of Mr Wilson went to this issue as did all the attempts to lead otherwise irrelevant evidence concerning the so-called Swiss prosecution, including the cross-examination of Mr Radosavljevic. All this added significantly to the costs incurred by the plaintiff in conducting the case.
 As MWP has contended that these factors enliven the jurisdiction for indemnity costs.

See in particular, in relation to arguments that were self-evidently hopeless or bound to fail, the Court of Appeal's decision in Huntsman
Chemical Company Australia Ltd versus International Pools Australia Limited [(1995) 36 NSWLR 242] (per Kirby P at 249-250).
 
See also in relation to the raising of deliberately false defences or allegations of fact Degmam Pty Limited (in liq) versus Wright (no 2) [[1983] 2
NSWLR 354 (Holland] J).
 
Conclusion For those reasons the costs orders which are to be made will be as follows :

The Court orders that the notice of motion filed by the first to fifth defendants on 10 July 2009 be dismissed.

The Court orders that pursuant to [s.
(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) the first to fifth defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs of the notice of motion on an indemnity basis.

Subject to the above order the Court also orders that the defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings including reserved costs.
 
Security for costs The plaintiff seeks an order releasing it from any continuing obligation to provide security for the defendants' costs of the proceedings. Security has been provided in the form of bank guarantees. This security was ordered pursuant to: paragraph 1 of the orders of 9 February 2007; paragraphs 1 and 2 of the orders of 7 December 2007; and paragraph 13 of the orders of 28 May 2008.
 The plaintiff has succeeded in its claims against the defendants. The defences have all been rejected. There is no reason for the defendants to continue to enjoy orders for security for costs in proceedings they have lost, particularly once final orders have been entered in favour of the plaintiff.
 I accept that the natural order on the successful conclusion for the plaintiff of the hearing is for any security it has provided for the costs of the defendants to be released. There is nothing left for the guarantees properly to secure.
 The form of the order will be: 
The Court orders that the plaintiff be released from the obligation to provide security for the defendants' costs of the proceedings pursuant to: paragraph 1 of the orders of 9 February 2007; paragraphs 1 and 2 of the orders of 7 December 2007; and paragraph 13 of the orders of 28 May 2008.
 
Application for a stay of orders pending appeal by the defendants The defendants have made clear that they have instructions to appeal from the decision in these proceedings. In that regard they have strongly contended that the appropriate way forward is for the court to stay its relevant orders until the commencement of term next year when the defendants would be required to seek a further stay from the Court of Appeal.
 The plaintiff has vehemently opposed this course especially by reason of its claim to be now entitled to be released from the obligation to provide security for the defendants' costs of the proceedings pursuant to the orders described above. It contends that bearing in mind the period of time which has expired since the principal judgment was handed down, and in the light of the proceedings having been set down for trial on issues of both quantum and liability, it has every entitlement to be released from the above described obligation to provide security for the defendants costs.
 In my view it is appropriate for the court to stay the operative orders to .00pm on 16 December 2009. However there is ample authority to the effect that a declaration cannot be stayed. A declaratory order is non-executory, it cannot be enforced.
