ALLOWED/DISMISSED DISMISSED 
JUDGMENT 
MEAGHER JA: These are two appeals from Mr Justice Bryson who made declarations in favour of the respondents in their claims to possessory title in respect of certain land.

The appellants' case has been put by Mr Ringrose and we have read carefully his written submissions. We have also listened attentively to the oral submissions which he has made practically for the whole of the day. However, at the end of the day we have been unable to detect any error in his Honour's reasons as a result of the submissions made by Mr Ringrose.

In so far as Mr Ringrose suggested, as the first of his four submissions, that there was no evidence of occupying of the vital land, we are of opinion that there is ample evidence which his Honour referred to.

In so far as he submitted that the respondents held the land, in so far as they held it at all, as tenants or licencees, we think this cannot possibly be true for the reasons advanced by his Honour.

In so far as his third submission is concerned, it concerned the effect of s164 of the Conveyancing Act and we are unable to see how this question arose in view of the fact that the vendors in question did not have title themselves.

His fourth submission was that even if the persons who gained possessory title did in fact gain it contrary to his principle submission, their efforts to transfer the title they gained have been ineffective. This is a submission which can only apply to lot O, as his Honour has found in lot Z that perfectly proper transfers were made.

The answer to his fourth submission is simply that the plaintiffs asserting possessory title of O, were in possession of lot O at the time the litigation commenced. For that reason it scarcely matters whether the title they derived from their predecessors was valid or invalid.

For those reasons we are, as I have said, unable to detect any error in his
Honour's reasons. We are therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and in our view the Court should adopt as its own the reasons of his Honour in the Court below.

GILES AJA: I agree.

SIMOS AJA: I agree.
