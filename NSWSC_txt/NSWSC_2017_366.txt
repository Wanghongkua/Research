JUDGMENT
The plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of orders under [sections 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) and [28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that act.
Section 10A(5) of the Act says the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person's interest in the property sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime related activity, stating the ground on which the suspicion therein is based, and that there is a reasonable ground for the suspicion. The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 5 April 2017.
Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the defendant is engaged in serious crime related activity or activities, being the commission of the offences of supplying a prohibited drug not less than the commercial quantity and supplying a drug not less than a large commercial quantity, both contrary to section 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 , and the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to [section 193B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) being an offence involving money laundering. These offences all fall within the definition of "serious criminal offence" under section 2B of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading the fact sheet prepared by the police after the arrest of the defendant, to e-mail communication between her and the police officer whom she believed prepared the fact sheet, and her search of the COPS data base showing that the defendant was charged with the offences concerned.
In relation to the e-mail correspondence, Ms Bourne sought from the police officer a confirmation that he had prepared the fact sheet, that the facts sheet was true to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief and that it was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation. The officer provided confirmation of those matters and provided additional information suggesting that the offence of supplying a commercial quantity might be an alternative to the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity.
I have read the fact sheets and I am satisfied that Ms Bourne's suspicion that those offences have been committed is reasonably held. The fact sheet discloses that the defendant resides in Victoria and the information in the affidavit identifies the defendant's ownership of land in Victoria. However, section 10A(3) of the Act does not apply because the interests in the property are derived from serious crime related activity within New South Wales and not from external serious crime related activity.
The plaintiff seeks that the order be made without prior notice to the defendant. It does so based on what Ms Bourne says in paragraph 9 of her affidavit concerning the ability to dispose of motor vehicles or backdate transfer forms and to enter into unregistered mortgages of real property very quickly in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act. I am satisfied that orders should be made without prior notice to the defendant. The defendant has rights under section 10C of the Act to seek a review of these orders.
The plaintiff also seeks an order that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of the interests in the property specified in schedule 1 of the summons which consists of cash and a motor vehicle. I have read the reasons given for the seeking of that order in Ms Bourne's affidavit and I am satisfied that such an order should be made.
