JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On application for adjournment - observations in respect of the point of trial and defendant's "reservation" of its position as to further cross-examination - T7601) HIS HONOUR: The cross-examination of Mr Marsden has just completed and an application has been made to adjourn re-examination until 2 o'clock today.
 To put it as neutrally as possible, the defendant's position is, having completed the cross-examination of the plaintiff, that there remains outstanding a subject matter for cross-examination which can be described as "the Elomari tapes".
 I do not propose to rehearse the history of my dealing with "the Elomari tapes" subject matter: it is set out in paragraph 8 of my judgment of 20 June (NSWSC 559: DLJT 176), in which I granted a request by the defendant for a direction to the Chief Executive Officer to produce certain files to the
Court. Nor do I propose to rehearse my understanding of matters the subject of an Amended Summons for Leave to Appeal in the Court of Appeal which was stood over to a date to be fixed by that Court on 16 June.
 The present position in my Court is that the plaintiff's cross-examination has concluded and it is to be taken that it has concluded on all matters available for cross-examination arising from evidence in the trial over which
I have been presiding. That state of affairs, as far as I am presently concerned, is the end of the matter.
 However, it must be made clear in the light of the several occasions on which Mr Stitt sought to "reserve" or "preserve" his position, and certain observations in the transcript of the proceedings in the Court of Appeal last
Friday, that in appropriate circumstances and at an appropriate time, I will not do otherwise than what is proper for me to do, namely, entertain any application the defendant makes.
 This present trial has a present structure which, until either I change it or it is changed by virtue of an authoritative and binding result from another
Court, will continue to the conclusion of the evidence, submissions and to judgment.
 I grant the plaintiff's application to adjourn until 2 o'clock to enable preparation for re-examination.
