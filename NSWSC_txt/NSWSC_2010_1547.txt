WHEALY J 
MONDAY 22 NOVEMBER 2010 /256171 REGINA versus Keli LANE 
JUDGMENT: see page 2901 of transcript HIS HONOUR: I regret to say that I cannot agree with the Crown's submissions. I think the matter is covered by paragraph 77 and 78 of my earlier decision. That decision was taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal and as I understand it the Court of Criminal Appeal did not reverse me on that aspect of my decision. I think the matter the Crown wants to argue, although it is somewhat different from the matter we originally argued, essentially has the same problems with it as I identified in those paragraphs, and I would not in the exercise of my discretion allow the Crown to advance that argument.
