PROCEDURE - civil - [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) - restraining order  
JUDGMENT
A Summons was filed in the Registry of this Court on 4 May 2016 by the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, seeking a restraining order against the defendant, Thi Quyen Luu. The restraining order, pursuant to <case> of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1900 ("the Act"), would prohibit any person from dealing with any interests in property of the defendant, including her interest in the property as set out in Schedule One.
Section 10A of the Act provides for applications of this nature to be heard ex parte, and this application proceeded on that basis.
The plaintiff has filed an affidavit of Mr Jonathan Lee Spark, sworn 3 May 2016, in support of the application for a restraining order. Mr Spark is employed by the plaintiff as a Director of Financial Investigations and his affidavit sets out that he is an authorised officer. He is a person authorised in writing by the plaintiff generally to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of <case> and Part 4 of the Act.
As a result of his employment with the plaintiff, Mr Spark has had access to records held by the New South Wales Police Force on its Computerised Operational Policing System, and records held by Land and Property Information New South Wales, being a unit of the Department of Finance, Services and Innovation. He has also seen, on a number of occasions, information provided to the Commission by Westpac and is familiar with the nature and appearance of such information.
Mr Spark's affidavit sets out his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity as defined by <case> of the Act. The serious crime related activity is the supply of a prohibited drug (cannabis), contrary to <case> of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 , which is an offence falling within the definition of "serious criminal offence" provided by <case>(b) of the Act.
Mr Spark relies on a New South Wales Police Force Fact Sheet. The Fact Sheet outlines that on 21 March 2016 a search warrant was executed at an address in Fairfield Heights. The defendant and her co-accused were discovered inside the lounge room at the rear of the granny flat located on the property.
Police located a large open blue canvas bag in the lounge room of the granny flat. Inside the bag, police discovered nine clear plastic vacuum sealed bags with approximately 3.9 kilograms of cannabis head inside. Police also located a second open blue canvas bag inside the bathroom of the granny flat, containing ten clear plastic vacuum sealed bags with approximately 5 kilograms of cannabis head inside.
Also found on the property was $5000 in $50 dollar notes, four electronic scales, an electronic money counter, two packets of vacuum sealed bags, a large amount of various "high end" female clothing items, assorted crystals and $450 dollars in $50 notes in a wallet in a bedroom.
The defendant and her co-accused were subsequently arrested.
Police allege that the Fairfield Heights address was a safe house for the supply of prohibited drugs, and that the defendant and her co-accused are part of an elaborate criminal enterprise responsible for distributing cannabis to street level suppliers within the metropolitan area.
I have considered the material supplied by the plaintiff, including the affidavit of Mr Spark and I am satisfied that his suspicion about the defendant is reasonably held. I am prepared to make the orders sought by the plaintiff, pursuant to <case> of the Act.
