FRIDAY 7 MARCH 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from part of a decision by Master Macready given on 13 September 1996.

The plaintiff, a company in liquidation, has commenced these proceedings against its former directors. The directors sought security for costs (amongst other relief). The Registrar refused to order security. The directors had the matter reconsidered by a Master. The learned Master ordered that the plaintiff give security for costs in the sum of $20,000 within six weeks. The plaintiff has filed an appeal under Pt 60 of the Supreme Court Rules on the ground that the Master did not sufficiently recognise that he himself was exercising an appellate function from a Registrar. A further ground is that the Master should not have differed from the Registrar exercising a sound discretion or, if he was to do so, he should only do so by making it clear the reasons why he took a different approach.

Mr Epstein, who appeared for the appellant, put that when one reads the learned Master's judgment he did not expose his reasoning process as to why he came to a different view to that of the Registrar.

What I have just said anticipates a little because it is necessary to look at the initial application made to the court which was a notice of motion filed on 29 May 1995 for security for costs which was determined after a day's evidence taken on 20 September 1995 by Registrar Berecry, the learned
Registrar's judgment being given on 28 September 1995.

The application before the Registrar was on two grounds: that security for costs should be given because of the insolvency of the plaintiff because of s of the Corporations Law or that the proceedings were brought for the benefit of others so that Pt 53 r 2(1)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules was applicable.

The first basis is the only one that I really need consider. The learned
Registrar at pp 4 and 5 of his judgment weighed up the various factors and he said in the last three paragraphs of his judgment: "There is no suggestion that the creditors are without means. In fact some have already put the liquidator in funds. This ground is a stronger ground for exercising discretion in favour of the first to third defendants. However, it should not be considered in isolation.

It needs to be weighed against other factors. These proceedings are brought against directors and shareholders, they are not standing behind the company.
The proceedings are brought by the liquidator to recover money which the company has been deprived of because of the alleged breach of duty by the first to third defendants. It is arguable that the actions of the first to third defendants have contributed to the insolvency of the plaintiff and lastly on the material before me the plaintiff has reasonable prospects of success.

In my view I should exercise my discretion in favour of the plaintiff.
Therefore, the order I make is the Notice of Motion for security for costs be dismissed. The first to third defendants pay the plaintiff's costs." 
Section 121 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) constitutes the
Registrar as "the Court" for the purpose of the exercise of various powers including the powers to grant or refuse an application for security for costs.
However, <case> of the Act makes it clear that an order made by a Registrar may be set aside or varied by the Court. The word "Court" in that section, one would think, means "judge", but the practice for many years has been that the only way of dealing with the Registrar's decision is under the Supreme Court
Rules and the only provisions that are made for the examination of the correctness of the Registrar's decisions are Pt 61 r 3 which provides for "a review" or under Pt 80 r 21 and several other special rules which make provision for appeals. None of the rules which specifically deal with appeals from Registrars are applicable, so that the only way of examining a
Registrar's decision in this case is under Pt 61 r 3.

Mr Epstein puts that the review which is covered by Pt 61 r 3 is really an appeal from a person exercising the judicial power of the Supreme Court of New
South Wales under <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). He puts that a
Registrar when so acting is not "a mere delegate" but rather the Court itself.
Accordingly, he says a review is really an appeal in the strict sense by way of re-hearing and principles such as those set out in House versus The King <case>; [(1936) 55 CLR 499] are applicable. He then goes on to submit that the learned Master, although his reasoning process is not fully exposed, misdirected himself by considering that he was really dealing with the matter ab initio and was not bound by anything that the Registrar had determined or any discretion the Registrar had exercised.

The view that has been taken of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p61) r in the authorities has been quite contrary to that which Mr Epstein has put to the Court. The general view is set out by 
Santow J in Westpac Banking Corporation versus Abemond Pty Ltd (3 November, unreported. See also Beaufort Air-Sea Equipment Pty Ltd versus Emhart
Australia Pty Ltd (SC 
Malpass M, 18 December, 1992 unreported.) 
Mr Epstein says, however, that the decision of Santow J involved a completely different type of decision made by a Registrar than the decision that is being considered in the instant case. The decision made by the Registrar in the case before Santow J was really dealing with the question as to whether matters of discovery and other matters should be heard together, whereas the present case involves a far more "judge-like" task.

It may be that one can distinguish the decision of 
Santow J on that basis and it may be that one can say much the same thing about Re Brindle <case>; [(1992) 35 FCR 506], a decision of Hill J in the Federal Court where his Honour dealt with reviewing the decision of a Registrar extending a bankruptcy notice.

However, when one actually looks at the reasoning of Santow J, one can see that his Honour, in a very thorough review of all the authorities, nowhere restricted his view to any particular type of application that a Registrar was considering. In my view, his Honour meant to convey a general rule. Moreover, that general rule was in accordance with what has been the practice in this
Court for the last twenty-five years and the learned Master, when following that decision, correctly did so.

One can get to the same position by another route. As Mr Taylor SC for the respondents said: it is very significant that the word "review" is used in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p61) r
The drafter of the rules knew what an appeal was and, indeed, the word "appeal" is used in other parts of the rules such as [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p60) r and [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p80a) rr 21 and 23A. Despite this, the drafter has employed the word "review" in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/index.html#p61) r when dealing with Registrars.

The word "review" when used in connection with a Registrar's or even a
Master's decision before the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) had a very definite connotation. A party was entitled to have the judge actually make a personal decision on the matter. When the judge was so asked, the matter was conducted as an original hearing. See Watson versus Lazarevic [(1972) 22 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281972%29%2022%20NSWLR%20159 "View LawCiteRecord" ) The same point is picked up in Re Brindle and in other authorities.

Accordingly, in my view, the Master did proceed on the correct basis.

The next point to consider is whether the Master nonetheless should have paid greater weight to the opinions that have been formed by the Registrar.
Certainly, the Master was entitled to have adopted the Registrar's views.
Indeed there are indications in some of the cases before the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) that he might do so especially where the Registrar has conducted a long and involved enquiry before coming to his decision (Watson's case). Another instance is where there is taxation of costs involved, see Schweppes' Limited versus Archer <case>; [(1934) 34 SR 178],
In such cases it was unusual for the reviewing judge to depart from the view taken below though it was always open to him or her to do so.

The "principle" I have just stated is really, however, just a guideline and the authorities on reviews before the Act, which seem to me to carry through after the Act, make it clear that it is the Master who is exercising jurisdiction virtually for the first time. While he or she is entitled to merely adopt what the Registrar has done, the Master is not bound to do so but, indeed, is bound to look at the matter afresh and make a decision on the material which is presented to the Master's court.

The question for me is whether or not the learned Master exercised his discretionary jurisdiction in a way that was open to him to do so. As to this, he did look at what the Registrar had decided, but considered that it was really a matter of assessing the various factors and it was not a matter where anything that had been given in oral evidence before the Registrar was decisive. The relevant factors were present both before the Registrar and the
Master. The Master had the full transcript of what had happened before the
Registrar and was in a good position to make the assessment.

Mr Epstein acknowledged that the rule in Re Strand Wood Co Ltd [[1904] 2
Ch 1], that a court-appointd liquidator is not required to give security for costs save in exceptional circumstances, is inapplicable to the present situation where the company and not the liquidator is the plaintiff (Hession versus Century South Pacific [(1992) 28 NSWLR 120).] However, he put that the policy considerations upon which the Strand Wood principle was based are nonetheless applicable, "The rationale of the rule is partly that the liquidator is performing a public function on behalf of all the creditors and contributories of the company" (Re Pavelic Investments Pty Ltd [(1983) 8 ACLR 417]; [1 ACLC 1207] per Blackburn CJ).

Mr Epstein referred to two South Australian decisions to reinforce his submission, namely John Arnold's Surf Shop Pty Ltd versus Heller Factors Pty Ltd [(1979) 22 SASR 20] at 27 and 34-35 and Spiel versus Commodity Brokers Australia Pty
Ltd [(1983) 35 SASR 294] at 302.

I agree with Mr Taylor SC that the differences between South Australian and
New South Wales practice makes these decisions distinguishable. In this State, more emphasis is put on the defendant's position if unsuccessfully sued by an insolvent company.

Mr Epstein complains that the Master's reasons were not as full as they ought to have been. He says his client was entitled to have fuller reasons. However, it must not be overlooked that the Master was dealing with four different interlocutory appeals and they were interconnected and the various factors had been identified.

Accordingly, it did not require the learned Master to set out as fully as might appear in some other judgments, his complete reasoning process. The factors included assessing the strength of the plaintiff's case. Both the
Registrar and the Master found that difficult both because of the way in which the statement of claim is framed and the fact that no defence was put on.
Both, however, indicated that they would proceed on the basis that the plaintiff may be successful. The Registrar said that it was arguable that the actions of the first to third defendants contributed to the insolvency of the plaintiff. With respect, that was a very weak statement.

The authorities on this factor cannot be found to lay down any set rule as to how far a court, when considering security for costs, must consider the likelihood of the defendants having contributed to the insolvency of the plaintiff. It is clearly established on the material that that did in fact happen. See, for instance, Lucas versus Yorke [(1983) 50 ALR 228]; M A
Productions Pty Ltd versus Austarama Television Pty Ltd [(1982) 1 ACLC 404], 408 and
GAI Holdings (No 3) Pty Ltd versus GAI Holdings (No 4) Pty Ltd [(1986) 4 ACLC ], .

The decision of Smithers, J in Newtons Travel Services Pty Ltd versus Ansett
Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1982) 1 ACLC 521], reminds judges dealing with this sort of application that the court has a wide discretion which is to be exercised according to the circumstances of the case.

It is only when looking to the circumstances of the case that one looks to see whether the want of means was brought about by the conduct of the defendants.
Although it is clear that the burden of proof has no part to play in this type of application, Sir Lindsay Parkinson & Co Ltd versus Triplan Ltd [[1973]
QB 609], 626 and the Newtons Travel Services case p 623, the Court is more likely to exercise its discretion against ordering security for costs, if the evidence of the defendant being the cause of the company's impecuniosity is weak. In one sense, almost anything can be said to be arguable. Thus, with respect, the
Registrar's statement that it could be argued that the action of the defendants brought about the insolvency is, strictly speaking, irrelevant.
However, it would not take very much more, in an appropriate case, to say that because there was a reasonable probability that that fact could be established in due course it would be appropriate to take the matter into account in the mix. It is a bit difficult to see how the evidence would justify a statement any stronger than the Registrar made and I do not really consider that, if this is as high as the matter goes, it is a vital factor to be taken into account in the exercise of discretion.

The learned Master made a decision, it was an original decision which he made, it was a discretionary decision and the authorities are fairly clear that such discretionary decisions should not be interfered with without it being demonstrated that there was some error involved in the reasoning. See
Prospect Electricity versus Advanced Glass Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd [(1996) 22 ACSR 6], 12-13. The Master seems to me to have taken into account the relevant factors, most of which are conveniently listed in KP Cable
Invesments Pty Ltd versus Meltglow Pty Ltd <case>; [(1995) 56 FCR 189], 197. He came to the view that it was appropriate that security for costs should be given. I can find nothing in the consideration by the learned Master which would justify me in interfering with his discretionary decision.

I should say one more thing. It is most regrettable that these proceedings, which were started in 1994 and in which the question of security for costs was decided by the Registrar in September 1995, which decision was reviewed by the
Master in September 1996 and then reconsidered by me in March 1997 have not yet proceeded to the stage of a defence. Delany on Security for Costs p 178 makes the point that an appeal against a decision to require security is one where the appellant's chances of success should and must be poor. See
Darrell Lea (Vic) Pty Ltd versus Union Assurance Society of Australia Limited <case>; [[1969] VR 401], 408. This is as it should be. There should be very limited possibilities of litigation being held up by interlocutory appeals.

In saying this I am not casting aspersions on any one in this case, I am merely talking generally.

Under the rules, as they are presently structured, there would appear to be both a review of the Registrar's decision by the Master and then an appeal to a judge. This is contrary to the spirit of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) which is that there should be hardly any appeals in interlocutory matters and, certainly, there should not be more than one appeal. It may be a matter which the Rules
Committee should consider as to whether there should be some specific provision to allow only one review or appeal where a Registrar is exercising the judicial power of the Court under <case>.

However, so far as this appeal is concerned, the order is: 
The appeal is dismissed with costs.

I extend the time for complying with the learned Master's order for fourteen days.
