COMMON LAW DIVISION  
BELL J  
WEDNESDAY, 31 OCTOBER 2001  
RE GABRIEL AND ANOR versus AND TWO ORS 
FERNANDO AND ANOR versus AND TWO ORS  
HER HONOUR: In this matter I note that both in matter number 10871/01, proceedings styled re Fernando, and proceedings 10870/01, proceedings styled re Gabriel, the proceedings in the Court below have been finalised. There is accordingly no utility in my granting the orders which the plaintiffs claim in their summonses, namely orders quashing in each instance the determination of the Children's Court Magistrate. I propose making no such orders in the light of that advice. 
In each set of proceedings, Ms Reynolds, who appears on behalf of the child, seeks costs, as does Mr McLachlan, who appears on behalf of the second defendant in the proceedings styled re Fernando. It is contended that while the plaintiff was successful in the result in that I found in each instance error of law on the face of the record such as to make it appropriate that the plaintiff be granted the relief sought in its summonses, that nonetheless, the plaintiffs had been unsuccessful on almost all issues raised by them on the hearing of the proceedings. 
I consider there is force to that submission and that, in all the circumstances, the appropriate exercise of my discretion favours an order that the plaintiffs in each set of proceedings pay the costs of the separate representative of the child and, in the proceedings of Fernando, that the plaintiffs pay the costs of the second defendant and I so order.
