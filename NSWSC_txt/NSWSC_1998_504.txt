MENDEZ versus TELSTRA CORPORATION LIMITED 
WORKERS' COMPENSATION - statutory interpretation - meaning of "in the course of employment" under [ss 44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) and [45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (Cth) 
The appellant, an employee of Australia Post, was injured while travelling to work when a manhole cover installed by Telstra in a public street gave way under her. The trial Judge held that her action was statute barred because it had occurred "in the course of employment" within the meaning of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) and [45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) .

HELD: Allowing the appeal: The phrase "in the course of ... employment" in [s 44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) (1) should be given its well established interpretation which did not cover travel to and from work. The section therefore did not bar the plaintiff's action against Telstra.

ORDERS 
Appeal allowed with costs.

Order striking out the statement of claim set aside.

Respondent to pay the costs of the motion in the District Court.

Respondent to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act if qualified.

MENDEZ versus TELSTRA CORPORATION LIMITED 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an appeal by leave from the judgment of his Honour Robison J striking out the plaintiff's action. The relevant facts which were not in dispute were that the plaintiff, an employee of the Australian Postal Corporation, was injured on her way to work when a manhole cover installed by Telstra in a public footpath in Victoria Street, Wetherill Park, collapsed under her. 
The primary judge held that the plaintiff's action was barred by [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) and [45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) . [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) provides: "Subject to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) an action or other proceeding for damages does not lie against the
Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a licensed corporation or an employee in respect of: an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment being an injury in respect of which the Commonwealth, Commonwealth authority or licensed corporation would, but for this sub section, be liable ... for damages ...".

There is no dispute that Telstra is a licensed corporation for the purposes of this section. The judge held that the plaintiff was injured in the course of her employment with the Australian Postal Corporation because she was then on her way to work. In my judgment that conclusion cannot be supported. The expression "in the course of his or her employment" is a familiar one in workers' compensation legislation and requires there to be a temporal connection between the injury and the employment (see the Commonwealth v
Holland <case>; [(1992) 173 CLR 473] at 483, in the joint judgment of four Justices of the Court: "The course of employment is ordinarily perceived as commencing when the employee starts work in accordance with his or her ordinary or overtime hours of work and as ending when the employee completes his or her ordinary or overtime hours of work".

Clearly therefore this plaintiff was not injured in the course of her employment with the Australian Postal Corporation. Mr Sheldon sought to support the decision of the primary judge that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) applied in this case by reference to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s6.html) (b)(ii) of the Act which provides: "Without limiting the circumstances in which an injury to an employee may be treated as having arisen out of, or in the course of, his or her employment, an injury shall, for the purposes of this Act, be treated as having so arisen if it was sustained: ...
 by the employee: ...
 was travelling between his or her place of residence and place of work other than during an ordinary recess in that employment".

This is a definition section which must be read with the definition of injury in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s4.html) (1) which so far as relevant provides that injury means: "(b) An injury ... suffered by an employee, being a physical or mental injury arising out of, or in the course of, the employee's employment".

These definitions apply to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s14.html) which imposes a liability on Comcare to pay compensation in accordance with the Act: " ... in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work, or impairment".
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s6.html) (1) is in effect a deeming provision which operates among other things to deem an injury sustained by an employee while travelling between his or her place of residence and place of work to have "arisen out of or in the course of his or her employment". It does not deem the injury to have arisen in the course of the employment, but to have arisen out of or in the course of the employment.
That is, either in one way or the other, not both.

This is a statutory fiction because an injury in the course of a journey between the employee's place of work and his or her place of residence does not arise out of or in the course of the employment. That is why special journey provisions were necessary in workers' compensation legislation. In these circumstances the definition provision in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s6.html) (1) does not assist the defendant in sustaining the judgment under appeal. There is no reason for this Court to adopt other than the well established meaning of the expression "in the course of ... employment" in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) (a).

The use of this expression, instead of the composite expression found in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s6.html) , and in the definition of injury in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s4.html) , can hardly have been inadvertent especially in the light of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s15.html) which entitles employees to compensation for loss or damage to property as a result of an accident "arising out of and in the course of ... employment".

It follows in my judgment that the appeal should be allowed. I would propose the following orders: 
Appeal allowed with costs.

Order striking out the statement of claim set aside.

Respondent to pay the costs of the motion in the District Court.

Respondent to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act if qualified.

MASON P: I agree. Section 6(1) deems certain specified matters for the purpose of the Act to bear one of two alternative characters. It does not stipulate that they may be treated as both. Therefore the section is unable to be prayed in aid in the present context. I agree with the orders proposed. 
SHEPPARD AJA: I also agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Handley and the additional remarks of the President and with the orders which are proposed. 
MASON P: The orders will be as indicated. * * *
