EQUITY DIVISION  
HAMILTON J  
WEDNESDAY, 14 JUNE 2006  /05 SYLVIA ABBOTT versus ROY CLARK  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: I delivered judgment in this matter on 23 February 2006:
Abbott versus Clark <case> ("my judgment"). But I have not up to today made final orders.  There have since that time been some rather dramatic developments. Mr
Andronos, of counsel for the plaintiff, today asked for leave to re-open his case to file additional affidavits. Those affidavits revealed that, since my judgment, by almost superhuman efforts, the defendant has been located in
England. He has very frankly and properly acknowledged that he has no beneficial interest in the property and has executed an acknowledgement to that effect. He was proffered a transfer to execute, but has failed to execute it. This was largely because he was asked to see a solicitor concerning the matter, which he has some reluctance to do. In the circumstances, he could not be criticised for this.  Mr Andronos has now approached me with orders which he asks me to make. The principal order that he has sought is an order under [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s138.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) that the
Registrar General issue a new certificate of title naming the plaintiff as the sole registered proprietor of the property.  Normally the Court would be reluctant to make an order for the issue of a new certificate of title where there are other mechanisms available for effecting the transfer of the property, ie, in this case by having an appropriate transfer executed by the Registrar on behalf of the defendant. The reluctance is in part because the simple order for the issue of a new certificate of title may avoid the payment of stamp duty which would otherwise be due.  However, in this case enquiries of the revenue authorities, which have been conveyed to the Court, suggest that duty would not be payable if it were demonstrated that the transfer was by an apparent purchaser to the real purchaser of the property. That formula is in the [Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/) [s (1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s55.html)
It seems to me from the facts proved in this case and found in my judgment that this transfer would fall in that category and I should be prepared to make a specific finding to that effect if it were necessary.  Another possible objection to dealing with the matter by the simple issue of a new certificate of title may be the attitude of the Registrar General to this course. But correspondence has been put into evidence that shows that the
Registrar General has no objection to this course being followed in this case, provided that, as well as order 2 of the proposed orders, orders 3 and 4 are also made. These will procure the plaintiff's possession of the current certificate of title and record an undertaking by the plaintiff to the
Registrar General to lodge a notice of death in respect of the plaintiff's husband, the late John Francis Abbott, who is still on the title as a joint tenant, and the current certificate of title when possession is obtained.
Liberty to apply is granted so that if there is any difficulty in carrying out these steps the Court may be approached.  On that basis I have made orders in the form of proposed orders presented to me on behalf of the plaintiff.
