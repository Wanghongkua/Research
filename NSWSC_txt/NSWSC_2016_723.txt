JUDGMENT
In April 2016 I dealt with a motion by which NRMA sought to have the relief sought against it by Mr Syed struck out in accordance with [Rule 14.28(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s14.28.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) and in the alternative, the proceedings against it dismissed under [Rule 13.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s13.4.html) (see Syed versus Crumpton <case>
NRMA failed to make out its case, which depended on the proper interpretation of the blameless accident provisions of the [Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) . The result was that its motion was dismissed and Mr Syed was given leave to amend his statement of claim, NRMA having accepted that if its motion failed, he had to be given leave to squarely raise the dispute over whether his policy covers the injuries he suffered in a motorbike accident.
That concession was properly made because Mr Syed had been injured when his bike struck a wallaby which had been thrown to the road after it was struck by the car in front of him. He had made a claim under his policy, which NRMA had denied. The statement of claim advanced a claim that the blameless accident provisions of the [Motor Accidents Compensation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) applied to the accident. Whether the policy covered the claim Mr Syed had made for his injuries, depended on the proper construction of those provisions.
There is now a dispute about the proper costs order. The usual order under the Rules is that costs follow the event. Mr Syed accepts that there should be a departure from the usual position. He seeks an order that NRMA pay his costs of the motion, save for costs thrown away by reason of the amendment to his statement of claim. NRMA seeks an order that each party should bear their own costs of the motion.
There is no issue that under [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) the Court has the discretion to make a costs order which is just in the circumstances.
The real dispute lying between the parties was over whether NRMA had liability under the compulsory third party insurance policy Mr Syed had taken out, for the accident in which he was involved, in the event that it was found to be a blameless accident. NRMA had denied liability under the policy for the claim which he made in respect of his accident.
Mr Syed's statement of claim pleaded reliance on [s 113](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s113.html) of [Motor Accidents Compensation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/). I concluded that it was not relevant (see April judgment at [56]). NRMA's motion failed, nevertheless, because the construction of the [Motor Accidents Compensation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) for which it contended could not be accepted. That was what occupied the majority of the hearing of the motion.
Accordingly, Mr Syed's concession that he is not entitled to a costs order for the costs thrown away by his misplaced reliance on [s 113](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s113.html) was properly made. He succeeded, however, in resisting NRMA's motion. The just order in those circumstances is that it should otherwise pay the costs of the motion on which it failed.

ORDERS
For those reasons, I order that NRMA pay Mr Syed's costs of the motion other than the costs thrown away by reason of the amendment to his statement of claim, permitted by the order made on 27 April 2016.
