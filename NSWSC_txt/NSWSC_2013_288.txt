JUDGMENT
Judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, Ms Pentelow, and the parties were directed to provide short minutes of the order to be made (see Pentelow versus Bell Lawyers Pty Ltd trading as Bell Lawyers <case> Rather than seeking orders returning the matter to the Local Court, as [s 41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s41.html) of [Local Court Act 2007](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) envisages, they have agreed on orders finally disposing of the first instance proceedings. The defendant also seeks an order under the [Suitors Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
The just, quick and cheap course envisaged be taken by [s 56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), is certainly to make orders in the terms which the parties have agreed. I was referred to a number of cases where the view was taken that such orders could be made, given the provisions of [s 75A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s75a.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and [Rule 50.16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s50.16.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) (see Thaina Town (On Goulburn) Pty Ltd versus City of Sydney Council <case>; [(2007) 71 NSWLR 230]
In this case, the appeal having resolved various questions of law lying between the parties, they have been able to agree on the orders which should be made in relation to the underpinning factual controversy between them which was not addressed in the Local Court. In Thaina Town (On Goulburn) Pty Ltd it was observed at [103]: "103 This Court must be concerned that the course of administration of justice in this State does not impose unnecessary cost burdens on parties by adopting a narrow interpretation of statutory powers conferred upon the Court to ensure the just and efficient administration of justice. Where no new findings of primary fact are required to be made, this Court should exercise a power conferred upon it in wide terms so as to ensure that the costs of legal disputation is minimised and thereby apply the guiding principle in [s56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) to the exercise of powers conferred by an Act other than that Act or by Rules of
Court, so as to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the issues in dispute in civil proceedings."
There the issue was an order for costs. The view taken was that this Court "is usually in as good a position as a first instance judge, even in a specialist tribunal, to make the relevant judgment, where there is no gap in the factual findings." Here there is now no need for any factual findings to be made and the parties have agreed on the appropriate orders to resolve the dispute lying between them, the disputed questions of law having been resolved. In those circumstances, it seems to me that the Court has the necessary jurisdiction to make the proposed orders under [s 75A(10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s75a.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), which provides: "(10) The Court may make any finding or assessment, give any judgment, make any order or give any direction which ought to have been given or made or which the nature of the case requires."
Here what is required is an order to give effect to the agreement which the parties have reached as to how the dispute should now be resolved by way of appropriate order. I propose, in the circumstances, to make the order which gives effect to that agreement.
As to the claim for an order under the [Suitors Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), it is relevant to note that the requirements of [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) are here satisfied. They are as discussed in Robinson versus Zhang <case> <case> - [38]. Here the appeal turned in part on a question of law resolved by the Court of Appeal after the decision appealed against was given and partly on the proper construction of other aspects of the [Legal Profession Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/), not previously considered. 
In the circumstances I propose to make the order sought.
