ORS 
THE APPLICATIONS OF GIO GENERAL LIMITED /95, 10717/95, 13898/95 
FRIDAY 21 FEBRUARY 1997 
SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
BADGERY-PARKER J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: . The proceedings 
A number of former patients of Chelmsford Private Hospital ("Chelmsford") have proceeded by way of summons, seeking leave to commence action, pursuant to [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), against certain insurance companies alleged to have been, during certain relevant periods, the public liability insurers of Somers Pty. Limited, a company alleged to have had the management of the hospital during the period of admission thereto of the respective plaintiffs. The three summons proceedings thus commenced (Nos. 13895 of 1995, 10717 of 1995 and 13898 of 1995) will together be referred to in what follows as "the proceedings".
 . The parties to the proceedings 
The plaintiffs 
In summons No. 13895 of 1995, the plaintiff is Jeffrey John Hillsley. He was a patient at Chelmsford Private Hospital on eight occasions between 11 September and 2 July 1979 and claims that during those admissions he was treated by way of deep sleep therapy and electro-convulsive therapy which caused him injury.

In summons No. 10717 of 1995, the plaintiff is Marcia Mary Allen who claims on her own behalf and on behalf of each of 40 other persons named in the schedule to the summons. She and each of the persons so named claims to have been a patient at Chelmsford Hospital on one or more occasions between 1 January 1977 and 1 December 1980, and to have sustained injury by reason of treatment administered there including deep sleep therapy and electro-convulsive therapy.

In summons No. 13898 of 1995, the plaintiff is Patricia Florence McAlpine who claims on her own behalf and on behalf of each of four other persons named in the schedule to the said summons. She and each of those persons claims to have been a patient at Chelmsford on one or more occasions between 1 December 1974 and 1 December 1980 and to have sustained injury by reason of treatment administered there including deep sleep therapy and electro-convulsive therapy.

The defendants 
The defendants to the proceedings are:- 
NZI Insurance Australia Limited (formerly General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corporation) alleged to have been the relevant insurer between 1 December 1974 and 9 July 1976; 
GIO General Limited (formerly GIO of NSW) alleged to have been the relevant insurer between 12 August 1976 and 12 August 1977; 
CIC Insurance Limited (formerly Southern Pacific Insurance Company Limited) alleged to have been the relevant insurer between 3 July 1978 and 1 December 1980.
 . The applications 
One of the insurers against whom relief is sought in the proceedings, GIO
General Limited, ("the applicant") has made applications for orders that certain questions arising in the proceedings be tried separately and before any other question in the proceedings, as contemplated by [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/index.html#p31)
Rule 2(a) of the Supreme Court Rules ("the applications"). The applications were heard on 14 February 1997 when judgment was reserved.
 . The facts 
The hearing of the applications proceeded before me upon an assumption of the following facts.

During the relevant periods (that is to say, the periods during which each of the plaintiffs was treated at Chelmsford), Somers Pty. Limited was the proprietor or licensee of or otherwise conducted and had the care, control and management of Chelmsford Private Hospital.

Policies of insurance issued by the respective defendants in respect of liability which might fall upon Somers Pty. Limited as operator of the hospital were in existence during the periods specified above.

On 23 September 1996, Somers Pty. Limited was dissolved and deregistered pursuant to the provisions of s.459 of the Companies (New South Wales) Code, and could not be sued in proceedings commenced after that date unless it was first reinstated in the register of companies.

No application for reinstatement of the company has been made.

The latest date at which treatment by way of deep sleep therapy was administered to any plaintiff at Chelmsford Private Hospital was in July 1979. Accordingly, in respect of any cause of action which any of the plaintiffs may have had against Somers Pty. Limited, the relevant limitation period established by [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) expired prior to the deregistration of Somers Pty. Limited.

None of the plaintiffs commenced action against Somers Pty. Limited prior to the expiration of that limitation period.

None of the plaintiffs has applied for an extension of the limitation period.

Each of the plaintiffs, Hillsley, McAlpine and Allen was granted leave, on 2 September 1996, to commence action against any of the insurers but on terms designed to preserve the rights of the parties as they stood at that time. In each case the order granting leave was in the following form:- "1. Leave be granted to each of the plaintiffs to commence separate actions by respective statements of claim to be filed in the Common Law Division of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales at Sydney against relevant defendants to the summonses herein, pursuant to [s.6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) (`that
Act').
The filing fees that would otherwise be payable at the time of the filing of the said respective statements of claim shall be deferred until further order.
Liberty to any of the defendants to apply to the court on 14 days notice to revoke the said grant of leave made under [s.6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the Act as against the respective defendant, and at the hearing of any such application or applications to revoke leave, it is ordered that:- each of the respective plaintiffs retains the onus of establishing all such matters as would have been necessary for the respective plaintiff if his or her application for that leave had been heard and determined on 2 September ;
 the respective defendant bears the onus of establishing that leave should be revoked insofar as, if at all, the respective defendant may seek to rely on any facts or matters that occur on or after 3 September 1996.
Direct that the defendants' application that certain questions be heard separately from other questions (pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/index.html#p31)
Rule 2(a) of the Supreme Court Rules) be made returnable for hearing on 25
October 1995.
Costs of and incidental to the present application shall be costs in the summons hearing." (The reference in paragraph (4) of those orders is a reference to the applications to which this judgment relates. On 25 October 1995, the applications were adjourned and subsequently again adjourned from time to time until fixed for hearing on 14 February 1997.) 
Pursuant to that leave, the plaintiffs Hillsley and McAlpine (but not yet the plaintiff Allen) have commenced action against GIO General Limited and took the opportunity to name as a defendant in the statements of claim filed on their behalf on 11 October 1996 Somers Pty. Limited, notwithstanding that no application has been made to restore that company to the register.
 . The content of the applications 
The applicant seeks the separate and prior determination of questions initially posed in the following form (which I take from the notice of motion filed in the matter of McAlpine):- "(a) Assuming that a charge pursuant to [s.6(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) was created in favour of the plaintiff against the second defendant on or about 17 August 1976, has that charge been extinguished pursuant to [s.63(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) ? 
If yes to (a), is the plaintiff precluded from bringing or maintaining these proceedings? 
If no to (a), whether the bringing of these proceedings are not maintainable by virtue of [s.14(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/)." 
An amended notice of motion filed in court on 21 February 1997 (and then further amended) pursuant to leave granted by me on 14 February 1997, contains a reformulation of question (c) in the following terms:- "(c) If no to (a), should leave to commence proceedings pursuant to [s.6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) be refused as to do so would be futile because proceedings against Somers Pty.
Limited have not been commenced and are no longer maintainable by operation of [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) ?" . Separate determination of questions [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p31) so far as now relevant provides as follows:- "1. In this Part, `question' includes any question or issue in any proceedings, whether of fact or law or partly of fact and partly of law, and whether raised by pleadings, agreement of parties or otherwise.
The court may make orders for:- the decision of any question separately from any other question, whether before, at or after any trial or further trial in the proceedings; ..." 
The Rule contemplates a departure from the general practice whereby all issues in a particular litigation are tried at the same time. The power to depart from the general practice should be exercised with caution. In CBS
Productions Pty. Limited v. O'Neill [(1985) 1 NSWLR 601], Kirby, P.
said at 606:- "Care must also be taken in utilising the procedures now available for the determination of preliminary points to avoid such determination in cases which are not ripe for this treatment. A matter is `ripe' for separate and preliminary determination where it is a central issue in contention between the parties, the resolution of which will either obviate the necessity of litigation altogether or substantially narrow the field of controversy. Thus where a plaintiff sues contending breach by the defendant of his duty to the plaintiff as an invitee, determination of this issue as a preliminary point would rarely, if ever, be appropriate if the plaintiff had in reserve, alternative counts framed in the duty owed to a licensee or an entrant as a contractual right or in negligence generally. To determine the one matter would leave other issues unresolved and render the preliminary procedure a needless and expensive fatuity.

Even allowing for the beneficial development of declaratory relief in recent years, there will frequently be occasions where issues are not ripe or otherwise appropriate for separate determination." 
In the same judgment (at 607) the President draw attention to the advantages of the adoption of this procedure in appropriate cases:- "Where the exceptional circumstances exist that make it sensible to do so (and no reason exists to suggest the contrary) the procedure can be beneficial. It can contribute not only to the prompt disposal of crucial issues in the litigation (sometimes resulting in disposal of the whole action and even judgment for a party). It can also contribute to the saving of time and costs where an authoritative decision narrows the issues for trial substantially, excluding the necessity to explore factual matters which, on one determination of the preliminary question, are entirely unnecessary. Such may be the present case. Additionally, there is a practical consideration. If the court provides an authoritative determination of a key question in difference between the parties, it is quite likely that it will, in some cases at least, contribute to the settlement of the litigation because the parties know the basis upon which the remaining disputes will be dealt with by the court." 
Even if it is clear (as here) that the question proposed for separate decision is a question of law which can be determined without evidence on agreed facts, and a question which, if answered in favour of the applicant, will put an end to the litigation, it would not usually be appropriate to order a separate trial unless it is reasonably arguable that the question should be answered in the sense for which the applicant contends. If, for example, the answer proposed by the applicant was clearly not available, because it flew in the face of a relevant statutory provision or established authority binding on the court of trial, it would, generally speaking, be futile to order a separate trial.

An exception might be a case where although the trial judge would be compelled by authority binding on him to answer the question adversely to the applicant, the applicant proposes to argue, on appeal following the separate trial, that that binding authority was wrongly decided and should not be followed. In such a case it might be appropriate to order a separate trial of that question of law and for the trial judge to determine the matter (perhaps without argument) in light of the authority binding upon him, opening the way for the unsuccessful applicant to approach the Court of Appeal; or it might be appropriate to order a separate trial of that question of law and then order that the proceedings be removed into the Court of Appeal pursuant to the provisions of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p12) [Rule (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s2.html) 
For the purpose of deciding whether to order a separate trial of such a question, a judge must consider:- whether the question proposed for separate trial would, if answered in favour of the applicant (or in some cases, however answered) put an end to (or significantly narrow the issues in) the litigation; (i) whether the answer proposed by the applicant to the proposed question of law is reasonably arguable; and (if it appears not to be so, only because of the existence of a particular decision of the Court of Appeal which is to the contrary of the answer proposed), whether the applicant has reasonable prospects of:- - securing leave of the Court of Appeal to argue that the earlier decision is wrong; and - persuading the Court of Appeal that it is indeed wrong and not to be followed; whether the question proposed for separate trial can be determined upon agreed (or clearly incontrovertible) facts; whether in the circumstances of the particular case there is any reason to suggest that it is not "sensible" to order a separate trial (cf. per Kirby, P.
in CBS Productions Pty. Limited v. O'Neill (supra at 607).

I turn then to consider the relevant law, not for the purpose of seeking to answer the question propounded, but for the limited purpose which I have indicated, namely to consider the matters identified in the immediately preceding subparagraphs (a)-(d).
 . The relevant statutory provisions 
The [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) provides by [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) a means whereby an injured party entitled to damages from a tortfeasor may have recourse to the proceeds of a relevant policy of insurance issued to that tortfeasor. So far as now relevant the section provides as follows:- "6(1) If any person (hereinafter in this Part referred to as the insured) has, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, entered into a contract of insurance by which he is indemnified against liability to pay any damages or compensation, the amount of his liability shall on the happening of the event giving rise to the claim for damages or compensation, and notwithstanding that the amount of such liability may not then have been determined, be a charge on all insurance monies that are or may become payable in respect of that liability.
 ...

Every such charge as aforesaid shall be enforceable by way of an action against the insurer in the same way and in the same court as if the action were an action to recover damages or compensation from the insured; and in respect of any such action and of the judgment given therein the parties shall, to the extent of the charge, have the same rights and liabilities, and the court shall have the same powers, as if the action were against the insured: 
Provided that, except where the provisions of subsection (2) apply, no such action shall be commenced in any court except with the leave of that court.
Leave shall not be granted in any case where the court is satisfied that the insurer is entitled under the terms of the contract of insurance to disclaim liability, and that any proceedings, including arbitration proceedings, necessary to establish that the insurer is so entitled to disclaim, have been taken.

Such an action may be brought although judgment has been already recovered against the insured for damages or compensation in respect of the same matter.

Any payment made by an insurer under the contract of insurance without actual notice of the existence of any such charge shall to the extent of that payment be a valid discharge to the insurer, notwithstanding anything in this
Part contained.

No insurer shall be liable under this Part for any greater sum than that fixed by the contract of insurance between himself and the insured." 
The [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) provides by [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) so far as now relevant as follows:- "14(1) An action on any of the following causes of action is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of six years running from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff to a person through whom he claims:- a cause of action founded on contract (including quasi contract) not being a cause of action founded on a deed; a cause of action founded on tort ...
 ...
 a cause of action to recover money recoverable by virtue of an enactment, ..." [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of that Act provides by subsection (1) as follows:- "Subject to subsection (2), on the expiration of a limitation period fixed by or under this Act or a cause of action to recover any debt damages or other money, the right and title of the person formerly having the cause of action to the debt damages or other money is, as against the person against whom the cause of action formerly lay and as against his successors, extinguished." (Subsection (2) is not presently relevant.) 
Although [s.63(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) is unqualified in its language, it has to be read subject to certain other provisions of the Act which invest the court with jurisdiction to extend the limitation period in respect of a cause of action for personal injury in certain circumstances. [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57.html)-[58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) inclusive provide one avenue whereby a plaintiff may secure such an extension; [ss.60F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60f.html), [60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) and [60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) provide another avenue.
 . Relevant case law 
In Grimson v. Aviation & General (Underwriting) Agents Pty. Limited [(1991) 25 NSWLR 422], the Court of Appeal by majority held that the limitation period for an action to enforce a charge under [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) runs from the happening of the event which gives rise to the insured's liability to pay damages, approving earlier decisions to that effect: Cambridge Credit
Corporation Limited v. Lissenden [(1987) 8 NSWLR 411 (Clarke], J.) and
Ratcliffe v. V.S. & B. Border Homes Limited [(1987) 9 NSWLR 390 (Hunt](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%209%20NSWLR%20390 "View LawCiteRecord" ), J., as he then was). In Lawlor v. New South Wales Medical Defence Union & the Estate of Bailey (unreported, 9 October 1992) I remarked:- "The decision (in Grimson) has an unfortunate and somewhat extraordinary consequence, namely that the action to enforce the statutory charge might become statute barred at a time when either the intending plaintiff was entirely unaware (and had no means of knowledge because of the lack of a means of compelling the provision of information) that the tortfeasor was insured or, assuming that the tortfeasor was insured, of the identity of the insurer; or because an application for leave to sue the insurer could not be made at any time during the limitation period applicable in respect of the tortfeasor, because throughout the whole of that period the tortfeasor was a `good common law defendant': Andjelkovic v. AFG Insurances Limited [(1980) 47 FLR ]

In New South Wales Medical Defence Union Limited v. Crawford [(1993) 31
NSWLR 469], Grimson was overruled, the court holding that time only begins to run under [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) from the date on which leave is granted because the cause of action under [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) does not accrue before the grant of that leave. The matter went on appeal to the High Court (reported as Bailey v. New South Wales Medical Defence
Union <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 399)] but nothing in the judgments there touches on that question.
In Crawford, Sheller, JA. expressly held that the decision in Grimson was wrong (p.531). However, his Honour, having said (at p.530) that he agreed with Hunt, J. in Ratcliffe (supra) that "if the injured party's right to recover damages against the insured has been extinguished there is no charge to enforce", went on to say (at p.531):- "If it be correct, as I think it is, that the extinguishment by the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) of the injured persons' (sic) right against the insured extinguishes a charge under [s.6(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s6.html) because there is no liability to pay damages to support it, but that any independent limitation applicable to the insured's claim on the insurer is preserved by the insurer's right to disclaim liability, I think it also correct to say that the charge may also be extinguished if there are no insurance monies that are or may become payable in respect of that liability and to which it can attach. Such would be the case if there were a breach of a condition precedent to liability. We are not here concerned with the effect of the [Insurance Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (Cth). On this I agree, with respect, with what was said by Samuels, JA. in Oswald v.
Bailey (at 732). However because I am of opinion that the injured person's right to damages was not extinguished by the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) and the obligation to pay insurance monies in respect of the insured's liability to the injured person unaffected by the November 1982 amendment to the articles it is not necessary for me further to pursue consideration of the circumstances in which the charge may be extinguished." 
That passage is seized upon by the applicant insurer in the present proceedings.
 . The applicant's argument 
The GIO contends, relying on the passage just quoted from the judgment of
Sheller, JA. in Crawford, that where [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) operates to extinguish a plaintiff's cause of action against an insured tortfeasor, the effect is to extinguish also the charge created under [s.6(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) with the consequence that no action would lie against the insurer pursuant to [s.6(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html)
That result did not ensue in Crawford because s.63 did not there operate to extinguish the plaintiff's claim against the tortfeasor, for the reason that the limitation period for Crawford's action against the tortfeasor had been extended pursuant to [s.58(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). The applicant, relying on the fact that no extension of time has been granted in respect of the plaintiffs' causes of action against Somers Pty. Limited, argues that [s.63(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) has operated according to its terms to extinguish the cause of action against the tortfeasor and, relying upon the reasoning of Sheller, JA., submits that the charge also must be taken to have been extinguished, so that there remains no cause of action against the insurer.

If that argument is correct, a question in the terms of or to the effect of the GIO's question (a) would attract an affirmative answer, as would question ; and question (c) would not arise. Question (c) is propounded only in the event that question (a) is answered in the negative, adversely to the GIO. The purpose of question (c) is, as I understand it, to provide an opportunity for the GIO to argue that [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) operates according to its terms to produce the result that no action against the insurer pursuant to [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s6.html) is maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period of six years from the date of accrual of the plaintiff's cause of action against the tortfeasor. What is sought, in effect, is an opportunity to argue that the
Court of Appeal in Grimson was correct and that the later (and recent) decision in Crawford, holding that time does not run in respect of the [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s6.html) action until the grant of leave, is incorrect. A single judge of this court would be bound to answer that question in the negative. Were that the only question sought to be raised, that circumstance would provide an obvious reason for refusing to order the separate determination of that issue.
However, if it is appropriate to determine separately questions (a) and (b), nothing is lost and much may be gained if question (c) is propounded and answered at the same time. Then, should there be an appeal against the primary judge's answer to questions (a) and (b), the Court of Appeal would have the opportunity once more to consider the conflicting decisions in Grimson and in Crawford.
 . Whether question (a) is "ripe" for separate decision 
I have identified three considerations relevant to this issue. I summarise my views in respect of each in turn:- 
Resolution of questions (a) and (b) in favour of the insurer would put an end to the proceedings.

The point which the insurer seeks to raise, based upon the reasoning of Sheller, JA. in Crawford, is clearly arguable. The fact that neither the President nor Mahoney, JA. dealt with the question of extinguishment does not necessarily connote that their Honours disagreed with Sheller, JA. on that question. The GIO argues, the position is simply that on the approach which their Honours took to the issue that question did not arise. Accordingly it is submitted that Crawford does not stand as authority against the proposition which the GIO now seeks to advance for, assuming the correctness of the decision (and in any event it is of course binding on a single judge of this court) it is distinguishable. I am of the view that the argument proposed to be raised is not so obviously hopeless as to provide a reason for the exercise of discretion adverse to the present application.

The questions can be determined without duplicating the exploration of the facts which would in any event be necessary upon a full trial of the action. It appears to me that the questions can be determined upon facts which are, if not agreed, certainly incontrovertible, namely, and only, that the limitation period against Somers Pty. Limited expired prior to the dissolution and deregistration of that company and that no application has been made either to extend that limitation period or to restore Somers Pty. Limited to the register.

These considerations point to the making of the order for separate trial which the applicant seeks. But in the peculiar circumstances of this case, it is necessary to consider whether, for another reason, the making of an order may be futile; or whether question (a), apparently a simple question of law (that is, simple to state, if not simple to decide) actually conceals a complex issue of fact. Both of those possibilities arise in this case because, although none of the plaintiffs has made an application to extend the limitation period against Somers Pty. Limited and none has pressed to conclusion any application to restore that company to the register, it is still legally possible, notwithstanding the provisions of [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/), for such applications to be now made; and it is at least theoretically possible that such applications might be successful. To those questions I now turn.
 . The possible reinstatement of Somers Pty. Limited to the register of companies 
The Companies (New South Wales) Code provides by s.459(6) as follows:- "If a person is aggrieved by the cancellation of the registration of a company, the court, on an application made by the person at any time within 15 years after the cancellation, may, if satisfied that the company was, at the time of the cancellation, carrying on business or in operation or otherwise satisfied that it is just that the registration of the company be reinstated, order the reinstatement of the registration of the company and, upon an office copy of the order being lodged with the Commission, the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if its registration had not been cancelled, and the court may by the order give such directions and make such provisions (including directions and provisions relating to the re-transfer of property vested in the Commission under s.461) as seem just for placing the company and all other persons in the same position as nearly as may be as if the registration of the company had not been cancelled." 
As a matter of practice, the court does not usually restore a defunct company to the register in order to permit a person to pursue a cause of action for damages against that company unless it is shown that a relevant policy of insurance existed at the time when the cause of action arose, and then usually on terms that no judgment will be enforced against any asset of the company other than the proceeds of such policy.

When some of the plaintiffs instituted proceedings in the Equity Division to restore Somers Pty. Limited to the register, the registrar very properly indicated a view that he was unlikely to make such an order in the absence of evidence of the existence of a relevant policy of insurance, because in the absence of a policy an order restoring the company to the list would be futile. The plaintiffs being then not in a position to demonstrate the existence of a policy allowed their application to restore the company to the register to wither and die.

The material before me suggests that the plaintiffs are now in a position to show the existence of relevant policies of insurance issued by the respective defendants which (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) put the several defendants on risk during the periods identified earlier in this judgment.

That being so, there seems now to be no obstacle to an application to restore
Somers Pty. Limited to the register, albeit on some such condition as, I have already indicated, is commonly imposed in practice. The fact that the insurers are resisting the proceedings for leave to sue them directly would not, in my view, afford a reason for the court, on an application to restore the company to the register, to decide as a matter of discretion to refuse such an order.
Nor would the fact that the insurers will seek to argue, in answer to the proceedings, (as no doubt they would if sued by Somers Pty. Limited on their respective policies) that they are discharged from liability by reason of non- disclosure and/or breaches of policy conditions. Those are matters appropriate to be determined upon an application under [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), or in proceedings brought by Somers Pty. Limited against its respective insurers; but not upon an application under s.459 of the Companies Code to restore the company to the register.
 . The possibility of extension of the limitation period to enable the plaintiffs to sue Somers Pty. Limited 
As noted earlier, the plaintiffs Hillsley and McAlpine filed statements of claim on 11 October 1996 against Somers Pty. Limited, among other defendants.
The plaintiff Allen has not yet commenced any proceedings against Somers Pty.
Limited. The [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) permits an extension of the limitation period in respect of a cause of action for damages for personal injury in circumstances defined in subdivision (1) of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p3) of the Act (relevantly [ss.57A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57a.html), [57B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html) and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html)) and in the circumstances defined in subdivision (3) of the same Part (relevantly [ss.60F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60f.html), [60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) and [60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html)) where a court makes an order under one or other set of provisions then, "for the purposes of an action on that cause of action brought by the applicant in that court", "the limitation period is accordingly extended" [(ss.58(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html), [60K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60k.html)(1)(a)).
An application for an extension pursuant to [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) may be made whether or not a limitation period for the cause of action in question has expired before such application is made [(s.58(3))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html); so too an application and an order may be made under Division 3 "as if
Division 1 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p4) had never been in force" and "even though the limitation period has already expired" [(s.60M(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60m.html), ). Division 1 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p4) is that Division of the Act which contains, among other provisions, [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) providing for the extinguishment of the cause of action.

The existence of those provisions for extension of a limitation period produces the result, in effect, that the extinguishment of a cause of action effected by [s.60(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) is provisional only and is subject to the possibility that the plaintiff may succeed in an application, however belated, for an extension of time. Indeed, even if an application for an extension of time were initially unsuccessful, the possibility would remain of a subsequent application or applications:
Colarado v. Haden Engineering Pty. Limited (Court of Appeal, 6 November ). Thus, perhaps, questions arise as to whether an order now made for separate trial of the questions proposed might be or be rendered futile if, before (or indeed even after) such separate determination, the plaintiffs should succeed in an application for extension of time; and whether the possibility that such may occur affords a reason for the refusal of the applications.

The applicant submits not: it is submitted that the application should be dealt with on the basis of the situation which exists at the time the application is made, namely that it is now more than 10 years after Somers
Pty. Limited was removed from the register of companies and in that period no order has been made for its reinstatement, nor is any application for that purpose now pending; and that it is now more than 10 years since the expiration of the limitation period in respect of any cause of action that might exist against Somers Pty. Limited in respect of injury sustained by reason of deep sleep therapy but no extension of the limitation period has been granted nor is any application for that purpose now pending; and that the application of [ss.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) and [63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) has the result that no cause of action against Somers Pty. Limited in respect of deep sleep therapy is now maintainable and, indeed, any cause of action in respect of such has been extinguished.

The written submissions of Mr. Bates who argued the case on behalf of the plaintiffs did not, as it seems to me, with respect, address the point on which the applicant relies, namely the effect of [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) in the factual situation which now exists but rather to address matters relevant to the exercise of discretion under [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) - matters which may be of considerable significance if that application comes eventually to be dealt with by a judge but which do not assist at this stage.
In the course of oral argument, I invited plaintiffs' counsel to address the question whether an application to extend the limitation period and an application to reinstate Somers Pty. Limited in the register of companies might, if made, be successful; and he put certain submissions which are recorded in the transcript and which I do not need to repeat here. I also invited him to deal with the proposition, pressed by Mr. McCulloch on behalf of the applicant, that the applications should be dealt with on the basis of the facts as they now exist. His only answer, as I understood his submission, was that because no application to reinstate the company and to extend the limitation period against it has been made and rejected, it is not possible to say that the cause of action has been extinguished. It seems to me, with respect, that is not an adequate answer to the applicant's position. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) enunciates what is to take place after the expiration of a limitation period fixed by (inter alia) [s.14.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html)
If [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) is not to operate according to its terms, that can only be because some order nullifying its effect has been made pursuant to some other provision of the
Act. If no such order has been made, then it appears to me that the court must give effect to [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) in the light of the facts as they exist at the time when the court is called upon to deal with an issue to which that section is relevant. To decline to do so on the basis that some application might conceivably be made by somebody at some unspecified and unforeseeable time in the future would be to deprive [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of its intended effect and to deprive a tortfeasor and his insurer of the certainty as to their position which the section was intended to provide.

I recognise that if an order is now made for separate trial of the questions, events may intervene, before that separate trial takes place, which render the order apparently futile. That is to say, the applicants may decide, after all these years, to seek the reinstatement of Somers Pty. Limited and to seek an extension of time to proceed against it. Should they do so, the effect of any such action as they may take in relation to the anticipated separate trial may require consideration before any such separate trial takes place. For example, if, between now and any date fixed for such separate trial, an application is made to extend the limitation period against Somers Pty. Limited, it might be seen to be appropriate to adjourn the separate trial until such application has been dealt with. If, before the date (or any adjourned date) fixed for the conduct of the separate trial, an application to extend the limitation period succeeds, so that the effect of [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) is held to have been nullified, it may be appropriate to vacate the order for separate trial of these questions previously made. But if, as may well be the case, the plaintiffs determine upon further consideration not to pursue any such application, those intervening events may never occur; in which event there is no reason why the separate trial sought by the applicant should not proceed.

For those reasons I make the following orders:-
That in each of the proceedings the following questions be determined together, but separately from any other question and before any other issue in the proceedings:- "(a) Assuming that a charge pursuant to [s.6(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) was created in favour of the plaintiff against the second defendant on or about 17 August 1976, has that charge been extinguished pursuant to [s.63(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s63.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) ? 
If yes to (a), is the plaintiff precluded from bringing or maintaining these proceedings? 
If no to (a), should leave to commence proceedings pursuant xto [s.6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) be refused as to do so would be futile because proceedings against Somers Pty.
Limited have not been commenced and are no longer maintainable by operation of [s.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s14.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) ?"
That the applicant serve on the plaintiffs on or before 28 February 1997 a statement of facts to be assumed or agreed for the purposes of a separate trial and that the plaintiffs on or before 7 March 1997 signify in writing to the applicant their agreement to the proposed statement of facts or, if the facts are not agreed, particulars of the amendments sought and the reasons therefor.
That the applicant file and serve on or before 12 March 1997 an agreed statement of facts or, in the event that agreement has not been reached so that that direction cannot be complied with, cause the matter to be listed for mention before me on 13 March 1997 for further directions.
That the applicant file and serve written submissions on or before 21
March 1997.
That the plaintiffs file and serve their written submissions on or before April 1997.
That the applicant file and serve any written submissions in reply on or before 10 April 1997.
That the matter be listed for further directions on 10 April 1997 with a view then to fixing a hearing date for the separate trial of the said questions.
Costs reserved.
I direct that any application filed for the reinstatement of Somers Pty.
Limited and any application for extension of the limitation period against that company may be made returnable before me.
I direct that any filing fee ordinarily payable in respect of those matters be deferred until further order of the court.
Liberty to apply.
