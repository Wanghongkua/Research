Monday, 20 September 2010  /259773 Armitage versus HXE Limited 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: Between 1965 and 1972 the plaintiff was employed by a company then called Hawker Siddeley Electronics Limited ("the company") in its engineering division. The plaintiff is suffering from mesothelioma and has a life expectancy measured in months. He contends that in his employment with the company he was exposed to asbestos dust and fibres. He has commenced proceedings in the District Court of South Australia seeking damages in respect of his condition.
 The plaintiff has made a claim against the Statutory Reserve Fund in South
Australia pursuant to <case> of the Workers' Compensation Act Amendment Act (SA).
 On 8 July 2010 the solicitors for the Statutory Reserve Fund advised the plaintiff's solicitors that the Fund would concede liability to indemnify the company in respect of established workers' compensation liabilities to the plaintiff.
 On 14 September 1979 the members of the company resolved that it be wound up voluntarily. Mr Alexander MacIntosh was appointed as liquidator. The company's directors made a declaration of solvency in accordance with <case> of the
Companies Act 1961 .  In January 1980 the liquidator filed a return reporting that the assets of the company had been distributed to its sole beneficial shareholder. Section of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) provided that on the expiration of three months after the lodging of the liquidator's return showing the affairs of the company had been fully wound up, the company should be dissolved.
 The solicitors for the Statutory Reserve Fund have advised the plaintiff's solicitors that it is necessary for the plaintiff to take steps to have the company reinstated in order to "validate" proceedings brought to establish a workers' compensation liability in respect of which the Statutory Reserve Fund is liable to indemnify the company.
 The present application is for an order pursuant to <case> of the [Companies Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) declaring the dissolution of the company to have been void and for consequential relief. The application is not brought pursuant to [s
AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth).
 [Section
AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is not a bar to the relief sought. It must be at least doubtful whether the statutory liability of the Fund would be within the section. It would not be just to subject the plaintiff to the task of ventilating such an issue, particularly where it is unnecessary to do so.
 In Baird versus WJT Howes Investments Pty Ltd <case>; [(2008) 68 ACSR 485], Barrett J followed City West Water Ltd versus Mr D
Investments Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2002) 43 ACSR 622] in holding that where a company had been deregistered under the Companies (New South Wales) Code, the provision of that Code remained applicable to applications for reinstatement. This was by virtue of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/s85.html) of the [Corporations (New South Wales) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/) pursuant to which the Code continued to apply by its own force in relation to matters arising directly or indirectly out of matters that arose before the commencement of that Act.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cola1981282/s20.html) of the [Companies (Application of Laws) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cola1981282/) provided that unless the contrary intention appeared all things and circumstances appointed or created by or under the [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) should, subject to the Companies (New South Wales) Code, continue to have the same status, operation and effect as they would have had if the [Companies (Application of Laws)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cola1981282/) had not been enacted.
 Hence the present application is made under the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/). Section 307 of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) provides:  "307 (1) Where a company has been dissolved the Court may at any time within two years after the date of dissolution, on application of the liquidator of the company or of any other person who appears to the Court to be interested, make an order upon such terms as the Court thinks fit declaring the dissolution to have been void, and thereupon such proceedings may be taken as might have been taken if the company had not been dissolved."  The present application is brought 30 years after the dissolution of the company. But there is a path under <case> of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) to enlarge the time for bringing a proceeding under <case> where the justice of the case so requires. Given the long period of latency of the disease from which the plaintiff suffers, justice requires that time be extended and that an order be made declaring the dissolution. However, as provided for by <case>, that order should be made on terms that it not affect any steps taken in the voluntary liquidation of the company including any distribution of assets to members.
 Mr MacIntosh has since retired. The question arises as to what, if anything, should be done upon the making of the order under <case>. If nothing further is done, the company will remain subject to the members' voluntary winding-up. But circumstances will have changed. If the plaintiff's claim is well founded, presumably the defendant company will be insolvent. A new liquidator would have to consider calling a meeting of creditors. Without a new liquidator the company would be without governance.
 In the circumstances, it is appropriate that the company be wound up on the just and equitable ground by order of the Court and that all steps requiring service of a winding-up application, and advertising of such an application, be dispensed with. Such dispensation is warranted as the company has not existed for 30 years. There is no-one who could reasonably be thought of as having an interest in opposing the application. Because the plaintiff has standing as a contingent creditor, [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s462.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) also needs to be considered. In the circumstances of this case, no security for costs of the application is required. A prima facie case for winding up has certainly been established. Indeed I am satisfied that the company should be wound up.
 Notice of this application has been given to the Australian Securities and
Investment Commission. ASIC has stated that it does not oppose the application if certain conditions are satisfied. The conditions include that the order sought for reinstatement be in terms that <case> of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) require ASIC to void the dissolution of the company and that the company be wound up pursuant to <case> of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/).
 [Section
AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides that the Court may make an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of the company if certain conditions are satisfied. Section 307 of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) is in a different form. If an order is made under <case> declaring the dissolution to have been void, the consequence of voidness flows from the making of the order and not from any subsequent step to be taken by ASIC. It is not appropriate to make the order in the terms sought by ASIC.
 Nor do I consider that the winding-up application is to be made pursuant to s 222 of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/). The winding-up is a discrete matter from the dissolution of the company and the avoidance of that dissolution. Whilst the provisions of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) apply to the dissolution and avoidance of the dissolution, I do not consider that those sections govern the winding-up order to be made.
 It appears that the liquidator should have no work to do otherwise than as arises from the plaintiff's claim. There would be no purpose in the liquidator spending money in preparing a preliminary report under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s476.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or in advertising the claims.
 I will give a direction under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s479.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that the liquidator would be justified in not taking any steps in connection with the liquidation other than as may be necessary or desirable in relation to the plaintiff's claim.
 The plaintiff will also be given leave to proceed against the company on terms that he take no steps to enforce any judgment obtained against the company without further leave of the Court. Costs of the present application should be costs in the South Australian proceedings.  For these reasons I make the following orders: . Order that pursuant to subsection 366(4) of the Companies Act 1961 the period for the making by the plaintiff of the application under s (1) of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) be enlarged to 5 August 2010 being the date of the filing of the originating process.
 . Subject to order 3 declare the dissolution of the defendant to have been void.
 . Order that order 2 not affect the validity or operation of any step in the voluntary winding-up of the defendant including any distribution to members.

 . Order pursuant to [s (1)(k)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s461.html) of the [Corporations

Accountants be appointed liquidator of the defendant.
 . Direct pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s479.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that the liquidator would be justified in not taking any steps in connection with the liquidation other than lodging notice of his appointment and otherwise taking such steps as may be necessary or desirable in relation to the plaintiff's claim.
 . Give leave to the plaintiff nunc pro tunc to commence and proceed with proceedings 723/10 against the defendant in the District Court of South
Australia.
 . Direct that without the further leave of the Court the plaintiff take no steps to enforce any judgment obtained by him against the defendant in the
District Court of South Australia otherwise than by resort to proceeds of insurance or indemnity.
 . Order that the plaintiff serve a copy of these orders upon the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission forthwith after the orders are entered.
 . Order that the costs of these proceedings be costs in the proceedings /10 in the District Court of South Australia.

 . These orders are to be entered forthwith.
