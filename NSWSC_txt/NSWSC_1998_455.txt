JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
On 2 May 1994, Irena Plizga was convicted of larceny in the Local Court,
Downing Centre, Sydney. The sentence was for three months periodic detention.
On appeal to the District Court, the sentence was quashed and, in lieu thereof, Ms Plizga was required to enter into recognizance in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for two years. That was on 15 December 1994.

On 9 December 1997, on the application of the NSW Crime Commission, a restraining order was made ex parte by this Court, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), prohibiting disposal or dealing with the interests in property of Mr J R
D'Agostino and of Ms Plizga specified in the order. So far as Ms Plizga is concerned, the property specified was a 1994 Mercedes motor car, and a house property at Coogee (the latter being owned by Mr D'Agostino and Ms Plizga as tenants in common in equal shares).

The present application is made by the Commission on notice to Ms Plizga. It is for summary judgment on its claim for an assets forfeiture order, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the Act, in relation to the same interests in property.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) entitles a person to apply for an order excluding the operation of any assets forfeiture order or any restraining order in relation to the interest in property the subject of any such orders in whole or in part. An application for an exclusion order may be made where an assets forfeiture order has been applied for or has been made.

In the present case, counsel for Ms Plizga sought to bring on an application for an exclusion order at short notice. I refused leave to do so, and ruled that the Commission's application for an assets forfeiture order should proceed, but on the basis that any assets forfeiture order would be stayed to give Ms Plizga the opportunity of making a case for an exclusion order. (That was as the Commission intended in any event.) 
Ms Plizga opposed an assets forfeiture order on the ground that a necessary element in the Commission's case for an assets forfeiture order was not made out, namely, that Ms Plizga had been engaged in "a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more".

The fact relied on by the Commission as making out that element in its case was the larceny for which Ms Plizga was convicted on 2 May 1994. It was submitted on behalf of Ms Plizga that this offence did not qualify because, having been dealt with summarily pursuant to <case> of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), Ms Plizga became liable to a maximum penalty for the offence which was less than five years imprisonment.

It was common ground that if that point went against Ms Plizga, an assets forfeiture order should be made, as claimed.

In order to resolve the issue, it is necessary to examine in further detail the course of the prosecution for larceny in its legislative context, and the course of the proceedings under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).

The prosecution for larceny 
The larceny consisted of the theft of five jumpers from David Jones' store.
The value of the goods did not exceed $500. The property was recovered.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s116.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) provides that every larceny, whatever the value of the property stolen, shall be deemed to be of the same nature.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s117.html) provides that whosoever commits larceny shall, except in the cases thereinafter otherwise provided for, be liable to penal servitude for 5 years.

The effect of these two sections is to prescribe a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment for larceny irrespective of the value of the property stolen, except in the cases subsequently otherwise provided for. Other cases appear in sections shortly following [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s118.html), where penalties of more and less than five years imprisonment are specified.
These include stealing cattle [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s126.html), stealing dogs [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s132.html), stealing wills or codicils [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s135.html), stealing court or public records [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s138.html), stealing property in a dwelling-house [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s148.html), stealing with menaces [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s149.html), stealing goods in process of manufacture [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s150.html), stealing from a ship in port or on wharfs [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s152.html), stealing from a ship in distress or from a wreck [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s153.html), stealing aircraft [(s
B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s154b.html), larceny by clerks or servants [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s156.html), larceny by persons in the Public Service [(s ).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s159.html) 
There are two provisions of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) which enable a charge of larceny to be dealt with summarily, i.e. by a magistrate (and necessarily without a jury) rather than on indictment. These are sections and 496.

Section 476 applies, in the case of larceny, if the value of the property is $15,000 or less, a plea of guilty is accepted, it appears to the magistrate that the case may properly be disposed of summarily, and the accused consents to that course. In such a case, "(n)otwithstanding anything in this Act to the contrary" (that is, notwithstanding the penalties specified in earlier sections), "the maximum punishment which may be imposed by a magistrate under this section is ... (imprisonment for) two years ...".

Section 496 relates specifically to larceny. It provides that if the value of the property is $5,000 or less, the offender "shall on conviction in a summary manner ... be liable to imprisonment for 12 months or to pay a fine not exceeding 50 penalty units or both". If the value of the property involved does not exceed $2,000, "the maximum monetary penalty is 20 penalty units".
The section empowers a Local Court to deal with such an offence summarily pursuant to the section. But by <case>, a Local Court may, in its discretion, decline to do so. Section 497 also provides that nothing in that section or s prevents an offence from being dealt with on indictment.

The effect of these sections is that the prosecuting authority may proceed on indictment for larceny, irrespective of the value of the property involved. On the other hand, it may choose to proceed under <case> or <case> subject to the prescribed conditions for the operation of those sections being met.

In the present case, the Director of Public Prosecution chose to proceed under s 496. The Local Court did not decline to deal with the matter summarily. Ms
Plizga's liability to a penalty on conviction thereby became limited to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twelve months and a fine not exceeding twenty penalty units.

The proceedings under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) 
A restraining order may be made under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the Act in relation to the interests in property of a person suspected of having engaged in "a serious crime related activity". That phrase is defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html), which provides, so far as is relevant as follows: "6(1) In this Act, a reference to a serious crime related activity of a person is a reference to anything done by the person that was at the time a serious criminal offence, whether or not the person has been charged with the offence or, if charged: has been tried, or has been tried and acquitted, or has been convicted (even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside).

In this section, a reference to a serious criminal offence is a reference to: ) [These paragraphs specify ) drug offences] )
 an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involves theft, fraud, obtaining financial benefit from the crime of another, money laundering, extortion, violence, bribery, corruption, harbouring criminals, blackmail, obtaining or offering a secret commission, perverting the course of justice, tax or revenue evasion, illegal gambling, forgery or homicide, or ) [Not relevant] )" 
The reference to theft (that is, larceny) in [s (2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) is to be noted.

A restraining order was made in this case on the basis that the larceny for which Ms Plizga was convicted of on 2 May 1994 constituted "serious crime related activity" within the meaning of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) provides that the Supreme Court must make a forfeiture order in relation to the specified interests in property, on the application of the Commission, provided that the person in respect of whom the restraining order was made was, within the six years last passed engaged in: "(a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or, a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more." 
Thus, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) imposes a higher standard than [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html)
The fact of serious crime related activity must be proved. Proof of suspicion is insufficient. (If the application for an assets forfeiture order fails, the restraining order lapses: [s (9)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html)
Further, the activity must now be shown to involve an indictable quantity of a prohibited substance if it does not involve an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.

Since the conduct relied on in the present case was factual rather than merely suspected from the start, and since it was, from the start, conduct involving theft which, according to [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) and s[22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) must be punishable by imprisonment for five years or more, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) did not lift the bar in a practical way. The question falling to be decided arose as much for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) as it did for the purposes of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html)
That question is whether the commission of the offence of larceny by Ms Plizga truly constituted "serious crime related activity" within the meaning of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) 
In my opinion it did, for the reasons which follow.

Ms Plizga's conduct was "serious crime related activity" if - in the terms of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) - what was done was a "serious criminal offence". It was that if - in terms of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) - the offence was "an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more and involving theft". That it involved theft is clear. Was the "conduct" engaged in by Ms Plizga "an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more"? That is the question.

The scheme of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) shows that it was. First, the statute expressly contemplates that a restraining order and an assets forfeiture order may be made before the person concerned is charged with an offence and, indeed, without ever being charged with an offence. As at the time when the offence was committed, Ms Plizga had unquestionably committed an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. The Director of Public Prosecutions could have chosen to proceed by indictment, thereby attracting the operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s117.html) of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) and a maximum penalty of five years. Thus, the conduct constituted an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more at the time the offence was committed. The prosecuting authority's election to proceed under <case> did not change the character of the conduct at the time it was engaged in by Ms
Plizga. The conduct constituted an offence so punishable.

Secondly, it cannot have been intended that, in the case of larceny of goods of a low value, the characterisation of the offence as one covered by <case> depends on whether the Director chooses to proceed by indicting. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s22.html) is expressed to be capable of operation before prosecution for any offence or, indeed, without prosecution for any offence. If the characterisation of the offence depended on the Director's decision whether to proceed by indictment, [s 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s22.html) could not operate in a case such as this until the decision was made, and would never operate if a prosecution was not instituted. That is antipathetical to the scheme of the legislation.

Thirdly, it is not the offence as committed by the person concerned to which s is directed. That would require a finding that the offence, if committed, would appropriately attract a penalty of imprisonment for five years or more on the application of correct sentencing principles to the particular case. In practice, there is hardly ever a worst case, so that the legislation would be rendered inoperative in relation to this class of case.

Once it is clear that the offence is not the offence as committed by the person concerned but the generic offence as known to the law, for which a maximum penalty is prescribed, it follows that nothing particular to the instant case of that offence is relevant. It is of no more consequence that a procedural course was followed which lowered the maximum penalty in this instance, than that the circumstances of the offence were such that imprisonment for five years or more was never a possible outcome as a matter of practicality.

This approach is supported by authority.

In Wood versus Reason [(1977) 1 NSWLR 631], a person could be disqualified from holding a private enquiry agent's licence under the relevant legislation if "convicted of an offence punishable on indictment".
The person concerned was tried and convicted summarily for an offence which could have been tried on indictment. Yeldham J held that the words quoted above were not directed to what occurred as a matter of procedure and by the exercise of options open to the parties or the magistrate, and that the words meant "capable of being punished on indictment". It was, he said, the intrinsic gravity of the crime charged to which the words were directed.

In that case, the selected measure of intrinsic gravity was whether the offence was indictable. In the present case, it is whether the offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment of five years or more.

Director of Public Prosecutions versus Sinclair (Sperling J, 1 April 1997, unreported) is directly on point. The appellant had been charged with concealing the commission of a serious offence by another person, contrary to [s 316](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s316.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The phrase "serious offence" was defined by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s311.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) as meaning "an offence punishable by imprisonment or penal servitude for five years or more or for life". The other person had elected to be tried summarily for an offence punishable on indictment by a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. His exposure was thereby reduced to a maximum prison term of two years. I held that the offence was nonetheless a "serious offence" within the meaning of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s311.html) I cited Wood versus Reason (supra). I went on to say: "It is the offence in its generic sense which is to be categorised. It is the offence prescribed by the law which has to be `serious' as defined, not the particular offence committed in the case in question.

The seriousness of the offence in the relevant sense is not diminished because the maximum penalty is reduced by election for a particular mode of trial, any more than it is reduced to the maximum penalty which could lawfully be imposed on the particular offender - whether summarily or on indictment - on application of appropriate sentencing principles (which will almost always be much less than the maximum penalty prescribed by law for the generic offence) or reduced to the penalty actually imposed on the particular offender." 
Comment 
Ms Plizga has cause for complaint. It is extraordinary that a petty crime such as she committed should render her liable for the forfeiture of a motor vehicle and a one half share in a residential property, notwithstanding the opportunity she has to make a case for an exclusion order. But her complaint lies with the Parliament, which has chosen to define the class of "serious" crime which activates the legislation as including, in effect, any larceny, no matter how minor objectively and irrespective of mitigating considerations.

My attention has also been directed to the second reading speech of the Hon. J
W Shaw (Attorney General and Minister for Industrial Relations) in support of the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Amendment Bill 1997, which changed the name of the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990 to the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) and enlarged the operation of the statute. Before that amendment, restraining and assets forfeiture orders could be obtained only on the basis of conduct constituting serious offences (suspected or actual respectively) involving illicit drugs and related offences. The bill removed any necessary nexus with a serious drug offence. Of the legislation before the amendment, the Attorney
General said: "Mr President, the purpose of this Bill is to amend the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act to make serious crime and indeed a life of crime a very unattractive option.

Mr President, this Government is determined to make the old adage `crime doesn't pay' a reality.

We are determined to ensure that organised criminals do not profit from their crimes.

One of the best methods of doing this is by attacking the assets accumulated from illegal activity.

It is well known that criminals use the profits from crime to purchase apparently legitimate assets.

The Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act which was introduced in 1990, with the wholehearted support of the then Labor opposition, is designed to allow the State to seize those assets.

The Act facilitates the attack on crime in two ways; criminals lose the money and assets gained through criminal activity and the State uses those proceeds to fund the fight against crime as well as other programs which address the impacts of crime on the community." ....
 "Mr President, it is the view of the Government that this legislation, which enables the assets acquired through criminal activity and the proceeds of crime to be recovered, will become an increasingly important tool in the fight against crime.

The Crime Commission will continue to pursue serious criminals and the links it has forged and continues to develop with other agencies such as the Police
Service, the NCA and the Australian Federal Police will contribute not only to the apprehension of criminals but the stripping of their assets.

Mr President, the message to the drug pushers, the corrupt, the money launderers and other bag carriers for organised crime should be clear.

We will get you.

When we do we will set about depriving you of all you have gained from a life of crime, whether it be your house, your money, your car or any other property." 
Of the proposed amendment, the Attorney General said: "Mr President, this Bill will enable the confiscation provisions of the Act to be used in relation to this group of offence types without requiring a connection with a drug offence.

However, the Act will only apply where the criminal activity of these types would constitute an offence which would carry a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment or more.

This will mean that persons who have engaged in serious criminal activity such as money laundering, bribery, corruption and a range of other types of offence will be liable to have the proceeds of their criminal lifestyle forfeited.

This will be the case even if they have not been involved directly in the drug trade.

Mr President, persons involved in serious or organised crime frequently engage in a range of types of offending.

It is not always possible to demonstrate to the Court the requisite link to drug activity.

This change will enable the provisions of this Act to be used where other, serious offending behaviour can be demonstrated." 
It is not conformable with those objectives that a person convicted of a single instance of shoplifting should suffer the forfeiture of her property on that account, even provisionally. It is also wrong that it should be so. If I could construe the legislation to mean what was apparently intended by the
Government of the day, I would do so, but the language of the legislation will not permit it. The terminology of the legislation is, in my view, intractable.

It is, of course, open to the NSW Crime Commission to invoke the legislation only in suitable cases. This may be a suitable case because of other facts which it has been unnecessary for the Commission to establish under the legislation as it stands. I have no way of knowing, and it is not for me to enquire. That is not the point. The legislation should be amended to limit its use to cases where there is reason to believe that valuable assets have been or may have been obtained through serious criminal activity.

Orders 
That having been said, the Commission is entitled in law to the assets forfeiture order sought.

I make the orders in the short minutes of order signed and dated by me and placed with the papers. I make the following further order.

Liberty to Irena Plizga to apply for reconsideration of Order 2 (as to costs) on seven days notice, to be given within twenty eight days of any order being made pursuant to <case> or <case> of the Act.
