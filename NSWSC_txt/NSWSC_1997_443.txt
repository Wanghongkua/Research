Regina versus Luke Matter No 60644/95 [1997] NSWSC 443 (29 September 1997) 
Regina versus John Luke /95 September 1997 
Gleeson CJ, Sully J, Dunford J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal /95 REGINA versus John LUKE 
JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: The applicant, John Luke, was tried before Madgwick DCJ and a jury in March 1995 on charges of sexual assault. He was convicted on all five counts in the indictment. 
On 8 March 1995 the judge sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 8 March 1995 in respect of each of four counts. On the fifth count he sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of seven years penal servitude and an additional term of three years.

The applicant lodged an appeal against the convictions and sentences which had been imposed on him. The appeal was heard by this Court on 30 May 1996. A judgment dismissing the appeal was delivered on 22 October 1996.

In accordance with the provisions of Rule 53 of the [Criminal Appeal
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/) the orders of this Court were noted on the relevant District Court records on 17 November
This is proved by an affidavit of Kimberley Sobb sworn 26 September 1997 and filed in these proceedings.

By a notice dated 25 February 1997 the applicant purported to institute a further appeal against his convictions raising grounds of appeal that had not been argued in the earlier appeal.

The decision of the High Court in Grierson versus The King <case>; [(1938) 60 CLR 431] is authority for the proposition that in the circumstances outlined this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the further appeal. That principle was recently re-affirmed in the case of Postiglione versus The Queen <case>; [(1997) 71 ALJR 875] in the judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 877 and in the judgment of McHugh J at .

The present appeal represents an attempt to conduct a second appeal in respect of conviction from which an appeal has already been heard and determined on its merits by this Court and in respect of which a judgment has been perfected by the entry of this Court's orders on the relevant District Court records.
There is no jurisdiction in this Court to hear the appeal. The appeal should be dismissed.
 
SULLY J: I agree.
 
DUNFORD J: I also agree.
 
GLEESON CJ: The order of the court is as I have proposed.
