JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR : The plaintiff filed a summons on 22 December 2011. The relief claimed in the summons is " That the Supreme Court remove the public guardian from mum and that I can take mum home where she wants to be ". The summons was listed for hearing before me on 26 March 2012. 
On reviewing the papers I arranged for the matter to be listed for directions. It seemed to me that the application was not in a position to proceed on the materials that were on the file and that there was a want of parties. Coincidentally a notice of motion was filed on behalf of the Attorney-General of New South Wales made returnable today in which the Attorney-General sought leave either to be joined as a defendant or to appear as amicus curiae . 
Amongst the papers that have been filed is a copy of reasons for decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal given on 16 December 2011 ( ADK versus NSW Trustee and Guardian  <case> The Administrative Decisions Tribunal there set aside a decision of the Guardianship Tribunal made on 28 March 2011 in relation to a person whom they called ADM and who is the subject of the proceeding in this court. The Administrative Decisions Tribunal remitted the matter to be heard and decided again by the Guardianship Tribunal. It did not appear from the papers what had been done following the handing down of the decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal on 16 December 2011. That was a further reason for my listing the matter for pre-trial directions. 
It appears that a further application has been lodged in respect of ADM by a daughter of ADM and a person associated with Westmead Hospital seeking guardianship of ADM. I am told that that application is listed for hearing before the Tribunal on 16 March 2012. It would be expected that the Tribunal at the same time would deal with the matter that was remitted to it by the Administrative Decisions Tribunal on 16 December 2011. 
The plaintiff's summons seeks to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the court with respect to guardianship of persons that is preserved by [s 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/s8.html) of the [Guardianship Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/). However, it is well settled that where Parliament has established a statutory tribunal to deal with questions relating to the guardianship of disabled persons and has conferred limited rights of appeal to the Supreme Court from a decision of that Tribunal, it would defeat the statutory scheme if a person, dissatisfied with decisions of the Tribunal, could simply start a separate proceeding by invoking in this Court the Crown's parens patriae jurisdiction. 
It is well settled in a related area dealing with respect to the exercise of those powers concerning children that the court will only intervene in exceptional circumstances. (See generally Re B  <case> at <case>- <case> and the cases there cited.) 
Nothing that has been said on behalf of ADM by the plaintiff indicates that this is an exceptional circumstance that would warrant the court exercising its inherent jurisdiction when there are proceedings listed to be heard in the Guardianship Tribunal in the reasonably near future. I do not think that it would be consistent with the scheme established by Parliament for dealing with such questions for this application to proceed, running as it were in parallel with the proceedings in the Guardianship Tribunal. 
If the Guardianship Tribunal makes a decision which the plaintiff considers to be adverse to the interests of his mother and if, as I would expect will be the position, he is a party to the proceedings before the Tribunal, then he may have a right to appeal and would have in any event the right to seek leave to appeal from such an adverse decision. The statutory regime should be allowed to take its course. 
I have considered whether I should stay the summons. On reflection it appears to me that if any fresh proceeding is to be brought in this Court, it would be the result of further orders to be made in the Guardianship Tribunal and should be brought by way of appeal, or application for leave to appeal, if there are proper grounds to do so. 
For these reasons I order that the summons be dismissed. * * *
