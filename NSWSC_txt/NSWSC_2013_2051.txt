EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: As best as can be gleaned from the discursive affidavit filed, or purportedly filed, by the plaintiff in these proceedings, Mr Kheder is a forensic patient in a correctional facility. The guardian ad litem appointed by the State appears before the Court, and asks the Court to grant legal assistance, pursuant to the provisions of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) (UCPR). 
Mr Kheder has been a forensic patient, or at least in custody, for approximately nine years. He maintains his innocence of the charges that led to his incarceration. It seems, although it is difficult to tell, that he did not receive legal assistance on a previous occasion, nor adequate legal assistance at some other time. It is not absolutely clear. What is clear is that a person who has been incarcerated for nine years is entitled to come before the courts and seek, if there be an error in the administration of justice, a right to be heard and to seek liberty. 
In order to do so adequately, Mr Kheder requires referral under the pro bono scheme in order to make a proper application, supported by proper affidavit material, including the filing of the material that led to his initial incarceration. 
It may be that the proper application is an application for a review of his mental state, or of his conviction or non-conviction, if special orders were made under [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mhpa1990355/s69.html) of the [Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mhpa1990355/). 
In any event, it is beyond doubt in these circumstances that it is in the interests of the administration of justice that Mr Kheder obtain proper legal advice, and to the extent that it is possible, assistance in the drafting of a proper summons and/or other originating process, and representation during the course of the subsequent proceedings to the commencement of that notice. 
The issues of administration of justice in a situation such as this are not dissimilar to the issues discussed by the High Court in Dietrich versus The Queen <case>; [(1992) 177 CLR 292], in which, in effect, the High Court said that a person charged with a serious criminal offence is entitled to be properly represented before they are tried in order to ensure a fair trial.
In this case, a person has been incarcerated for nine years. On the limited material I have seen, that incarceration has occurred in the circumstances of an order of referral to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, but without Mr Kheder being properly represented, or properly assisted in terms of that incarceration. In order for that to be reviewed and properly assessed as early as possible, it is in the interests of the administration of justice for referral to occur. 
In those circumstances, I refer Mr Kheder, and to the extent necessary, his guardian ad litem to the Registrar of the Court, for the purpose of referral to a barrister and/or solicitor on the pro bono panel for legal assistance. 
I do so because of the situation of the litigant, the capacity of the litigant to obtain legal assistance outside of the scheme, the nature and complexity of proceedings that may be instituted, and the interests and administration of justice generally. 
That referral is for the purpose of advice in relation to any and/or all proceedings seeking a review or the cessation of his incarceration or liberty order, representation on direction hearings, interlocutory or final hearing and the like, the drafting and settling of documents to be filed or used in the proceedings, the preparation and representation generally of the conduct of the proceedings, and otherwise as advised. * * *
