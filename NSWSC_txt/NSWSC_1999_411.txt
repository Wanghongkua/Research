 Being tendered on both applications, the areas of relevance contended for include the dealings between Mr Quail on behalf of the defendant and the
Police; the fact and implementation of the asserted agreement between the defendant's solicitors and the Police; the promptitude with which some particulars were supplied in light of information possessed compared with asserted delay in the supply of others; the partiality of the Police in dealing with the subpoena issued by the plaintiff and that by the defendant; the position of the Police in respect of any application for a stay of the civil proceedings.

Honour's judgment of 24 December 1998 that is of fundamental relevance. It is merely by reference to his Honour referring to the submissions advanced for the parties and particularly those in writing that I admit this material to the extent that it may aid the consideration of the significance of the application and its resolution by Ireland J.
