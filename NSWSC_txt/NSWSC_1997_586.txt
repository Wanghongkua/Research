SEARCH WARRANTS - CONSTRUCTION OF PART 4 [ROYAL COMMISSION (POLICE SERVICE)
ACT 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) -
PURPORTED ISSUE OF GENERAL WARRANTS. The appellants were officers of the
Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service who caused ten search warrants to be issued authorising the searching of premises and motor vehicles of the respondents. The warrants were issued pursuant to the [Royal
Commission (Police Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) and the [Search Warrants Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/). The appellants commenced proceedings seeking the quashing of the warrants. Temby
AJ held that the warrants were bad on their face because they were impermissibly broad.

On appeal 
The appellants submitted that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s15.html) of the [Royal Commission (Police Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) empowered the issue of general warrants if the justice issuing the warrant was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing the matters specified in [subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s4.html) of [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/s15.html) 
Held: 
The language of the [Royal Commission (Police Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) relied on by the appellants does not reach the standard of clarity required to change the long established rule at common law that general warrants are invalid.

MacGIBBON versus WARNER & ORS 
MacGIBBON versus VENTURA & ANOR 
MacGIBBON versus O'CONNOR & ORS 
PRIESTLEY JA: These three appeals concern ten search warrants issued pursuant to the [Royal Commission (Police Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) (the
Police Commission Act) and the [Search Warrants Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/) (the [Search Warrants
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/)). The warrants authorised the searching of premises and motor vehicles of three persons, each of whom began proceedings seeking the quashing of the warrants.
The defendants were the justices who issued the warrants and the officers of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (The Police
Commission) who sought and obtained their issue.

The three cases were dealt with together at first instance before Temby AJ.
The search warrants were for relevant purposes all in the same form and were all ordered to be quashed by Temby AJ for the same reasons.

Each search warrant said on its face, after some introductory words, that the issuing justice: "... being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for doing so, granted this Search Warrant authorising [a named officer] an officer of the Royal
Commission into the New South Wales Police Service and such other officers of the Royal Commission as are named in the First Schedule hereto: ) To enter, by day, [described premises] and whilst therein, to search in and about those premises.
 ) To search the premises for prohibited drugs, drug paraphernalia, documents, correspondence, facsimiles, photographs, audio or video cassettes, video production equipment, banking and financial records, monies, bullion and other precious metals, jewellery, gems and other precious stones, antiques, credit cards, safety deposit box keys, post office box keys, forms of identification, diaries, notebooks, personal organisers, telephone indexes, computers, computer disks or records or any other documentation or things found in or about these premises and to deliver these things so seized, to the
Royal Commission." 
Temby AJ noted that the evidence before him was very limited; that it was not in dispute that the warrants had been executed and property seized; that the case argued before him had nothing to do with the issue of the warrants or the manner of their execution; and that if the plaintiffs were to obtain relief it had to be on the basis that the warrants were bad on their face.

After consideration of the history of general warrants and the provisions of the Police Commission Act and the [Search Warrants
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/swa1985175/), Temby
AJ reached the opinion that the warrants were bad on their face because they were impermissibly broad. He added that the very breadth of the warrants justified the conclusion that the justices who issued them misapprehended their functions.

On this footing he quashed them all. The defendants appealed and the appeals were heard together on the agreed basis that they all raised the same issues.

On appeal, it was acknowledged by counsel for the appellants that at common law the warrants would be invalid because of their width. However, it was contended that Part 4 of the Police Commission Act headed "Search and
Listening Device Warrants" and containing ss 15-25 authorised the issue of warrants in the very wide terms of the warrants in question here. In particular ss 15, 16 and 22 were relied on. So far as relevant those sections are as follows: "15.(1) An authorised justice to whom an application is made under subsection may issue a search warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so.

The Commissioner, on application made to the Commissioner under subsection (4), may issue a search warrant if the Commissioner thinks fit in the circumstances and if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so.

Search warrants should, as far as practicable, be issued by authorised justices, but nothing in this subsection affects the discretion of the
Commissioner to issue them.

An authorised person may apply to an authorised justice or the
Commissioner for a search warrant if the person has reasonable grounds for believing that: there is in or on any premises a document or other thing connected with any matter that is the subject of the Commission's inquiry or that such a document or other thing may, within the next following 72 hours, be brought into or onto the premises; and the matter involves any conduct of a person that constitutes or involves or may constitute or involve a criminal offence.
 ...
 .(1) A search warrant authorises any police officer, or any other person, named in the warrant: to enter the premises; and to search the premises for documents or other things, connected with any matter that is the subject of the Commission's inquiry; and to seize any such documents or other things found in or on the premises and deliver them to the Commission.

A police officer executing a search warrant may search a person found in or on the premises whom the police officer reasonably suspects of having a document or other thing mentioned in the warrant.
 ...
 ...
If, in the course of searching, in accordance with the terms of a search warrant, for documents or other things: the person executing the warrant finds a document or other thing that the person believes on reasonable grounds to be evidence that would be admissible in the prosecution of a person for an indictable offence against the law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; and the first-mentioned person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to seize the document or other thing in order to prevent its concealment, loss, mutilation or destruction, or its use in committing such an offence, that person may seize the document or other thing and, if it is so seized, it is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been seized pursuant to the warrant." 
The primary argument for the appellants was that <case> empowered a justice to issue a warrant upon being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for doing so, those being the reasonable grounds for believing matters specified in subs (4). It was then submitted that once a justice had issued a warrant the very fact of its existence authorised the persons named in it to do the things set out in pars (a), (b) and (c) of <case>.

This approach involved reading <case> without regard to <case>, deciding on the meaning of <case>, and only then considering <case>, in the light of the final view, already formed, of <case>. One result of this approach is that the only safeguard against abuse of the power conferred by <case> to enter, search and seize, lay in the necessity for the justice issuing the warrant to be satisfied of the reasonable grounds listed in <case>. The satisfaction of the justice was all that was required. Once that safeguard had been satisfied, a warrant could be issued which did not specify anything in particular other than the names of the officers who could execute it and the premises which it authorised those officers to enter and search and in which it authorised them to seize documents or other things connected with any matter the subject of the Commission's inquiry.

This was the primary submission for the appellants in the appeal. They appear to have relied on other arguments before Temby AJ. These were formally relied on again in the appeal, but virtually the whole argument in this court was devoted to what I have called the primary submission. It also appears to me to have been the strongest submission available to the appellants.

Counsel for the appellants readily acknowledged that his submission amounted to saying that <case> was a statutory provision empowering the issue of general warrants. He submitted that it was within the power of parliament to enact such provisions and that parliament had done so in the Police Commission Act because of the great public importance of the subject matter of the Act.

General warrants have been condemned by the courts for centuries. They have been regarded as instruments which facilitate the abuse of executive power.
They are invalid at common law. It is true that it is open to State Parliament to pass laws authorising the use of such warrants, but courts will not read legislation as taking such a drastic step unless it is very clear in its meaning and effect: indeed it has been said in recent cases in the High Court similar to the present, that the intention of parliament to change the common law must be made "unmistakably clear" (Coco versus R <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 427] at 437) or expressed with "irresistible clearness" (Bropho v Western Australia <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 1] at 19).

The language from the Police Commission Act relied on by the appellants does not in my opinion reach the standard of clarity required to change a very long established common law rule protecting civil liberties. In fact, it seems to me that the provisions relied on can be more reasonably read as not departing from the common law proscription of general warrants than as authorising general warrants.

It is a recognised rule of construction that the meaning of particular parts of a statute should only be arrived at after consideration of all the parts of the statute which have any bearing on the particular part in question. In the present case that rule of construction requires postponement of decision of the meaning of <case> until the bearing upon it of, inter alia, <case> has been considered.

Section 16(2) in particular is written consistently with the idea that the search warrant it refers to is not a general warrant. Further, it is inconsistent with the idea that the search warrant it refers to might be a general warrant. If <case> intended to authorise the issue of general warrants, the subsection need only have said "A police officer executing a search warrant may search a person found in or on the premises".

Section 16(2) must have been written on one of three assumptions: that <case> authorised the issue of general warrants; that it authorised the issue of warrants which specified documents or things to be searched for by virtue of the authority of the warrant; or that, <case> having authorised the issue of general warrants, <case> in stating the power to search a person, made the power to search the person more limited than the power to search the premises.

As a matter of the language of ss 15 and 16, the second assumption seems to me to be the most likely. Further, if that assumption is made there is no problem in reading all the provisions of Pt 4 of the Police Commission Act consistently with one another. On the other hand, to read <case> as authorising the issue of general warrants both raises the problems of construction then caused by <case> and interprets Pt 4 as departing from the common law position when its language does not plainly call for such a departure.

These considerations are sufficient to satisfy me that this court should not accept the primary submission for the appellants. It was elaborated with considerable skill by counsel for the appellants and many more provisions of
Pt 4 of the Police Commission Act were the subject of careful scrutiny than I have discussed. However, the detailed argument seems to me to be substantially answered by what I have already said. To the extent that further arguments were relied on, they were those put before Temby AJ who dealt with them in a way which in my opinion was correct. In view of the way the argument went in this court it is unnecessary to say anything further about those arguments.

In my opinion the appeals should be dismissed with costs.
