JUDGMENT 
In the substantive judgment in these proceedings <case> delivered on 23 August 2012, I said - in connection with the identification and valuation of the property of the parties available for division for the purpose of Dr Julienne Grace's cross-claim for adjustive property orders under (CTH) [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), [s :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s79.html) The evidence does not permit the exercise to be undertaken with precision, largely because there is no clear picture at any single date of Julienne's position, a matter for which she must bear responsibility. Nonetheless, the property of the parties as at or about the date of Colin's death may be summarised as in the following table. Notes explaining the various entries follow the table. As will become apparent, in respect of the shareholdings in the private companies, I have adopted the methodology used in the defendants' submissions, but as at an earlier date. This has usually involved substituting different revaluations of real property into financial statements for different years from those used in the submissions. To avoid excessively cluttering these reasons I have not set out the calculations in detail; but if the parties desire supplementary reasons in that respect they are at liberty to seek them, preferably before final orders are made.
The invitation to seek supplementary reasons was made in connection with the valuation of the shareholdings in the private companies, namely Nevilda Investments, Nevilda Holdings, Grace Securities, Sharander, and N&H Grace Holdings. Supplementary reasons having been requested, I now set out in more detail the calculations which implement the methodology described above, namely (1) adoption of the methodology used in the defendants' submissions (which the plaintiff's reply submissions generally followed), (2) substitution of the financial statements for years more proximate to the date of notional adjustment (November 1992) where available, and (3) substitution of revaluations of real property more proximate to the date of notional adjustment. 
Nevilda Investments. As explained in the substantive judgment (at [260]), the defendants substituted into the Nevilda Investments accounts for the 1995 year, revaluations of real property as at that date. This is shown in the first column below. I used the valuations of the relevant properties as at January 1993 (ascertainable from the table of valuations in DX287) rather than May 1995, and substituted them into the 1993 accounts (ascertainable from the previous year column in the 1994 accounts in DX314) rather than the 1995 accounts. This is shown in the second column below.

Colin = 12/112 shares ,520 ,323 /754 New South Head Rd was acquired after 30 June 1993. 
Boston Ave, East Malvern was acquired after 30 June 1994.
Prior to his death, Colin held 10 of the 112 shares in Nevilda Investments, and was beneficially entitled to another two (held in trust for him by Hilda and Carolyn). This process results in Nevilda Investments having net assets of $4,081,679 as at 30 June 1993, so that one ordinary share would be worth $36,444, and Colin's twelve ordinary shares $437,323. 
Nevilda Holdings. As explained in the substantive judgment (at [261]), the value of the ordinary (equity) shares is derived from the same process as applied by the defendants as at May 1995, but substituting the value of the underlying Nevilda Investments shares as deduced in the previous paragraph, and using the 1993 instead of the 1995 accounts.

This results in a value for Colin's 300 ordinary shares of $1,792,632 - an immaterial discrepancy from the $1,792,012 mentioned in the substantive judgment.
Grace Securities. As explained in the substantive judgment (at [262]), the defendants ascribed to each share a value of $2,286,150, by substituting 1995 valuations, this time into the 1993 financial statements - presumably because the 1995 financial statements were not contained in DX314. In any event, on my preference for the September 1992 date, the 1993 financial statements are more proximate and appropriate. However, 1993 and not 1995 valuations should be used for that purpose. In the case of this company's properties, however, only 1995 valuations were obtained. From the overall trend in the valuation evidence over this period, I have assumed a general increase in values of about 20% over the relevant two-year period. Working backwards, this involves a discount of about 15% from the 1995 values. It is also necessary to substitute the revaluations of the 300 shares in Nevilda Holdings (as per para 6 above) and the 200 shares in Sharander (as per para 9 below).

Julienne =1/2 ORD ,286,150 ,907,131
This results in a value for each of Colin's and Julienne's shareholding of $1,907,131, and exposes an error in the substantive judgment, where I concluded that value per share was $1,724,978. I have not been able to identify the source of that error in the previous calculation.
Sharander. As explained in the substantive judgment (at [263]), using a similar process, the defendants attribute to 200 shares held by Colin in Sharander a value of $183,326 as at April 1995, and a corresponding value to the equivalent number of shares held by Julienne. Sharander's property at Curlewis St was valued only as at 1995, and accordingly I have applied a 15% discount and substituted that discounted valuation in the 1993 instead of the 1995 accounts; this results in each parcel of 200 shares being worth $163,540, a minor discrepancy from the $163,604 mentioned in the substantive judgment.

N&H Grace Holdings. As explained in the substantive judgment (at [264]), the defendants attributed to Colin's shareholding in N&H Grace Holdings a value of $263,646, by substituting the revaluation of the Sharander shares into the 1998 balance sheet obtained from the 1999 financial statements - presumably because none other after 1990 were in evidence. Applying the above revaluation of Sharander to the same balance sheet results in a value for Colin's 1002 shares of $244,056, which differs immaterially from the $244,119 mentioned in the substantive judgment.

The error in the substantive judgment in the calculation of the value of the shares in Grace Securities affects both the husband's and the wife's share, as each held one of two shares. On this account (and on account of the other minor discrepancies noted above) the table of assets in the substantive judgment must be amended, as follows:

Net divisible property ,497,365
Accordingly, the net divisible property as at September 1992 was in the order of $9,497,365 (not $9,132,630), of which Julienne was entitled to $3,129,047 (not $2,946,958), or 33% (a greater share than the 32% I had originally thought). This is because the correction in respect of Grace Securities increases each of Colin's and Julienne's property by $182,153. Consequently, the alteration that would have been made had Colin not died is slightly less than I had originally contemplated, and there is similarly even less reason still to make an adjustive property order in the light of the consequences of and circumstances following his death. 
As a result of the foregoing, some amendments are required to some of the summary paragraphs in the substantive judgment, as follows.
Paragraph 288 of the substantive judgment requires revision, to the following effect: As at the notional adjustment date the actual distribution of assets was :33 in favour of Colin, and as I have concluded that an appropriate apportionment was 60:40, it can be concluded, for the purposes of [s (8)(b)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s79.html), that had Colin not died the court would have made an order adjusting the interests of the parties in favour of Julienne, so as to produce a distribution that was 60:40 in favour of Colin.
Paragraphs 293 and following of the substantive judgment require revision, to the following effect: The second impact of Colin's death is that, by survivorship, Julienne succeeded to Colin's share in Burrabirra Avenue, unencumbered. The practical effect of this was an adjustment in her favour of $750,000, increasing her net position to $3,879,047, or 41% of the pool of property. Only a further $157,333 would have been required to produce the notional 57.5:42.5 distribution, based on the original pool.
 Thirdly, however, under Colin's will, Deborah also obtained significant benefits. Through the shares in Grace Securities, Deborah received property to the value of $1,907,131, and through the shares in Sharander, a further $163,540. In all, this amounted to almost 22% of the divisible pool of property. This is of importance because, having regard to (1) the alignment of
Deborah with Julienne and David with Colin following separation, (2) the arrangement between Colin and Julienne following their separation that he would provide for David while she would provide for Deborah, (3) the fact that
Julienne made a will on February 1988 leaving the bulk of her estate to
Deborah, and explaining in the body of her will that she did so because Colin was proposing by his will to leave his estate to David, and (4) the alignment of the parties in these proceedings, so that it may be considered improbable that David would inherit significantly if at all from Julienne, it is necessary to consider whether - at least to the relatively small extent of $157,333, which corresponds to about 7.5% of Deborah's inheritance from Colin - it should be borne by Julienne's share of the matrimonial pool.
 In my judgment it should, first because the provision made by Colin for
Deborah significantly reduced Julienne's obligation to provide for her; secondly because her remaining 41% share was ample to provide for Julienne's needs; and thirdly because treating the distribution to Deborah in that way would result in Julienne receiving 41% of the matrimonial pool, David 37% (being Colin's residuary estate) and Deborah 22%, but with the likelihood that in due course Deborah and not David would inherit from Julienne.
 Accordingly, once the [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s75.html) adjustment in favour of Colin is disregarded by reason of his death, the appropriate apportionment returns to 57.5:42.5. As a result of the will, the distribution in favour of Julienne increased from 33% to 41%, by reason of her succession to Colin's interest in Burrabirra Ave. Although this implies that there ought to have been an adjustment in favour of Julienne to increase her interest to 42.5%, Deborah received 22% of the pool pursuant to Colin's will, and given the sufficiency of 41% amply to provide for Julienne's needs, and the alignments of the parties and the arrangements they agreed in respect of provision for the two children, it is just and equitable that the distribution to Deborah be treated, at least to the extent of 1.5% of the pool, as being for the benefit of Julienne.
Paragraphs 315 and 316 of the substantive judgment require revision, to the following effect: The net divisible property of Colin and Julienne as at September 1992 was in the order of $9,497,365, of which Julienne was then entitled to $3,129,047, or 33%. Overall, the contributions of Colin up to that notional date of adjustment exceeded those of Julienne, in my assessment by 57.5% to 42.5%. On balance, the [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s75.html) factors weighed in favour of Colin, albeit that given the size of the pool of assets, their relative impact would have been slight, justifying a further adjustment in his favour of 2.5%, resulting in an overall apportionment 60:40 in favour of Colin as at the notional adjustment date. As, at the notional adjustment date, the actual distribution of assets was 67:33 in favour of
Colin, and an appropriate apportionment was 60:40, had Colin not died the court would have made an order adjusting the interests of the parties in favour of Julienne, so as to produce a distribution 60:40 in favour of Colin.
 Once the [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s75.html) adjustment in favour of Colin is disregarded by reason of his death, the appropriate apportionment returns to 57.5:42.5. As a result of the will, the distribution in favour of Julienne increased from 33% to 41%, by reason of her succession to Colin's interest in Burrabirra Ave. Although this implies that there ought to be an adjustment in favour of Julienne to increase her interest to 42.5%, Deborah received 22% of the pool pursuant to Colin's will, and given the sufficiency of 41% amply to provide for Julienne's needs, and the alignments of the parties and the arrangements they agreed in respect of provision for their two children, it is just and equitable that the distribution to Deborah be treated, at least to the extent of 1.5% of the pool, as being for the benefit of Julienne. It is therefore not still appropriate to make an adjustive property order. Accordingly, I would not make an order under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s79.html) in substitution for the order set aside.
Orders may now be made to give effect to the substantive judgment.
