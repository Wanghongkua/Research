NEGLIGENCE - causation - cross-claim for contribution - onus upon defendant to prove that cross-defendant is a tortfeasor - where state of scientific knowledge and medical evidence is insufficient to prove legal causation - [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) , [s 5.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) 
The respondent was successfully sued for personal injury by a plaintiff (the respondent's former employee) suffering from asbestosis. The appellant had supplied asbestos products to the respondent during the latter half of the plaintiff's employment with the respondent. The respondent cross-claimed against the appellant, seeking a contribution from it under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) .
Under that section, the respondent had to establish that the appellant was a tortfeasor, joint or otherwise. The appellant appealed against the trial judge's determination that it was a tortfeasor and against his Honour's apportionment of liability (which was assessed at 50%) against it.

HELD, allowing the appeal: 
The respondent did not show that the appellant was a tortfeasor, as required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) , because on the medical evidence it had not been proved that the appellant's negligence caused the plaintiff's injury.

It is not sufficient to prove causation to demonstrate that a wrongdoer's conduct cannot be excluded as a cause of injury.

WALLABY GRIP (BAE) PTY LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) versus MACLEAY-HASTINGS AREA HEALTH SERVICE 
JUDGMENT 
SHELLER JA: I agree with Beazley JA. 
BEAZLEY JA: This is an appeal from a decision of O'Meally J sitting as a member of the Dust Diseases Tribunal. The proceedings in the Tribunal were commenced by Mr Steep as plaintiff, against the respondent, who had been the plaintiff's employer. The appellant supplied asbestos products to the respondent during the latter part of the plaintiff's employment with the respondent. The respondent cross-claimed against the appellant seeking contribution from it under [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) . The plaintiff succeeded against the respondent and there is no appeal from that part of the trial judge's determination. The appeal is brought by the appellant against his Honour's determination that it was a tortfeasor and against his Honour's apportionment of liability against it. 
Background 
The plaintiff was employed by the respondent from 1955 to 1977 and was exposed to asbestos during the whole of that period. From 1966 the appellant supplied asbestos to the respondent. The type of asbestos supplied by the appellant was amosite, a virulent promoter of asbestos-related diseases. The evidence was silent as to the type of asbestos used by the respondent prior to 1966, although there was no change in the use to which the asbestos was put by the respondent throughout the whole period. The plaintiff was first diagnosed with mesothelioma in 1995. His only exposure to asbestos was during the course of his employment with the respondent.

The entire medical evidence in the case was adduced pursuant to the provisions of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ddta1989243/s25.html) of the [Dust Diseases Tribunal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ddta1989243/) .
That section permits evidence from other cases heard by the Tribunal to be tendered in evidence. The only medical evidence tendered under the section was the evidence of Dr Joseph in the cases of Phillips (DDT 98/90), McIlwaine (DDT 34/90), Scott (DDT 48/90) and Segelow (DDT 59, 66/91). That evidence established that mesothelioma: is a disease of the pleura, caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibres; has a latency period of 4 - 75 years, with a mean latency period of 37 years; and is a dose-related disease.

These attributes of the disease are well documented. However, they reveal little about the aetiology of the disease, which Dr Joseph described as uncertain. The uncertain aetiology of mesothelioma raises significant legal issues in relation to proof of causation, which is the central issue in this appeal.

Trial Judge's Finding 
His Honour found that the appellant was liable as a tortfeasor in respect of the plaintiff's injury and so liable to contribution under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/). This finding was based upon the premise that all exposure to asbestos contributes to the contraction of mesothelioma and that the plaintiff had suffered a single indivisible injury. In reaching this conclusion his Honour said: "As a member of a specialist Tribunal, it is well known to me, as it is to other members, that mesothelioma is a form of cancer to which all asbestos exposure contributes. It is a disorder quite different in nature from asbestosis and other fibrosis induced diseases, caused by exposure to fibrosis inducing substances. These produce increasing fibrosis with continued exposure. Mesothelioma is not such a disease. It is not the culmination of a progression, nor a cumulative process, such as occurs in cases of asbestosis or silicosis. It is not the result of successive deteriorations. By reason of the nature of mesothelioma, one does not have it until shortly before its symptoms are manifested. In a case of mesothelioma, a plaintiff is suffering from an injury which is one and indivisible." 
This passage did not identify what evidence led his Honour to his conclusion.
In the immediately preceding section of the judgment, his Honour had referred to significant portions of the <case> material. It is necessary to refer to that material.

In Phillips' case Dr Joseph gave evidence that: "... I'm certainly of the opinion that [Phillips'] mesothelioma is attributable to his exposure to asbestos and that that exposure occurred over a period of approximately 36 months. No one could say at what particular point he inhaled the particular fibres that caused his mesothelioma. I mean, unless they had been tagged with a nuclear identification you couldn't possibly say which of those fibres was the cause. I mean, the exposure occurred over that period of time and any one of those days might have been the day on which he inhaled the fibres that got out to his pleura and caused the mesothelioma, because its the fibres that reach the pleura which cause the mesothelioma." 
Dr Joseph also said that: "[the plaintiff's] total exposure has been the cause and I wouldn't be prepared to try to differentiate any one period from the another period..." 
In Scott, Dr Joseph expressed the opinion that: "[mesothelioma] is cumulative in that the longer the exposure and the heavier the exposure the greater the dose of asbestos which enters the lung and therefore the greater the chance of fibres getting into the periphery of the lung where they would generate mesothelioma, so therefore in a sense it is cumulative..." and in Segelow he said: "[there was] no way of knowing which particular dose of asbestos [was] the cause." 
Counsel for the appellant referred the Court to additional parts of Dr
Joseph's evidence to the effect that: (i) the nature of the process which occurs between the asbestos fibre and the mesothelium and which causes the negligent tumour is "probably something at the molecular level"; and (ii) the most significant, that is, the most likely cause of mesothelioma is asbestos inhaled during the period of early exposure.

The appellant submitted that his Honour's conclusion in the passage set out above appeared to be based upon his knowledge acquired as a member of a specialist tribunal and not upon the medical evidence, or alternatively that his conclusion reflected a misunderstanding or a misconstruction of the medical evidence. It was submitted that Dr Joseph's evidence, taken as a whole was inconsistent with the "one and indivisible" injury theory which his
Honour not only postulated, but applied in determining that the appellant was liable under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) It followed on this submission that Dr Joseph's evidence did not provide the necessary evidentiary base to prove that the appellant's negligence was causative of the plaintiff's mesothelioma.

Causation 
The respondent's contribution claim against the appellant was brought pursuant to [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/). To succeed under that section, the respondent had to establish that the appellant was a tortfeasor, whether joint or otherwise. Although the appellant was not sued directly by the plaintiff, the issues which arise as to causation in a claim brought under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) are the same as arise in the case of multiple defendants. Those issues were considered in two recent decisions in this Court: see Bendix Mintex Pty Ltd v
Barnes [(1997) 42 NSWLR 307]; ICI
Australia Operations Pty Ltd versus Walsh [(1997) 15 NSWCCR 279.] The plaintiff failed in both cases.

The difficulty that confronted the plaintiff in Bendix was that his evidence established no more that that his exposure to asbestos in his various employments following the first employment in which he was exposed to asbestos could not be excluded as a cause of his mesothelioma: Bendix at 343. This was fatal to the plaintiff's claim, as it is well established that causation is not established by showing only that a possible causative factor cannot be excluded as the cause of injury. This is discussed further below. The same fate was suffered by the plaintiff in Walsh. In that case, Mason P confirmed the views he had expressed in Bendix, stating at 284: "...[in] cases involving mesothelioma and multiple defendants I concluded that the ultimate issue becomes one of deciding which (if any) of the persons sued were shown, on the balance of probabilities, to have caused or materially contributed to the plaintiff's mesothelioma. Expert evidence may establish that a defendant's conduct might have caused or materially contributed to the illness, even though there may be a weight of evidence to the contrary.
Nevertheless there remains a critical distinction between expert evidence that a causal link is possible, and a sustainable finding by the trier of fact that it was demonstrated as a matter of probability." 
The medical evidence in Walsh was to the same effect as it is in this case (and for that matter, in Bendix). Thus, in Walsh, for example, Dr
Schneeweiss refused to exclude any single asbestos exposure as relevant to the development of mesothelioma and agreed that he did "not really try and determine which exposure it was that caused the mesothelioma". When asked to assess whether a particular exposure was more probable than not to have caused the mesothelioma, Dr Schneeweiss responded, "it is quite possible and it may be that there's a critical degree of additional exposure that plays a part in these things, I don't know, I'm surmising ...". Evidence from Dr Joseph was also adduced in Walsh under <case>. That evidence was to the same effect as that adduced in this case. In Walsh, Mason P stated at 292: "[e]ach expert frankly admitted that he could not suggest what caused mesothelioma, and that when speaking of a greater or lesser likelihood he was addressing a mere statistical probability. When the key passages referring to `cumulative exposure' are examined, they show the two experts honestly and consistently reaffirmed their agnosticism on the matter." 
Neither Bendix nor Walsh established any new principle. Rather, each case applied well known principles of causation. Relevantly, for the purposes of this case, those principles are:
A plaintiff must establish that his or her injuries are "caused or materially contributed to" by the defendant's wrongful conduct: see Duyvelshaff versus Cathcart & Ritchie Ltd [(1973) 47 ALJR 410] at 138, per
Gibbs J; Tubemakers of Australia Ltd versus Fernandez [(1976) 50 ALJR 720] at , per Mason J; Bonnington Castings Ltd versus Wardlaw <case>; [[1956] AC ] at 620, per Lord Reid; McGhee versus National Coal Board <case>; [[1973] 1 WLR 1] at 4, 6, 8 and 12; March versus E & MH Stramare <case>; [(1991) 171 CLR 506] per Mason CJ at 514; Bendix at 339; Walsh at 283;
Proof of default by the defendant followed by injury of the plaintiff is insufficient to establish causation: 
St George Club Ltd versus Hines [(1961) 35 ALJR 106] at 107; [[1962] ALR 39] at 41; Quinn versus Cameron & Robertson Ltd [[1958] AC ] at 23;
Bendix at 315; and
If the defendant's negligence cannot be causally linked to the particular risk, the plaintiff must bear the loss: see Rhesa Shipping Co SA versus Edmunds, The `Popi M' [[1985] 2 Lloyd's Rep ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1985%5d%202%20Lloyds%20Rep%201 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 5; Bendix at 317.
A causal connection is established if it appears that the plaintiff would not have sustained his or her injuries had the defendant not been negligent: 
ICIANZ Ltd versus Murphy [(1973) 47 ALJR 122] at -128; March versus E & MH Stramare <case>; [(1991) 171 CLR 506]; Bendix at 338;
The impossibility of excluding a factor as a cause of injury does not establish that factor as the cause of that injury: 
Sydney County Council versus Furner (1991) 7 NSCCR 210 per Hope AJA at 214,
Barnes versus Bendix per Beazley JA at 339;
A plaintiff must show more than that it is possible that injury was caused by the defendant: 
Bonnington Castings Ltd versus Wardlaw <case>; [[1956] AC ];
One or more defendants may be liable if each has been shown to have negligently exposed a plaintiff to a risk of contracting the fatal disease. It will be sufficient to establish liability against each if their several acts caused or contributed materially to the onset of mesothelioma: Bendix at ;
A material increase in the risk of injury by a defendant is not legally equated with a material contribution to the injury by a defendant. However, in "some circumstances if it were proved that the defendant did `materially increase the risk' of injuring the plaintiff then the court might infer causation, ie. that the defendant's negligence `materially contributed' to the injury": see Wilsher versus Essex Area Health Authority <case>; [[1988] AC ];
Andrew Grubb, `Causation and Medical Negligence' [1988] Cam LJ 350; Bendix at 316; Walsh at 284; 
This last proposition is well illustrated by the facts in Wilsher. In that case the plaintiff, who was born prematurely, required the administration of oxygen to survive. Through the negligence of the doctor he was given an excessive amount. The plaintiff developed retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) which produced blindness. There were several possible causes of the plaintiff's RLF.
Lord Bridge considered that although the doctor's negligence increased the risk of the plaintiff developing RLF, it had only done so in the sense of adding a new possible cause of RLF to the already existing range of potential causes. That was insufficient to establish causation in fact.

The application of these principles can cause a plaintiff considerable difficulty when suing multiple defendants, in circumstances where it is unclear which defendant(s) may be liable. However, a number of principles have emerged in the cases to assist proof of causation in such circumstances. See the discussion by Mason P in Bendix at 317 ff. Relevantly for the purposes of this case, those principles are: the trier of fact is entitled (indeed encouraged) to take a "robust and pragmatic approach" to proof of causation: Wilsher versus Essex Area Health
Authority <case>; [[1988] AC 1074] at 1090, per Lord Bridge; causation will not be defeated by the absence of evidence showing precisely how an event occurred: see Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd versus Forst <case>; [(1940) 64 CLR 538]; Tubemakers of Australia Ltd versus Fernandez [(1976) 50 ALJR ]; and slight evidence may suffice to persuade the trier of fact that liability has been sheeted home to a defendant where the facts are particularly within the knowledge of that party: Parker versus Paton <case>; [(1941) 41 SR 237]; [58 WN 189]; Hampton Court Ltd versus Crooks <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 367] at 371-372.

When the medical evidence in this case is reviewed as a whole, it went no further than that in Bendix and in Walsh, namely that the defendant's negligence could not be excluded as a cause of the injury. Even the uncontroversial factors of latency period and dose relationship, to which I have referred above, provide little assistance to the court in the determination of the issue of causation. For example, latency is a measure of the time between the time of first known exposure and the date of contraction of the disease. However, there was no evidence as to the method used to derive the mean latency period, or the relevance of either the latency period or mean latency period to the aetiology of the disease or the legal issue of causation. The evidence also established that the higher the dose of asbestos to which a person was exposed, the more likely it is that the person will contract mesothelioma, but that dose is not as significant in relation to the contraction of mesothelioma as it is in relation to the contraction of asbestosis, which is accepted to be a disease of gradual onset. However, the evidence as to the significance of dose-relationship when taken in conjunction with the evidence as a whole, provided no assistance to the determination of the question of whether any particular exposure caused the mesothelioma.

It seems to me that when his Honour referred to an "injury which is one and indivisible" he was reflecting that part of Dr Joseph's evidence that "[mesothelioma] is cumulative" and "total exposure has been the cause".
However, those portions of the evidence do not reflect the totality of the evidence. Indeed, it gave to that evidence a complexion which Dr Joseph's evidence, taken as a whole, did not bear. The medical evidence did not establish that the exposure during the period 1966 to 1977 more probably than not, was a cause of the plaintiff's mesothelioma. At the most, it demonstrated that that exposure may have been a cause. That being the case, it was insufficient to establish that the negligence of the appellant was causally responsible for the plaintiff's injury. It follows from what I have said that the conclusions drawn by the trial judge in this case were not open to him on the evidence and the appeal must succeed.

I have already referred to the difficulties of proving causation against any or any particular defendant which may confront plaintiffs in mesothelioma cases where there are multiple defendants. This appeal, involving a cross- claim between a guilty defendant and another potential tortfeasor, raises the same problem. The approach which has been espoused by Meagher JA in Walsh and Stein JA in Bendix to the resolution of the problem where the medical and scientific knowledge cannot provide the legally certain answers which common law causation principles demand is appealing, but in my opinion, does not accord with established principle. The result in cases such as this is that it leaves a party unable to satisfy the legal onus to establish that the negligence of another party caused the injury. However, the legal impasse posed by the principles of causation in cases of this type is not something which the Court can remedy by decisions which do not apply well established legal principles. Nor is it a problem which, with respect to the trial judge, can be resolved by reliance upon his expertise acquired as a member of a specialist tribunal. In my opinion, the advantages which membership of a specialist tribunal are intended to promote do not extend to applying the member's own views of the aetiology of a disease which is not supported by the evidence.

I am of the opinion that the respondent did not establish that the appellant's negligence was causative of the plaintiff's injury. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal. My conclusion in respect of the appeal makes it unnecessary to deal with the question of apportionment, however, I would not have interfered with the trial judge's apportionment.

I would propose the following orders:
Appeal allowed.
The orders of the court below be set aside and in lieu thereof, there be a verdict for the appellant on the respondent's cross-claim.
The respondent to pay the costs of the cross-claim in the court below.
The respondent to pay the costs of the appeal but to have a certificate under the [Suitors' Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) , if so entitled.

SHEPPARD AJA: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the judgment to be delivered by Beazley JA. I am in agreement with her Honour's conclusion that the respondent did not establish that the appellant's negligence was causative of the plaintiff's injury. In brief, I am of this view because mesothelioma, at least on the present state of medical knowledge, is not a disease of gradual onset such as is asbestosis. One of the difficulties of determining when and in what circumstances the disease was caused is its long latency period, on one view somewhere between four and seventy-five years. The evidence led in this case does not enable one to say whether the exposure of the plaintiff to the asbestos dust resulting from the asbestos supplied by the appellant was the cause of his disease. In those circumstances there was no evidence inculpating the appellant in the onset of the disease which the plaintiff suffers. 
In the result, therefore, I agree that this appeal should be allowed. I agree with the orders which Beazley JA proposes.
