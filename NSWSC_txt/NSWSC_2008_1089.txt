MONDAY 13 OCTOBER 2008  /08 WRL PTY LIMITED versus VERTICAL TELECOMS PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff makes application under [s
P](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459p.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) for an order that the defendant be wound up in insolvency and an order appointing a liquidator.
 The only evidence of insolvency upon which the plaintiff relies is alleged failure by the defendant to comply with a statutory demand served by the plaintiff. The plaintiff makes no attempt to prove in any other way that the defendant is insolvent.
 The defendant says that the proceedings should be summarily dismissed or, in the alternative, that the plaintiff should be restrained from taking any further step in the proceedings. It has filed an interlocutory process claiming this relief.
 The defendant takes this attitude in a context where there is on foot an undetermined application by it under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) for an order setting aside the relevant statutory demand. The plaintiff's position, as set out in Mr Williams' affidavit of 10 October 2008, is that the defendant's <case> application was not made within the period of 21 days required by [s
G(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) (which the court cannot extend: David Grant & Co Pty Ltd versus Westpac
Banking Corporation  <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 265)] and that there is accordingly no such application pending at all.
 The court file shows, however, that the statutory demand dated 10 June 2008 was served on 11 June 2008 and that the [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application and supporting affidavit were filed on 27 June 2008. In those circumstances, the court simply cannot find that that the 21 day time limit in respect of the making of the [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application was not met in the way that the plaintiff alleges.
 The plaintiff next says that the application under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) was not properly served because it was not served at the address for service stated in the statutory demand. If there was no valid service, the second event that must occur within the 21 day period specified in [s
G(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) will be seen to be lacking.
 It has been established, however, that the [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application and supporting affidavit were, on 27 June 2008, served at an address which, at the time, was recorded in ASIC records as the registered office of the plaintiff company. The ASIC records show that the situation of the registered office changed on 18 July 2008. But service took place on 27
June 2008 at the then registered office and that service must be regarded as good service under [s
X(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109x.html) In light of the matters concerning filing and service of the [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application, the situation is one in which that application was duly made and continues on foot, so that there has been no failure to comply with the statutory demand. That position comes from [s
F(2)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459f.html)
Under that section, there cannot be non-compliance unless and until the application has been "finally disposed of"; and even then the question of non- compliance will depend on how the application is disposed of.
 It is clear, therefore, that no presumption of insolvency has arisen under [s
C(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459c.html) and that the sole basis on which the plaintiff seeks to establish insolvency is simply not made out.
 There is another matter. Even if there had been non-compliance with the statutory demand in the way the plaintiff suggests - that is, that non- compliance was complete at the end of the period of 21 days after service of the statutory demand on 11 June 2008 - the present winding up application could not be based on any presumption of insolvency. This is because a court determining a winding up application is authorised and required to act on such a presumption only where failure to comply with the statutory demand occurred within (or after) the period of three months ending on the day on which the winding up application was made.
 If, as the plaintiff says, non-compliance had been complete 21 days after June 2008, the resultant presumption of insolvency would have been available in support of winding up proceedings initiated within the period of three months immediately following the non-compliance. That is not the position here. The winding up application was filed on 10 October 2008 which is after the end of that period of three months.
 This is a case in which the winding up application is entirely devoid of prospects of success. Summary dismissal is warranted: see Gryst versus Dromana
Estate Ltd  <case> I therefore make order 4 in the interlocutory process filed in court today.
 [APPLICATION FOR COSTS]  Having regard to the e-mail at annexure "T" to Mr Doble's affidavit, an order for the payment of costs on the indemnity basis is warranted. The plaintiff has persisted with a hopeless case despite having been alerted to the fact that it is hopeless.
 I therefore order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings including the interlocutory process; such costs to be assessed on the indemnity basis.
