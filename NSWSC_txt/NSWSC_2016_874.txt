Catchwords: 
PROCEDURE - application to commence proceedings by plaintiff using a pseudonym and for suppression of the plaintiff's identity - plaintiff physically and emotionally abused as a minor by defendants - claims made in respect of abuse  
JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff by Notice of Motion seeks leave to bring proceedings using a pseudonym and asks that the Court make a suppression or non-publication order under [s 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s7.html) of the [Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/) in relation to the identity of the Plaintiff.
The Plaintiff claims against the Defendants for physical and emotional abuse during the time that he lived at the Ashram conducted by the First Defendant.
The First Defendant is sued as having vicarious liability for the deceased person who was in effect the manager of the Ashram. The Second Defendant performed the role of significant female supervisor of children at the Ashram during the years 1976 to 1986 when the Plaintiff was at the Ashram.
Although the Plaintiff does not claim sexual abuse against these Defendants, he gave evidence at the Royal Commission because of its concern with the institutional response of the Ashram to all manner of abuse that was alleged to have taken place at about that time at the Ashram. The Plaintiff nevertheless seeks the use of the pseudonym because of the seriousness of his mental condition and its exacerbation, particularly as a result of the evidence that he gave publicly at the Royal Commission.
The affidavit of the solicitor in support of the Motion indicates that the Plaintiff has subsequently become distressed due to the public knowledge of his experiences related at the Royal Commission. He was shortly after that time admitted to the Gold Coast Mental Health Service as a result.
The report from Professor Lorraine Dennerstein of 30 May 2016 makes reference to his worsening mental health after giving evidence at the Royal Commission. She diagnoses him as having chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, marijuana dependency and bi-polar II disorder.
The application is also put on the basis of protection of the Plaintiff's two sons who are aged 17 and 4 and a half.
In AA versus Satyananda Ashram Pty Ltd [2016] NSWC 236 I made reference to what was said by the Court of Appeal in Witness versus Marsden [200] NSWCA 52 at 14, 17 and 140. It seems to me that if it was appropriate that a mere witness in proceedings be given the protection of anonymity by a pseudonym, it is appropriate in the present case where it is clear that the Plaintiff's mental health is related to the abuse that he received at the Ashram and has been exacerbated by his giving evidence publically about it at the Royal Commission. It is appropriate that the orders sought should be made.
I make these orders:
That the Plaintiff be granted leave to commence and continue these proceedings by a pseudonym KK.
Pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s7.html) of the [Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/), the name and address of the Plaintiff and any member of his family not be published without the leave of the Court by reason of [s (1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s8.html) of the Act.
No order as to costs.
These orders are to be entered forthwith.
