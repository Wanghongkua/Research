HAMMERSCHLAG J  AUGUST 2010  /267410 CHAMELEON MINING NL -V- INTERNATIONAL LITIGATION PARTNERS
PTY LIMITED & ORS 
JUDGMENT 
BACKGROUND  HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff ("CHM") is a mining company whose shares are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The first defendant ("the Funder") is a litigation funder based in Singapore.  In November 2007, CHM commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of
Australia against Murchison Metals Ltd and others, claiming compensation for alleged breaches of statutory and fiduciary duties ("the Proceedings").
 
The Chameleon Litigation Funding Deed On 28 October 2008, CHM and the Funder entered into an arrangement embodied in an instrument described as the Chameleon Litigation Funding Deed ("the
Deed") under which the Funder agreed to provide litigation funding for the
Proceedings.
 Under cl 3 of the Deed, upon Resolution of the Proceedings, the Funder is entitled to:  a Repayment of the Legal Costs paid by it in accordance with cl 2.1; and  b Payment of the Funding Fee (as defined in cl 1).  "Legal Costs" is defined in cl 1 to mean: all costs associated with procuring the legal files from the previous
Solicitor on the record for CHM in the Proceedings and all future agreed legal costs and disbursements incurred by CHM and Funder in relation to or incidental to the Proceedings, or any Appeal, including without limitation solicitors fees and disbursements, counsel's fees and disbursements and expert witness fees, the provision of $250,000 by way of security for costs for security paid prior to this deed, and the provision of any Security for Costs or monies payable for Adverse Cost Orders arising in the Proceedings, or any
Appeal, unless otherwise agreed between CHM and the Funder "Funding Fee" is defined in cl 1 to mean: the higher of: 
Three (3) times the sum of the Costs incurred by the Funder under clause .1 or the Percentage Payment.
 "Percentage Payment" is defined in cl 1 to mean: % of the Resolution Sum should a Resolution agreement occur at any time prior to the earlier of 1 February 2009 or the third security for costs payment in the Proceedings; % of the Resolution Sum should a Resolution agreement occur at any time thereafter (a) but prior to the earlier of 31 May 2009 or 45 days prior to the hearing date of the Proceedings; % of the Resolution Sum should a Resolution agreement occur at any time thereafter (b) but prior to the earlier of 30 November 2009 or 45 days prior to the hearing date of the Proceedings; and % of the Resolution Sum should a Resolution agreement occur at any time after 31 March 2010 "Resolution" is defined in cl 1 to mean: when all or any part of the Resolution Sum is received and where the
Resolution Sum is received in parts, a "Resolution" occurs each time a part is received "Resolution sum" is defined in cl 1 to mean: the gross amount received by CHM or the Lawyers, whether by way of settlement, judgment or otherwise of the Proceedings, including any interest and Legal Costs recovered pursuant to a Costs Order Clause 4 of the Deed provides as follows: 
Early Termination .1 Should there be a Change in Control of CHM, the Funder's obligations pursuant to this Deed terminate effective immediately.
 .2 Should clause 4.1 come into effect the Funder is entitled to immediate payment by CHM of the Early Termination Fee.
 "Early Termination Fee" is defined in cl 1 to mean:  a payment by CHM to the Funder or its nominee of an amount equal to the
Legal Costs (including Security for Costs) expended by the funder up to the date of termination pursuant to clause 4.1 and a further amount equivalent to the higher of the value of 20% of the share capital of CHM at the strike price of its shares by the acquirer of the Charge in Control or the Change in
Control or $9 million "Change in Control" is defined in cl 1 to mean:  any direct or indirect change in Control of a company (whether through merger, sale or shares or other equity interests, or otherwise) through a single transaction or series of related transactions, and whether from one or more transferors to one or more transferees I will later refer to a number of other terms in the Deed. It is accordingly convenient to provide the entire instrument. It appears as
Schedule A.  
The Charge Simultaneously with the Deed, CHM executed a Deed of Fixed and Floating
Charge ("the Charge") under which it charged all of its assets and property (both real and personal), undertaking and rights whatever and wherever situated presently or in the future held by it ("Charged Property") as security for the payment of all money owed under the Deed and performance of all its other obligations to the Funder.
 The Charge contains provisions entitling the Funder, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined), to appoint receivers to the Charged
Property. Under cl 10.2(b)(1) and cl 10.2(b)(2) of the Charge respectively, an
Event of Default occurs if CHM defaults to pay when payable any money owed to the Funder or defaults in the performance or observance of any obligation owed or undertaking given to the Funder.
 Clause 7.1(a)(1) of the Charge provides relevantly as follows: .1 Prohibition on dealing with the Charged Property ... the Mortgagor must not, without the Mortgagee's consent: sell, assign, lease, charge, encumber, surrender, grant any interest in or power over or otherwise in any manner deal or agree or attempt to deal with any Charged Property or any interest in any Charged Property  
Events leading up to the present dispute The Proceedings went to trial during September and October 2009. Judgment was reserved.
 In December 2009, CHM settled its claims against a number of the parties, but not Murchison. It received $6,000,000 pursuant to that settlement and paid the whole of it over to the Funder on account of its obligations under the
Deed.
 Judgment against Murchison remains reserved. It is not known when it will be delivered.
 Late in 2009 tensions developed between CHM and the Funder, primarily, it seems, in connection with monies received in relation to some other, but related, litigation which the Funder had funded.
 Tensions escalated in 2010 when oral settlement discussions took place directly between Murchison's solicitors and the Funder. Apparently Murchison indicated to the Funder that it might be prepared to pay a particular amount in settlement which CHM regarded as inadequate. The parties had different views as to how any settlement proposal from Murchison should be handled.  The Funder sought to invoke the provisions of cl 13.2 of the Deed which provides that a disagreement between the Funder and CHM as to the appropriate terms for settlement is to be referred to a senior counsel for advice, by which advice the parties are to be bound. CHM took the position that it would not agree to be bound by any view until its dispute with the Funder (apparently in relation to the proceeds from the other litigation) was resolved. It also took the position that there had been an earlier oral arrangement that offers below a particular threshold would not be entertained.
The parties' exchanges included some colourful language.
 On 20 July 2010, CHM wrote to Piper Alderman (who throughout were CHM's solicitors on the record in the Proceedings and the Lawyers under the Deed) notifying the immediate withdrawal of authority of the Funder to instruct and direct lawyers with respect to the Proceedings or to negotiate an outcome of them. CHM formally instructed Piper Alderman to desist from taking any instructions from the Funder, taking the view that the appointment of a senior counsel pursuant to cl 13.2 of the Deed was premature until a formal offer had been received and fully considered by the board of CHM. An impasse was reached.
 An exchange of emails followed. By 27 July 2010 the impasse had not been resolved.  On 30 July 2010, the parties received a requisition from the learned presiding Judge in the Proceedings which necessitated the preparation of a document to be provided to his Honour. The Funder complained that it had a right which had been denied to have input into the response to the requisition. Senior counsel who had been briefed in the Proceedings apparently settled the response.
 Very late in July 2010, CHM began negotiating with the fourth defendant ("Cape Lambert") the terms of a strategic alliance intended to provide CHM with both funding and mining expertise. Draft terms sheets were prepared and exchanged.
 During the course of the negotiations with Cape Lambert, CHM's Managing
Director Mr AJ Karam disclosed to it the existence of the Deed. A copy was provided. He also disclosed the amount which had been paid to the Funder under the settlement earlier referred to.
 On 4 August 2010, solicitors for the Funder wrote to CHM asserting, amongst others, that CHM was in breach of the Deed. Relevantly, it was asserted that
CHM had breached the Deed by seeking to terminate the retainer of Piper
Alderman without consultation with the Funder as required by cl 8.3 of the
Deed, by instructing Piper Alderman to act contrary to CHM's obligation to consult with the Funder and keep it informed of the progress of the
Proceedings pursuant to cl 8.1 of the Deed and by refusing to comply with its obligations under cl 13.2 of the Deed to discuss the terms of a settlement offer made and if agreement could not be reached, to progress through the dispute resolution process provided in cl 13.2.  CHM and Cape Lambert signed a Terms Sheet on 10 August 2010. The Terms
Sheet provided that upon its acceptance by CHM, Cape Lambert would be entitled to appoint directors constituting 50 per cent of the board of CHM. It provided for a facility of $6,500,000 to be made available to CHM to be drawn down as one tranche. The Terms Sheet makes it clear that the facility is to be used to discharge the Funder's security and provides for CHM to give Cape Lambert a first-ranking fixed and floating charge over its assets, subject to the discharge of the Charge.
 Immediately after the Terms Sheet was signed, CHM notified the Funder of the transaction and that a Change in Control of CHM within the meaning of cl 1 (and as contemplated by cl 4) of the Deed had occurred. It asserted that as
Cape Lambert had not acquired any shares pursuant to the terms of the transaction, the Early Termination Fee under cl 4.2 of the Deed was $9,000,000. The letter stated: 
On 13 July 2010 CHM formally requested the Funder to account to them and provide details with respect to the Six Million Dollars (AUD$6,000,000) paid (by direction) to CHM by the Funder. We note that such account has not yet been provided by CHM by the Funder. Accordingly, CHM requests that you provide confirmation of all amounts ILP claims are owing under the Funding Agreement and the fixed and floating charge granted by CHM to ILP.
 On 10 August 2010, CHM also wrote to the Funder (referred to as ILP), amongst others, as follows: 
CHM now raises the following matters: The Board of CHM consider that a serious issue arises as to whether ILP is entitled to any payment under the Funding Agreement. This includes ILP's entitlement to the Early Termination Fee (as defined in the Funding
Agreement).
 ILP is in the business of litigation funding. This is plainly suggested in ILP's name and by its conduct.
 Pursuant to [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s911a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (CA), a person who carries on a financial services business in Australia must hold an
Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) covering the provision of the financial services. We advise that a search of the ASIC register has been carried out in the course of Cape Lambert resources Ltd undertaking its due diligence from which it appears that ILP has neither an AFSL nor an exemption from ASIC exempting ILP from this requirement.
 In the circumstances, CHM gives notice of its rescission of the Funding
Agreement pursuant to [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925a.html) of the CA.
 As you may be aware, pursuant to [sections
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925e.html) and [925F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925f.html) of the CA, ILP, as a non-licensee is not entitled to rely on the Funding
Agreement, nor is it entitled to recover by any means (including, for example, set-off or a claim on a quantum meruit) any brokerage, commission or other fee for which CHM would, but for [section
F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925f.html), have been liable to ILP under or in connection with the Funding Agreement.
 Without a right to receive any payment, CHM sees no basis upon which ILP can either assert that CHM is in default of the Funding Agreement or that IPL has any entitlement whatsoever, to appoint a Receiver.
 Please explain the basis upon which IPL considers it is entitled to any fee in circumstances where it is un-licensed.  On 11 August 2010, the Funder appointed the second and third defendants as receivers ("the Receivers") to CHM under the Charge.  
THESE PROCEEDINGS  On 11 August 2010, CHM approached the Court on an urgent basis for interim relief. The next day, after a contest, the Court (Einstein J) granted an injunction restraining until further order the Receivers from acting.
 Given the clear commercial urgency of this dispute, not least of all because trading in CHM shares was suspended as a result of the Receivers' appointment, on 16 August 2010 I set the matter down for final hearing to commence at 2.00pm on 17 August 2010. The final hearing concluded during the afternoon of 19 August 2010.  Mr R M Smith SC together with Mr M A Jones of counsel appeared for CHM. Mr
I M Jackman SC together with Ms R C A Higgins of counsel appeared for the
Funder and the Receivers. Cape Lambert was represented by Mr C R C Newlinds SC and Mr J C Giles of counsel.
 The only affidavit evidence read was that of Mr Karam. He was cross- examined by counsel for the Funder and the Receivers.  By its second amended summons, CHM seeks declarations that: a the appointment of the Receivers was invalid and an order restraining them from acting;  b the Deed was validly rescinded pursuant to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth);  c the Funder has no entitlement to payment of the Funding Fee;  d upon payment to the Funder of an amount equal to the total monies paid by the Funder to CHM's benefit under the Deed, the plaintiff is entitled to immediate discharge of the Charge; and  e on the proper construction of the Terms Sheet, the security contemplated by it (a first ranking fixed and floating charge) is to be granted only on the discharge of the Charge and that draw down under it is conditional upon the provision to Cape Lambert of that security. In the alternative, it seeks rectification of the Terms Sheet so as to have this effect.
 The summons further seeks an order for an accounting to determine the total monies paid by the Funder to its benefit and an order that the Funder redeem the Charge upon payment of that amount. In the alternative it seeks an order that the Funder's entitlement under the Deed is limited to the Early
Termination Fee and that the Funder redeem the Charge upon tender by CHM of the Early Termination Fee.  By cross summons, Cape Lambert seeks declarations that the Funder's entitlements under the Deed are limited to the Early Termination Fee and that on payment of that amount the Funder must discharge the Charge.
 
THE ISSUES 
Rescission [Section
A(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s924a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the Act") provides: 
Agreements with certain unlicensed persons 
Subdivision B applies to an agreement entered into by a person (in this section and Subdivision B called the non-licensee) and another person (in this section and Subdivision B called the client) (not being a financial services licensee) that constitutes, or relates to, the provision of a financial service by the non-licensee if: the agreement is entered into in the course of a financial services business carried on by the non-licensee; and the non-licensee does not hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial service, and is not exempt from the requirement to hold such a licence.
 [Section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925a.html) (which is in subdivision B) provides: 
Client may give notice of rescission 
Subject to this section, the client may, whether before or after completion of the agreement, give to the non-licensee a written notice stating that the client wishes to rescind the agreement.
 [Section
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925e.html) provides: 
Agreement unenforceable against client 
This section: applies while both of the following are the case: the client is entitled to give a notice under [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925a.html); a notice so given will result under [section
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925b.html) in rescission of the agreement; and applies after the agreement is rescinded under [section
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925b.html); but does not otherwise apply.

The non-licensee is not entitled, as against the client: to enforce the agreement, whether directly or indirectly; or to rely on the agreement, whether directly or indirectly and whether by way of defence or otherwise.  CHM (supported by Cape Lambert) challenges the validity of the appointment of the Receivers on the ground that CHM was, by virtue of these provisions, on August 2010 entitled to rescind the Deed and that the Funder was and is not entitled to enforce it directly or indirectly.
 
Events of Default Initially, CHM contended that the Funder was not entitled to appoint the
Receivers because no Event of Default under the Charge had occurred (or for that matter has yet occurred).
 However, in its submissions in reply CHM conceded (as it had to) that an
Event of Default under the Charge had occurred when CHM had during the negotiation of the Terms Sheet, in breach of its obligation under cl 11.1 of the Deed to keep confidential the existence and terms of the Deed and not disclose it to any person other than its legal and financial advisers, or as required by law, disclosed the existence and terms of the Deed to Cape
Lambert.
 In reply CHM submitted for the first time (although to my observation somewhat faintly) that reliance by the Funder on this Event of Default as entitling the appointment of the Receivers was not in good faith because the remedy was out of proportion to the default. It put that the appointment was accordingly nevertheless bad.
 Counsel for the Funder and the Receivers correctly pointed out that had this contention been foreshadowed earlier, evidence could and would have been led to neutralise it. CHM did not put anything to the contrary and no party suggested that there should be an adjournment to enable the Funder to meet the contention. In the circumstances I do not consider that it is open to CHM to rely on it. Even if it was, a finding that reliance on this breach (which to my mind is not a trivial one) lacks good faith on the part of the Funder, is not fairly open on the evidence. It follows that the Funder has established an
Event of Default.
 Although in the circumstances it is not necessary to deal with other Events of Default alleged by the Funder, in my view it established a number of others.
 Firstly, cl 4.2 of the Deed entitles the Funder to immediate payment of the
Early Termination Fee. That fee in the present case is an amount equal to the
Legal Costs and a further amount of $9,000,000. To this point, the Funder has not given an account to CHM for the Legal Costs. The Funder has been paid $6,000,000 which the parties agree is to be deducted from the amount CHM must pay in respect of the Early Termination Fee. The Early Termination Fee will thus not be less than $3,000,000. The Early Termination Fee became payable immediately upon the Change in Control.
 CHM puts that: a under cl 17.4 (an express good faith obligation) and at general law the
Funder has an obligation to provide to CHM an account which quantifies the costs component of the Early Termination Fee;  b cl 4.1 read with the definition of Early Termination Fee contemplates only one payment;  c the Funder has not provided CHM with the account;  d it follows that the Funder has no entitlement under cl 4.1 to the immediate payment of the Early Termination Fee.
 I do not accept this submission. I do not think that the obligation to pay even the costs component of the Early Termination Fee depends on the Funder providing any account. The Funder's obligation in cl 2.1 to pay the Legal
Costs is dependant on written notification (presumably from the Lawyers on behalf of CHM or CHM itself). That information is available in both cases to
CHM without the Funder having to provide it. Even if the obligation depended on the provision of such an account, the definition of Early Termination Fee contemplates the payment of two amounts, one for the Legal Costs and the other being the higher of 20 per cent of strike price of the shares changing hands or $9,000,000 and in any event, cl 15.3 provides that words denoting the singular number are to include the plural and vice versa so that the payment referred to in the definition is to read as comprehending more than one. On the assumption that having not yet informed CHM of the amount of the Legal
Costs, the Funder could not assert that a failure to pay the Legal Costs amount constitutes a breach of the Deed or an Event of Default under the
Charge, it is not disputed that at least $3,000,000 must be paid in any event.
In my view, the Funder was entitled to immediate payment of that amount and
CHM's failure to pay it was and remains an Event of Default. It is not presently necessary to deal with what the consequences would be of a failure on the part of the Funder to provide CHM with a discharge figure upon CHM seeking to redeem. It is to be observed that to this point CHM has taken the incorrect position that the Deed has been rescinded.
 Next, there was a clear disagreement between CHM and the Funder as to the appropriate terms for settlement of the Proceedings. In those circumstances
CHM had an obligation under cl 13.2 of the Deed to agree to a panel of senior counsel from whom one would be briefed by the Lawyers. It refused to proceed in accordance with cl 13.2. This too was an Event of Default. I also consider that CHM's failure to consult with and consider the views of the Funder with respect to answering the learned Judge's requisition was a breach (perhaps rather trivial) of its obligation under cl 8.1 of the Deed. I further consider that its withdrawal of Piper Alderman's authority was a breach of cl 8.3 of the Deed.
 Finally, entry into the Terms Sheet was in my view an Event of Default because under it CHM agreed, contrary to cl 7.1 of the Charge, to deal with
Charged Property or an interest in it by agreeing to grant a charge over the same property to Cape Lambert without the Funder's consent. CHM put that it did not under the Terms Sheet agree to charge Charged Property because the
Terms Sheet makes it clear that a charge would only be granted to Cape Lambert on discharge of the Charge so that at that point the property over which Cape
Lambert's charge would extend would not be Charged Property under the Charge.
This submission is unsustainable. The property comprehended in the definition of Charged Property in the Charge is or includes the property over which the
Cape Lambert charge would be given. The Terms Sheet had immediate contractual effect. That this is so is clear from the fact that it brought about the
Change in Control. Even if CHM's obligation to give Cape Lambert a charge was conditional upon the earlier discharge of the Charge, the Terms Sheet constituted an agreement to do that upon fulfilment of the condition. This was a breach of cl 7.1 of the Charge, and accordingly an Event of Default.  The validity of the appointment of the Receivers thus turns on whether CHM validly rescinded the Deed under [s
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925a.html) of the Act.
 If CHM validly rescinded, the Funder is (because of [s
E)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s925e.html) not entitled to enforce the Deed so as to recover the Early Termination Fee.
CHM accepts that it would nevertheless be liable to repay the balance (if any) remaining of the Legal Costs which the Funder has paid to its benefit, after taking the $6,000,000 already paid into account. CHM apparently accepts that it would have to pay any shortfall to obtain redemption of the Charge, even if the rescission was effective.
 
Operation of the Deed It is not in issue that there has been a Change in Control of CHM within the meaning of that term in the Deed.
 CHM and Cape Lambert contend that if the Deed is enforceable, the Funder's entitlement is limited to the right to receive the Early Termination Fee and that the Funder must redeem the Charge on tender of it. The Funder contends that it is entitled to receive both the Early Termination Fee and, upon
Resolution of the Proceedings, the Funding Fee as well.
 This turns on the proper construction of the Deed in the events that have occurred.
 If the Funder is entitled to no more than the Early Termination Fee, CHM intends to seek to tender the amount to obtain redemption of the Charge, but not otherwise.
 
Construction and rectification of the Terms Sheet There did not seem to be any issue that both CHM's right to draw down and its obligation to provide security under the Terms Sheet are conditional upon discharge of the Charge. The parties did not address the claim for rectification.
 
WAS CHM ENTITLED TO RESCIND THE DEED? It is not in dispute that the Funder does not hold and has never held an

Meaning of derivative 
For the purposes of this Chapter, subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), a derivative is an arrangement in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied: under the arrangement, a party to the arrangement must, or may be required to, provide at some future time consideration of a particular kind or kinds to someone; and that future time is not less than the number of days, prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph, after the day on which the arrangement is entered into; and the amount of the consideration, or the value of the arrangement, is ultimately determined, derived from or varies by reference to (wholly or in part) the value or amount of something else (of any nature whatsoever and whether or not deliverable), including, for example, one or more of the following: an asset; a rate (including an interest rate or exchange rate); an index; a commodity.

Specific things that are not financial products 
Despite anything in Subdivision B or Subdivision C, the following are not financial products for the purposes of this Chapter: any of the following: a credit facility within the meaning of the regulations (other than a margin lending facility) [Regulation .1.06(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/cr2001281/s7.1.06.html) of the [Corporations Regulations ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/cr2001281/) (Cth) provides: 
Specific things that are not financial products: credit facility 
For subparagraph 765A (1) (h) (i) of the Act, each of the following is a credit facility: the provision of credit: for any period; and with or without prior agreement between the credit provider and the debtor; and whether or not both credit and debit facilities are available; and that is not a financial product mentioned in paragraph 763A (1) (a) of the Act; and that is not a financial product mentioned in paragraph 764A (1) (a), (b), , (f), (g), (h) or (j) of the Act; and that is not a financial product mentioned in paragraph 764A (1) (i) of the Act, other than a product the whole or predominant purpose of which is, or is intended to be, the provision of credit; Regulations 7.1.06(3)(a) and (b)(ix) and (x) provide: 
In this regulation: credit means a contract, arrangement or understanding: under which: payment of a debt owed by one person (a debtor) to another person (a credit provider) is deferred; or one person (a debtor) incurs a deferred debt to another person (a credit provider); and including any of the following: a financial benefit arising from or as a result of a loan; assistance in obtaining a financial benefit arising from or as a result of a loan;  
The parties' contentions CHM puts that the Deed is an agreement entered into by the Funder (as the non-licensee) with it (as the client) that constitutes or relates to the provision of a financial service entered into in the course of a financial services business carried on by the Funder within the meaning of <case>(a) on the basis that the Funder thereby dealt in a financial product as contemplated by <case>(b).
 It puts that the Deed is a financial product because it is a facility through which it made a financial investment or manages financial risk within the meaning of <case>(a) and <case>(b) of the Act and is within the specific things that are financial products described in <case>, namely a derivative within par (c) of that section.
 It puts that by the Deed, CHM "manages financial risk" as contemplated by s
C(a), by shielding itself against the possibility of incurring legal costs but failing to recover sufficiently or at all against Murchison.
 In addition to taking issue with these propositions, the Funder puts that the Deed is not a derivative because it is a contract for the future provision of services within the meaning of <case>(b) and that it is not a financial product because it is a credit facility within the meaning of <case>(h)(i) and Regulation 7.1.06.
 A faint and perfunctory submission was put by the Funder that CHM had not shown that the Deed was entered into in the course of a financial services business carried on by the Funder, that is, that this type of transaction was not in the course of a business being carried on by it. The submission was not developed and may be briefly disposed of. In his affidavit evidence Mr Karam deposed to dealings with Mr Lindholm (of the Funder) leading up to the making of the Deed which leaves no room for any doubt that the Funder was in the business of providing litigation funding and that Mr Lindholm engaged in conduct intended to induce CHM to use the services which the Funder provided.
There is also evidence of the Funder having funded other proceedings by CHM in this Court. I am satisfied that it was in the business of doing the type of transaction presently under consideration.
 
Consideration In my opinion, the Deed is not a derivative. Section 761D(1)(c) requires the amount of the consideration or the value of the arrangement ultimately to be determined, derived from or vary by reference to (wholly or in part) the value of something else. The word "ultimately" in the subsection plainly qualifies the words "determined, derived from or varies by reference to" (there being no comma before the words which follow the words in parentheses).
 This is no doubt because it is in the nature of a derivative that the value of the arrangement will (as the word "ultimately" connotes) in every case be affected by (and hence derived from) the value of something else. The Deed does not have this invariable operation, as the facts in the present case demonstrate. The amount of the Early Termination Fee on the particular Change in Control here is not determined or derived from, nor does it vary by reference to the value of, something else.
 There is, to my mind, a further and fundamental problem with CHM's submission. CHM is the client referred to in <case>, and in that capacity purported to rescind an arrangement whereby it was issued with a financial product. By <case>, the financial product concerned is a facility through which CHM says it made a financial investment. Section 763B provides for when a person makes a financial investment which in all cases involves an investor giving money or money's worth to another person and envisages that contribution being used or intended to be used in a particular way. That is not this case. Here, it seems to me, if anyone is making a financial investment, it is the Funder, not CHM. The Funder pays Legal Costs and may receive a possible enhanced return.
 I do not consider that the Deed can properly be described as a contract for the future provision of services as contemplated by <case>(b) of the Act.
The Recitals record that the Funder has agreed to provide investigative and management expertise but the Deed does not seem to contain any covenant obliging the Funder to do so. This aspect of the Deed is at best an adjunct to the main object of the arrangement, which is the payment of money.
 I also do not consider that the Deed is a financial product by which CHM manages financial risk as contemplated by <case>(a) of the Act.
 Whilst in one sense the Deed has the effect of minimising one category of financial risk for CHM (namely, the risk that it will incur expense in pursuit of Murchison which will be wasted if no or an insufficient Resolution Sum is received), on no realistic view can it be said that the Deed is a financial product whereby CHM manages that risk.
 Rather, the object of the Deed is to enable CHM to prosecute the
Proceedings by having the Funder pay Legal Costs and perhaps (as the Recitals describe) provide investigative and management expertise to assist in the
Proceedings. The object of the Deed is to facilitate CHM vindicating its claim against Murchison, not to manage the risk of possible failure in that endeavour.
 What is more, under cl 4 of the Deed, as part of the quid pro quo for the funding, CHM undertakes a risk of a significant payment which is unrelated to the ultimate fate of the Proceedings. As well, under cl 10.1 the Funder may in its sole discretion (and without reference to the outcome of the Proceedings) terminate the Deed. These are not the characteristics of a financial risk management instrument.
 I do not accept the Funder's submission that the Deed is a credit facility within <case>(h)(i) and Regulation 7.1.06 (which is set out above) and therefore not a financial product because:  a the Deed does not operate so as to defer payment of any debt owed by CHM to the Funder or result in CHM incurring a deferred debt to the Funder;  b CHM does not incur a debt to the Funder as a result of the Funder paying the
Legal Costs and it does not incur any personal obligation to repay the amount funded; and  c the payment by the Funder of the Legal Costs is not an advance and the Deed does not contain provisions under which CHM incurs a personal obligation to repay.  
Conclusions The Deed is not an agreement to which <case> applies, and CHM had no entitlement to give a notice of rescission. Its attempt to rescind was of no effect.
 It follows that: a the Funder is entitled to enforce the Deed according to its tenor;  b the Charge is effective to secure performance of CHM's obligations under the
Deed;  c the Receivers were validly appointed; and  d the injunction granted by Einstein J restraining them must be discharged.  
OPERATION OF THE DEED  The Funder puts that a Change in Control entitled it to immediate payment of the Early Termination Fee without affecting its entitlement under cl 3.1 of the Deed. CHM puts that the Funder's only entitlement is to the Early
Termination Fee.
 To determine the effect of the Deed in the events that have occurred, the
Court must have regard to the language used, the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, the purpose of the transaction and the objects which it was intended to secure: Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd versus Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2004) 219
CLR 165 at 179; International Air Transport Association versus Ansett Australia
Holdings Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) and others <case>; <case>. A commercial contract should be given a business-like interpretation. The nature and extent of the commercial aims and purposes of the agreement or parts of it are part of the essential background circumstances: McCann versus Switzerland
Insurance Australia Ltd <case>; [(2000) 203 CLR 579] at 589; Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd versus State Rail Authority <case>; <case> at <case> and following. The whole of the instrument has to be considered. Preference is given to a construction supplying a congruent operation to the various components of the whole of an instrument: Wilkie versus Gordian Runoff Ltd <case>; [(2005) 221 CLR 522] at 529.
 Recently, in Chartbrook Ltd versus Persimmon Homes Ltd <case>; [[2009] 1
AC 1101](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2009%5d%201%20AC%201101 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 1112 <case> Lord
Hoffmann said:  
There is no dispute that the principles on which a contract (or any other instrument or utterance) should be interpreted are those summarised by the
House of Lords in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd versus West Bromwich Building
Society <case>; [[1998] 1 WLR 896], 912-913.
They are well known and need not be repeated. It is agreed that the question is what a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties would have understood them to be using the language in the contract to mean. The House emphasised that "we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents" (similar statements will be found in Bank of Credit and Commerce
International SA versus Ali <case>; [[2002] 1 AC ] , ; Kirin-Amgen Inc versus Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd <case>; [[2005] 1
All ER 667] , 681-682 and Jumbo King Ltd versus Faithful Properties Ltd <case>; [(1999) 2 HKCFAR 279] , 296) but said that in some cases the context and background drove a court to the conclusion that "something must have gone wrong with the language". In such a case, the law did not require a court to attribute to the parties an intention which a reasonable person would not have understood them to have had.
 It should be pointed out that the Deed contains a number of obvious errors.
The reference in cl 3.6 to cl 8.1 should be a reference to cl 10.1. The references in cl 6.3 to cl 4.1 and cl 4.2 should be references to cl 6.1 and cl 6.2. The definition of Early Termination Fee includes the superfluous and meaningless words "the Charge in Control".
 The Deed does not expressly state, as one might have expected it to do, whether upon a Change in Control resulting in the Funder's entitlement to the
Early Termination Fee, the Funding Fee will or will not be payable if there is a later Resolution.
 The Funder puts that nothing in the plain meaning of the words of cl 3.1 and cl 4.1 indicates that if one applies the other does not. It puts that each provides for an entitlement which depends on the occurrence of a different event and each has a different underlying object. Clause 3.1 is to reward the
Funder for the risk it undertakes, cl 4.1 is intended to discourage a Change in Control of CHM.
 In further support of its construction it puts that:  a cl 4.1 refers to the Funder's obligations (rather than the Deed itself) terminating effective immediately which indicates that the Funder continues to have all other rights and entitlements under the Deed after a Change in
Control;  b cl 3.2 is an irrevocable direction for payment of any Resolution Sum to be made to the Lawyers and cl 3.3 irrevocably authorises them to hold that part of the Resolution Sum due to the Funder under the Deed on trust for it and the balance on trust for CHM. The statements of irrevocability indicate that cl .1 will continue to operate;  c cl 3.4 and cl 3.5 provide protection for the Funder if any part of the
Resolution Sum is received, not by the Lawyers, but by CHM, which obligations survive any termination of the Deed save for a termination pursuant to cl 8.1 (meaning cl 10.1). These provisions indicate that other provisions of the Deed continue to operate, except where the termination is pursuant to cl 8.1 (meaning cl 10.1).
 For the following reasons I consider that the words of cl 4.1 and cl 4.2 read in the context and operation of the Deed as a whole, mean that upon a
Change in Control, the Funder's only entitlement (or right) is to receive the
Early Termination Fee.
 In my view, in saying that the Funder is entitled to immediate payment of the Early Termination Fee, cl 4.2 of the Deed means it is entitled only to that fee. Put another way, the words of cl 4.2 mean that the Funder's entitlement (that is, its entire entitlement), is to payment of the Early
Termination Fee.
 Under cl 4.1, upon a Change in Control the Funder's obligations pursuant to the Deed terminate, effective immediately. This has the effect that all of its obligations terminate. The Funder accepted as much. The Funder's contention that this leaves unaffected all of its rights under the Deed brings with it the consequence that where it has rights which have corresponding obligations it would retain the rights but not have any corresponding obligations. Thus, for example, the Funder would have the right under cl 6.1 to require an appeal to be lodged, but shorn of the corresponding obligation in that clause to pay the Legal Costs and disbursements in connection with the appeal; it would have the right to require CHM to adhere to its obligation of confidentiality under cl 11 but would be relieved of its own corresponding obligation under that clause; and it would have the right to require CHM to act in good faith under cl 17.4 but be relieved of its own obligation to do so under that clause. This is hardly a commercial or sensible operation.  With respect to cl 6.1, counsel for the Funder put that it would still work without the Funder being obliged to pay the Legal Costs of an appeal which it (and only it) wished to be brought because CHM could legitimately not (and in practice would not) bring the appeal if the Funder refused to pay the Legal
Costs. This is an untenable submission because under cl 6.1 CHM would have the binding contractual obligation to bring the appeal.
 With respect to cl 11.1, counsel put that the Funder's covenant of confidentiality would be discharged, but the Funder would be under an equitable obligation of confidentiality. This too is an untenable submission given the express termination under cl 4.1 of the Funder's obligations. There was no debate about cl 17.4.
 This demonstrates that the Funder's construction does not result in the congruent operation of the Deed as a whole.
 CHM put that the effect of cl 4.1 was really to terminate the Deed and therefore the Funder's entitlement under cl 3.1 on the basis that the word "obligations" in the clause should be read as meaning "rights and obligations". However, this does not accord with the plain meaning of the words used. Upon a Change in Control all of the Funder's rights are not terminated. Indeed, in that event it obtains one new right (which does not involve any corresponding obligation), namely the right to immediate payment by CHM of the Early Termination Fee.  The Funder's construction results in further anomalies.
 Firstly, under cl 2.1 the Funder agrees to pay the Legal Costs. Legal
Costs is defined to mean all future agreed legal costs and disbursements incurred in relation to and incidental to the Proceedings or any Appeal. Under cl 3.1 the Funder is entitled to repayment of the Legal Costs paid by it in accordance with cl 2.1. Read with the definition of Legal Costs, this contemplates that the Funder will pay legal costs incidental to the
Proceedings or any Appeal. The Recitals make it clear that CHM has requested and the Funder has agreed to provide funding to assist in prosecuting the proceedings (presumably to finality unless earlier resolved or withdrawn). The
Funder's contention is that the Deed operates to the effect that the Funder ceases to have any obligation to pay Legal Costs upon a Change in Control but nevertheless retains an entitlement to share in the Resolution Sum. More than simply ceasing to be obliged to further fund, the Funder becomes immediately entitled to payment of a significant sum of money by CHM. It seems to me that this is inimical to the principal object of the transaction, namely that the
Funder will fund the Proceedings and be rewarded by sharing in a successful outcome.
 In my view, the express termination of all the Funder's obligations under the Deed brings with it the necessary implication that all its entitlements other than that expressly provided for in cl 4.2 are terminated as well.
Correspondingly, the Funder's entitlement under cl 3.1 to payment of the
Funding Fee depends on receipt of a Resolution Sum which presupposes prosecution of the Proceedings to a judgment or settlement, the Legal Costs of which will be funded by it. It has no such entitlement without the corresponding obligation to do that which facilitates receipt of the
Resolution Sum out of which that entitlement will come.
 Secondly, one of the components of the Early Termination Fee is an amount equal to the Legal Costs expended by the Funder up to the date of termination pursuant to cl 4.1. Clause 3.1 entitles the Funder to repayment of the Legal
Costs as well as payment of the Funding Fee. If both cl 4.1 and cl 3.1 operate the Funder, anomalously, recoups in effect its Legal Costs twice.
 I do not consider that any reasonable person in the position of the parties to the Deed would have taken the language of the Deed to mean that cl .1 and cl 4.1 were concurrent rather than mutually exclusive entitlements.
 In my view the Early Termination Fee can only sensibly and commercially be explained as a payment representing the parties' assessment of the entire value of the arrangement to the Funder upon a Change in Control and accordingly a payment in substitution for its other entitlements under the
Deed.
 It may be accepted that one of the underlying purposes of cl 4 is to discourage a Change in Control of CHM. The disincentive or "poison pill" (as it is sometimes described) is the significant payment to be made if a Change in Control occurs.
 The payment undoubtedly also recognises that a Change in Control may not serve the Funder's interests, if, for example, new controllers take a pessimistic view of CHM's prospects in the Proceedings and give up.
 However, on its construction the Deed remains operative despite the Early
Termination Fee having to be paid immediately, and where new controllers (as may well be the case now) have the same view that the old ones did and act no differently with respect to the Proceedings.
 The size and particularly the immediacy of the Early Termination Fee indicate an entitlement in substitution for, and to the exclusion of, that in cl 3.1.
 It seems to me that cl 3 and cl 4 deal respectively with two (of the four) separate and mutually exclusive ways in which the funding arrangement is effectively brought to an end. The other two are cl 10.1 which entitles the
Funder to terminate its obligations under the Deed and cl 10.5 which entitles
CHM to terminate the Deed for the Funder's breach.
 In each of the following four scenarios the Funder receives a payment, and each has logical and commercially rational consequences: a receipt of a Resolution Sum before any termination of the Funder's obligations - the Funder receives repayment of the Legal Costs and the Funding
Fee (cl 3.1);  b Early Termination - the Funder receives the Early Termination Fee, which includes an amount equivalent to the Legal Costs and a further amount based on the share capital of CHM if there is a strike price or $9,000,000 - whichever is the higher (cl 4);  c Termination by the Funder of its obligations under the Deed - the Funder receives payment of the Legal Costs out of any Resolution Sum later received (cl 10.1 - cl 10.4); and  d Termination of the Deed by CHM for the Funder's breach - the Funder remains liable to meet its accrued obligations (being to pay any outstanding Legal
Costs incurred up to the date the notice of termination becomes effective) and is entitled to repayment of Legal Costs incurred up to the date of the
Termination of the Deed out of any Resolution Sum later received (cl 10.5).
 The respective provisions which give rise to these entitlements each operates separately and to the exclusion of the others. So viewed all the provisions of the Deed (including cl 4.1 and cl 4.2 as between themselves) operate congruently, commercially and rationally.
 Notably, only under cl 4 does the Funder receive anything other than out of a Resolution Sum, an additional indication that after it receives the Early
Termination Fee, the Deed has no further work to do. Another characteristic which sets cl 4 apart is that a Change in Control can occur without the participation or concurrence of any party and, indeed, in circumstances where
CHM opposes it. All other forms of termination are within the control of one of the parties to the Deed.
 The irrevocable directions and authorisations in cl 3.2 and cl 3.3 are in aid, and in aid only, of the Funder's entitlement under cl 3.1. They have no operation if cl 3.1 has none. On the construction I have found, the Funder has no entitlement under cl 3.1. The irrevocable authorisations and directions accordingly have no field of application.
 It follows that the Funder has no entitlement under cl 3.1 and CHM is entitled to redemption of the Charge upon payment of the amount owing as at the date of tender to which the Funder is entitled on the basis that it was, upon the Change in Control, entitled to immediate payment only of the Early
Termination Fee.
 
CONCLUSION CHM's challenge to the appointment of the receivers has failed. The injunction ordered by Einstein J on 11 August 2010 is dissolved.
 CHM and Cape Lambert have succeeded in relation to the construction and the operation of the Deed for which they have contended and appropriate declarations will be made.
 The parties are to bring in short minutes reflecting this outcome, I will hear them with respect to the future conduct of these Proceedings and on costs.
 The exhibits are to be returned.
