Judgment for the plaintiff
JUDGE1
DAVID HUNT CJ at CL The respondent to this Summons (Mr Bruce Galea) attended before the
Hon Justice J R T Wood, sitting as Commissioner in the current
Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service, in order to give evidence on 14
July last.
The terms of the Commissioner's inquiry include the nature and extent of corruption within the Police Service, particularly of any entrenched or systemic kind. Evidence had already been given to the Commissioner by a Det
Sgt John Swan that he had, when a member of the Consorting Squad, received a number of payments from the respondent. ((1) No further detail of the police officer's evidence was placed before me.) The respondent was sworn as a witness in a closed hearing. He refused to answer questions as to whether he conducted gambling establishments and whether he had paid money to named officers or to named former officers of the Police Service.
[Section 18A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18a.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act 1923](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/) ((2) I shall refer to this statute as "the Act".) provides that a person is in contempt of a Royal
Commission if he does or omits to do anything which would, if the Commission were the Supreme Court, be in contempt of this Court. A refusal by a witness in this
Court to answer relevant questions, or a refusal to do so without good reason, amounts to such a contempt. ((3) Smith versus The Queen [(1991) 25 NSWLR 1] at 9.) A witness before a Royal Commission is not, however, entitled to refuse to answer any question on the ground that his answer may incriminate or tend to incriminate him, although his answer thereafter is not admissible against him hi any civil or criminal proceedings. ((4) See [s 17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of the Act, which has been made applicable to this Royal Commission by the letters patent appointing
Justice Wood as the Commissioner.)
The Commissioner, pursuant to [s 18C(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18c.html) of the Act, issued a warrant to arrest the respondent and to bring him before this Court. The respondent has been in custody since then. The Commissioner, in accordance with [s 18B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) of the Act, presented this Court with a certificate setting out the details which he considered constituted contempt of the Royal
Commission. That certificate is prima facie evidence of the matters certified. ((5) [Section 18B(4)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) The
Summons, which contains a statement of the charges of contempt, seeks declarations that the respondent is guilty of contempt, an order that he be committed to imprisonment for such contempt and an order for costs.
The respondent appeared before me on the same day. He was represented then (and has been represented since) by Mr G R James QC, who sought an adjournment in order to investigate whether medical evidence was available to raise an issue as to whether the respondent's refusal to answer questions was unjustifiable or without good reason. There was a discussion as to whether the respondent should be granted a form of conditional liberty in order that a proper examination and testing be undertaken for that purpose, but in the end the respondent elected to withdraw his application for such release.
When the hearing resumed on 20 July last, Mr James announced that his client had instructed him to admit that his refusal to answer the questions nominated in the Summons was without reasonable excuse, and thus to admit the contempt alleged against him. It was agreed ((6) It had also been agreed on the previous occasion.) that the charges specified in the Summons should be consolidated into the one charge relating to all the questions so nominated.
((7) They had been separately charged so that the respondent would not be disadvantaged procedurally should he have a separate 'defence' relating to different questions; cf Stanton versus Abernethy [(1990) 19 NSWLR 656] at 343-344, 347-349.) The respondent was then formally charged and he pleaded guilty.
The respondent has two convictions on his record, both for offences of conducting a gaming house, one having been committed in February 1992 and the other two months later.
I do not regard those convictions as having any particular relevance to what should be done here.
Mr James stated that he did not intend to lead any evidence in mitigation (in particular, any fresh medical evidence ((8) There was a deal of medical evidence placed before the Commissioner, which was in evidence before me. A certificate was also tendered before me asserting that an assessment of the respondent's health problems could not be performed inside the gaol, an assertion which was subsequently accepted as being inaccurate.)) He did, however, provide information concerning the respondent's background from the bar table. The respondent is fiftyeight years of age. He was educated to
Leaving Certificate standard, having been a school prefect at Waverley College and captain of both the First XI and First XV in his final year. He played first grade Rugby Union at District level and he represented the State; he was also a member of an Australian Colts team. He is a professional gambler, and for two substantial periods he was a licensed bookmaker.
The respondent suffers from coronary artery disease, with documented episodes of atrial fibrillation, and he is under medication for that condition. The most recent report following an examination available (dated 17
March 1995) describes this medication as having been extremely effective and advises the reduction of that medication, and the respondent was described as having been "very well" and not in need for any further review for six to twelve months. I am not prepared, in the absence of further medical evidence, to accept any suggestion that the respondent's medical condition had any effect upon him which justified his refusal to answer the questions in issue.
There was considerable debate before me as to the seriousness of the respondent's contempt. It was submitted on his behalf that he could not be said to have been opposing the Commission; rather, it was submitted, he had: " ... sought conscientiously, for whatever reason, to detach himself from that process while publicly applauding it." 
It was not, the submission went, a contumacious and defiant contempt. No evidence was given by the respondent before me; those submissions were based solely upon the transcript of the proceedings before the Commissioner.
My interpretation of the respondent's attitude before the
Commissioner does not support the submissions made on his behalf. He made his attitude clear from the beginning: ((9) Reference was made to all of the Wowing matters before me in open court; there is no intention to disclose the precise nature of inquiries being followed by the Commissioner in camera.) "Before we go any further, I'm not going to say anything further at all. I'm not going to answer any questions at all. I'm not well and I want to be out as quick as possible." 
He was then asked his occupation, to which he answered: "I don't want to answer any questions in the court today. I'm not too well. I want the proceedings to finish. Whatever you have to do, I understand that, but whatever I have to do, I have to do. I don't want to answer questions."
During the course of a discussion concerning his health with the solicitor then appearing for him, the respondent said: "May I say something, please. Whatever the young lady asks me today, I won't be answering anyway. I'm not running away from anything. I have respect for you; I have respect for this hearing and the government that put the hearing in place and that, and there's no disrespect for you or this Commission, but
I won't be answering any questions today, because I'm not in the mood to answer questions perhaps when I come back in twenty years' time; ((10) The transcript was interpreted before me as if this semi-colon had been inserted in error. Such an interpretation appears to me from the context to be correct.)
I won't be answering questions, but this is how - I know you have to do what you have to do, but I have to do what I have to do. We are only wasting time. Let's get out of here." 
When the respondent was then asked whether he had operated gaming establishments, his solicitor objected and referred (in the course of his submissions) to the prospect that his client "most probably will pay the price of refusing to answer". The respondent said: "My attitude from now, every question that is asked I'm not going to answer."
He next refused to answer a series of questions relevant to the
Commissioner's inquiry. Counsel then asked the respondent some questions relating to his health. The first produced this response: "I don't want to answer any questions. I'm not in the mood to answer any questions. If the gentleman wants to take it from there, he takes it on from there."
Notwithstanding that statement, the respondent did answer some questions, although he did so by asserting that he had no memory. He also said: "I'm not being smart, no contempt to this court, but it's just not a go today, thanks."
He agreed that he did frequent a particular club and that cards were played there, but he continued: "I don't want to answer any questions. You are too smart for me, lady. You might say something and I might say it's right and it may be wrong. I just don't want to answer questions.

Q. Would you agree, Mr Galea, that ... A. I would agree with whatever this gentleman brings down in his verdict or whatever he wants to do. That's what I will agree with. "
A substantial number of questions were then in fact answered about some recent events of an apparently non-controversial nature, until the respondent was asked whether he knew Det Sgt Swan. He said: "No, not really. I don't want to answer any of those questions.
I thought you were aiming at the health business and I was trying to answer that to the best of my abilities about the health business. Now you diverge; you are getting back to the same old thing. I'm not going to answer any questions. Mr Wood, please, sir, can we finish this up?"
Submissions were then made in relation to contempt, and the Commissioner concluded that the respondent should be required to show cause in accordance with [SS 18B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) and [18C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18c.html) of the Act as to why he should not be dealt with for contempt of the Royal Commission.
I understand the adjective "contumacious" to mean "stubbornly resistant to authority; wilfully obstinate" ((11) Collins English Dictionary -
Australian edition.) or "wilfully and obstinately disobedient to authority".
((12) Macquarie Dictionary.) I am satisfied that the respondent's refusal to answer the questions was contumacious in that sense. This is particularly clear from the selective nature of his refusal to answer questions.
I have not seen and heard the video-recording of his evidence, but I am prepared to accept the submission that the respondent's refusal was polite. It is nevertheless the contumacious nature of the contempt which renders it criminal in nature. ((13) Australian Consolidated
Press Ltd versus Morgan <case>; [(1965) 112 CLR 483] at 108-109;
DPP versus Chidiac [(1991) 25 NSWLR 372] at 375-376.)
It was submitted that I am in no position to determine how substantial the materiality of his answers would have been to the Commissioner's inquiry.
This is relevant to the seriousness of the contempt committed. A "hypothetical" situation was put forward from the bar table that persons in the respondent's position may well have found themselves the subject of extortion by police officers over the years, being shaken down by them to make payments in order to avoid improper charges being laid against them, but also being timid and unable to take upon themselves any whistle-blowing role in relation to such corrupt conduct. However, it is not for me to guess whether that is the explanation which the respondent may give when he does answer the questions of him.
Whether he is alleged to have been seeking to bribe police officers or whether he may only have been the subject of extortion is beside the point so far as I am concerned. The point is that, according to the evidence already given to the Commission by one police officer, the respondent has paid money to him, and it is of very substantial importance that the
Commissioner find out from the respondent whether he has paid money to that officer and to any other police officers and former officers - whether it be by way of bribery or as a result of extortion. Both are equally important to the Commissioner's terms of reference.
The wilful refusal of a witness to answer questions asked in legal proceedings is a very serious contempt, as it reduces the effectiveness of the administration of justice; ((14) Registrar, Court of Appeal versus Gilby (Court of
Appeal, 20 August 1991, unreported at 2; Smith versus The Queen (at 10).) it is equally serious where the refusal occurs in a Royal Commission such as the present, because it will reduce the effectiveness too of the important inquiry for which it was established. ((15) Von Doussa versus Owens (No3)(1982) [31 SASR 116] at 117-118.) A weak attitude towards such a contempt in the present case would encourage others to act in the same way, and the Commission could thereby be crippled. ((16) Thelander versus Woodward [(1981) 1 NSWLR 644] at 646.)
The substantial issue which was debated before me was the purpose for which, stating it in neutral terms, action can or should be taken against the respondent as a result of his contempt of the Royal Commission. Three possible specific purposes of any such action were identified: as retribution for the contempt which has been committed by the respondent, or by way of expiation on his part; to coerce him into answering the questions; and the deterrence of others.

The third of those purposes would clearly overlap with each of the other two.
The first point made by Mr James was that this Court has no power to take action against the respondent in order to coerce him into answering the questions. Coercion is usually effected by committal to prison until further order of the Court, so that the contemnor is kept in custody until his contempt is purged (in this case, by answering the questions). ((17) Subject only, in the case of a Royal Commission, to the termination of the Commission itself. Ferraro versus Woodward <case>; [(1978) 143 CLR 102] at 107.) It was argued that there is nothing in the Act which gives this Court such power in the case of a witness before a Royal
Commission. [Section 18(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18.html) of the Act, it was pointed out, gives the power to compel witnesses to answer questions only to the
Commissioner. The amendments made to the Act in 1990 - by deleting from [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18.html) the Commissioner's power to punish for contempt of the Commission and by investing that power (and what was said to be that power only) in this
Court by [s 18B(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) - made such a conclusion inevitable, the submission ran.
Emphasis was placed upon the words "may punish" in [s 18B(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) when investing that power in this Court, and it was argued that punishment is in effect mutually inconsistent with coercion.
 .
Reliance was placed upon the principle - stated by the High Court in Re
Bolton; Ex parte Beane ((18) <case>; [(1987) 162 CLR 514] at 518, 520, 523, 532.) - that a legislative provision will not be construed as intending to derogate from a fundamental freedom of the subject unless that intention is clearly expressed.
That appears to be but one manifestation of the well established presumption that the Legislature does not intend to abrogate a common law right or privilege unless a contrary intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied in the statute; there is a long line of authority in the High Court to that effect. ((19) The authorities are collected in Regina versus Fuller [(1994) 34
NSWLR 233] at 237-238.) Although it was not suggested that there was any particular freedom or common law right or privilege being denied to the respondent by [s 18B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html), this principle was called in aid to ensure that the powers given to this Court by [s 18B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) are read narrowly so as to exclude the power to commit him to prison for an indefinite period in order to provide such coercion.
((20) The history of the struggle against the power of a Royal
Commission (without the assistance of statutory authority) to compel answers to its questions is traced by Griffith CJ in Clough versus Leahy <case>; [(1905) 2 CLR 139] at 158-160 (and see the argument of Wise KC at 145-147), and by Dixon J in
McGuinness versus AG <case>; [(1940) 63 CLR 73] at 94-102.)
This Court's power in relation to a witness in a case before it to commit him to prison for an indefinite period in order to compel or to coerce him to answer questions is not challenged; it is well recognized. ((21) Australian
Consolidated Press
Ltd versus Morgan (at 498); AMIEU versus Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (at 114). See also Re Buchanan (1964) 65 SR 9 at 12; Von Doussa versus Owens (No 3) (at 118).) There are many cases in which such orders have been made without criticism when those cases were considered by the High Court. ((22) See, for example: James versus Cowen <case>; [(1928) 42 CLR 305] at 581-582; Ferraro versus Woodward (at 107).) What has been challenged by
Mr James is this Courts power to do so in relation to a witness who refuses to answer questions before a Royal Commission.
As I have already pointed out, the Act provides that the Royal
Commissioner may compel a witness to answer questions. ((23) [Section (1)(b)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18.html) Since the 1990 amendments, the Commissioner may do so only by presenting a certificate to this Court pursuant to [s 18B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) and asking this
Court to exercise its powers in that section to "punish" the witness. [Section
B(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s18b.html) provides that this Court may do so - "... in like manner and to the like extent as if the person had committed that contempt in or in relation to proceedings in the
Supreme Court. "
Subsection (3)(c) applies the provisions of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and of the Supreme Court Rules and extends them by any necessary adaptations.
SCR Pt 55 r 13 ("Punishment") permits this Court to punish contempt by committal to prison, a phrase which is consistent with an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment until further order of the Court.
The Legislature must therefore necessarily have contemplated and intended that this Court's power of "punishment" pursuant to <case> would be used in order to compel the witness to answer questions, or to coerce him into doing so, by committal to prison for an indefinite period. There is, in my view, nothing to be gained from the use of the words "punish" and "punishment" in s
B.
Mr James relied also upon the provision by <case> of the Act of an offence of refusing to answer questions by a witness before the Commission, for which offence a maximum penalty of $400 may be imposed. It was conceded, as it must be, that such a refusal may be "punished" as a contempt of the Commission even though it could also be punished as an offence; ((24) Section 18 D(1).) but it was argued that it would not be appropriate to keep a witness in custody indefinitely for his contempt in refusing to answer a question when he can be punished only by way of a relatively small fine for the offence also thereby committed. I do not accept that argument. Indeed, the lenient nature of the punishment provided for the offence tends, in my view, to support the argument of Mr
Howie QC (who appeared as Crown Advocate for the applicant) that an indeterminate period of custody is necessary in order to prevent a witness avoiding his obligation to answer merely by paying the fine. ((25) Van Doussa v Owens (No 2) [(1982) 30 SASR 391] at 399; Van Doussa versus Owens (No 3) (at 118).)
I am accordingly satisfied that this Court has power to commit a person found guilty of contempt of a Royal Commission to prison until further order of the Court.
But should that power be exercised in the present case rather than by imposing a determinate sentence as punishment (in the sense of retribution) for the contempt which has been committed? As a criminal contempt, the offence is a common law indictable misdemeanour, ((26) Consolidated Press Ltd versus McRae <case>; [(1955) 93 CLR 325] at -364.) for which (in common with all such common law misdemeanours) there is no maximum term of imprisonment, provided that the sentence is not inordinate. ((27) Rex versus Morris [(1951) 1 KB 394] at 396; Verrier versus DPP 11967) 2
AC 195 at 220.)
Coercion would obviously be inappropriate if the respondent had already purged his contempt, or if it were no longer necessary to obtain his answers to the questions asked, or if the Royal Commission had been terminated, or if for any other reason no good purpose would be served by detaining him any further. ((28) Young versus Registrar, Court of Appeal [(1993) 32 NSWLR 262] at 292.)
In Re Buchanan, ((29) (at 11-12)) the journalist who refused to reveal his source when giving evidence in a defamation action was subsequently fined because the action had already been heard and he could no longer give evidence in it. In many similar cases where a journalist as a witness in a Royal
Commission has refused to answer questions as to his sources, he has been prosecuted for the offence provided by statute rather than for contempt. ((30)
For example: McGuinness versus AG (at 75). In AG versus Clough [(1963) 1 QB 773], the journalist in each case was charged with what is described in <case>(b) of the (UK) Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 as an "offence" of refusing to answer questions before such an inquiry. That section permits the chairman of the tribunal to certify the "offence" to the
High Court, which in turn (after inquiry into the alleged offence) may punish the offender "in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the (High
Court)". In Re Buchanan (at 12), the Full Court asserted that the proceedings in each case were not for contempt of court. With all due respect to the Full
Court, the proceedings (which are almost identical to those provided by <case> of the [Royal Commissions Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/)) were different in name only; they were not different in substance to proceedings for contempt of court.) The same has been the case in relation to other witnesses where they have been dealt with after the proceedings in which they refused to answer questions have been completed. ((31) For example: Clough versus Leahy (at 140).) In Registrar, Court of
Appeal versus Craven (No 2) ((32) (Court of Appeal, June 1995, unreported)) the trial in which the respondent had refused to answer questions had also been completed, but he was nevertheless charged with contempt. As coercion was no longer relevant, he was fined. In the present case, the Royal Commission is continuing, and is likely to do so for some years. ((33) One witness before the Commission has already been found guilty of contempt of it and has been committed to prison until further order by reason of his refusal to answer questions; the issue of this Court's power to do so was not argued, although it was unsuccesfully argued that the witness should receive a determinate sentence rather than that which was unposed: Bon JRT Wood versus Staunton (Dunford
J, 8 June 1995, unreported).)
It was emphasized on behalf of the respondent that he is not in this case subject to a continuing order. That may be so, but the statements made by the
Royal Commissioner at the time, his action in certifying the respondent's contempt, and the submissions made on his behalf by Mr Howie all make it clear that the Commissioner still seeks to have answers to the questions asked of the respondent. I do not believe that the respondent's obduracy is of such a nature that it is unlikely that he will change his mind. ((34) cf Enfield
London Borough Council versus Mahoney [(1983) 1 WLR 749] at 754, 755756, 758; DPP v
Channel Four Television Co Ltd (1993) 2 AU ER 517 at 531; ICAC versus Cornwall (No ) (Abadee J, 8 September , unreported) at 13.) On the contrary, I am satisfied that it is likely that coercive action against the respondent will eventually produce the information sought by the Commissioner, ((35) In re
Barrell Enterprises [(1973) 1 WLR 19] at 27-28.) and that these are the only means by which such a result may be obtained. ((36) cf "Contempt", MAC 35 , at par 511.)
Accordingly, I make the following orders: 
I declare that the respondent (Bruce Galea) is guilty of contempt of the
Royal
Commission into the NSW Police Service in that, being a witness who had been summonsed to attend and to give evidence to the Commission, he did on 14
July 1995 refuse to answer relevant questions (being those identified in the
Summons herein) and that he did thereby conduct himself in a manner which tended to interfere with the lawful inquiries and investigations of the
Commission. 
The respondent is committed to imprisonment for such contempt of the
Commission until further order of the Court or until the Commission is terminated, whichever event first occurs. 
The respondent is to pay the Commissioner's costs of these proceedings. 
Liberty to apply.
