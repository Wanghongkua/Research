JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: These proceedings raise an issue which is as interesting as it is vexed concerning the entitlement of a party to interest on costs ordered in civil proceedings. 
The plaintiff, Mr Brian McMahon, has been successful in obtaining an award of damages in his defamation action in the sum of $300,000: see McMahon versus John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 7)  <case>
I dealt with the costs of the proceedings in a separate judgment: see McMahon versus John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 8) <case> In that judgment, I made the following orders: 
That the defendants pay 95 per cent of the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings except for his costs of the special damages claim; 
That, as to the costs of professional services provided to the plaintiff by himself (in any capacity), those costs be paid as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis; 
That, as to disbursements and the costs of professional services provided to the plaintiff by others, those costs be paid as agreed or assessed on the indemnity basis; 
That the costs payable by the defendants pursuant to these orders be reduced by the amount payable by Mr McMahon pursuant to the costs order of the
Court of Appeal made 18 November 2010 in McMahon versus John Fairfax Pty Ltd <case> provided that the defendants take all reasonable steps to have those costs agreed or assessed with due expedition, failing which Mr McMahon has liberty to apply to vacate this order.
The plaintiff now seeks interest on the costs awarded to him. The defendant opposes the application but contends - and it is not disputed by Mr McMahon - that in the event that Mr McMahon is successful, the defendant should also have an award of interest on costs awarded in its favour. 
A threshold issue was argued this afternoon as to the Court's power to determine Mr McMahon's application at this stage of the proceedings. 
The judgment on costs was published on 27 May 2014. 
On 29 May 2014, senior counsel for Mr McMahon, Mr McClintock, wrote an email to my Associate asking for an opportunity to raise at least one issue, namely the issue of interest on costs incurred before the orders were finalised and entered. The orders had at that stage already been entered on JusticeLink in accordance with my Associate's usual practice. It followed that they were taken to have been entered in accordance with r 36.11. 
In those circumstances, Mr Dawson, who appears for the defendant, quite properly raised the question of power. He noted that the application brought at this stage, after the orders have been entered and beyond 14 days after that date, did not appear to fall within any of the categories in which the Court can vary a judgment in accordance with r 36.16 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.
However, Mr Dawson also accepted that the correspondence following Mr McClintock's email had proceeded on the assumption that the Court would, in due course, deal with the application if it were not resolved. In those circumstances, he very fairly acceded to my suggestion that the question could properly be determined by me if I were to regard Mr McClintock's email as being, for the purposes of that rule, adequate notice of Mr McMahon's motion brought today. I made a direction accordingly.
Mr McMahon's application invokes the Court's power under [s 101(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) which relevantly provides: 
The court may order that interest is to be paid on any amount payable under an order for the payment of costs.
[Section 101(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the Act provides: 
Interest under subsection (4) is to be calculated, at the prescribed rate or at such other rate as the court may order, as from: the date or dates on which the costs concerned were paid, or such later date as the court may order.
Mr McClintock submitted that, having regard to the plain terms of the section, it may readily be construed as conferring a broad discretion on the Court which is unfettered except to the extent that subsection (5) reveals an order cannot be made so as to award interest from a date earlier than the date on which the costs concerned were paid. He submitted that the section is to be exercised in accordance with the interests of justice, in particular taking into account the fact that it appears to be intended to serve the function of compensating a litigant who has been out of his money due to the litigation.
Mr McClintock went close at the same time to suggesting that the discretion must be exercised in favour of a party who applies for an order for interest unless some reason is demonstrated for ordering otherwise. I would regard that as equally being a fetter on the discretion conferred by the section, which should simply be applied according to its terms.
Mr Dawson accepted that the discretion is broad and unfettered but submitted that the proper circumstances for its exercise must be informed by the relevant authorities. As observed at the outset of this judgment, the jurisprudence in respect of the proper application of the section has, to a degree, been vexed.
Dealing with the relevant authorities in chronological order, in Lahoud versus Lahoud <case> Campbell J said at [82]: 
In my view it is appropriate to make an order for the payment of interest on costs. There is no requirement, before an order for payment of interest on costs is made, for the Court to be satisfied that the circumstances of the case are out of the ordinary: Grogan versus Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd & Anor <case> at <case> per
Barr J; Australian Development Corporation Pty Ltd versus White Constructions (ACT)
Pty Ltd (in liquidation) & Ors <case> at <case>- <case> per
Einstein J; Puntoriero & Anor versus Water Administration Ministerial
Corporation <case> at <case> per Grove J; Davies versus Kuring-Gai Municipal Council <case> at <case> per Austin J.
That principle was described as being "clear" and applied uncontroversially by Slattery J in Lovick & Son Developments Pty Ltd versus Doppstadt Australia Pty Ltd <case>. His Honour said, at [49]: 
The plaintiffs submit they are entitled to interest on costs. The relevant principles are clear. There is no requirement to establish any special circumstances in order to justify an order for the payment of interest on costs: Lahoud versus Lahoud <case>, per Campbell J and Drummond & Rosen Pty Ltd versus Easey (No 2) <case> at <case>, per Macfarlan JA. The defendants were not realistically able to resist the order for interest on costs. So an order is provided for below to award interest on costs. But it will not be clear until a costs assessment takes place just exactly when the plaintiffs paid their legal costs and disbursements. Therefore, the precise dates on which interest on these costs payments should run cannot yet be calculated. This calculation can be dealt with in final orders consequent thereon.
The position, however, became complicated following the publication of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Illawarra Hotel Company Pty Ltd versus Walton Construction Pty Ltd (No 2)  <case>; [(2013) 84 NSWLR 436]. As the judgment of the Court of Appeal reveals, that was a building case as to which McDougall J, the trial Judge, had made observations concerning "the evident animosity between the parties and the lengths to which each had gone to buttress its case". 
It has frequently been observed that hard cases create difficulties for the propounding of good law. 
Against the observations of McDougall J, the Court of Appeal dealt with the question of interest on costs in the following terms (at [36] to [39]): 
Illawarra nevertheless recognises that the power to award interest on costs is discretionary and that some positive case must be made in support of the application. It says, in that regard, that Illawarra has paid out a very large sum since the commencement of the litigation in 2008 and that that money could otherwise have been put to profitable use. Reference is made to an affidavit of Illawarra's solicitor referring to sums paid by Illawarra to his firm.
Illawarra further says that Walton has effectively had the benefit of not having paid that money.

Walton submits that the question of interest on costs cannot be determined without an exhaustive consideration of the circumstances that caused the proceedings to be protracted by the serving of evidence on unsuccessful issues, futile amendments to pleadings, issues not pursued at trial and matters relevant to McDougall J's observation concerning "the evident animosity between the parties and the lengths to which each has gone to buttress its case": WaltonConstruction Pty Ltd versus Illawarra Hotel Company Pty
Ltd <case> at <case>.

That submission must be accepted. A party who contends that there should be an order for interest on costs must do more than point to the fact that the proceedings were protracted and that it had to outlay moneys on its own costs over a long period. The reasons for the protracted nature of the proceedings are of obvious relevance. To take a hypothetical example, one can imagine a case in which one party deliberately seeks to prolong proceedings with an eye to some collateral benefit of its own for which it is quite happy to pay the price of being out of the money it progressively outlays for costs. That hypothetical case can be contrasted with another in which a party has made strenuous effort to expedite matters and to avoid all delay with a view to the earliest possible trial but has been frustrated in those efforts by actions of the other party. A middle course is where each party acts with reasonable diligence and dispatch but the nature of the proceedings and their subject matter is such as to prolong them. A court might well take different attitudes to applications for interest on costs in these hypothetical cases.

This litigation was, of its nature, time-consuming and exacting. Building cases often descend into what, to the outside observer, seems to be tedious analysis of a vast myriad of minutiae. In the absence of some sufficiently clear explanation of the reasons why this litigation proceeded as it did, in a timing sense, there would be no sound basis for exercise of the discretion concerning interest on costs, even if it were now exercisable by this Court in relation to the costs in the court below.
In The Owners Strata Plan 61162 versus Lipman; The Owners Strata Plan No 61162 versus Building Insurer's Guarantee Corporation <case>, those remarks were subsequently construed by McDougall J (who, as the foregoing consideration reveals, had been the trial Judge in Walton versus Illawarra <case> as binding his Honour not to award interest on costs unless some positive case was put forward for doing so. His Honour observed at [267] that it was for the Court of Appeal to decide whether what was said in Illawarra in the paragraphs set out above should be regarded as having been decided "per incuriam". His Honour said: 
It seems to me that, as the most recent decision of the Court of Appeal in point lays down the proposition to which I have referred at [257] to [259] above, I am bound to deal with the question of interest on costs in that way.
Unconstrained by those principles, his Honour would have taken the approach set out at [265] of the judgment as follows: 
If the particular question were not the subject of authority binding on me, so that I was free to deal with it, I would consider that: it is inappropriate for the general discretion to order interest on costs, conferred by [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), to be trammelled by some fetter on its exercise such as that there should be something more than "the fact that the proceedings were protracted and that [the applicant for interest] had to outlay moneys on its own costs over a long period", and the discretion should be exercised so as, objectively, to suit the interests of justice on the facts of the particular case, taking into account of course the evident compensatory function that [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) is intended to perform.
As it happened, on the date on which that judgment was published, Illawarra was not in fact "the most recent decision of the Court of Appeal" in point. Two days before McDougall J's publication of his judgment in The Owners Strata Plan 61162 versus Lipman, the Court of Appeal had published its decision in an appeal against the judgment of Slattery J to which I have already referred: see Doppstadt Australia Pty Ltd versus Lovick & Son Developments Pty Ltd  <case> (wrongly described in the judgment as a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal). 
It should be observed that Ward JA was common to the bench in both Doppstadt and in Illawarra. In Doppstadt, the Court of Appeal said at [403] to [404]: 
No issue was raised on appeal as to the principles applied by the primary judge at [49] Judgment No 3. The payment of interest is intended to be compensatory, on the basis that the person entitled to costs has been wrongly required to spend money on litigation to enforce established rights: Robb
Evans of Robb Evans & Associates versus European Bank Ltd (No 2)  <case> as [44] per Basten JA (Campbell JA agreeing). Thus in the absence of any countervailing discretionary factor, it is appropriate that an order for interest on costs be made to compensate the party having the benefit of a costs order for being out of pocket in respect of relevant costs which it had paid. There is no requirement to establish that the circumstances of the case are out of the ordinary: Drummond and Rosen Pty Ltd versus Easey & Ors (No 2) <case> at <case> per
Macfarlan JA (Tobias JA agreeing) citing Lahoud versus Lahoud  <case> at <case>- <case> per
Campbell J.

In this case, there was evidence before the primary judge by way of affidavit from Mrs Vicki Lovick, the administration officer of the respondents, of the amounts paid, and the dates of payment of legal costs totalling $636,558.27 as at 21 June 2012 (Black 936M). Thus no issue arises on the present appeal as to whether a special order for interest on costs can and should be made in the absence of such evidence: Drummond and Rosen Pty Ltd versus Easey & Ors (No ) at [3] per Macfarlan JA (Tobias JA agreeing); contra Handley AJA at [49]; cf Illawarra Hotel Co Pty Ltd versus Walton Construction Pty Ltd (No 2) <case>; <case> per
Meagher, Barrett and Ward JJA.
Finally, I suppose by way of epilogue, following the publication of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Doppstadt, White J in Wardy versus Wardy & Ors (No. 2)  <case> interpreted the decision in Illawarra as in effect commending the importance of a party seeking interest on costs making the application at first instance, so that the primary judge who would be better placed to consider how the litigation had been conducted would be able to consider and deal with any questions that might arise in that respect.
Mr Dawson submitted, with his usual carefulness and ingenuity, that the passages from Doppstadt set out above should be regarded as having been made simply in the circumstances there recorded, namely, that there had been no issue in the appeal as to the relevant principles. He noted that the decision in Illawarra, although referred to on a separate question, was not expressly discussed so that the apparent controversy between two lines of authority should not be regarded as being resolved by that decision.
As eloquently as those submissions were put, I think I am bound as a puisne judge to take the same approach taken by McDougall J in Owners Corporation, albeit under misapprehension, namely, I should apply what is, so far as I have been told, the most recent decision of the Court of Appeal, and that is the principle clearly stated in Doppstadt. I should add that those statements of principle appear to me to accord with a plain reading of the section which, as I have observed, it seems to me confer a broad and unfettered discretion to be exercised in accordance with the interests of justice in any individual case.
In the present case, the simple fact is that the proceedings have been protracted and Mr McMahon has been out of pocket to the extent demonstrated in his affidavit sworn 8 July 2014. According to that affidavit, he has paid disbursement items in the proceedings totalling $324,821.72. The affidavit also deposes to the fact that Ardent Legal Pty Limited has paid a sum in the order of $170,000 by way of disbursements. I do not think there should be an award of interest on those disbursements for reasons to which I will return.
As to the disbursements that have been paid by Mr McMahon, in my view the circumstances of the case warrant an award of interest for the following reasons. 
First, as I have already said, the proceedings have been protracted and Mr McMahon has been out of pocket. That on its own is not enough, according to the submissions of Mr Dawson, in the circumstance of what he put as the countervailing discretionary factor. Mr Dawson noted that, in my earlier costs judgment, I made an award of indemnity costs as to a portion of the plaintiff's costs on the basis of [s 40(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s40.html) of the [Defamation Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/), for the reasons explained in the judgment.
However, I specifically rejected an application for indemnity costs on the alternative basis of the manner in which the proceedings had been conducted on the part of the defendants, saying (at [34]): 
Had I not been persuaded of Mr McMahon's prima facie entitlement to indemnity costs in accordance with [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s40.html) of the [Defamation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/), his submissions would not have persuaded me that I should award indemnity costs on the basis of the provisions of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da200599/s40.html) of the Act. Based on my observation of the conduct of both parties in the proceedings, I do not think the defendants' conduct marks them out for such an order.
Mr Dawson submitted that the plaintiff has accordingly received a measure of indemnity in respect of his costs, and that it would be too punitive to add the award of interest on those costs as presently claimed. That submission seems to me to assume that a party's conduct of the proceedings is the only relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion.
A further consideration which in my view is relevant is the fact that there were circumstances in the present case, albeit due to a specific statutory regime, for awarding indemnity costs to Mr McMahon. In my view, those same circumstances provide a strong discretionary factor in favour of also awarding Mr McMahon's interest on those disbursements which he has paid out of his is own pocket.
I do not think the same argument can conceivably be put in respect of the disbursements paid by Ardent Legal. Indeed, I would go so far as to express my doubt as to whether the power under <case> can even properly be exercised in respect of those costs. But assuming it can, the stronger countervailing discretionary factor, in my view, is simply that Mr McMahon has not been and is not now out of pocket in respect of those costs. That is enough in my view to dispose of the application. I do not think it would be appropriate to make a prospective order in respect of those costs.
For those reasons, I am satisfied that Mr McMahon should have an award pursuant to <case> of interest on the disbursement items paid by him as deposed in paragraph 7 of his affidavit. It follows that the defendant should also have an award of interest on the costs which have been awarded in its favour in the proceedings, since no countervailing discretionary consideration has been put forward on behalf of Mr McMahon.

Addendum of 11 July 2014:
HER HONOUR: I have this morning heard the parties as to the costs of the application determined earlier this week in this judgment. 
Mr McMahon seeks an order that the defendants pay his costs of the application on the simple premise that he was successful and, accordingly, that the usual order should be made on the strength of costs following the event. 
Mr Dawson has submitted that it is a case in which the Court should take a differential approach. The basis for that submission is that Mr McMahon claimed, in addition to interest on disbursements paid directly by him, interest on disbursements which, as the evidence ultimately revealed, had in fact been paid by Ardent Legal on his behalf. 
The correspondence tendered on the application sustains, in my view, Mr Dawson's submission that but for the pursuit of the point in a formal contested and adversarial hearing, it would not have been plain to the defendants that part of the disbursements in respect of which interest was claimed had indeed not been paid by the plaintiff himself. 
Throughout these proceedings the circumstance of the plaintiff operating through the firm Ardent Legal has complicated the consideration of questions of costs, as revealed in my earlier judgment dealing substantively with that issue. The correspondence persuades me that there was, although I would not suggest it was deliberate, a degree of complexity added to the issue by a lack of complete transparency in the way in which the request was brought forward on behalf of the plaintiff.
Further, the plaintiff was unsuccessful in that aspect of the claim. In all the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to exercise my discretion to deal with the costs in a way that is fair, reflecting all of those considerations, by ordering that each party bear his or its own costs after 27 May 2014. * * *
