JUDGMENT
The plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of an assessment in relation to an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act says that the court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person whose interest in property is sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime related activity, stating the grounds on which the suspicion referred to therein is based, and the court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 16 February 2017. Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime related activity or activities being the commission of the offences of cultivating a prohibited plant of greater than the commercial quantity and supplying a prohibited plant not less than the commercial quantity contrary to [ss 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s23.html) and [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) respectively of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) . Those offences fall within the definition of serious criminal offences under [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading the facts sheet prepared by a police officer after the arrest of the defendant. Ms Bourne sought confirmation from the officer whom she believed prepared the facts sheet of: the fact that the officer had done so, the facts sheet was true to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief and the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation. The officer replied in the affirmative to those enquiries adding that the facts sheet was prepared in conjunction with another officer.
Ms Bourne also provides evidence from various sources including the LPI data base and the RMS data base that justifies her suspicion that the property that is sought to be restrained is property belonging to the defendant.
I have read the facts sheet and the other material annexed to Ms Bourne's affidavit. I am satisfied that her suspicion that the offences have been committed and that the defendant is the owner of the property is reasonably held.
The plaintiff seeks that the orders be made without prior notice to the defendant. It does so based on what Ms Bourne says in para 10 of her affidavit that, through her experience with the plaintiff, she is aware that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages of real estate and dispose of motor vehicles very quickly or to back date motor vehicle transfer forms all in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act.
I am satisfied that the orders should, therefore, be made without prior notice to the defendant. The defendant has rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review of these orders.
I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given by the solicitor for the plaintiff. On that basis I make orders in terms of paras 1, 2, 4, 7 and 8 of the draft order provided. I grant the leave and liberty in paras 3 and 5. The matter is stood over for directions before the common law registrar at 9am on Monday 15 May 2017.
These orders may be entered forthwith.
