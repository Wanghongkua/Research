Australian Property and Management P/L versus Devefi P/L [1997] NSWSC 112 (7
April 1997) `AUSTRALIAN PROPERTY AND MANAGEMENT P/L versus DEVEFI P/L` `1927/97` `MONDAY, 7 April 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: These are proceedings brought by the caveator to extend
Caveat No 2838963 lodged against the defendant's title. The caveat as lodged sought to protect two alleged equitable interests; however, the argument was confined to one of these: namely, "An equitable estate or interest arising under Contract for Sale dated 31 July 1996 ...".` ` The property is in Clarence Street, Sydney. The contract is for a sale price of $10,000 for shop 1, ` `206 Clarence Street Sydney being proposed lot 69 as marked on the unregistered strata plan being part of lot 1 deposited plan 51322. ` ` The parties anticipated that it might take some time for the plan to be registered and subject to special conditions it was thought that thirty months might be an appropriate time for the plan to be registered.` ` The plaintiff paid 10 per cent deposit, but the contract has not yet been stamped. It was admitted into evidence on the undertaking by the plaintiff's solicitor to pay the stamp duty thereon.` ` The contract is basically in the standard form but there are a host of amendments to the printed conditions. Clause 12 of the special conditions reads as follows:` ``"The Purchaser acknowledges that the Vendor must use its best endeavours to settle this transaction within a reasonable time and agrees it must not cause a caveat to be lodged against the title of the Property at any time." 
The present caveat was lodged in February 1997. The defendant went through the procedure of causing a notice of lapsing to issue by the Registrar General and pursuant to this notice of lapsing the caveat will lapse, I believe, tomorrow morning unless extended by this Court. The defendant wishes to remove the caveat because it is mortgaged in favour of an overseas company for a large sum of money which, it says, is necessary for it to develop the site and it has also on-sold the property in accordance with the contract, exhibit DX08, made 27 March 1997.

I should note that the contract, exhibit DX08, provides in special condition that the purchaser under that contract agrees to purchase the property subject to what are called the exchanged contracts set out in annexure H which include the contract to the plaintiff involving shop 1.

Mr Downes QC who appears with Mr G B Evans for the plaintiff, said that DX08 shows a clear breach of contract. This may be so as a strict matter of law though it may not be. As other commercial considerations apply on both sides, it is best not to make any decision on that point in these proceedings which are solely directed to extension of the caveat.
 [Section
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74k.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) as amended provides that the Court may, if satisfied that a caveator's claim may have substance, make an order extending the operation of the caveat and may make such ancillary orders as the Court thinks fit.

The first question is whether the caveat may have substance.

There is an initial problem with this because the contract has not been stamped. The High Court in Dent versus Moore (1919) 26 CLR 316 and the Court of
Appeal in Ash Street Properties Pty Limited versus Pollnow [(1987) 9 NSWLR ]
say that no interest arises under the unstamped contract in law or in equity because of the wording of [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/s29.html) of the [Stamp Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sda1920157/).

Mr Downes QC put that courts have on many occasions recognised a caveatable interest in an unstamped contract and pointed to cases such as Silovi Pty
Limited versus Barbaro [(1988) 13 NSWLR 466] where the
Court was not at all put off by similar words in the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/).

I believe that the decision of the High Court in Dent versus Moore is too clear for me to do anything more than acknowledge its correctness. However, whilst this is a full answer to the plaintiff's claim I will not stop at this point, but go on and consider the matter according to its merits. This is for two reasons: first, because on the merits I believe one gets the same result and, secondly, it may be possible to grant an injunction rather than to extend the caveat and then for the injunction to be registered on the title so that the same result might follow.

Accordingly, there is no real purpose in deciding the matter on technical grounds.

Assuming that the contract is enforceable, it creates an interest in the land as all contracts of this nature do. Accordingly, as an interest in the land is vested in the plaintiff and there is a caveat to protect that interest in the land, the caveat must pass the barrier of showing that it may have substance.

But the Court does not stop there; it goes on to consider whether in all the circumstances the caveat should be extended. In Yong versus Letchumanan [[1980]
AC 331], 337 the Privy Council, on appeal from Malaysia, said that the present type of proceedings raised two questions: first, whether the claim for an interest in property raised a serious question to be tried and, secondly, whether on the balance of convenience it would be better to maintain the status quo until the trial than take the reverse course. In New South Wales that course has been taken on many occasions, particularly in connection with caveats which are lodged to enforce charges by builders (see Martyn versus Glennan [[1979] 2
NSWLR 234] and Gibson versus Coordinated Building Services Pty Limited BPR 9630).

This, indeed, seems to be the course that is taken throughout the world where the current system is in place except for New Zealand and Western Australia and I am not too sure of the position in Canada. (See the decisions noted in
Lindsay on Caveats Against Dealings (Federation Press 1995) pp 206 to .

One of the major factors to my mind in whether the Court would extend the caveat is the promise by the plaintiff in special condition 12 that it would not lodge a caveat. The promise that it would not lodge a caveat did not, of course, prevent the plaintiff as a matter of law from lodging a caveat but that is the sort of promise that the Court would in appropriate circumstances enforce at least by way of injunction. One can see this in the allied case of a promise not to take proceedings to partition or sell property pursuant to section 66G of the Conveyancing Act. (See Re Buchanan-Wallaston's
Conveyance [1939] Ch 217 (Farwell J) and 738 (Court of Appeal); Re
Permanent Trustee Nominees (Canberra) Limited [[1989] 1 Qd R 314] and
Williams versus Legg [(1993) 29 NSWLR 687).] 
In the present case had the defendant got wind of the plaintiff's intention, it may have obtained an injunction to prevent the caveat. When the Court is asked to extend the caveat it takes into account the circumstances that it would have considered when determining whether or not to grant an injunction.

The promise not to exercise a statutory right, on the 66G authorities, is one which the Court takes very seriously. It would seem to me for this reason alone that it would be inequitable for the Court to extend the caveat.

However, there is another reason: the Court has said in cases such as Martyn v Glennan that it will not allow caveats, even if they are legitimate caveats, to oppress the registered proprietor unduly. The Court does not live in some commercial vacuum. The Court knows that the mere presence of a caveat may prevent a whole series of bona fide commercial transactions taking place and if a case gets into that sort of area the Court will be extremely careful as to whether the caveat should be retained. An example is Re Clements
Caveat [[1981] Qd R 341.] If in such a circumstance a substitute security can be given then the Court is often minded to order that the caveat be removed.

In the instant case Mr Robinson, the solicitor for the defendant who is also its managing director, has undertaken to the Court to secure $50,000 for any damages that might be suffered by the plaintiff as a result of default on the part of the defendant. I first thought this was insufficient because the plaintiff would be entitled to specific performance with respect to property of this nature and damages might not be an adequate remedy. However, on consideration, it seems to me that the promise not to put on a caveat drastically diminishes the expectation that the equitable proprietary right is to be protected. Such right is also diminished by the fact that this was a sale off the plan of a piece of land which could only be defined when a strata plan was ultimately registered.

Thus, I consider there is sufficient substitute security. The Court, accordingly, declines to extend the caveat.

The summons will be dismissed with costs upon the undertaking which will be written out and noted in proper form of the defendant. All I have to do is initial the undertaking and place it with the papers. Exhibits may be returned.
