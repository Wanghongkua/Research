L M Corcoran versus R Grimmer [1996] NSWSC 622 (17 December 1996) 
Leonard Martin CORCORAN (a.k.a. Marty CORCORAN) versus Rachel GRIMMER AND ORS /96 December 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
SMART J 
JUDGMENT 
Before proceedings to note the terms of settlement and to sign the judgment I should record the effect of observations made by me to the parties during the course of the addresses of counsel. The medical evidence before me indicated that at best timely treatment would have prolonged the life of the plaintiff for a relatively short period. Inevitably, and in any event, the plaintiff would have required extended care and treatment for malignant neoplasia. There would have thus been costs and expenses for this condition in any event. As the evidence stood it was difficult to see how costs and expenses for such care and treatment could be debited to the defendants. The probabilities were that such costs and expenses would not have been recovered by the plaintiff against the defendants. 
I note that the matter has been settled upon terms filed this day and signed by the legal representatives of the parties. There will be judgment as per paragraphs one, two, and three of the terms. I note terms four, five and six.
I sign the judgment which may be entered forthwith.
