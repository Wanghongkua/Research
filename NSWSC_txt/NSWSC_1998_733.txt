REGINA versus JASON GUY FEENEY /98 May 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: In the matter of Jason Feeney, the proceedings came before me in circumstances that occasioned me considerable disquiet at the vulnerability of this man within the gaol system. It was only that, particularly in the light of his extradition from Queensland, that minded me to allow the adjournment of the matter to see what might be available by way of alternative accommodation. 
On the matter coming back before me, we are still in a position where there are not available: reports from Corrective Services showing his internal record tending to assist on that question of vulnerability in the gaol system; the report from Mr. Kirkham referred to in the papers, which indicates matters personal to the applicant and particularly relating to his understanding and possible brain damage; completed psychometric testing (although there was provided material from a psychologist to indicate either brain damage or intellectual retardation such as would make him vulnerable) and when I examine the whole of the material, it seems that for one reason or another the applicant has been unable to put before the court such material as would enable this application to be dealt with on its merits, that is, as to whether there is somewhere he could go outside of the Corrective Services system which would ensure his attendance at court and protect him also.

Very properly in those circumstances, Mr. Laucis, appearing for the Crown, has not opposed the application being withdrawn, even at this late stage, to permit of the attempt to obtain this material if it should become available and so, there not having been a hearing relevant upon the merits, s.22A would not stand in the way of the applicant.

The application is marked withdrawn and dismissed.

I direct a copy of these remarks be taken out and placed with the papers.
