THURSDAY, 23 MARCH 2006  /06 OFFICIAL TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY versus REGISTRAR GENERAL FOR NEW SOUTH WALES & ANOR  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: The circumstances of this matter up to 20 February 2006 are recorded in my judgment Official Trustee in Bankruptcy versus Registrar General for New South Wales  <case> and I shall not repeat them here. The matter has been back in court on two occasions between then and today, namely, on 24 February 2006 and on 8 March
On or since 20 February 2006 four steps have been taken:  
Stephen Vasil was joined as a defendant in the hope that this step might procure further information from him as to the whereabouts of the certificates of title. However, he has not been able to be served, despite efforts.  
A request was made of the Registrar of the District Court at Sydney to produce the certificates of title.  
A subpoena was issued to the State Crown Solicitor to produce the certificates of title.  
A subpoena was issued to the Commissioner of Police to produce the certificates of title.  
Steps (2), (3) and (4) have had a variety of success.  Correspondence has been received from the District Court Registry and from the Crown Solicitor which indicates that appropriate searches have been made and it would seem that the certificates of title are not and never have been in the possession of that Court or the Crown Solicitor.  In relation to the subpoena to the Commissioner of Police, this led to the production to the Court of the original of one of the certificates of title, which was in the custody of the Police. While there is no clear evidence as to how this came about, it seems that it may corroborate what Mr Vasil earlier said, to the extent that at least one of the certificates of title was seized from him by the Police under a search warrant. This makes one wonder whether the other certificate of title is not also somewhere in the offices of the
Commissioner of Police, particularly as the Police have a copy of it. However, the Court is informed by a written communication from Detective Sergeant Taig, the Fraud Squad Coordinator, that the original of that certificate of title cannot be located. I am told that eight boxes of documents have been thoroughly searched without result.  It is a little unsatisfactory in light of the risk of fraud, to which I have already adverted, that the Police are not able to tell the Court whether the second certificate of title was seized in the first place and, if so, what has become of it. However, a situation has been reached where it does seem that search has been made and it cannot now be located.  The original certificate of title that has been recovered from the Police may be handed out of court to the plaintiff, who is the person now entitled to it, and who has sold that property under a contract which awaits settlement.
Furthermore, more recently, on 14 March 2006 the plaintiff has exchanged contracts for the sale of the second property in respect of which the original certificate of title is still missing. The contract provides for settlement 42 days from exchange.  Despite the remaining uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the second certificate of title, I have come to the conclusion that in all the circumstances the time has come to make an order under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s138.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) for the issue of a fresh certificate of title in respect of the second property. I shall make orders by reference to short minutes brought in to give effect to the decisions recorded in this judgment.
