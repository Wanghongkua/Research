EX TEMPORE Judgment  
HIS HONOUR: This is an application to set aside a Statutory Demand served on the plaintiff by the defendant and dated 24 February 2011. The defendant company is in liquidation. Earlier, in light of communication received from the liquidator that he neither consents to nor opposes the grant of leave to the plaintiff to proceed, I granted such leave pursuant to [s 471B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s471b.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)"). 
The defendant has not appeared to defend the proceedings. 
Under [s 459G(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), a company may apply to the Court for an order setting aside a Statutory Demand served on the company. 
Under [s 459H(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) a Statutory Demand is, relevantly, liable to be set aside if the Court is satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between the company and the respondent about the existence of the debt to which the demand relates. 
The Statutory Demand claims the sum of $21,999.99 described as owing for consulting services. 
The defendant is associated with a Mr Constantinidis who was a director of the plaintiff until 30 March 2010. 
The claim is based on the provisions of a Shareholders' Deed which provides for all directors of the plaintiff to be non-executive directors and to receive an initial annual remuneration of $80,000 excluding GST, payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each calendar month. Under the provision such remuneration may be varied from time to time by a special resolution of shareholders. 
The company secretary of the plaintiff deposes to the facts that a at the request of Mr Constantinidis, the company paid the fees not to Mr
Constantinidis but to the defendant;  b invoices were issued by the defendant for the fees and all fees payable up to and including the time at which Mr Constantinidis ceased to be a director, have been paid in full. 
Clearly the plaintiff has established that there is a genuine dispute with respect to this claim. The Statutory Demand is accordingly to be set aside. 
I order that the Statutory Demand dated 24 February 2011 served by the defendant on the plaintiff be set aside. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of proceedings. * * *
