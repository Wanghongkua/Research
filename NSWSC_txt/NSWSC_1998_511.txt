Held:
The Commission, a superior court of record, <case>, having extensive powers of interpretation, <case>, has jurisdiction to decide whether the respondents can litigate their claim pursuant to <case>; The King versus Hickman; ex parte Fox and Clinton <case>; [(1945) 70 CLR 598] distinguished.
Alternatively, if the Commission was subject to the limitations as in
Hickman, this court could not consider the merits of the decisions because they were made in bona fide exercise of the Commission's powers in regard to subject matter of the 1996 Act within the Commission's authority.
The effect of <case> is that decisions of the Commission made within jurisdiction are final and not subject to review in this court.

WOOLWORTHS LIMITED versus HAWKE & ORS 
PRIESTLEY JA: Woolworths Limited (Woolworths) commenced proceedings in this court by way of summons seeking orders in the nature of prohibition against the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales in Court Session (the Commission in Court Session or the Commission) and six other parties on the ground that the Full Bench of the Commission in Court Session had exercised jurisdiction in hearing an appeal from Peterson J, in excess of its jurisdiction. 
The six parties other than the Commission filed a notice of motion in the summons proceedings, asking that the summons be dismissed on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to hear Woolworths' summons, by reason of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s179.html) of the [Industrial Relations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/) (the 1996
Act). The point this court is asked to decide in hearing the motion is comparatively simple, but to explain what the point is, some history of the case needs to be set out.

The six parties who filed the notice of motion were until April 1994 parties who separately had contracts with Woolworths pursuant to which they carried
Woolworths' goods. (For the sake of brevity I will call them the contractors.)
In April 1994 Woolworths informed the contractors that it had contracted with a single carrying company to conduct its distribution services and because of that terminated each of the contracts of carriage that Woolworths had had with each of the contractors.

The contractors considered that they had a grievance against Woolworths in two respects, each flowing from the facts that the contractors had acquired vehicles for the purpose of their contracts and had been individually conducting businesses of carriage which, so long as Woolworths continued the contract system it had had in operation until April 1994, were valuable assets. The contractors considered that because of the termination of the contracts Woolworths should compensate them for losses claimed to be suffered in regard to their vehicles and for the complete destruction of the value of their businesses.

The contractors later claimed that when their contracts were terminated, they were entitled to seek remedies for their grievances under <case> of the
Industrial Relations Act 1991 (the 1991 Act). This court was told that there was no limitation on the period within which proceedings under <case> could be commenced.

On 14 April 1994 the Industrial Relations (Contracts of Carriers) Amendment
Bill was introduced to the Legislative Assembly. After some amendment, it was passed by both Houses and was assented to on 2 June 1994. (I will call it the Act.) It commenced on 1 August 1994. (These details are taken from the publication, Acts Tables 1994 No 12, compiled by the Parliamentary Counsel's
Office.) 
The 1994 Act amended the 1991 Act by inserting a new Pt 5A in Chapter 6. Part
A provided a specific mechanism by which a contract carrier whose head contract of carriage was terminated by a principal contractor might claim compensation from the principal contractor in defined circumstances. Broadly speaking, the compensation for which Pt 5A provided the mechanism was compensation for the kinds of grievances which the contractors in the present proceedings considered they had against Woolworths. One feature of the mechanism provided by Pt 5A was the establishment of a Contract of Carriage
Tribunal (s 697C). The 1994 Act also inserted a transitional provision in Pt 4 of the 1991 Act, which became <case> of the 1991 Act; this provided that the Act amendments applied to the termination of relevant contracts occurring on or after the commencement of the amendment (that is 1 August 1994) whether the head contract of carriage was entered into before or after that commencement.

It followed that the regime established by the 1994 Act did not apply to the contractors' contracts with Woolworths, or the consequences of their termination in April 1994.

When the 1996 Act commenced, it included in Ch 6 a Pt 7 which reproduced the
Pt 5A which the 1994 Act had inserted in Ch 6 of the 1991 Act. Clause 38 of
Sch 4 of the 1996 Act was a transitional provision saying that Pt 7 of Ch 6 applied to the termination of relevant contracts occurring on or after 1
August 1994, "being the commencement of the predecessor of that Part enacted by" the 1994 Act and similarly so applied "whether the head contract of carriage was entered into before or after that date".

Thus, so far as concerns the contractors in the present case, the situation remained the same after the commencement of the 1996 Act as it had been under the 1994 Act.

The 1996 Act commenced on 2 September 1996. Section 106 was the successor to s in the 1991 Act.

By a summons for relief under <case> filed by the contractors on 4 June 1997 they claimed relief in respect of the grievances earlier mentioned. The relief claimed included declarations and variations of their contracts terminated in and orders for payments of money. The summons was entitled "Before the
Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales in Court Session".

In the contractors' summons proceedings Woolworths filed a notice of motion on August 1997 seeking that the contractors' summons be either struck out or stayed.

The grounds for seeking the striking out of the summons were said to be that under the 1996 Act only the Contract of Carriage Tribunal could hear the contractors' claims and that the Commission had no power to deal with such claims under <case>.

The alternative application for a stay was based on the delay of the contractors in commencing their proceedings.

On 24 November 1997 Peterson J dismissed Woolworths' notice of motion leaving the contractors to go forward with their summons proceedings.

In his reasons on the jurisdiction point, Peterson J pointed out that the effect of the submission made for Woolworths would be that parties in the position of the contractors would have lost rights to make claims under <case> of the 1991 Act upon the commencement of the 1994 Act. Persons wishing to pursue such claims could do so in respect of contracts terminated after 1
August 1994 in the Contract of Carriage Tribunal, but persons whose contracts had been terminated before 1 August 1994 and had had until that date the right to pursue their claims pursuant to <case> of the 1991 Act, would have lost those rights. He said it would seem extraordinary to him to read the 1994 Act as curtailing a jurisdiction available since 1959 (s 275 was the successor of s 88F inserted in the Industrial Arbitration Act in 1959). He said it would be to remove rights without any declaration anywhere of an intention so to do. He was not prepared to give the 1994 Act the retrospective operation necessary for Woolworths' submission to succeed.

On 12 December 1997 Woolworths filed an application for leave to appeal and appeal against Peterson J's decision.

The Full Bench of the Commission heard and decided Woolworths' application on June 1998. Hill J delivered the unanimous judgment of the court.

The court first dismissed the application for leave to appeal against Peterson
J's decision not to grant the stay sought by Woolworths on the ground of delay. That was said to be a matter within Peterson J's discretion with which the Full Bench would not interfere.

The reasons then proceeded: "The other challenges to the decision involve question of statutory interpretation and in respect of them we grant leave to appeal. However, we have formed the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant's primary argument is that Pt 7, Ch 6 of the Act makes special provision in relation to claims for compensation in respect of terminations of head contracts of carriage on the grounds that they are unfair, harsh or unconscionable; and those provisions operate to the exclusion of Pt 9 - Unfair contracts - Ch 2 of the Act, at least in the circumstances of this case.

Mr Hatcher of counsel for the appellant argued that cl 38 of Sch 4 - Savings, transitional and other provisions - to the 1996 Act operates to deprive the respondents of the rights to bring any action under <case> in the circumstances of this case because the remedy in the said Pt 7, Ch 6 is exclusive. That clause provides: 
Part 7 of Chapter 6 applies to the termination of a head contract of carriage that occurs on or after 1 August 1994 (being the commencement of the predecessor of that Part enacted by the Industrial Relations (Contracts of
Carriage) Amendment Act 1994), and so applies whether the head contract of carriage was entered into before or after that date.

Counsel submitted that the Industrial Relations (Contracts of Carriage)
Amendment Act 1994 (the 1994 Act), which enacted the precursor provisions of
Pt 7, Ch 6, also extinguished any right to bring a similar claim under <case>, the unfair contracts provisions, of the Industrial Relations Act 1991.

In our opinion neither the said cl 38, Sch 4 nor the provisions of the 1994
Act express any clear intention to operate retrospectively in respect of head contracts of carriage which were terminated prior to 1 August 1994.
Accordingly, even if the provisions of and the remedies granted by the 1994
Act and Pt 7, Ch 6 of the 1996 Act respectively, were intended to operate to the exclusion of the unfair contracts provisions of the 1991 Act and the 1996
Act, and we are far from convinced that they do, nevertheless the claims or causes of action in these cases are not caught by the provisions of Pt 7, Ch 6 of the 1996 Act because they relate to matters or rights which arose prior to the relevant date prescribed by cl 38, Sch 4, namely, 1 August 1994." 
The appeal was then dismissed with costs.

Then on 11 August 1998 Woolworths, as earlier mentioned, filed a summons in this court seeking relief in the nature of prohibition and (on 24 August 1998) the contractors filed a notice of motion seeking dismissal of Woolworths' summons on the ground that <case> of the 1996 Act deprived this court of any jurisdiction to consider Woolworths' claim for relief.

Section 187 of the 1996 Act gave Woolworths the right to appeal to a Full
Bench of the Commission against a decision of a single member of the
Commission. Section 188 provided that the appeal to the Full Bench could be made only with leave of the Full Bench. Section 191 provided that an appeal to the Full Bench was not by way of a new hearing and was to be determined on the evidence and material produced in relation to the decision appealed against, this position however being subject to the possibility of the Full Bench granting leave for further evidence to be put before it. Section 191 further provided that in determining an appeal it could not merely substitute its own decision on the matter, but had to follow the principles applied to appeals from discretionary decisions.

Section 179 of the 1996 Act is as follows: "(1) Subject to the exercise of a right of appeal to a Full Bench of the
Commission conferred by this or any other Act or law, a decision or purported decision of the Commission (however constituted): is final, and may not be appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question by any court or tribunal (whether on an issue of fact, law, jurisdiction or otherwise), 
A judgment or order that, but for this section, might be given or made in order to grant a relief or remedy (whether by order in the nature of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus, by injunction or declaration or otherwise) may not be given or made in relation to a decision or purported decision of the Commission, however constituted.

To avoid doubt, this section extends to any decision or purported decision of the Commission, including an award or order of the Commission." 
In reliance on <case> counsel for the contractors submitted that this court had no jurisdiction to embark upon consideration of the Full Bench's decision of June 1998.

Woolworths' opposing submissions were: (i) Peterson J had been wrong in his decision. On the proper construction of the relation between Ch 6 Pt 7 of the Act and <case>, the Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the contractors' claims; (ii) therefore the Full Bench was acting in excess of jurisdiction in holding, like Peterson J, that the Commission did have jurisdiction to entertain the contractors' claims; (iii) the privative effect of <case> could not extend to preventing this court from saying that the
Commission lacked jurisdiction to entertain the contractors' <case> claims.

I do not think it is necessary for this court to decide in these proceedings whether the contractors' very wide ranging submission about the effect of s should be accepted. For myself, I doubt whether it is possible for any tribunal to be established by the New South Wales Parliament whose orders, or purported orders, if made beyond any power to make them, would not be subject to the power of the Supreme Court of the State to declare them of no legal effect and to authorise steps to be taken to prevent any legal use of them.
However, it is not in my opinion necessary to decide that question in this case, because it can be decided on a much simpler ground.

Section 152 of the 1996 Act makes the Commission in Court Session a superior court of record.

Section 175 gives it extensive powers of interpretation: "The Commission may, for the purpose of exercising its functions in connection with a matter before it, determine any question concerning the interpretation, application or operation of any relevant law or instrument (including the industrial relations legislation and any industrial instrument)." 
Whether or not Peterson J and the Full Bench were right in their construction of the sections in question in this case, (and although I do not need to decide the point, as at present advised I have no reason for thinking they were wrong) the issue before them, namely whether the Commission in Court
Session (see <case>(c)) could entertain the contractors' claims under <case> against Woolworths, was one they were bound to decide in the ordinary exercise of the Commission's jurisdiction.

The powers given to the Commission by the 1996 Act in exercising jurisdiction as a superior court of record are quite different in this respect from those given to the Local Reference Board whose decision was called in question in
The King versus Hickman; ex parte Fox and Clinton <case>; [(1945) 70 CLR 598] and quashed by the High Court in that case. When the extent of the powers of the Commission pursuant to the 1996 Act is surveyed, it seems to me impossible to suppose that the Commission in Court Session whether constituted by one member or a Full Bench could or should have declined to decide the question raised before it whether the contractors could litigate their claims against Woolworths under <case>.

The answer to the argument put by Woolworths therefore is that the proposition that the Commission was acting beyond jurisdiction in making the decision that it did is incorrect; the jurisdiction was there, and so long as the jurisdiction was exercised, whether or not an error of law was committed along the way, <case> made the decision final and not subject to review in this court.

Even if I am wrong in my understanding of the provisions in the 1996 Act which give the Commission in Court Session its powers, and if the right view were that it was subject to the same limitations as the Local Reference Board in
Hickman, I would still be of the opinion that this court is not empowered to embark upon a consideration of the rightness of wrongness of its decision.
This is because, to adapt the words of Dixon J in Hickman (at 617) the decisions of the Commission in the present proceedings do not upon their face exceed the Commission's authority, they amount to a bona fide attempt to exercise the powers of the Commission and they relate to the subject matter of the 1996 Act.

My opinion therefore is that the argument put for the contractors in support of the notice of motion is correct, and the order sought in that notice of motion should be made, that is, Woolworths' summons filed on 11 August 1998, as amended, should be dismissed with costs.

SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment in draft of Priestley JA with which I agree.
