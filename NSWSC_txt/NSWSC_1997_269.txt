Morris versus Welling & Ors /95 July 1997 
Master Malpass 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division /95 - Morris versus Welling & Ors 
JUDGMENT 
MASTER: A motor vehicle accident took place on 4 April 1994. There was a collision between a motor vehicle driven by the late Robert Leslie Morris (the deceased) and a motor vehicle being driven by Antonius Gerhardus Welling (the first defendant). This vehicle was jointly owned by the first defendant and Petronella Welling (the second defendant). The accident took place near Cumnock. Cabonne Shire Council (the third defendant) is the local authority having the responsibility for certain roadways in that area. 
Pauline Antuanette Morris (the plaintiff) and her three children were passengers in the vehicle driven by the deceased. The deceased was killed in the accident.

The plaintiff has commenced two proceedings. There were proceedings in the
District Court brought against Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited (the third cross-defendant). In those proceedings, she claimed damages for personal injury (including nervous shock). The claim was founded on an allegation of negligence on the part of the deceased. Those proceedings were resolved by compromise between the parties. There are these proceedings in the
Supreme Court. They have been brought against the first defendant, the second defendant and the third defendant. In these proceedings, she propounds a claim under the Compensation to Relatives Act, 1897 (the CTR Act) on behalf of herself and the children. The process also purports to propound a claim for nervous shock.

These proceedings are defended by all defendants. Each of them has raised an issue that any loss or damage was caused by the deceased's fault or contributory negligence.

Three Cross-Claims have been brought in these proceedings. The Third Cross-
Claim is brought by the third defendant against the third cross-defendant. An
Amended Third Cross-Claim was filed on 23 June 1997 (the Third Cross-Claim).
The third cross-defendant is sued as the insurer of the deceased under the
Motor Accidents Act, 1988 (the MA Act). I assume that it relies on the provisions of section 54. The process contains, inter alia, the following:- "13. The Third Cross Defendant says that any injury, loss and damage sustained by the Plaintiff was caused by the negligence of the deceased, for which the
Third Cross Defendant is liable.
 ...
And the Third Cross Claimant claims:- 
In the event the Third Cross Claimant is held liable to the Plaintiff, then the Third Cross Claimant claims an order for contribution from the Third
Cross Defendant in respect of any such liability which it is held to have to the Plaintiff for such amount as may be found by the Court to be just and equitable pursuant to [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/)." 
The third cross-defendant has filed a Notice of Motion. It seeks the striking out of the Amended Third Cross-Claim on the basis that it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action.

At this point, I should briefly digress to mention certain matters relating to the nervous shock component of the claim made in these proceedings. The plaintiff does not have locus standi to bring such a claim on behalf of the children. She has herself obtained judgment in the District Court for the claim made on her own behalf in respect of nervous shock. I am informed from the bar table that steps are being taken to effect summary disposition of that component of the claim.

Legal argument has seen reference being made to various statutory provisions and to certain decided cases. There has been reference to the provisions of [section (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), 1946 (the 1946 Act), the provisions of section 10(4) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), 1965 (the 1965 Act) and to provisions (sections 74-77) of the MA Act. There has been reference to Anderson versus Liddy & Anor <case>; [49 SR 320], General Steel Industries Inc versus Commissioner For Railways <case>; [(1964) 112 CLR 125],
Thompson versus Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd <case>; [(1996) 71 ALJR 131] and Commonwealth of Australia versus Flaviano & Anor <case>; [(1996) 40 NSWLR 199.] 
The third cross-defendant has made various submissions. The principal contention is that the Third Cross-Claim is not maintainable because it does not satisfy the requirements of section 5(1)(c).

Before dealing with this contention, it is perhaps convenient to look first at the matters relied on by the third defendant in opposition to the application.

A summary of the third defendant's submissions has been reduced to writing as follows:- "1. By section 74(1) the common law and enacted law in relation to contributory negligence are preserved. Subsection (2)(a) requires a finding of contributory negligence to be made in the circumstances where certain offences have been committed. Subsections (b)(c)(d) require a finding of contributory negligence in the circumstances described.
Section 75 purports to in effect allow damages to be reduced by the contributory negligence of the deceased person. On its face it nullifies the operation of [s10(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1965404/s10.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1965404/) in so far as that section prevented damages being reduced by reason of contributory negligence.
The difficulty arises because, on one view, there is a direct conflict in the legislation. On the one hand the common law and enacted law is specifically preserved on the other, the enacted law is not preserved because of the provision of s75.
It may be that the section can be reconciled on the basis that s75 means that not withstanding s10(4) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provision) Act, a reduction can be made for contributory negligence in accordance with the requirements of s74.
However, if the plaintiff is able to argue that her damages should not be reduced by reason of any contributory negligence of the deceased, the Cross
Claimant, Council is potentially left with the total liability and unable to claim contribution from the Cross defendant AAMI, the deceased's insurer.
In this sense this is a real issue of law that may need to be determined and therefore not one that can be struck out. (General Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways) <case>; [112 CLR 125] at .
The deceased is a joint tort-feasor as explained by the High Court in
Thompson versus ACTV Pty Ltd <case>; [71
ALJR 131] at 132.
Therefore subject to resolution of the statutory argument referred to above is potentially able to claim contribution from the deceased's insurer pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1946.
Any question of a contribution must be left to the trial judge to determine." 
I should now refer to certain of the statutory provisions which have been mentioned in these submissions and during argument.

The plaintiff's claim under the CTR Act is made maintainable by reason of the provisions of section 3(1) thereof. The provisions enable the maintaining of the action notwithstanding the death of the person injured whensoever the death of that person is caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default. It is an action for the benefit of certain relations of the deceased and enables the recovery of "such damages", "proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the parties" for whose benefit it has been brought. The damages are to be assessed having regard to the provisions of section 3.

Prior to the enactment of the 1965 Act, an action under the CTR Act failed if the deceased was found to be guilty of contributory negligence. Section (4) of the 1965 Act provided as follows:- 
No action for damages for the benefit of dependants of a deceased person under the Compensation to Relatives Act, 1897-1953, shall be defeated by the fault or breach of statutory duty of the deceased person nor shall the damages recoverable in such action be reduced by reason of such fault or of such breach of statutory duty.

This provision was part of a scheme introduced to amend the doctrine of contributory negligence.

This position was altered when the MA Act came into force. Sections 74 and may be found in Part 6 (Awarding of Damages). Save as to the exceptions provided therein, section 74 stipulates that the common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence apply to claims in respect of motor accidents.
Section 75 provides as follows:- [Section 10(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1965404/s10.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1965404/) does not apply so as to prevent the reduction of damages by the contributory negligence of a deceased person in respect of an action for damages where the death of the deceased person was caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle. 
Whilst the MA Act has its shortcomings in draftsmanship, it seems to me that sections 74 and 75 of the MA Act can be read together. Where the death of the deceased person was caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle, the sections operate to allow the reduction of damages by the contributory negligence of the deceased person, in cases where a claim is made under the CTR Act. I do not consider that these statutory provisions throw up any real question of law which is relevant to the determination of this application.

In any event, these submissions do not deal with the real problem which confronts the third defendant. This is the matter which has been identified as the principal contention advanced on behalf of the third cross-defendant.

Section 5(1)(c) of the 1946 Act is in the following terms:- (1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) - ...
 any tort-feasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tort-feasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tort-feasor or otherwise, so, however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by that person in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought.

The Third Cross-Claim is only maintainable if it falls within the parameters of section 5(1)(c) of the 1946 Act. In my view, it clearly does not. This follows from the language of the section itself and from what has been said in the decided cases. The deceased cannot be said to be a tortfeasor "liable in respect of the same damage". Contribution can only be recovered from one who "is, or would if sued have been, liable" to pay damages to the person injured (see Unsworth versus Commissioner for Railways <case>; [(1958) 107 CLR 73] at 87 and Flaviano at p 201).

I am satisfied that the Third Cross-Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. Therefore, I order that the Third Cross-Claim be struck out. The third cross-claimant is to pay the costs of the Third Cross-Claim.
