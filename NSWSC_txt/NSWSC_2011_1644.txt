EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT 
In this matter, I note that the parties have agreed in principle, and subject to the approval of the Court pursuant to [s 76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s76.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), to resolve the matter. 
The claim arises from the birth of the plaintiff Samantha Gerrard on 20 July 1988 at the Royal Hospital for Women, in Sydney. As a consequence of the birth Samantha has been severely disabled and is diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. 
Samantha presently lives with her mother and two siblings in Queensland. Her care is undertaken by both her mother and her father, although they are presently separated. 
From time to time they have been assisted in this monumental undertaking by the provision of assistance from external agencies. However, the great bulk of the care Samantha has been undertaken by her mother. 
Samantha is profoundly disabled. She is incapable of working. She is unable to care for herself. She requires constant supervision. 
The proceedings were listed for hearing for a three week period commencing 21 November 2011 in this Court. As part of the ordinary processes of the preparation for trial, there had been joint meetings of expert neonatologists and also of expert obstetricians. 
These meetings have produced a joint report which considerably narrowed the issues in dispute. However, each of those joint reports whilst narrowing the issues in dispute, made plain that there was significant dispute between the parties as to what had happened in July 1988 and what the appropriate course of obstetric care was that should have been followed. 
It is clear to me from the reading of those joint reports and the other medical reports to which I have had access that there was a real issue in the proceedings as to whether the plaintiff would have succeeded or not. It is not possible for me to express any view on that question other than to note that there was a significant dispute on the question of liability. 
As well, although the plaintiff is profoundly disabled, a significant issue arose on the question of damages as to what in the future would be the most likely course undertaken for her care and what would be the reasonable course undertaken for her care. Of the two choices available to the Court, there would result in a difference in damages of a significant sum of money. Accordingly whilst it is often easy for damages to be calculated in cases such as this, there nevertheless remained an issue which may affect the ultimate sum of damages which the plaintiff recovered. 
In all of those circumstances and particularly having regard to the written advice of senior and junior counsel for the plaintiff which I have carefully read, I am prepared to approve, pursuant to [s 76(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s76.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), the settlement of the matter in accordance with the Terms of Settlement executed by the parties dated 17 November 2011, which I will initial and place with the papers. It will necessary to make formal orders giving effect to this settlement.
