Clarke JA, Handley JA, Cole JA 
CATCHWORDS: LIMITATION OF ACTIONS - extension of time under [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) [s 60I.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Ex tempore 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Dismissed 
The plaintiff who suffered from industrial deafness had been employed continuously by the defendant since 1971. He applied for an extension of time under [s 60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) G of the [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). The trial judge found on the facts that the plaintiff had not satisfied the provisions of [s 60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) of the Act and refused the application. The appellant contended that the trial judge had misunderstood or misapplied [s 60I(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) with respect to the 3-year period therein relevant to cl 4(4)(a) of Sch 5 of the Act.

HELD, dismissing the appeal: No error had been established.
 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an appeal by leave of this Court granted on 28 August 1995 from a decision of McDevitt DCJ refusing an application by the appellant for an extension of the limitation period under [s 60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) of the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) in an industrial deafness case.

The plaintiff has been employed by the defendant continuously since 1971. His
Honour was not satisfied on the facts that the plaintiff had brought himself within the provisions of [s
I(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) of the Act. This was a necessary pre-condition in this case for the making of any order extending the limitation period, the application having been made on May 1995.

Mr Robison did not directly challenge the primary Judge's findings of fact on those matters, but submitted that his Honour's approach had miscarried because he had misunderstood or misapplied [s
I(1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) 
It seems to me that his Honour was correct in his interpretation of [s
I(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html), and that the plaintiff did have to bring his case within the 3 year period therein referred to, which was relevant because of cl 4(4)(a) in the 5th
Schedule.

This being the only error asserted against the decision, I am satisfied that the appeal should fail, and I would propose that it be dismissed with costs.

CLARKE JA: I agree. On the trial Judge's findings of fact, it seems to me that the appeal was doomed to failure from the start.

COLE JA: I also agree.

CLARKE JA: The order of the Court will be the appeal is dismissed with costs.
