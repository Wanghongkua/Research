THURSDAY, 27 NOVEMBER 2003  /03 ABRUZZI SPORTS CLUB LIMITED (ADMINISTRATOR APPOINTED) - APPLICATION OF ANTONY DE VRIES AND RIAD TAYEH  
JUDGMENT   HIS HONOUR: This is an application under [ss
A(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) and [447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the CA"). The company under administration is cash poor but asset rich in that it owns a piece of land worth some $7.5 million, which is in excess of the amount necessary to pay all its debts. The convening period under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) of the CA expires next Monday, 1 December 2003. The administrators have been unable to gather all the material necessary to formulate a proper proposal for the disposal of the whole or part of the property to meet the company's debts.
That is understandable in light of the nature and value of the property. It is important that it be disposed of to best advantage. The situation is complicated by the existence of possible options other than outright sale, including subdivision of the land, the retention of part for the Club's purposes, and the disposal of the rest to pay its debts.  Christmas is approaching. It would be best if consideration of the proposal formulated did not fall to be given in the immediate Christmas/New Year period. The extension for a period of time of the convening period, namely, to March 2004 is asked for, but the comparatively long period sought is ameliorated by the second part of the application. The second part of the application is that I make an order under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the CA permitting the meeting to be held, not in the five days after the expiry of the extended convening period, which the terms of the statute would otherwise compel, but to be brought forward and held earlier, if a scheme for consideration is formulated and can be considered at an earlier point of time.
The powers under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) are very wide: see Australasian Memory Pty Ltd versus Brien [(2000) 200 CLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282000%29%20200%20CLR%20270 "View LawCiteRecord" ). Furthermore, the section has been used in exactly the way now proposed by Lindgren J in the Federal Court in Re Daiseytek Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [(2003) 45 ACSR 446.]  The position of the secured creditor has been protected by agreement with the administrators that the secured creditor, a bank holding a mortgage over the property, should continue at liberty to appoint a receiver if so advised.
In the circumstances I am persuaded that both applications should be granted, and I shall make orders accordingly.
