EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
The proceedings were commenced by summons in February 2006, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, who deposed to his suspicions that the defendant Jason David Tillot had engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely demanding property with intent to steal contrary to [s 99(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s99.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) , for reasons there explained. 
In February 2006 restraining and other orders were made by James J under <case> and [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) , in respect of Mr Tillott's interests in certain property.
The parties now ask the Court to make a further order dismissing the application for a proceeds assessment order by consent, Mr Tillot having warranted that his only interests in property as at the date of signing the orders were those specified in the schedule to the order.
Having considered the terms of the order sought and the circumstances in which they are pursued, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms which the parties have agreed. 
Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, with the result that the restraining order no longer remains in force and the proceeding are brought to an end.
