JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for a proceeds assessment order under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act. 
Under [s 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html), the Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit by an authorised officer identifying that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime-related activity, that the authorised officer has a suspicion on reasonable grounds that the Defendant has so engaged and that the property sought to be restrained is illegally acquired property. 
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 July 2014. He deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity, that being the supply of a prohibited drug of an amount greater than the commercial quantity contrary to <case> of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1990 . That is an offence defined as a serious criminal offence pursuant to [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). 
Mr Spark deposes to an email exchange with the police officer responsible for preparing the statement of facts concerning the Defendant's offending. The police officer confirmed in answer to Mr Spark's questions that he had prepared the contents of the facts sheet or was familiar with them, that the contents of the facts sheet were true, and that the sheet was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described. 
The information in the facts sheet satisfies me that Mr Spark's suspicion is held on reasonable grounds. 
One of the items of property was a piece of real estate at 2 St Simon Close, Blair Athol owned entirely by the Defendant. Inquiries demonstrated that a contract for sale was entered into for that property on 23 June 2014. In ordinary circumstances, the purchaser of that property would have an interest in the outcome of this application. However, the purchaser's interest has, in my opinion, been satisfactorily met by the form of the orders proposed. The intention is that sale will be allowed to proceed in the ordinary course, but that the proceeds of sale after the deduction of certain stipulated matters which may be summarised as the amounts necessary to discharge encumbrances on the property and the costs and expenses associated with the sale, will thereafter be restrained. 
The Court is also required to consider whether notice should be given to the Defendant for the making of the application. I note what Mr Spark says in his affidavit concerning the speed with which property may be disposed of. Mr Spark has long experience in the area and I accept that evidence. I consider it is appropriate that no notice should be given to the Defendant. The Defendant in any event, has his rights for a review under <case> of the Act. 
On the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking, and I note that it has been given, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 11 of the draft order. * * *
