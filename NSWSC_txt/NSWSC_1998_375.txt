Miskell versus Green and Anor Matter No 1034/97 [1998] NSWSC 375 (14 August )

Last Updated: 29 September 1998 `NINA MAUDE MISKELL versus MELVA PHILLIS GREEN & ANOR` `1034/97` `14 August 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT `HIS HONOUR: This is a motion to strike out the statement of claim or alternatively for security for costs.` ` The proceedings are brought by the plaintiff, who is the mother of the first defendant and mother-in-law of the second defendant. In 1986, according to the statement of claim, the plaintiff used $23,200 to effect improvements to the defendants' property by adding two rooms at the back. The parties lived together from 1986 to March 1995. The plaintiff says in her claim that she was forced to move out of the property as a result of the defendants' treatment of her. The defendants deny this, in the sense that they do not deny that she left, but they say that she left of her own accord, and in any event they were glad to see her go.` ` The plaintiff says that she is now living in a flat provided largely by her other children and it would be unconscionable for the defendants to retain the benefit of the improvements to their property, and that she is entitled to an equitable charge over that property in the sum of $23,200. The plaintiff makes two alternative claims either for a part interest in that property or damages in equity of $23,200.` ` The plaintiff has been given legal aid. The defendants have not secured legal aid. The effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laca1979183/s47.html) of the [Legal Aid Commission Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laca1979183/) is that successful parties to proceedings may not obtain more than $12,500 in costs against a legally aided person.` ` The defendants bring this motion saying that to allow the matter to proceed would be to countenance an abuse of process. Mr Haffenden for the defendants says that the classes of what is an abuse of process can never be closed and that in present day New South Wales to allow a legally aided person to mount proceedings where the defendants' costs would be between $25-35,000, where their maximum recovery would be $12,500, over a claim placed at $23,200 plus interest, would be to allow the plaintiff to abuse the processes of the court.
He referred to Walton versus Gardiner <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 378], 394 where the High Court indicated that, basically, the principles of abuse of process in civil cases are much the same as those applied in criminal cases. The court is master over its process and possesses the necessary power to prevent its processes being employed in a manner which gives rise to unfairness.` ` That financial matters may come into account when making this assessment is now quite clear. Spigelman CJ, although in a dissenting judgment, said recently in James Hardie Industries Pty Ltd versus Grigor, Court of Appeal, 18
June 1998, as yet unreported, at pp 36-37, that one must as a policy matter pay regard to the limited resources available to the administration of justice in New South Wales.` ` The evidence of the valuer Mr Densmore is that even though the costs of the extension were $23,000 in 1986, that extension overcapitalised the property and the net advantage obtained by the defendants by having their property improved was about $8,500. Mr Densmore also assessed the rent that a person would have had to pay for the rooms occupied by the plaintiff, which she occupied for a period of nine years, at $55 a week.` ` Mr Haffenden says that when one looks at that sort of evidence one can see that the defendants have not been unjustly enriched at all and so there is nothing against their conscience.` ` Miss Needham for the plaintiff says that one should not look at that sort of evidence at this stage, that is really usurping the role of the trial Judge, and it is also impermissible to set off against the capital sum the amount of "rent" for use of the property in a family situation. She points to the fact that in the seminal cases of Morris versus Morris [[1982] 1 NSWLR 61] and
Malsbury versus Malsbury [[1982] 1 NSWLR 226] the appropriate order is either a constructive trust for a proportionate amount of the plaintiff's contribution, or an equitable charge.` ` However, those two cases were the sowing of the seed of the present principle in this class of case. Since then a more refined view has been taken of the remedy and currently the view is that the minimum equity should be awarded to cleanse the defendants' conscience; see Nichols versus Nichols BPR 9240, 9245-6. However, it should be stated that there are other views that in fact the plaintiff may be entitled to an order fulfilling her expectation. See, for instance, the decisions referred to in Parkinson's
Principles of Equity (LBC, Sydney, 1996) p 227. As to this Mr Haffenden makes the point that the case is not pleaded that way.` ` The plaintiff has come into Equity and she is seeking equitable relief.
There is nowhere in her statement of claim any offer to do equity. One might think that that makes the whole claim demurrable and one that could not succeed. Miss Needham makes the point that Mr Haffenden has never pleaded that. However, it is relevant that even if the point is not a demurrer point the court would not give the plaintiff any relief unless the plaintiff submitted to an order in the final suit that she do equity.` ` Thus, if the plaintiff succeeded she would be subject to an order that her equitable charge would be subject to her bearing the proper expenses. Those expenses might involve the costs of the defendants, insofar as the defendants obtained orders for costs.` ` However, the problem would be that if the plaintiff fails then no such conditional order could be made against her and the defendants would not be able to recoup their costs except to the extent of $12,500.` ` The case is in my expedition list because the plaintiff is eighty-two and there is some evidence that whilst she does not have any health problems at the moment those could develop. The defendants are also receiving benefits and are in their early sixties. The plaintiff says that her current income is $195 a week from her pension, plus her husband's superannuation and that pretty well all of this is expended on daily living. She does not have any surplus funds and has no assets.` ` The female defendant is a person on the age pension. She has, apart from the subject property which is valued at $145,000, a joint interest with her husband in a car worth approximately $500, a half share in the furniture and about $41,000 in the bank. She had hoped to use that for medical treatment.
The male defendant is sixty-six. He has a superannuation fund valued at $35,000 which has been rolled over, and is living off a job search allowance.` ` When the case was in my expedition list I was told the case would take two days plus, maybe as much as four days, and that the plaintiff desired that it be heard in Bathurst where everybody, except counsel, live or practice (treating Orange for this purpose as the City of Greater Bathurst). The defendants have resisted this on the basis that it will increase the costs.
Miss Needham says it will in fact reduce them. I cannot make an assessment of that at the moment.` ` However, wherever the matter is heard, it will mean that if the plaintiff fails the defendants will have a legal bill of something like $30,000. That bill will have to be defrayed, apart from the $12,500 which is the maximum contribution which will come in from legal aid, from the small savings they have or by selling the house, or mortgaging it.` ` Under those circumstances most commercial people might take the view that they have got no alternative but to give in to the plaintiff's claim because they just cannot afford to fight the case.` ` There was a suggestion that I made that the case might be able to be tried on affidavits without cross-examination so that it could be dealt with in about the same time as this present motion has taken to try. The plaintiff will not agree with that, and I cannot force it on people. The plaintiff says that she would be prepared to have cross-examination of the major players, which might reduce the hearing of the case to just over a day. That would be of some advantage, but really would not remove the detriments.` ` I believe that the court, when considering whether to continue process is unfair, must take into account practical matters such as the effect of legal aid.` ` Miss Needham says that this is not so. She says that the legislature has deliberately passed the [Legal Aid Commission Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laca1979183/) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laca1979183/s47.html) to make sure that people without means can get justice and have just claims vindicated. That is correct so far as it goes. It may be that the legislature thought that there would be sufficient resources to stop problems such as the present occurring by giving both the plaintiff and the defendants legal aid where they are all receiving government benefits, or alternatively giving neither side legal aid, so that there would be no advantage or disadvantage to either side. If that were the situation it has not occurred in the present case because, whether for policy reasons or because of the merits, the defendants' application for legal aid, to quote the advice from the Legal Aid
Commission "has been carefully considered and refused".` ` Essentially then the Legal Aid Commission has decided this case. On what grounds no-one knows because, as I have said, two pensioners, whose house is on the line, just cannot afford to resist, and they may very well have good grounds for resisting the claim made by another pensioner who has attracted legal aid.` ` I cannot in any way interfere with the legal aid system, as witnessed in the recent High Court case involving the Victorian Legal Aid Department: Re JJT and Others; Ex parte Victoria Legal Aid <case>; [(1998) 155 ALR 251.] However, if a plaintiff does take advantage of legal aid and legal aid operates so that there cannot be a fair trial of persons meeting on equal footing, then that leads to unfairness. It is the court's duty to make sure that there is a fair trial and if a fair trial cannot be obtained, then the court has to make orders and do the best it can to see that there is either a fair trial or no trial.` ` The motion seeks in the alternative the dismissal of the provision of security for costs in the sum of $37,800. This claim is resisted by Miss
Needham. Certainly the plaintiff does not offer to provide any security for costs. Mr Haffenden relies on the decision of Holland J and the Court of
Appeal in Rajski versus Computer Manufacture & Design Pty Ltd [[1982] 2 NSWLR (Holland] J) and [[1983] 2 NSWLR 122 (CA)] for the proposition that the court can grant an order for the security for costs against a legally aided person. I am, of course, bound by that authority.
However, there is no purpose in making an order for security for costs because in a case where there is no other plaintiff and where [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laca1979183/s47.html) of the [Legal Aid Commission Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laca1979183/) does not apply, as the maximum liability paid by the Commission is $12,500, the provision of any security for costs achieves absolutely nothing.` ` Miss Needham puts other reasons why there should not be security for costs, such as the plaintiff is an individual and the matter does not fall within any of the heads in Pt 53 of the Supreme Court Rules, but I need not do more than note those submissions because I am of the view that ordering security for costs could achieve no purpose and, accordingly, should not be done.` ` Accordingly, the case comes down to one of either stay or no stay, or dismissal or no dismissal.` ` Miss Needham points to the well trodden path of authority that courts do not dismiss claims lightly and that a plaintiff is entitled to have her case heard by a court, even though the court might have grave suspicions as to its prospect of success. However, what is not often said in court, because it does not arise very often, but does in this case, is that the court must also make sure that the defendant has the opportunity of defending himself or herself if there is even the suspicion of a viable defence.` ` In the present case it would seem that the issues in the long run are going to be whether the defendants drove the plaintiff out of the house, or whether the plaintiff was the cause of the problems, and whether in the circumstances that are found the defendants should make any compensation to the plaintiff.
It is not really possible to try those matters in the present economic situation between them.` ` I do not consider I should dismiss the proceedings at this stage because it may be that other children of the plaintiff, who may well benefit from her estate in due course, or some other person may be prepared to enter into some sort of deed of guarantee in favour of the defendants. Again, it may be, even at this stage, that the Legal Aid Commission will take into account factors it has not yet already considered and may reach the view that I have, that its decision has put the court in an intolerable position so far as administration of justice is concerned.` ` Accordingly, until further order I will stay the proceedings. The plaintiff should pay the costs of this motion.` ` Whilst I have said that this is until further order, my present view is that the practical probabilities are that something will happen in the next couple of months to enable the matter to proceed or be settled. If not, on the first day of next term I may well, if asked, be tempted to dismiss the proceedings.
