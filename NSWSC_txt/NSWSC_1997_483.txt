MULTICON ENGINEERING PTY LTD v FEDERAL AIRPORTS FEDERATION 
STATE COURT EXERCISING FEDERAL JURISDICTION - PART 72 SUPREME COURT RULES - ADOPTION OF REFEREES REPORT - Upon the application of the appellant, and over the objection of the respondent, a reference was made under Pt 72 of the Supreme Court Rules of proceedings commenced under the [Trade Practices
Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth).
The referee made a report finding for the respondent. On the application of the respondent, and pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p72) r 13, the trial judge substantially adopted the referee's report. The appellant, by a notice of appeal containing 81 grounds, sought a new trial consequent upon the adoption of the report.

On appeal: The hearing of the appeal was in its first stage confined to grounds 31 and 32 and to two notices of motion by which the applicant sought to substitute for new grounds 31-32A for original grounds 31-32. On the basis of the reformulated grounds: the appellant submitted that Chapter III of the Commonwealth [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) precluded the application of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72) r 13(1)(a), as expounded in Super Pty Ltd versus SJP Formwork (Aust) Pty Ltd [(1992) 29 NSWLR 549], by a State court when exercising Federal jurisdiction (the constitutional question); and the respondent submitted that as the appellant had itself sought and obtained the order referring the proceedings to the referee, and, the appellant had not raised the constitutional question prior to the appeal, it was not entitled to rely on the constitutional question (the procedural objection).

Held:
It was not necessary to determine the constitutional question.
It would not be in the interests of justice to permit the appellant to argue the constitutional question on appeal in circumstances where that argument is contrary to the stance it had adopted at all stages in the trial.

ORDERS . Appellant given leave to amend its notice of appeal by substituting the new grounds 31-32A for the original grounds 31-32. 
So much of the appeal as relates to grounds 31-32A dismissed with costs.

MULTICON ENGINEERING PTY LTD versus FEDERAL AIRPORTS FEDERATION 
JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Mason P and with his Honour's reasons for those orders. I would make the following further observations. 
The history of the use by the English courts, as a special mode of trial, of the procedure of sending matters, or issues, to a referee was examined in the judgments of Stephen J and Jacobs J in Buckley versus Bennell Design &
Constructions Pty Ltd [(1978) 14O CLR 1.] Under the
Judicature Act 1873 , the report of a referee was deemed to be equivalent to the verdict of a jury. In 1892 New South Wales made statutory provision for references under orders of the court. It was modelled on the English legislation.

As was pointed out in Super Pty Ltd versus SJP Formwork (Aust) Pty Ltd [(1992) 29
NSWLR 549] at 559, the High Court, in Buckley, took the view that greater use of the procedure of references to arbitrators or referees was to be encouraged. Jacobs J expressed the hope that new rules of court would be promulgated to this end.

The [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) was amended to insert [s124(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s124.html), which empowered the making of rules to provide for references to an arbitrator or referee, and to deal with the manner in, and extent to, which, a determination or report may be called in question. Pursuant to [s124(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s124.html), the present Part 72 of the Supreme Court Rules was promulgated.

This case provides a typical example of the use which the Court makes of Part
It is a building case, involving complex technical issues. Upon the application of MCE, and over the opposition of FAC, Giles J referred the case to Mr A A de Fina, a consulting engineer. After a long hearing, the referee made a report. Subject to one presently immaterial qualification, Rolfe J, after hearing further lengthy argument from the parties, adopted the report, giving extensive reasons for his decision to do so.

Following all that, MCE, for the first time, raised the point that the case involves the exercise of federal jurisdiction, and relied on the point as the basis for a selective challenge to what had gone on before.

The reason for the selectivity is clear enough. It was MCE that procured the reference in the first place.

In the result, what has been described in this appeal as the constitution issue is raised in what may be a truncated form. It is not argued that the whole of Part 72 is inapplicable to cases which involve the exercise of federal jurisdiction. It is not argued that a problem exists because Mr de
Fina is not a lawyer, let alone a judge. It is not argued that Pt 72 r5, which gave Giles J the power to give directions and instructions to the referee as to the inquiry, was inapplicable. Nor is it argued that Pt 72 r8, under which the inquiry was conducted, and which provides that a referee is not bound by the rules of evidence, and may inform himself or herself in such manner as the referee thinks fit, did not apply. The argument is confined to Pt 72 r13, relating to the adopting of the referee's report. The relief sought is a reconsideration of the referee's report, but upon an approach different from that taken (in accordance with MCE's submissions at the time) by Rolfe J.

The effect of the submission advanced by the appellant is that, in a case involving federal jurisdiction, the whole of the remainder of Part 72 applies just as in a case involving State jurisdiction, but, when one comes to Pt 72 r13, the rules mean one thing in relation to cases involving State jurisdiction, and a different thing in relation to cases involving federal jurisdiction. This is difficult to reconcile with received opinion as to the manner in which s79 of the Judiciary Act operates (Commonwealth versus Mewett ALR 299 at 352).

If there be merit in the appellant's constitutional argument, then it is far from clear that it is only at the Pt 72 r13 stage that the argument begins to have legal consequences. Furthermore, as a matter of the discretion exercised by Giles J in referring the case to Mr de Fina originally, it is quite likely that no such reference would have been made had Giles J considered that either party could demand a full rehearing on any issue as to which the party was dissatisfied with the referee's report.

It is not easy to imagine a less satisfactory set of circumstances in which to decide the constitutional question raised by the appellant.

I agree that the constitutional grounds of appeal should be disposed of on the basis of what Mason P has called the procedural objection.

I would add that the case provides an illustration of the problem to which
Mason J was referring in The Commonwealth versus Hospital Contribution Fund <case>; [(1982) 150 CLR 49] at 62 when he said: "An exercise of the legislative power conferred by s77(iii) imposes an obligation on the State court to exercise the jurisdiction thereby invested.
It would indeed be a great inconvenience to the States and their courts if the structure and composition of a State court for the exercise of federal jurisdiction is to differ from that selected by the State for the exercise of its similar non-federal jurisdiction. Yet this is the unfortunate consequence of the Kotsis interpretation. What is more it will have a coercive and restraining influence on the States' competence to organise their courts as they choose. If the States are compelled to employ their judges in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, even in unimportant matters, they may be impelled to use the same organisation for the exercise of similar non-federal jurisdiction, to avoid having two organisations or to avoid drawing an unacceptable distinction between federal and non-federal business. As we know the exercise of federal jurisdiction may suddenly intrude into the exercise of non-federal jurisdiction without the court or the parties perceiving that a federal element has arisen. The consequence is that if the States adopt a curial organisation for the despatch of non-federal business that differs from the Kotsis specification the intrusion of a federal element in the exercise of what is thought to be non-federal jurisdiction could make the hearing abortive. There is no reflection in the provisions of Ch III of an intention to submerge the exercise of federal jurisdiction in problems of this kind or of an intention to constrain the States' freedom of action in the organisation of their courts." 
MULTICON ENGINEERING PTY LTD versus FEDERAL AIRPORTS CORPORATION 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: The appellant Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd ("MCE") contends that the Supreme Court's power to adopt a referee's report varies according to whether or not the Court is exercising federal jurisdiction. The respondent Federal Airports Corporation ("FAC") disputes this proposition as well as the appellant's right to raise it for the first time on appeal. 
FAC is a statutory body representing the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.
Its functions under the [Federal Airports Corporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/faca1986306/) include the "holding" of Federal airports for and on behalf of the Commonwealth [(s29).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/faca1986306/s29.html)
In 1990 FAC engaged MCE to carry out redevelopment work at Sydney
International Airport. MCE had previously tendered for the job. MCE was to supply and erect structural steelwork. In proceedings commenced in the
Construction List of the Common Law Division in 1991, MCE sued FAC for damages and other relief. It was claimed that FAC had breached [s52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) in its pre- contractual negotiations. FAC countered with a Defence and a Cross-Claim alleging that MCE was in breach of contract and liable to liquidated damages.

One matter at issue at an early stage was whether the proceedings were appropriate for reference pursuant to Part 72 of the Supreme Court Rules. MCE said they were. FAC said otherwise. On 11 November 1991 Giles J held that: "FAC's submission seemed to be made more in hope than in expectation, and the lack of enthusiasm is well-justified. Proceedings more apt to benefit from the application of the expertise of a referee with suitable qualifications it would be hard to find. They are technical, are likely to be lengthy, and will undoubtedly reach a quicker resolution, overall a cheaper resolution and a resolution as close to correct as can be, if use is made of the facility offered by Pt 72." 
His Honour ruled that the entirety of the proceedings should be referred. On November formal orders were made, which included an order referring the whole of the proceedings to Mr A A De Fina "for inquiry and report in accordance with the usual order for referees pursuant to Part 72 Rule 2".
Directions were given about the commencement of the hearing of the reference, and for the Referee's report to be forwarded to the Court by a named date (later extended).

The extent and complexity of the matters in issue caused the proceedings before the Referee to span 205 sitting days from May 1992 to June 1994. There were 12,500 pages of transcript and 6,590 pages of final submissions. Each side was represented by senior and junior counsel. The Referee reported to the
Court as follows in February 1995: "1. In my opinion, and for the reasons set forth herein the Plaintiff,
Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd, fails in its action alleging breach by the
Federal Airports Corporation of [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (1974) .
As a consequence of my opinion as expressed in (1) above the Plaintiff is not entitled to any remedy or relief available under [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) or
Section 87 of the Act or otherwise.
In my opinion and for the reasons set forth herein the Cross Claimant,
Federal Airports Corporation, succeeds in establishing entitlement in the sum of $1,607,000 for liquidated damages arising out of the failure of the Cross
Defendant, Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd, to comply with relevant provisions of the contract as to completion. Of this amount the sum of $293,302 remains unpaid and the FAC is entitled to that amount and to interest thereon at the judgment debt interest rate as applicable from time to time commencing from and including 14 February 1991.
I reserve on the matter of costs." 
The accompanying Reasons covered 267 pages.

In a hearing before Rolfe J which lasted nine sitting days in early 1996, the
FAC sought by Notice of Motion to have the Report adopted pursuant to Part 72.

Also before Rolfe J was a Notice of Motion filed by MCE seeking to have the whole Report rejected, save for certain findings on what were said to be technical matters. Although MCE also sought an order that the court decide the matter on the evidence taken before the Referee with or without such additional evidence as the court should think fit,[1] no attempt was made to tender evidence additional to that which was before the Referee.

It will be necessary to examine more closely the issues ventilated before
Rolfe J, and his Honour's response to them. For the moment, it may be noted that the learned judge addressed the competing contentions in a lengthy (130 page) judgment. He concluded that: "Save for one matter the Referee's report satisfies me that it is one which should be adopted by the Court. The one aspect of the report I am not disposed to accept, for the reasons given, are the words used by the Referee at p264 that significant sections of the evidence of Messrs Muirhead and Markham were `clearly biased' and `in part, advocacy'".

Formal orders were made on 29 March 1996. In substance, Rolfe J adopted the
Report, save for the penultimate paragraph on p264 thereof. He gave judgment for FAC on MCE's claim and judgment for FAC in the sum of $1.7 million on its
Cross Claim.

MCE appealed. In the appeal it seeks a new trial consequent upon the rejection of the Report. The original Notice of Appeal contains 81 grounds, most of which assert particular errors or omissions by Rolfe J in dealing with the
Report and the evidence before the Referee.

From the start of the proceedings in 1991, the Supreme Court was exercising federal jurisdiction because of MCE's claim of breach of [s52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/).[2] If the parties were conscious of this, neither they nor the judge saw any need to advert to it. However, in the section of the Notice of Appeal dealing with the way in which the trial judge adopted the Report, two grounds (31 and 32) are raised which turn upon the exercise of federal jurisdiction. These grounds assert that: "31. His Honour invalidly exercised the judicial power of the Commonwealth contrary to [s86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) and Chapter
III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of the Commonwealth of Australia in failing to consider directly the evidence in the proceedings and in failing to draw his own conclusions in relation thereto.
Alternatively to paragraph 31, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72)
Rule 13(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Rules is invalid to the extent that it permits the Court, in relation to a report in proceedings in the federal jurisdiction, to adopt a disputed factual finding merely because, in the opinion of the Court, there was material before the Referee upon which the finding was open." 
MCE's solicitor has filed an affidavit in which he acknowledges that a question about the proper approach to the adoption of a Referee's report by a judge in a matter in the federal jurisdiction was "first raised with me by a lawyer not previously involved" 20 days after Rolfe J made his final orders and 6 days before the Notice of Appeal was filed.

By Notice of Motion filed on 8 April 1997 MCE sought leave to amend the Notice of Appeal by substituting the following grounds, in lieu of grounds 31 and 32: "31. His Honour, exercising federal jurisdiction invested by [s86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), acted outside power, or erred in law, in failing himself to consider directly the evidence in the proceedings in relation to disputed factual findings in the report in accordance with [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p72) rule 13(1)(d) of the Supreme Court Rules or alternatively, in failing to hear de novo the evidence relating thereto and in failing to draw his own conclusions from the evidence. This involves a matter within [s78B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) of the
Commonwealth.
Further or alternatively to paragraph 31, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/index.html#p72) rule 13(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Rules is invalid to the extent that it permits the Court, when exercising federal jurisdiction, to adopt a disputed factual finding in a report merely because, in the opinion of the Court, there was material before the Referee upon which the finding was open. This involves a matter within [s78B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) of the
Commonwealth.

A. Further to paragraphs 31 and 32, for there to have been a valid exercise of federal jurisdiction, his Honour should have decided the proceedings for himself on the basis only of the undisputed factual findings in the report and such further factual findings as his Honour may have made in the manner referred to in paragraph 31. This involves a matter within [s78B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) of the
Commonwealth." 
FAC has moved to strike out the original grounds 31 and 32, and it opposes the necessary leave to insert the new grounds 31-32A. The same argument is advanced on either basis, namely that MCE had elected to press for the reference and conducted it and the proceedings before Rolfe J on bases that did not involve the "federal jurisdiction" point belatedly raised in the
Notice of Appeal. This objection has been referred to by MCE as the "Procedural Objection". FAC also submits that the issues raised in the identified grounds of appeal are without substance (the "Constitutional
Question").

On 12 May 1997 Powell and Stein JJA ordered that each Notice of Motion stand adjourned until the hearing of the appeal and that the hearing of the appeal, in the first instance, be confined to grounds 31 and 32 in the (original)
Notice of Appeal and the questions raised by the two Notices of Motion. These were the proceedings heard by this Court on 26 August 1997.

The proposed amended grounds 31, 32 and 32A are advanced by way of refinement or clarification. The amendment is opposed for reasons other than prejudice in the conduct of the appeal itself. Because of this, counsel for all parties addressed the issues raised by the reformulated grounds. The court should do likewise.

REFERENCES PURSUANT TO [PART 72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/index.html#p72) 
Express power to make rules with respect to the referral of proceedings was conferred by the Supreme Court (Commercial Arbitration) Amendment Act 1984, which inserted s124(2) in the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). Of present relevance is the power conferred by [s124(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s124.html) to make rules with respect to:- "(e) the consequences of a determination or report by an arbitrator or referee; the manner in which such a determination or report may be called in question; whether or not, or to what extent, a determination or report may be called in question on a matter of fact or law." [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p72), [rule 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s2.html) empowers the Court to make orders for reference to a referee appointed by the
Court for enquiry and report by the referee on the whole of the proceedings or any question or questions arising in the proceedings. The power is not available in respect of a question to be tried with a jury. The Court may give directions with respect to the conduct of proceedings under the reference (r8(1)). Subject to any such direction, the referee may conduct the proceedings under the reference in such manner as the referee thinks fit (r8(2a)). The Court may, at any time and from time to time, give directions with respect to any matter arising in proceedings under the reference (r9). An order for reference may be set aside or varied by the Court (r10).

Pursuant to [rule (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s8.html), the order by Giles J incorporated the "usual order for reference". 3 Inter alia this directed that [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s8.html) should apply to the conduct of the proceedings, subject to certain modifications. These included directions that the referee conduct the proceedings without undue formality, and that any evidence in chief should be by way of signed written statement unless the referee otherwise permitted. The referee was also given liberty to seek directions from the court.
 [Rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s11.html) stipulates that, unless the Court otherwise orders, the referee is to report to the Court, stating the referee's opinion on the matter and the reasons for the opinion. On receipt of the report, the Court is required to serve it on the parties (r12). [Rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s13.html) deals with "Proceedings on the report". It provides: "13(1) Where a report is made, the Court may, of its own motion, after notice to the parties, or on application by any party, on a matter of fact or law or both - adopt, vary or reject the report in whole or in part; require an explanation by way of report from the referee; on any ground, remit for further consideration by the referee the whole or any part of the matter referred for a further report; decide any matter on the evidence taken before the referee, with or without additional evidence, and shall give such judgment or make such order as the Court thinks fit.

Evidence additional to the evidence taken before the referee may not be adduced before the Court except with the leave of the Court." 
THE "CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION" 
MCE does not challenge the decision of Giles J to refer the whole proceedings "for inquiry and report in accordance with the usual order for referees pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p72) [Rule "](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s2.html).
Nor is complaint made about the way in which the Referee conducted the inquiry and reported to the court. The challenge is limited to the manner in which
Rolfe J addressed the Report and adopted it.

It is submitted that the judge was obliged to conduct a hearing de novo. His error, at least for the purposes of the proposed grounds of appeal under consideration, is said to be that he approached his role (under [rule )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s13.html) in accordance with the principles expounded in Super Pty Ltd versus SJP Formwork
Pty Ltd.4 Specifically, it is contended that the judge erred in considering merely whether it was open to the Referee to make the findings that he did. Thus stated, the submission grossly oversimplifies the approach to [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s13.html) required by Super and followed by the judge. Senior counsel for MCE acknowledged this, but maintained that there were sufficient indications in
Rolfe J's judgment that his Honour, in following Super, constructively failed to exercise his power in a constitutionally permissible manner.

Super explains the approach which the Court should adopt in addressing an application to adopt a referee's report pursuant to [Part 72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p72), [rule 13.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s13.html) It is unnecessary to set out the reasoning at length. It was held that the Court is at liberty to give substantial deference to the findings and recommendations of the referee, with power (in the terms of r13(1)(a)) to adopt the report in whole or in part. That power must, of course, be exercised fairly, with consciousness of the liberty to reject the report if the court is not persuaded that the interests of justice require its adoption. The Court of Appeal expressly rejected the proposition that a party dissatisfied with a referee's report is entitled as of right to require the judge acting under [rule 13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s13.html) to reconsider and determine afresh all issues which that party desires to contest before the judge.[5] MCE contends that this liberty is not available in proceedings involving the exercise of federal jurisdiction, except with the consent of the parties at the time. 
To place the constitutional argument in its proper focus, it must be noted that, since the Supreme Court was exercising federal jurisdiction, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p72) did not apply of its own force. Rather, it applied as "surrogate Commonwealth law", picked up by [s79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth).[6]
It is well established that, when [s79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) picks up and applies State laws in this manner, it does so "with their meaning unchanged".[7] 
There being no incompatible federal enactment, the question becomes whether the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) precludes the picking up of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72) [rule (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s13.html) as expounded in Super.8 MCE argues that Chapter III of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) imposes a requirement, which [rule (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s13.html) as expounded in Super contravenes, that the judicial power of the
Commonwealth may not be delegated by a court in which its exercise is vested unless that court effectively retains the power to determine by hearing de novo any contested issue of fact or law. Reliance is placed on Harris v
Caladine[9] and Harrington versus Lowe.[10] 
The respondent, supported by the Attorney General for New South Wales , submits that the constitutional argument is misconceived for at least two reasons: the principle in Harris does not extend to state courts exercising federal jurisdiction; and the powers conferred by [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s13.html) as construed in Super are compatible with Harris' non-delegation principle.

For reasons given below, there is powerful support for each of these responses to MCE's "constitutional argument", although it is not necessary that this
Court rule upon that argument in this case.

Speaking in Harris about the Constitution's requirement that a federal court's jurisdiction, powers and functions are to be exercised by a court whose members are judges appointed pursuant to [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s72.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/),
Mason CJ and Deane J said that:[11] "the requirement does mean that the judges of the Court do effectively control and supervise the exercise of its jurisdiction, powers and functions by participating in the hearing and determination of cases and otherwise by having the capacity to review the decisions of officers of the Court and other persons to whom jurisdiction, powers and functions may be delegated." 
At issue in Harris was whether the Family Law Rules retained for the judges of the Family Court effective control in their function of reviewing any exercise of power delegated to a Registrar of that Court. The Court's power when reviewing a Registrar's order was stated in the Rules to require the Court to "proceed by way of a hearing de novo [having] regard to the proceedings, including the evidence given ... before the ... Registrar, as the case requires".12 The High Court (by majority) held that this involved no breach of the constitutional prohibition of non-delegation. The case does not decide the application of the prohibition to State courts, nor does it establish that nothing short of a right to a hearing de novo is sufficient.
Nevertheless there is a wealth of differing dicta addressing these issues.

Does Harris' principle extend to State Courts? 
There are passages in Harris which suggest that the non-delegation principle there discussed derives from [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s72.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), which addresses the tenure of judges of the High Court and of other federal courts created by the Parliament of the Commonwealth.[13] If [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s72.html) is the critical determinant, then the non-delegation principle discussed in
Harris does not extend to State courts. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) imposes no tenure requirement for a State court to be a receptacle of invested federal judicial power.[14] 
There are indications that some of the justices relied significantly upon [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s72.html) and did not intend their remarks to apply to State courts,[15] although only
McHugh J seems to have said so expressly.[16] 
On the other hand, there are statements suggesting a contrary view. For example, the discussion by most of the justices of the catena of cases relating to State courts exercising federal jurisdiction culminating in The
Commonwealth versus Hospital Contribution Fund[17] was at pains in several places to emphasise the supervision and control of masters and registrars by the judges of those State courts.[18] It also emerges from a reading of the judgment of Gaudron J, that her Honour does not rest the non-delegation principle upon [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s72.html), and that she views it as deriving from the broader notion of the judicial power of the Commonwealth which [s71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s71.html) vests in various "courts", including State courts.[19] 
Extent of effective supervision and control of delegate 
While review by way of hearing de novo was sufficient to pass muster for the rule under challenge in Harris, and while there are statements that mere appellate review was insufficient,[20] only McHugh J[21] stipulated that the right to a hearing de novo is a necessary minimum for what Dawson J described as "effective supervision and control".22 Mason CJ and Deane J, speaking of the scope of a State court to organise itself in a variety of ways, saw no difficulty with such a court referring a case or an issue to arbitration or to assessors for examination and report.[23] Dawson J appeared to contemplate that the rules might permissibly limit the evidence admissible in the proceedings on review.[24] Of the majority justices, only McHugh J[25] insisted on a right to a hearing de novo, and he expressly confined it to federal courts.[26] 
The upshot is that, even if Harris applies to State courts, it is doubtful whether the Super principles would contravene its mandate. It is to be remembered that a referee's opinion has no effect unless and until the court chooses to adopt it.[27] And Super emphasises the breadth of the power of "review" implicit in the power to reject.[28] Rolfe J demonstrates this in his careful analysis of the Report and of the evidence before the Referee. There is much to be said for the view that [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72) - [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s13.html) in particular - effectively modifies the common law of judicial evidence, albeit in a manner consistent with fair procedure and the proper exercise of federal judicial power.[29] It follows that, when one turns to the application of
Super in this particular case, it is far from clear that any breach of the principles in Harris would be involved even if Rolfe J had been sitting as a judge of the Federal Court.

This said, I consider it appropriate that we should follow the practice of avoiding the determination of constitutional issues unless necessary. The practice has been frequently stated.[30] Such an approach is judicially economical; it avoids unnecessary conflict between the judicial and other arms of government, thereby enhancing the standing of each; and it saves the parties and others from the potentially irremediable consequences of a determination that is beyond legislative correction. Above all, the practice reflects the truth that there are times and areas in which judges "know too little to risk the finality of precision".[31] These principles apply a fortiori to an intermediate court of appeal addressing an area of developing
High Court jurisprudence.

There are other difficulties in addressing the "constitutional question" in vacuo. Interesting as that question is, it goes nowhere unless the ultimate decision is shown to be affected by the putative error. This itself is a highly debatable proposition given reliance upon the evidence before the
Referee, absence of any attempt to tender additional evidence, and the way in which the contested issues were in fact addressed by Rolfe J. Quite apart from the "procedural question" to which I shall shortly turn, there is the distinct possibility that, even if what MCE submits to be the constitutionally correct approach to the task of adopting a report in federal jurisdiction had been followed, the judgment below might nevertheless stand. To show that isolated findings were made in a constitutionally impermissible manner would not automatically result in the new trial which MCE seeks.

In my view the appeal can and should be disposed of by reference to the so called "procedural objection" to which I now turn.

THE "PROCEDURAL OBJECTION " 
FAC challenges MCE's right to rely on the constitutional point because of the way MCE conducted its case below. Over the objection of FAC, MCE had sought and obtained an order referring the proceedings to the Referee. The form and clear intent of that order invoked [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72) with all of its incidents, especially the power to adopt a report (r13).
Having joined issue in the lengthy and expensive inquiry (spanning 205 sitting days), obtained an unfavourable Report, and failed in the proceedings before
Rolfe J relating to the adoption of the Report, MCE seeks to advance its "constitutional" point for the first time in the appeal.

For present purposes, it is common ground that Rolfe J approached his task in accordance with the Super principles. Indeed, a document entitled "Principles On Review", put before him by MCE, indicates that this was exactly what the appellant asked him to do at the trial. Super was the basis upon which many particular objections to the Report and its findings were advanced below by MCE. Nevertheless, the transcript of the proceedings before
Rolfe J records the then senior counsel for MCE: "accepting completely the statement in many of the cases ... that a plaintiff is not entitled to a rerun; that the plaintiff is not entitled to ask this
Court as of right to tramp over all of the factual matters; the plaintiff is not entitled to ask this Court to reverse findings of fact when clearly those findings of fact have been made in the course of the referee preferring one piece of evidence over another."[32] 
Senior counsel for MCE in the appeal submitted that Rolfe J had been asked in effect to approach the report in a constitutionally permissible manner having regard to the relief sought in FAC's Notice of Motion before Rolfe J and its document entitled "Plaintiff's Submissions on Findings of Fact" which embodied findings which the judge was asked to make. However, these documents do not assist MCE in overcoming the force of the matters referred to in the previous two paragraphs. The Notice of Motion and the submissions it incorporated were entirely consistent with [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72),[33] and they invoked the principles of review enunciated in Super rather than spurned them. The findings sought in the document referred to above were sought on the basis of the evidence before the Referee, and on the basis of
Super.

Rolfe J records[34] that MCE's submission was that the Referee had misapprehended the case presented for his decision and that he had accordingly misunderstood the evidence and failed to give effect to unchallenged evidence.
This submission was addressed and rejected on its merits. There is a careful analysis directed at showing that the Referee understood the task he had been set by the pleadings and the parties.[35] 
Where it was submitted that it was not open to the Referee to reach the findings that he did, the issue was addressed and resolved.[36] The judge was at pains to show that critical findings were supported by evidence and appropriate reasoning processes. The legal principles applied by the Referee were examined and found to disclose no error. The judge also addressed particular arguments that suggested, in reliance upon Super, that the
Referee misunderstood his task, misapplied the law, made perverse findings or findings unsupported by evidence.[37] In offering this summary of the judgment below, I am not to be taken to have addressed any of the challenges raised in the 79 grounds of appeal that are yet to be argued.

Since the judge was not asked to receive any fresh evidence or to rehear any of the witnesses called before the Referee, it is hardly surprising that he did not do so. Subject to anything that may emerge in relation to the grounds of appeal not presently before the Court, the conclusion is clear, namely that the judge approached his task conformably with [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72) and the principles in Super. This was no more or less than what MCE had intended when it sought the order from Giles J and what MCE had asked Rolfe J himself to do.

It should also be indicated, in response to a submission but faintly put by counsel for MCE, that there was nothing radical or unexpected in the principles expounded by the Court of Appeal in Super. As Gleeson CJ there pointed out,[38] the approach which had been taken by Giles J at first instance in the Super case (which was endorsed in the Court of Appeal) was consistent with that which had been taken over a number of years by judges of the Commercial Division.

In an endeavour to escape the consequences of the stance adopted below, senior counsel for MCE sought to characterise the constitutional argument as a jurisdictional point, citing a number of cases in support of the principle that parties cannot by consent confer power upon a court to make orders outside its jurisdiction.[39] In my view, this principle has no application to the case as presented by MCE which, it will be remembered, accepts the validity of Giles J's order referring the whole proceedings to the Referee pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p72) and accepts the validity of [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s13.html) (so long as it is construed in accordance with the constitutional principle advanced by MCE in this appeal). In other words, the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales to entertain and dispose of the proceedings is not in issue, nor its power to use the assistance of the Referee and his
Report. By this means Rolfe J ascertained "existing rights by the judicial determination of issues of fact or law"[40] in a matter within the federal jurisdiction conferred by [s86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/).

Indeed, the fragility of MCE's contention that a "jurisdictional" error occurred (assuming the correctness of the constitutional point) is exposed by the very fact that MCE argues that [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s13.html) as expounded in Super precluded the adoption of the Referee's findings, except with the consent of the parties at the time. The qualification entailed in the concluding words was added in order to accommodate MCE's submission to
Rolfe J (repeated in the Court of Appeal) that he could, with MCE's consent, adopt significant parts of the evidence before the Referee and those parts of the Report to which no objection was taken. This concession lies ill with MCE's argument that its stance before Giles J did not have some preclusive effect. But of present relevance is the difficulty of fitting such a qualification with the argument that an impermissible assumption of jurisdiction or even power was involved. From start to finish, the issue in the appeal involved the manner in which the power conferred by [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s13.html) was exercised. That manner was (for present purposes) exactly as proposed by MCE, and the cases cited about a court declining to make an order by consent that is outside jurisdiction have no application.

In support of the procedural objection, FAC and the Attorney General relied principally upon University of Wollongong versus Metwally (No 2)[41]. That was a case in which a party to completed proceedings by way of case stated in the High Court sought to vacate a declaratory order which had been made by the
Full Court of the High Court after it had been perfected by being taken out.
The applicant desired to raise a point which had not been raised on the hearing in the High Court and which was in direct conflict with the basis of the case presented on his behalf in the completed proceedings in the High
Court. (He wished to assert the constitutional invalidity of the [Racial
Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/rda1975202/) (Cth) after having lost an earlier argument which assumed the validity of that Act, contending that it was inconsistent with a State Act.[42]) In that context, the High Court stated that:[43] "It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so." 
While the principle is a compelling one, it needs recognition that
University of Wollongong did not involve an appeal by way of rehearing.
Indeed, it did not involve an appeal at all.[44] 
Since this is an appeal by way of rehearing, the matter should be approached in accordance with the principles stated in cases such as Suttor versus Gundowda
Pty Ltd[45] and Coulton versus Holcombe.[46] A party seeking to advance for the first time on appeal a new ground not taken at trial will be precluded from doing so if the new ground could possibly have been met by calling evidence at the hearing or if, had the ground been raised below, the respondent might have conducted the case differently at trial. MCE argues that these principles do not preclude it from raising the constitutional point on appeal, because all that is in issue is the proper approach to be followed in considering whether to adopt a report in a matter in the federal jurisdiction.
The evidence which each party wished to rely upon was before the judge.

However there is another principle of more direct relevance. A party does not have a right to insist that a new point be decided on appeal simply because all of the facts have been established beyond controversy or the point is one of construction or of law, even constitutional law. This is because it remains a question of whether the appellate court "may find it expedient and in the interests of justice to entertain the point".47 The rule is not an absolute one, as evidenced by this Court's decision in Della Patrona versus Director of
Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 1).[48] However: "it is a sound general principle, leading not only to the maintenance of fair play, but also to the repression of unnecessary litigation, that parties must be bound by the course they deliberately adopted at the trial."[49] 
In Coulton[50] Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ said that: "It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish." 
In the present case it would not be "in the interests of justice" to permit
MCE to repudiate on appeal the stance it adopted at all stages in the trial.
That would make it a classical case of a party having elected to fight on one basis, and lost, seeking a new trial to be allowed to fight it on another basis. To say nothing about a significant waste of judicial resources, payment of the costs thrown away (which MCE offers) would not remedy the injustice that would flow if a party that invited the Court to exercise the powers conferred by rule 13 as expounded in Super (and which, in some of the remaining grounds of appeal, complains of failure to do so) now to adopt the position that there was no power to do this in the first place. It is also relevant to take into account the difficulties of establishing that the putative error had any effect on the outcome of the case. In this regard, the present case is far removed from Della Patrona where a discrete "knock- out point" seemed at the time to be involved.[51] 
The proper time for the constitutional point to have been taken would have been at the time when the reference was sought. It would then have been open to Giles J to have taken into account the possibility that the benefits anticipated from a referral would be lost having regard to the limitations imposed on the Court when adopting the report, due to the constitutional point (if valid).

In stating that the proper time for the taking of the constitutional point would have been when the referral order was made, I am not saying that failure to have done so necessarily foreclosed MCE's rights to argue the point. Had
MCE been the party that unsuccessfully opposed the making of a referral order, then its rights to object in an appeal from the final order in the proceedings would have been protected. But even in a situation where, as was the case, MCE was the moving party, then it may possibly not have been fatal had MCE taken the objection later, at some point of time before it did take the point.[52]
There are many circumstances where the law will afford a locus poenitentiae to a party who makes a procedural slip or takes a wrong turn in tortuous litigation. But there comes a time in any litigation where a party has gone so far in one direction that it would be unjust to allow that party to commence a second run at the same target. In the present case that time is past. Lord
Atkin's aphorism that "finality is a good thing but justice is a better"[53] raises a false dichotomy if finality is not seen as an aspect of justice.

The appellant should be given leave to amend by substituting the new grounds -32A for the original grounds 31-32, but so much of the appeal as relates to those grounds should be dismissed with costs. No order should be made for the costs of the intervener.
