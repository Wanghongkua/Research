Fexuto Pty Limited versus Bosnjak Holdings Pty Limited and Ors Matter No /97 [1998] NSWSC 293 (25 June 1998) 
Last Updated: 28 August 1998 `FEXUTO PTY LIMITED versus BOSNJAK HOLDINGS PTY LIMITED & ORS` `3799/97` `25 June 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT - On application to read two affidavits of Carol Bosnjak, when deponent unavailable for cross-examination 
HIS HONOUR: The first application made is that the affidavits DA14 and DA15 be read, notwithstanding that Carol Bosnjak is not available for cross-examination. She is not available because, the evidence is, last Friday she became so distressed that she was unable to think, or to read, and she has gone home under medical treatment. 
A party is given a right under <case> of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/) to cross- examine a witness; however, that is subject to the general powers of the Court under <case> and under ss 135 and 136 of the Act.

The course could be taken of standing the matter over for three months, but that does not seem to be very appealing to any of the parties who have been in court. This is the thirteenth day and they, doubtless, want a decision.

I have reread the affidavits concerned. It seems to me that, apart from paragraphs 40 to 42 of DA14, which go to the question as to the involvement of the National Bus Company and employees of Westbus, and affidavit DA15 in total, which goes to whether Anda Bosnjak could be understood when she spoke to an English-speaking person, the material is mainly background, or covering non controversial matters.

I think that the only way that I can hold the scales equally is to not read affidavit DA15; not read paragraphs 40 to 42 of affidavit DA14; and read the balance on the basis that, when weighing up that evidence, I will have to discount it on the basis that the witness was not available for cross- examination.
