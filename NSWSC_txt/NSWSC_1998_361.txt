CCA 60166/96 June 1998 
Spigelman CJ, Newman J, Barr J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 
HEADNOTE 
This is an appeal from a judgment cancelling an order for periodic detention pursuant to [s25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) and a decision also under 27(4) of the Act determining how the remaining sentence was to be served.

Held: There is no appeal to this court from the decision to cancel a periodic detention order under [s25:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html)
R versus Sommerville [(1995) 36 NSWLR 184]; Wilson v R; Department of Corrective Services, 14/04/1997 NSWCCA 60650/95.
 Upon cancellation of a periodic detention order, [s27(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) has effect as a deemed sentence: Sommerville at 187.
 [Section (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) applies to give this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the sentence, deemed to have been imposed at the time of cancellation of the periodic detention order: Mikas [(1996) 85 ACrimR 34] at 37.
The appeal in this Court is from the deemed sentence that came into effect by the operation of [s27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s27.html) of the Act.
 The trial judge turned his mind to the exercise of the discretion under [s25(3B).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s25.html)
He refused to exercise the discretion on the basis of medical evidence before him. In view of contrasting medical reports, the trial judge was entitled to act upon the positive opinion of the cardiologist for the Crown that the appellant was fit to attend periodic detention.

However, new evidence suggested that a custodial sentence would adversely affect the applicant's state of health: R versus Smith [(1987) 44 SASR 587] at 589 and in R versus L, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 29 May 1996 at pp6-7, applied.

ORDERS
Leave granted to appeal against the sentence deemed to have been imposed at the time when the trial judge cancelled the periodic detention order
Appeal against that sentence allowed and sentence quashed.
In lieu thereof, fix a minimum term of nine weeks two days, with an additional term of sixty-six weeks and five days.

JUDGMENT 
SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal from a judgment of His Honour Judge McGuire delivered on 22 March 1996 in which his Honour cancelled an order for periodic detention pursuant to [s25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) (the "Act"). Secondly, his Honour exercised his discretion under [s27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the Act by fixing a minimum term of thirty-eight weeks. 
His Honour Judge McGuire had sentenced the applicant on 9 May 1995 after a plea of guilty to two counts. The first count was threaten to use an offensive weapon; namely, a knife. This occurred in circumstances where the applicant was apprehended by a security officer after taking a wallet from a shop. The second count was that of larceny with respect to the taking of that wallet.

His Honour deferred passing sentence with the respect to the first count and subjected the applicant to a bond to be of good behaviour. With regard to the second count the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of eighteen months to be served by way of periodic detention.

In the course of his reasons on sentence, in his first judgment, his Honour said: "A number of medical reports have been placed before me which verify the prisoner's complaints that he suffers from a number of serious debilitating conditions including diabetes, a heart condition, a prostatic condition and the effects of a stroke. I do not propose to quote from these reports, suffice it to say that I have carefully considered same and I have taken into account the prisoner's claim that he is receiving continuing medical treatment." 
His Honour also made certain remarks with respect to the consequences if Mr
Urquhart breached the bond.

An appeal to this Court against severity of sentence was dismissed on 14
December 1995.

Over a long period of time Mr Urquhart was granted leave of absence for ill health under [s21(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21.html) of the Act based upon medical certificates and reports. Subsequently, in a report dated 14 September 1995, from a medical officer to whom he was referred by the Commissioner, he was found fit to comply with his periodic detention.
Thereafter, the Commissioner refused to grant leave. He was given notices under [s21(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21.html) of the Act for failing to report on six dates in October and November 1995.

An application to cancel his periodic detention was made under [s25(3A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) of the Act with respect to three such dates. The defence relied on [s25(3B).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) 
I set out and include in these reasons [ss25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html)-(3C) inclusive of the Act: "25(1) If an order for periodic detention is in force in respect of a person, the Court that made the order may cancel the order: 
On application by the person or the Commissioner, or 
Without application, if it appears to the court that there is good reason for doing so.

Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the Court may on the application of the Commissioner, cancel the order if the Court is satisfied that the person is not serving his or her sentence in accordance with the orders.

Without limiting the generality of subsection (1) the Court must, on the application of the Commissioner, cancel the order if it is satisfied: 
That the person has, for three or more detention periods, failed to report, as required by or under this Act, and 
That the failures to report occurred otherwise than on leave of absence under [ss20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s20.html), [20A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s20a.html) or [21AA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21aa.html) and are not the subject of an exemption under [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21a.html) 
The court may refuse to cancel the order if it is satisfied: 
That the person serving the sentence applied for and ought to have been granted leave of absence under [ss20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s20.html) or [21AA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21aa.html) or applied for and ought to have been granted an exemption under [s21A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21a.html), with respect to one or more detention periods, 
That the total number of detention periods for which the person has failed to report as referred to in subsection (3A) would, had the leave or exemption been granted with respect to those detention periods, be less than three, in which case it must make a determination to that effect.

If the court makes a determination under subsection (3B), leave of absence under [s20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s20.html) or an exemption under [s21A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21a.html) is taken to have been granted in accordance with the terms of the determination. " 
In his judgment of 22 March 1996, on the application to cancel the order for periodic detention, Judge McGuire said: "...what he has done is to treat with contempt his obligations to perform the order of periodic detention. He has persistently failed to attend, as he was obliged so to do.

I have perused various additional medical certificates tendered on this application and I have heard from Mr Urquhart himself. I am satisfied that there are no physical activities or work involved in the periodic detention.
There were no stairs which he had to negotiate at the prison. In short, there was no physical strain placed upon him which would affect his health.
Furthermore, I have perused a report from a consultant cardiologist who is retained by the Government Medical Officer, and that specialist reported that whilst Mr Urquhart is sick, the risk of his health is no worse during his period detention than it would be at home, and that he is fit to undertake the travel involved. Therefore the conclusion that he is unable to comply with his periodic detention on medical grounds cannot be supported. " 
His Honour went on to cancel the order for periodic detention and to exercise the discretion under [s27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the Act in the following way: "There remains to be served seventy six periods. That sentence will be served by way of a minimum term of imprisonment for thirty eight weeks which is to commence this day, and is to expire on 12 December 1996, when he is to be released to parole. 
I fix an additional term of thirty-eight weeks".

The issue has narrowed in the course of argument to the question of the exercise of the discretion under [s27(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html)
Involved in that is the possibility of the Court exercising the power under [s9(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s9.html) of the [Home Detention Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/) as a "court reviewing" a sentence. That subsection gives such a Court, of which this Court is one, a power to refer an offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for home detention "as a means of serving the minimum term of the sentence". Accordingly, that power is to be exercised when there is a minimum term to be served.

With respect to the review of, or an appeal from, decisions of a Court at first instance, under [s25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s25.html) and s[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s27.html) of the Act a number of principles seem to be established as follows: First, there is no appeal to this Court from the decision to cancel a periodic detention order under [s25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s25.html) (Sommerville [(1995) 36 NSWLR 184]); second, upon cancellation of a periodic detention order, [s27(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/hda1996155/s27.html) has effect as a deemed sentence, but not with the effect that the term of imprisonment therein referred to is deemed to be imposed by the original sentencing Judge or Magistrate (Sommerville at 187E).

Accordingly, [s5(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) applies to give this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal against the sentence deemed by [s27(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) to have been imposed at the time of cancellation of the periodic detention order (Mikas [(1996) 85 ACrimR 34] at 37).

I did not understand the reasoning in Mikas to stand for the proposition that the decision to cancel itself is appellable; rather, that the consequence of such a decision, in the form of a statutory proscribed sentence, is what is appellable. However, the orders actually made in Mikas included an order quashing the cancellation order.

Although it is not necessary to decide the relationship between Mikas and
Sommerville I note that in the subsequent case of Wilson versus R; Department of
Corrective Services, 14/04/1997 NSWCCA 60650/95 at 309, this Court, with the agreement of Hunt CJ at CL who delivered the judgment in Mikas, indicated that Sommerville did stand for the proposition to which I first referred; namely, there is no appeal to this Court from a decision to cancel a periodic detention order.

By reason of the status of the appeal to this Court in seeking leave against the deemed sentence, this is not a second appeal to the Court from the original sentence. That was dealt with by this Court on 14 December 1995.
Leave to appeal is required and the appeal is from the deemed sentence that came into effect by the operation of [s27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the Act.

In Mikas, I should note that the trial Judge had correctly concluded that the discretion under [s25(3B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) simply did not arise, because he had been informed, incorrectly as it turned out, that no application for leave of absence had been made under the Act. In these circumstances, the trial Judge had not considered whether or not the discretion should be exercised at all (see p38). Accordingly, on an appeal under [s5(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s5.html) against the deemed sentence, this Court's jurisdiction under [s6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) was properly invoked.

In the present case there can be no doubt that the trial Judge did turn his mind expressly to the exercise of the discretion under [s25(3B).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s25.html)
He refused to exercise the discretion on the basis of the medical evidence before him. He expressly took into account the evidence which was presented in this regard on behalf of the applicant. He preferred the evidence from a consultant cardiologist retained on behalf of the Department of Corrective
Services.

However, the attack on his Honour's original exercise of discretion may now be put, the position is now transformed by reason of additional evidence which has been put before this court, without objection from the Crown. It is well to recall the often quoted remarks of King CJ in the Supreme Court of South
Australia in R v. Smith [(1987) 44 SASR 587] at 589 where his Honour indicated: "The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime".

The well known passage concludes with the words that: "...ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health, or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health". 
See also the authorities cited in R versus L, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 29 May 1996 at pp6-7.

That is the position with which we now find ourselves in the light of the new evidence that has been presented to this Court.

In March of 1996 when the matter of the cancellation of periodic detention was before Judge McGuire, it was common ground that the applicant had a severe coronary heart disease and insulin dependent diabetes and other forms of a serious medical condition. The conflict was as to the effect of the periodic detention upon that condition. Dr Demetriou, the cardiologist who inspected him on behalf of the Crown, concluded that: "The risk to his health is no worse during his periodic detention than it would be at home. He is fit to travel there. " 
The evidence for the appellant included four reports from Dr McGrath and five reports from Dr Wilkes, a cardiologist. Dr McGrath expressed the opinion that, "A full custodial sentence is likely to be detrimental" to the applicant's health. Dr Wilkes referred to the prospect of "gradual deterioration" of the applicant's health, a significant matter indicating that that issue was before his Honour. However, Dr Wilkes expressed no opinion as to the effects of a custodial sentence or periodic detention on the applicant's health.

What Dr McGrath said was this: "I feel Frank remains unfit to attend periodic detention on the basis of the travel requirements placed on him" and he described the trip to Tomago Detention Centre as "arduous".

It is particularly significant that there was nothing in the reports of Dr
Wilkes, the cardiologist, expressing an opinion as to the appellant's lack of fitness to attend periodic detention. That was in contrast to the positive opinion of the cardiologist for the Crown.

His Honour was entirely entitled to act on the latter.

The Crown had no objection to the tender of additional evidence before this
Court, which puts the matter in an entirely different light to that in which the evidence stood before Judge McGuire. It is not necessary to go into the basis on which additional evidence can be justified to be relied upon in this
Court by reason of the Crown's concurrence. In light of the nature of that evidence, the failure of the Crown to object is an entirely proper position to have taken.

I draw attention to some comments in an affidavit by Dr Kendall sworn on 6
March 1998, in particular pars29 and 30, in which he said: "29. In my opinion, Mr Urquhart's health would be endangered even if he were housed in the prison hospital at Long Bay. I do not think that his dietary requirements could be met, neither do I believe that proper supervision of his insulin regime and the correct balance between insulin, food and exercise could be obtained. With his heart and peripheral vascular disease he cannot afford to have anything but optimal treatment. 
His cardiac status is poor and the added stress of prison would provoke further attacks of angina. " 
In addition, a number of other medical reports were tendered. I refer in particular to one from a Dr G Paul dated 21 May 1997 in which the following appears: "I have known Frank Urquhart for some four (4) years and during this time he has deteriorated in his medical condition to the extent I feel he would die quickly if imprisoned. " 
The doctor then went on to conclude: "His progressive frailness is of concern and would again recommend that either form of custody would easily cause his demise." 
Dr Wilkes provided an additional report dated 20 February 1998 in which he said: "Underlying vascular disease causing these problems is steadily progressive and there appears to have been a significant deterioration in his exercise tolerance during the last two years. ... The limitation of his exercise tolerance and the progressive nature of underlying pathology are factors which may be taken into consideration by the court in any future decisions." 
This evidence is obviously of a different quality to that which was before
Judge McGuire.

When the matter came before this Court Mr Game indicated that he would propose, rather than pursue all of the matters in the appeal, that in the exercise of this Court's unquestioned discretion to give leave to appeal from the exercise of the discretion under [s27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s27.html) of the Act, this Court should fix a minimum term of nine weeks and two days.
He originally said nine weeks but, as we now understand the position, the actual time served in custody was nine weeks plus two days.

No doubt, much of the material that is now before the Court could have been, but was not, adduced as medical evidence before Judge McGuire. In particular,
I give specific weight to the expression of the firm medical opinion that any custodial sentence will have a marked effect on the capacity of the applicant to survive.

This is material that perhaps could have been adduced on an earlier occasion.
By reason of the concession that the Crown made allowing the additional evidence to be tendered before this Court, it is not necessary to identify the basis on which it could properly be so adduced but, plainly, material must receive considerable weight. It would have carried such weight with Judge
McGuire had it been tendered before him.

This has been an unusual case for a number of reasons, many of which I have already referred to, and it is not necessary to list them again. But the strength of the medical opinion, the delay of some two years before this matter has been heard in this Court, together with the not inconsiderable period of time already spent in custody, has led me to the conclusion that the submission of the applicant should be upheld on this occasion and that the appropriate order of the Court should be to have the effect of setting a minimum period of the nine weeks and two days to which Mr Game made reference and on which I understood him to accept correction.

The additional term that was originally proposed was that of sixty-seven weeks. I do not believe any further submissions were addressed to that aspect of the matter and I would propose, unless there be some additional submissions to be made, to fix it at sixty-seven weeks.
 (Further submissions made).

The orders of the Court I propose are: 
Leave is granted to the applicant to appeal against the sentence deemed to have been imposed at the time when Judge McGuire cancelled the periodic detention order; t 
The appeal against the sentence deemed to have been imposed at the time when Judge McGuire cancelled the periodic detention order is allowed and that sentence is quashed.

In lieu thereof, fix a minimum term of nine weeks two days to commence on March 1996, expiring on 15 May 1996, with an additional term of sixty-six weeks and five days.

NEWMAN J: I agree with both the reasons and orders proposed by the Chief Justice. 
BARR J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court will be as I referred to a moment ago. * * *
