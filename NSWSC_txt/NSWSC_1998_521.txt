JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff is the occupant and the defendants are the owners of shop premises at the ground floor of 277 and 277A Pitt St, Sydney. On about 22 April 1998 the defendants served the plaintiff with a notice requiring the plaintiff to leave the premises at the end of May 1998. In these proceedings the plaintiff seeks a declaration that this notice is of no effect, and an injunction against the defendants interfering with its occupation. 
I will begin with a brief outline of the facts.

A deed dated 14 May 1990 regulated the licence of the premises from the defendants to the plaintiffs for the period 1 May 1990 to 31 August 1990, providing for a licence fee for the first two months of $9614.10 per month, and thereafter $13,900 per month payable on the first day of each month. The plaintiff's performance of its obligations was guaranteed by Mr Gregory
Curson, apparently the principal of the plaintiff. The most relevant parts of this deed are as follows: 
A. The Licensor is or is entitled to become the registered proprietor of the Land described in Item 4.

B. The Licensor is entitled to licence parts of the Land described in Item 4.

C. The Licensor has agreed to grant and the Licensee has agreed to accept a licence to occupy the premises described in Item 5 of the Schedule for the period set out in Item 6 of the Schedule for the licence fee of the amount set out in Item 7 payable in the manner set out in Item 8 and otherwise on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

D. The Licensor is proceeding with the development of land of which the premises forms part and the Licensor will require vacant possession of the premises t a future date to be fixed.
 (e) That if the Licensee consents in writing prior to the end of the period stated in Item 6 the Licensee may continue to use the premises after the period stated in Item 6 for the Licence Fee per calendar month payable immediately before the expiration of the period stated in Item 6 until that use is terminated by either party to this Agreement giving to the other one (1) month's notice in writing of its intention to terminate the Agreement, such notice being capable of expiring on any day of the month, whereupon the Licensee's rights to occupy the licensed premises will terminate.
 . In consideration of the Licensor granting this Licence at its request THE GUARANTOR named in Item 3 for himself his executors and assigns GUARANTEES that it is jointly with the Licensee, and individually, liable to the Licensor for the payment of all licence fees and other moneys under this Licence and damages and for the performance of all the Licensee's obligations under it. This is a continuing guarantee. The liability of the Guarantor will not be limited in any way but without restricting the generality of those words will not be affected by: the death of the Licensee or the death of the Guarantor; time or other indulgence given to the Licensee or the Guarantor; any variation of this Licence; any release of the Licensee or any other guarantor where there is more than one.

If payment made by the Licensee or the Guarantor is avoided that payment does not discharge the Licensee or the Guarantor from liability, and all parties will be restored to their positions as if that payment had not been made. Despite anything to the contrary all parties deem notice from the Licensor to the Licensee to be notice to the Guarantor.

ITEM 4:The whole of the land contained in Lot 1 in Deposited Plan 592975 registered in the Land Titles Office of the State of New South Wales as Folio Identifier 1/592975 and being known as 277 Pitt Street, Sydney, N.S.W.

ITEM 5:The Ground Floor shop premises of each of the buildings erected upon that part of the land known as 277 and 277A Pitt Street, Sydney, respectively.

ITEM 6:For the period commencing on the 1st day of May 1990 and terminating on the 31st day of August 1990.

ITEM 7 Licence Fee for the period 1 May 1990 to 30 June 1990 inclusive: Nine Thousand Six Hundred and Fourteen Dollars Ten Cents ($9,614.10) per calendar month.

Licence Fee for the period 1 July 1990 to 31 August 1990: Thirteen Thousand Nine Hundred Dollars ($13,900.00) per calendar month.

ITEM 8 Each monthly instalment of the Licence Fee is payable on the first day of each month during the occupation of the Premises by the Licensee. 
On 6 October 1993 the plaintiff was still in occupation. On that day agents acting for the defendants wrote to the plaintiff offering a lease from 1
November 1993 to 30 June 1995 for a rent equivalent to about $15,290.00 per month. This letter proposed that there should be a security deposit given by the plaintiff. On or about 10 October 1993 Mr Curson responded to the effect that he would agree to the proposed terms, except that there should be no security deposit and that the lease should start not on 1 November 1993 but on what was described as "date fit out starts". The fit out in question apparently required approval by the Heritage Counsel of New South Wales and this approval was obtained in late February 1994.

On 21 March 1994 the agent acting for the defendants wrote to the defendants, or to a company acting on behalf of the defendants, proposing a lease from 1
April 1994 and recommending that there should be a security deposit. The defendants indicated that they accepted this proposal; but then subsequently in about mid June 1994 accepted that there should be no security deposit, so long as Mr Curson remained guarantor. On about 6 July 1994 the plaintiff paid rent of $15,290 for the month of July 1994, plus an amount equivalent to the difference between the old rent and the new rent for the months of April, May and June 1994.

On 8 July 1994 the defendants' agent wrote to the defendants' solicitors advising that revised terms had been agreed for the licence, and requesting preparation of a Deed of Variation to the licence. This letter was objected to when it was tendered, and I admitted it as part of the history, reserving the question of whether it should be admitted as probative of the fact of agreement, by way of hearsay. I will return to that matter later.

On 11 August 1994, the defendants' solicitors wrote to the plaintiff enclosing the draft Deed of Variation. The Deed was ultimately executed and dated 17
October 1994. A copy of the deed is annexed to the judgment. I note that there is an alteration on the deed changing the monthly licence fee from $15,283.33.00 to $15,290.00. No point has been taken arising out of that alteration. Meanwhile, on 1 August 1994 the [Retail Leases Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/) came into operation.

The main claim made by the plaintiff in these proceedings is made in reliance upon that Act. The relevant provisions of that Act are the definition of retail shop lease in [s.3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s3.html) and ss.[6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s6.html) ,[8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) and [16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s16.html), which are in the following terms: retail shop lease or lease means any agreement under which a person grants or agrees to grant to another person for value a right of occupation of premises for the purpose of the use of the premises as a retail shop: whether or not the right is a right or exclusive occupation, and whether the agreement is express or implied, and whether the agreement is oral or in writing, or partly oral and partly in writing.
 . This Act does not apply to any of the following leases of retail shops: leases for a term of less than 6 months without any right for the lessee to extend the lease (whether by means of an option to extend or renew the lease or otherwise), and for this purpose a provision for holding over by the lessee at the end of the term of the lease is not considered to confer a right on the lessee to extend the lease if it operates effectively at the discretion of the lessor, leases for a term of 25 years or more (with the term of a lease taken to include any term for which the lease may be extended or renewed at the option of the lessee), leases entered into before the commencement of this section, leases entered into under an option granted or agreement made before the commencement of this section, any other lease of a class or description prescribed by the regulations as exempt from this Act.
 .(1) For the purposes of this Act, a retail shop lease is considered to have been entered into when a person enters into possession of the retail shop as lessee under the lease or begins or pay rent as lessee under the lease (whichever happens first).

However, if both parties execute the lease before the lessee enters into possession under the lease or begins to pay rent under the lease, the lease is considered to have been entered into as soon as both parties have executed the lease.
 (1) The term for which a retail shop lease is entered into, together with any further term or terms provided for by any agreement or option for the acquisition by the lessee of a further term as an extension or renewal of the lease, must not be less than 5 years. An agreement or option is not taken into account if it were entered into or conferred after the lease was entered into.

If a lease is entered into in contravention of this section, the validity of the lease is not thereby affected but the term of the lease is extended by such period as may be necessary to prevent the lease contravening this section.

This section does not apply to a lease if a lawyer not acting for the lessor certifies in writing that he or she has, at the request of the prospective lessee, explained the effect of subsections (1) and (2) to the prospective lessee and that the giving of the certificate will result in this section not applying to the lease. 
This section does not apply to a lease that results from the renewal of an earlier lease pursuant to an option conferred on the lessee, so long as there was no break in the entitlement of the lessee to possession of the retail shop and the option was granted by that earlier lease or by an agreement entered into before or at the same time as that earlier lease was entered into.

This section does not apply to a lease to the extent that its application would be inconsistent with the terms of any head lease under which the lessor holds the retail shop.

As mentioned earlier, on 22 April 1998 a notice was served by the defendants on the plaintiff; and it required the plaintiff to quit and deliver up the premises "on the date being the expiration of the month of your tenancy current at the end of one calendar month of the date of service of this notice upon you".

The parties have provided written outlines of their submissions in this case, and I will be very brief in outlining submissions.

On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr Jacobson QC submitted that the execution of the deed of 17 October 1994 amounted to the entry into a retail shop lease on that date, and he submitted that accordingly the term of that lease or licence was by virtue of s.16 of the Act extended to five years. He submitted that it did not matter that the deed spoke from 1 April 1994 and provided for the increased rent from that date, nor that the increased rent had in fact been paid as and from that date. He submitted that the case did not fall within s.6(c) or s.6(d) of the Act: the onus lay on the defendants to bring it within those provisions, and that onus was not discharged.

Alternatively, on the whole of the evidence the court would conclude that, whatever arrangement had been made prior to 1 August, it did not amount to a concluded legally binding agreement. He submitted particularly that the court would infer that the lessors or owners would not have wished or intended to enter into a legally binding agreement, until they obtained a guarantee in writing from Mr Curson and that did not happen until October. Mr Jacobson referred me to Heysham Properties Pty Limited v. Action Motor Group Pty
Limited, Court of Appeal 16 May 1996, and particularly the judgment of Powell
JA at p.28 and following.

Mr Jacobson submitted further that the case did not fall within s.8. There was no entry into possession under the lease, that is the document of October , prior to October 1994. Anything that happened before then did not happen under that document. In any event, the deeming provision having come into force on 1 August 1994, it would not deem matters to have occurred prior to 1
August 1994. The arrangement between the parties was expressed to be a licence. It only became a lease within the meaning of the Act by virtue of the definition in the Act. It could not therefore be treated as being a lease to which s.8(1) applied prior to the commencement of the Act.

As regards the notice to quit, Mr Jacobson submitted that it did not on its face show when it was to expire. It was not sufficient that an expiry date might possibly be worked out, if one considered the document in conjunction with the lease. In any event, even that would not give a clear expiry date having regard to the terms of cl.3(e) of the lease.

In circumstances where I have come to a firm view on one point which is favourable to the defendant in relation to the application under the [Retail
Leases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/), and in circumstances where the submissions of Mr Hughes QC for the defendants are summarised in two documents. I will not elaborate on those submissions now.

I should first indicate one conclusion of fact which I reach, namely that there was a consensus as to the terms of the new arrangement reached no later than about 6 July. I reach that inference from the history which I have outlined, namely the proposal of terms made back in October 1993, the initial response by Mr Curson, the dealings with the Heritage Counsel to arrange for the fit out, the specification of the date of commencement of 1 April, the apparent reaching of consensus that there should be no security but there should be a guarantee, the payment of rent at the new rate made on 6 July and commencing as from 1 April, the letter from the defendants' agent advising of the rental terms, the letter from the defendants' solicitors to the plaintiff enclosing the Deed of Variation, and the ultimate execution of that deed. In concluding from that material that a consensus was reached no later than 6
July 1994, I have not relied on the hearsay contained in the letter of 8 July
I do rely on the absence from the witness box of Mr Curson: that enables me more confidently to reach the conclusion that I have.

However, I would allow the document of 8 July as hearsay to confirm the reaching of a consensus. In my opinion, in all the circumstances, to allow it on that basis is not unfair within s.135 of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/). However, I will not allow it as hearsay to suggest the making of a concluded agreement. I think if the making of a concluded legally binding agreement was to be supported, it would have needed more direct evidence.

In my opinion, [s.8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) of the [Retail Leases
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/) does operate in this case to deem to the relevant retail shop lease to have been entered into no later than about 6 July 1994. In my opinion, the plaintiff did begin then to pay rent as lessee under the lease which was eventually formalised in the agreement of October 1994. It would be possible to give a construction to [s.8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) to the effect that there cannot be entry into possession as lessee under a lease, or payment of rent as lessee under a lease, unless the lease is already in existence in the full sense of the word; that is, unless there had already been a formally executed lease or at least a concluded agreement. However, in my opinion that construction of [s.8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) should be rejected, particularly having regard to the terms of [s.8(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) deals with a situation where both parties execute the lease before the lessee enters into possession under the lease, or begins to pay rent under the lease.
Those words, in my opinion, clearly contemplate the possibility that the lease may not be executed by both parties until after the lessee has entered into possession under the lease, or has begun to pay rent under the lease. That means in my opinion that the word "under the lease" in both subsections should not be given a narrow and restrict construction, but rather should be considered to be satisfied where there is entry into possession or payment of rent pursuant to a consensus as to terms which is subsequently given effect to by an executed lease. That is a situation which happens very commonly, and in my opinion that is the situation which the section is intended to deal with.

Given that construction of the section, in my opinion there is no doubt that such retail shop lease as may have been constituted by the agreement of
October 1994 is to be treated under [s.8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) as having been entered into no later than about 6 July. I do not think there is any force in the submission that [s.8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) cannot have the effect of deeming something like this to have occurred prior to the commencement of the Act.

Mr Hughes drew my attention to the case of Dibeek Holdings Pty Limited v.
Emmanuel Notaras & Ors., a decision of Higgins J in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory given on 17 October 1997. In that case,
Higgins J, in applying some ACT legislation, held that the crucial date there was the date of execution of the lease, not the date from which the term was set by the lease to commence. However, it appears that there is no provision analogous to [s.8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) in that legislation, and I do not think that case can affect the question of the application of [s.8.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s8.html) 
Having come to that view on that aspect of the case, I do not need to decide the other points raised by Mr Hughes. However, I will just advert to them briefly.

Mr Hughes submitted that the onus lay on the plaintiff to exclude the application of [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s6.html) pars.(c) and (d). In some case in the future it may be very important to know whether the person alleging the application of the Act also bears the onus of in effect excluding the application of [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s6.html), and I think it is better in this case for me not to express any view on that matter.

Mr Hughes submitted that in any event it was established that this case fell within [s.6(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s6.html), in that it was established that the lease was entered into under an agreement made before the commencement of the section. Apart from the inference arising from the facts which I have related, Mr Hughes also relied on the fact of
Recital C in the original agreement of 14 May 1990, as incorporated into the
Deed of Variation by means of cl.3.1 Since the recital asserted an agreement made prior to the Deed in question, the Court would infer, and indeed the plaintiff was bound by an estoppel to the proposition, that there was a pre- existing legally binding agreement. The court could infer from the circumstances that this legally binding agreement must have come into effect around 6 July. There is some force in that submission, but as I have indicated
I do not need to rule finally on it.

Next, Mr Hughes submitted that the Act did not apply where the agreement occurring after 1 August 1994 was in substance an agreement to vary and extend a pre-existing lease which had been in existence since prior to the beginning of the Act. In other words, he submitted that the Deed of October 1994 was not in any event a retail shop lease, because it was not the agreement under which the defendants granted or agreed to grant a right of occupation: that had happened long before. It was merely an agreement by which the right of occupation was continued and varied, this being a right of occupation that had been granted under the original arrangement of May 1990. Again I imagine that could be a submission of great importance in other cases. It is one I find difficult to decide, and I think in the circumstances it is best that I make no comment on it.

Mr Hughes also relied on ss.42 and 43 of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) and [s.81](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s81.html) of the [Retail Leases
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/). In my opinion the effect of [s.81](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s81.html) is that strictly in order to retain the relief sought by the plaintiff, the plaintiff would need to seek an order under [s.81(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rla1994135/s81.html) against the defendants to execute a lease in registrable form. I think it likely, if this matter had been decisive, that I would have permitted the plaintiff to make any necessary amendment to that effect.

Turning to the question of the Notice to Quit, it seems to me that the Notice to Quit in this case is in terms which are really indistinguishable from those held to be valid in Hartey v. Kolman [(1977) 1 NSW LR 674.] It seems to me that the mere circumstances that under cl.3(e) of the Deed of May the lessors may have been able to give a Notice to Quit for a shorter period, does not affect this question of validity.

The last matter that I mention is that, at the beginning of the hearing, the defendants put on a Notice of Motion seeking in effect a separate hearing dealing with an estoppel issue that they wished to raise. In the light of my findings on the issues that were debated today, I do not need to make a ruling on whether I would permit that course. As I understand the matter, until
Wednesday of this week it was the intention that the whole of the matter be dealt with today. However, that would not be conclusive against granting the
Notice of Motion, but in any event, as I see the situation, I do not need to say more about it 
For the reasons I have given I dismiss the proceedings.

I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants costs.

The exhibits may be returned after twenty eight days if there is no appeal.
