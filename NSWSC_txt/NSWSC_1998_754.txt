REGINA versus ROBERT JOHN WILLIAM RICHARDS /98 April 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: This application for bail is one for which I have very great sympathy. Unfortunately, the applicant comes forward in circumstances where he has breached conditions of a previous bail order and breached a recognizance. 
For the offences in respect of which he presently seeks bail he comes forward for sentence in only a fortnight and he does so in circumstances in which the family that has taken him in, not only speaks in his favour by coming forward and offering the little that is available financially to go surety for him so that he can be at liberty, but also to support him where he, himself, has made it very clear in the witness box that it is his intent to show that he can abide by the rules and is worth being at liberty.

All of this is most estimable. It is appropriately a matter to go forward before the sentencing court rather than this court for the purpose of bail is essentially to ensure that the applicant attends the trial. I have no doubt that this applicant has every intention to attend the trial but the Act in addition refers to specific matters to which I must have regard and that includes the applicant's prior history and his ability, if something should come up to scare him or affect him, to attend for trial and not put Mrs.
Dunne's undertaking at risk. I am not satisfied that the applicant is able to discharge that serious responsibility.

In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that I should grant bail and it is refused. But I direct a copy of these remarks be taken out and provided to the applicant's solicitor together with a copy of the transcript if he should wish to, for use on a sentencing hearing.
