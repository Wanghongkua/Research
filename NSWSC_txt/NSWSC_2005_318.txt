IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
Master Malpass  April 2005  of 2003 Robert Fleet versus RSPCA & Ors  
JUDGMENT  Master: On 23 November 2004 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion. It contains a variety of claims for relief.  The plaintiff commenced these proceedings in 2003. The proceedings concern events which started on 5 March 1997. The original statement of claim was filed on 5 August 2003. So far there have been three attempts at amendments.  Registrar Howe heard applications brought by all defendants involving, inter alia, summary dismissal or the striking out of the plaintiff's process. On 26
October 2004 he delivered his decision on those applications.  He delivered written reasons for his decision. The orders that he made are as follows:  
The proceedings against the fifth defendant are dismissed.  
The plaintiff is to pay the fifth defendant's costs of the proceedings.  
The balance of the amended statement of claim struck out.  
The plaintiff is to pay the first, second, third and fourth defendants' costs of the proceedings.  
The plaintiff is to pay the first, second, and fourth defendants' costs of the applications.  
Leave is granted to the plaintiff to file and serve a Further Amended
Statement of Claim after the first, second, third and fourth defendants' costs of the proceedings and these applications have been paid.  The plaintiff's present notice of motion was set down for hearing as a review of the decision of the Registrar pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p61) r 3 of the [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/). The review took place on Monday 11 April 2005.  In conducting the review the court perused, inter alia, the reasons for the decision of the Registrar, the material he had before him (including the plaintiff's pleading) and the submissions made by the parties during the conduct of the review.  Following that review, I have come to the decision that no basis has been disclosed for disturbing the orders made by the Registrar.  In my view, his decision and orders should be confirmed. The plaintiff's notice of motion is dismissed. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the notice of motion.  If the leave granted by the Registrar is to be exercised, it seems to me that it would be wise to do so with the benefit of legal advice and consideration should be given to the matter being transferred to the District
Court.
