WEDNESDAY 29 NOVEMBER 2006  /06 ANZ BANKING GROUP LIMITED versus JONES  
JUDGMENT - Ex Tempore   HIS HONOUR: This matter comes before me on an oral application for a stay of an order for discovery made by a Registrar. The order for discovery required the plaintiff to discover material identified in paragraphs numbered , 2 and 3 of a letter of 23 October 2006 from Holman Webb to Gadens. While that application for discovery was made orally to the Registrar, it was argued at the time it was made, the plaintiff did not apply for an adjournment, and the plaintiff lost the application.  The application was made at a time when the proceedings had been commenced by a Summons, and there were no other documents to define issues. However, the thrust of the second defendant's position, as disclosed to the plaintiff at that time, was that there were two loans that had been taken out by herself and her husband, one for $360,000 and one for a larger amount. The second defendant had been of the view that the second loan was a consolidated loan that included the amount of the first loan, and not that it was a separate loan. However, as things turned out, it was, indeed, a separate loan. It is her contention that her mistake, and the fact that no-one corrected her mistake, disentitles the bank from recovering the money from her.  There is on foot an appeal against the Registrar's decision. The stay that is sought orally today is pending the hearing of that appeal.  The issue that is involved has been explained to me in the course of the application for a stay. That issue is so simple that it is a waste of everyone's time and money to allow that dispute to continue any longer. In my view, it is appropriate for there to be some discovery, but of a more focussed kind than that ordered by the Registrar.  I order that the plaintiff provide discovery to the second defendant within days of the date of this order, of documents described in paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 of the letter from Holman Webb to Gadens of 23 October 2006, deleting from each of those paragraphs the words "lending policies".
