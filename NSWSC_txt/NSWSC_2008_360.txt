FRIDAY 18 APRIL 2008  /06 DENIS CASSEGRAIN versus GERARD CASSEGRAIN & CO PTY LTD (NO 2) 
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT Consequent upon my publishing my reasons for judgment, I directed the parties to bring in short minutes of order, including an order for the removal of the matter into the Court of Appeal under the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s51.html) as Bryson AJ had done in Coric versus Grotto & Ors; Nelson versus Grotto & Ors;
Estate of Late FA Grotto & Ors  <case> The matter of contention between the parties as to the appropriate orders I should now make centres upon the question of costs. In Coric, Bryson
AJ ordered that the costs of the proceedings before him follow and be paid in accordance with any order for costs to be made by the Court of Appeal upon the application for leave to appeal or on any appeal.
 The defendant submits that a like order should be made by me on the basis that there is no essential difference between this case and the one considered by Bryson AJ. The [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s51.html) treats the application for leave to appeal as having been "for all purposes well commenced" by the filing of the defendant's notice of motion, it is submitted.
 On the other hand, reference is made to the concession in the defendant's outline of submissions on the motion before me that the plaintiff had given notice of two grounds upon which it argued that the application was incompetent, the objection being upheld by me.
 It appears from the decision in Coric at [1] that neither side had adverted to the question of competence of the appeal before Bryson AJ. His
Honour sought further submissions from both sides on the point.
 Furthermore, there was in Coric a determination by his Honour of his own motion to refer the matter for mediation, a circumstance that does not exist in the instant circumstances.
 In my view, the ordinary order for costs following the event should be made.
I am strengthened in that resolve by the circumstances to which I have adverted, that the plaintiff had given the defendant notice that it regarded the defendant's proceedings as incompetent.
 I make orders in terms of the short minutes of order proffered by the plaintiff, initialled by me, dated by me and placed with the papers.
