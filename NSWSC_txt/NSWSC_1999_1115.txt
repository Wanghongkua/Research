OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 122914 of 1997 
WOOD CJ at CL 
FRIDAY 12 NOVEMBER 1999 
THE PROTHONOTARY versus JOHN WILSON HIS HONOUR: When the matter was before me last for sentence, I neglected to deal with the requirements of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s6.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/), which has been brought to my attention.
 PRISONER: Speak up, please.
 HIS HONOUR: The reasons for the order, I think, were otherwise obvious, but in order to be clear about it, I will state that in accordance with the requirements of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s6.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/), I specify that I have imposed fixed term sentences for the two offences of contempt of which the defendant has been convicted, rather than sentences offering the opportunity for release on parole, because of his refusal to acknowledge the criminality involved in the throwing of paint bombs at a judicial officer. In the absence of any sign of contrition or of insight on his part into the wrongness of his conduct and in the presence of his belligerent defiance of the Court, it is evident that no purpose whatsoever will be served by a period of supervised release on parole and, accordingly, in the imposition of a sentence structured so as to include a minimum and an additional term. The court will now adjourn.
