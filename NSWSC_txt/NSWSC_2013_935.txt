EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
By summons filed in February 2012 the New South Wales Crime Commission sought orders against the defendant under [s 31D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s31d.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). The application was supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the Commission's Director (Financial Investigations), in which he explained the basis upon which he suspected that the defendant had engaged in 'serious crime related activity', as defined in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the Act. 
On 17 September 2012 orders were made by Hall J under [s 31D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s31d.html) for the examination of the defendant and the provision of a certain statement. 
Today the parties ask the Court to make orders in terms which have been filed granting the Commission leave to amend its summons, to seek a forfeiture order under [s 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the Act in relation to some $57,555 cash seized from the defendant, as well as orders under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) and [s 10B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html), in relation to identified property of the defendant and dismissing the unexplained wealth order application. 
The parties have also agreed to the terms of a release given by the defendant in favour of the Commission and as to costs.
In the circumstances before the Court I am satisfied that the parties' agreement should be given effect and that orders made in the terms which their solicitors have executed, should be made. I order accordingly.
