ORDER . Bring up the record of the District Court (91/12/1051) in the matter of the appeal of Barry John Cassell; 
Order that the purported order of his Honour Judge Downs therein, quashing the convictions of the said Barry John Cassell and dismissing the information laid against him, be quashed by order of this Court;  .

Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination by the Court of
Criminal Appeal; and  . Order that the opponent pay the costs of the DPP in this Court but have, in respect of such costs, a certificate under the [Suitors' Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
JUDGE1
KIRBY P: The summons before the Court seeks judicial review of orders made by
Downs DCJ. By those orders, his Honour dismissed certain informations charging
Mr Barry Cassell (the first opponent) with certain offences. The Director of
Public Prosecutions (DPP) (the claimant) asserts that the apparent orders were not lawfully made. He contends that they followed a refusal by his Honour to state a case, as requested by the DPP's counsel, for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Involved in the determination of the summons, upon the basis of the record of the District Court placed before this Court, are three questions:
Whether in the circumstances, Downs DCJ erred in law in declining to state a case for the opinion of the Court of
Criminal Appeal; 
Whether this error was one made within jurisdiction (and thus not amenable to judicial review) or whether it amounted to a constructive refusal to exercise jurisdiction and invalidated the orders which followed it (authorising the issue of orders by this Court quashing the purported orders made by Downs DCJ); and 
Whether, having regard to the fact that
Downs DCJ's orders quashed the earlier conviction of Mr Cassell on criminal charges and dismissed the informations, this
Court could, and should, provide relief to the DPP, in the exercise of its discretion to issue orders prerogative in nature.
 
An accused is convicted and appeals to the District Court
In July 1991, Mr Cassell was charged with four counts of giving false evidence. The informations, placed before this Court, disclose that the charges related to evidence given by Mr Cassell in September 1989, on oath, at a hearing before the Independent Commission Against Corruption. It was alleged that the false evidence was given contrary to [s 87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/icaca1988442/s87.html) of the [Independent
Commission Against Corruption Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/icaca1988442/). The informations give certain particulars of the allegedly false evidence. They are four in number.
Respectively, they allege that the evidence was false in a material particular, viz by stating: that he did not have business dealings with Thomas
Edward
Paul Hogan, a councillor of Tweed Shire Council; that he did not participate in the business, nor share in the profits, of Consultants Corporation (Holdings)
Australia Pty Limited; that he did not have business dealings with Michael John
Ross; and that he did not share in the profits of Consultants
Corporation (Holdings) Australia Pty Limited.
 .
All such evidence was allegedly "false to the knowledge of" Mr Cassell.
Mr Cassell pleaded not guilty before the Local Court of New South Wales.
The informations were heard by Mr J. Stevenson, Local Court Magistrate. On 4
September 1992, Mr Cassell was convicted in respect of the four informations.
He appealed against those convictions to the District Court. In accordance with the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), his appeal was by way of complete rehearing. The hearing was conducted by Downs DCJ on 28 November 1994.
On the return of the appeal, counsel for Mr Cassell took a preliminary objection in respect of the informations and particulars provided by the prosecution.
In the District Court, that prosecution had been taken over by the DPP in the name of the Crown. Counsel for Mr Cassell submitted that the informations were defective in that they did not set forth the requisite particulars which had been and were therefore bad in law. He relied upon the authority of the High Court of Australia in John L. Pty Limited v
AttorneyGeneral for New South Wales <case>; [(1987) 163 CLR 508], 519 and the authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State in Stanton versus Abernathy and Anor [(1990) 19 NSWLR 656 (CCA)], 660. He placed before Downs DCJ requests for particulars which had been addressed to the DPP and answers received. As found by his
Honour, those answers did not "go any further than to set forth parcels of evidence (before the Independent Commission Against Corruption) upon which the Crown sought to rely".
Downs DCJ reserved his decision on the submission for Mr Cassell that the informations were defective. On the following day, 29 November 1994, his
Honour proceeded to give his decision on the preliminary objection. It is what then occurred that has given rise to the proceedings in this Court.
 
The primary judge declines to state a case
Having recounted the background facts, set out two of the four informations, and having quoted from passages in the judgments in John L.
Pty
Limited and Stanton, the transcript discloses what then occurred: "HIS HONOUR: ...
 give proper consideration lo the informations in the absence of a properly formulated and particularised charge, Stanton v
Abernathy, [(1990) 19 NSWLR 656] at p 662 F. It follows that the informations are insufficient in law and invalid 
As I indicated earlier the informations concerning Mr Ross are laid in the same form and they do not require any separate or further considerations.

I dismiss all four appeals--" 
PROSECUTOR: Before your Honour does that-HIS HONOUR: Yes, I withdraw that then.

PROSECUTOR: Would your Honour grant me a short time for an adjournment so to seek some instructions in relation what may be required by those who instruct me.

HIS HONOUR: All right, certainly.

PROSECUTOR: I am not hiding I am thinking of a stated case or something along those lines.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, well can we state a case on this? 
PROSECUTOR: Well, perhaps not, your Honour, but it is something that I feel that I should get instructions on before his Honour proceeds further...
 (a short adjoumment followed) 
HIS HONOUR: Yes, Mr Crown? 
PROSECUTOR: Yes, may it please your Honour, your Honour pursuant to <case> of the
Criminal Appeal Act I'd ask your Honour to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination in relation to this matter.

HIS HONOUR: I have decided the matter.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, in my respectful submission, your
Honour hasn't dismissed, sorry, your Honour has not upheld the
Appeal at this stage and up until that occurs, your Honour, in my respectful submission, 5B applies.

For the above reasons it is not possible to 
HIS HONOUR: Just a moment. There is direct authority on this.
 
PROSECUTOR: The authority, your Honour, is that I read from: 
HIS HONOUR: Why should I, why should I state a case? Now let me explain. I have decided the matter and of course, the Crown would have a right to appeal.

PROSECUTOR:
I'm sorry, your Honour? 
HIS HONOUR: I have decided the matter-- 
PROSECUTOR: Yes-- 
HIS HONOUR: Or when I say the magic words, I will have decided the matter and the Crown, of course, would have the right to appeal to the-- 
PROSECUTOR:
Under what section, your Honour. The Crown's got no right of appeal on the dismissal of the information (Discussion ensued on this point) 
PROSECUTOR: In relation to your Honour's first question, in my respectful submission a Judge should state a case when asked to do so when the stage has been reached for it to become proper, because if it was stated in this case, we've only had the argument on the sufficiency of the information-- 
HIS HONOUR: Yes.

PROSECUTOR: Coming up to what was coming from your Honour, towards the - you know, part of that I could see what was coming, I stood up.

HIS HONOUR:
Oh, that's all right.

PROSECUTOR: Endeavouring to obtain your Honour's attention, but when your Honour went about-- 
HIS HONOUR: That's all right.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour said a few words, then withdrew them.

HIS HONOUR: There's no criticism of you, Mr Crown.

PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, in my respectful submission, Ditmar's case, provides authority for the proposition that the Judge should state a case whenever he's able to do so. That is The
Queen and Ditmar, [(1973), 1 NSWLR 722.] 
HIS HONOUR: Do you have that authority? 
PROSECUTOR: I've got a copy of it, your Honour, I've only got the one copy unfortunately during the - I had time to get some photocopies done but not everything.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes, I haven't read that in detail. Anything further Mr Crown? 
PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well I do not propose to state a case. I am satisfied that I had delivered my final judgment even though I had not made my final orders I had delivered in my judgment, and as you said it was quite apparent during the course of it what my findings would be, and therefore it is too late to ask for a case to be stated. Your application is refused.

PROSECUTOR: May it please your Honour.

HIS
HONOUR: It remains for me to make the final orders now. I uphold the appeals in the four matters and I quash the four convictions.

COUNSEL FOR ACCUSED: The appeal is upheld and the informations are dismissed in each case.

HIS HONOUR: I quash the convictions and the informations are dismissed."
The DPP contends that, in refusing in the circumstances to state a case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Downs DCJ erred in law; that this caused his Honour to decline to enter upon a jurisdiction then lawfully invoked by the DPP; that the orders which followed were therefore misconceived and outside lawful jurisdiction; and that this Court would provide relief in the nature of certiorari and mandamus to quash the invalid orders made and to require Downs
DCJ to state a case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal
Appeal before proceeding to dispose of the appeal.
 
The duty to state a case when asked
The first question is whether, in the circumstances disclosed by the record (which the parties have agreed includes the transcript set out above),
Downs DCJ erred in refusing, when asked, to state a case for the opinion of the Court of
Criminal Appeal. The relevant statutory requirement is found in [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). It states: "5B. A judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on an appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before him to the
Court of Criminal Appeal for determination and the Court of
Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit."
Although the section is expressed in permissive terms, the obligation cast by it upon a judge of the District Court (as formerly upon the
Chairman of Quarter Sessions) is a rigorous one. This was explained by Jordan CJ in Ex parte McGavin; re Byrne and Ors <case>; [(1945) 46 SR 58 (FC)], 60f: "The word 'may' is prima facie facultative only; but it was pointed out in Macdougall versus Patterson <case>; [(1851) 11 CB 755] at that "when a statute confers an authority to do a judicial act in a certain case, it is imperative on those so authorised, to exercise the authority when the case arises, and its exercise is duly applied for by a party interested and having the right to make the application ... In my opinion it is the duty of a Chairman of Quarter Sessions to submit to the Court of Criminal Appeal any question of law which either party to the appeal may raise and ask to be so submitted unless, in his opinion, the question is so obviously frivolous and baseless that its submission would be an abuse of process."
That was a case where an accused person was convicted before a magistrate. The Chairman of Quarter Sessions overruled an objection to the exercise of summary jurisdiction, as had the magistrate earlier. He refused an application to submit a question of jurisdiction to the Court of Criminal
Appeal under [s 5B.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) The Full Court made absolute, with costs, a rule nisi for statutory prohibition. It did so to uphold the law, including the legal obligation of the Chairman of Quarter Sessions to conform, when reasonably asked to do so, with the requirements of [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
The foregoing authority has been applied many times in this State. For an historical explanation of the procedure, see Ward v Williams <case>; [(1955) 92 CLR ] is referred to. It is true that once an appeal has been upheld or dismissed, or the appellant convicted or acquitted, a case may no longer be stated for the opinion of the
Court of Criminal Appeal. This may variously be explained upon the footing that the appeal is no longer "before" the judge of the District Court, or that the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal, stated pursuant to a submission under [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) would have no further utility, the District Court having concluded its part in the appeal from the Local Court. The whole point of referring the question of law for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal is to secure the order or direction of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the District Court which will govern the disposition of the proceedings in that Court. See R v
Garnet-Thomas [(1974) 1 NSWLR 702 (CCA)], 706 where Jacobs P explained: "It seems to me that it is open to the chairman of quarter sessions now, in the light of these decisions, to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal at any stage of the proceedings before acquittal or conviction, or before upholding or dismissing the appeal, but that thereafter he can never state such a case. I do not think it is necessary that he should have indicated his result or his intended result one way or the other. That is a factor not relevant to the power given to him under [s 5B."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html)
In Garnet-Thomas, Jacobs P referred to R versus Lazarevic (1966) 85 WN [(Pt 1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s1.html) (CCA). There the District Court judge had made final orders in the appeal to the Quarter Sessions. He was thus held to be functus officio. The [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), [s 125(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s125.html) contemplates that the appeal does not conclude until the District Court makes its order. Decisions, comments, expressions of opinion and even findings made in the course of an appeal, although necessary for the formulation of the final order, do not have the fatal effect of disqualifying the District Court judge from the power to state a case under [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). The judge is not so disqualified until the final order is pronounced. Cf. Kopuz versus District Court of New South Wales [(1992) 28 NSWLR 232 (CA)], 244. This is because, as Lord Denning MR once explained, until the final order, no cause is lost and no decision made which cannot by persuasion, reconsideration (and in the case of an opinion stated pursuant to a submission of a question under [s 5B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html), an order or direction of the Court of Criminal Appeal, produce a different result from that to which the judge has earlier proceeded.
That the foregoing represents the law in this jurisdiction, was recently reaffirmed by Hunt J (with the concurrence of Grove and Allen JJ) in the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State in Budget Nursery Pty Limited versus Commissioner of Taxation [(1989) 42 A Crim R 81 (CCA).] That was a case where the District
Court judge was considering an appeal against a conviction and sentence of the
Local Court of offences against the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/). After the judge had commenced giving his reasons for judgment, indeed after he had stated his finding that the appeals against conviction would be dismissed but before making a formal ruling on the sentence which he would impose, the judge was requested by counsel for the appellant not to give his decision but to state a case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
In that Court, it was held that the judge was still authorised to state a case, as the appeal against the sentence imposed by the Local Court had not been concluded when he did so. The facts were not entirely dissimilar to the present. The judge had announced, more clearly than in the present case, that the appeal was dismissed, the conviction and findings of the magistrate were confirmed and he then went on to address the issue of sentence. Hunt J explains (at 82): "A question therefore arises at the outset as to whether by that stage any power remained to state a case to this court. Section
B does not in terms limit the time in which a stated case may be requested The case must, however, relate to a question of law arising "on" the appeal, and the judge must be requested during the hearing of the appeal - before coming to his final judgment - to state it: Ditmar (1973) I NSWLR 722 at 725.

The purpose of the stated case procedure is not to provide an appeal after the judge has made his decision; the purpose is to provide him with the assistance in coming to his decision. Once the appeal to the District Court has been upheld or dismissed or the defendant has been convicted or acquitted, a case can no longer be stated: Garnet-Thomas [(1974) 1 NSWLR 702] at 706. It does not matter that the judge has already indicated what he intends to do: Garnet-Thomas at 706; as long as there has not been a "formal" dismissal of the appeal or other appropriate order disposing of it: Fraser [(1977) 2 NSWLR 867] at 875."
Having regard to the foregoing clear authority, I have concluded, with respect to Downs DCJ, that at the time counsel for the DPP interrupted his
Honour's giving of reasons foreshadowed and then pressed an application to his
Honour to state a case, it was competent for Downes DCJ to accede to that request. Indeed, he was obliged by authority to do so, unless convinced that the application was frivolous. Various indications make it clear that his
Honour retained the power which was invoked. He had not made formal orders disposing of the appeal. Insofar as any order was foreshadowed, it was a mistaken one, viz "dismissal" of the four appeals. Even if this is taken to have meant dismissal of the four informations, it was not so expressed. It fell far short of the formal entry of orders of the District Court. The "orders" were, in any case, in terms, withdrawn by his Honour before orders were formally entered. His Honour granted the adjournment to permit the DPP to take instructions. No objection was taken to that course by counsel for Mr
Cassell. Later, his Honour seems to have been persuaded not to accede to the
DPP's request, believing that he was not in law entitled to do so. He considered that he had said "the magic words". But the transcript, which is the record of the District
Court for this purpose, reveals that he had certainly not done so.
Downs DCJ seems also to have been affected by a belief that the Crown had a right of appeal against his orders. This was also not so, as the DPP pointed out. The decision in Hookham v
R [(1994) 68 ALJR 900] to which his Honour referred, did not govern the matter. The long line of established authority which I have collected above, did.
It is therefore clear that a mistake has occurred. It was a mistake which governed what then occurred before Downs DCJ. It deprived the DPP of the right to have a case stated for the opinion (and possible orders) of the Court of
Criminal Appeal. I do not regard the exercise of that right as frivolous or vexatious in the circumstances. Nor did Downs DCJ suggest that it was. The orders which followed, disposing of the appeal, were the direct result of the refusal of Downs DCJ to state a case as the law permitted and obliged him to do.
 
The error was outside jurisdiction [Section 146](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) provides: "No certiorari
No conviction or order of a Justice ... or adjudication upon appeal of the District Court shall be removed by any order into the Supreme Court."
The general object of this section is to prohibit the grant of relief in the nature of the prerogative writs directed by this Court to the District
Court. However, it has long been established that an order made without jurisdiction, or in excess of jurisdiction, does not fall within the prohibition stated in [s 146.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html) See Ex parte Blackwell; re Hateley and Anor WN [(Pt 1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s1.html) [109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s109.html); [(1965) NSWR 1061 (SC)], 245. A distinction has been drawn in the cases between those circumstances where the judicial officer has wrongly exercised jurisdiction and where there is, in substance, a failure, or refusal, to exercise jurisdiction. In respect of the former, [s 146](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html) operates to prohibit relief from this Court. But not in respect of the latter.
The distinction is supported by the authorities considered by the High Court of Australia in Public Service Association of South Australia versus Federated
Clerks' Union of Australia, South Australian
Branch <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 132], 140ff.
See also Kopuz versus District Court of New South Wales and Anor [(1992) 28 NSWLR (CA)], 262.
In Roos, at 262, Handley JA stated: "The general rule is that an erroneous exercise of a statutory discretion is an error within jurisdiction and does not involve an excess of jurisdiction: compare McArthur v Williams [(1936) 55 CLR 324] at 364-366 and Public Service
Association (SA) versus Federated Clerks' Union (at 151-152). The situation is otherwise where a decision-maker has misconstrued his authority and exercised a discretionary power he did not possess: see Public Service
Association v Federated Clerks' Union."
For Mr Cassell it was put predicably enough, that Downs DCJ had merely mistaken the boundaries of his undoubted discretion to state a case when requested to do so. But he had proceeded to make orders which were not void.
They were valid orders. They terminated the proceedings. They were no longer susceptible to the provision to the District
Court of any opinion by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The District Court had concluded its part in the appeal.
It was functus officio.
Pursuant to the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), [s 125(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s125.html) it had "by its order" adjudicated the appeal which was now at an end.
Whilst it is often difficult to assign particular judicial action to the category (on the one hand) of an erroneous exercise of jurisdiction or (on the other) a purported exercise of jurisdiction which did not exist, I entertain no doubt as to which is the proper classification of what Downs DCJ did here.
His Honour clearly mistook the boundaries of his jurisdiction to state a case for the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal, although that jurisdiction had (as I have shown) been lawfully invoked. He declined to state a case but only under a mistaken understanding of his jurisdiction to do so. All that then followed was a consequence of his refusing to state a case. The purported "order" by which he determined the appeal, did not have the benefit of the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal upon the point which the DPP wished and asked to reserve. It was therefore not merely the result of a mistake by the learned Judge within jurisdiction which he undoubtedly had.
It involved a departure from his jurisdiction which left the purported order flawed in a way susceptible to correction by order of this Court.
It is true that it was clearly open to Downs DCJ to reach, within the jurisdiction which he possessed, an opinion as to the adequacy or otherwise, of the informations as expressing the essential components of the respective offences charged. Similarly, it was open to his Honour to reach a conclusion about the failure of the DPP for the Crown adequately to specify the charges and properly to particularise them. Likewise, it was open to him (after due opportunity of correction) to provide relief to Mr Cassell to uphold the requirements of law as to specificity of charges and particularisation thereof. But a request that he should first obtain an opinion of the Court of
Criminal Appeal, obliged him in the circumstances, to delay giving effect to his own inclinations until the Court of Criminal Appeal had first had the chance to provide its opinion and order. I am confirmed in my approach in this respect by what this Court held in Dawes (above). See p 246. Once there was an order [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) had no application. But that meant a lawful order; not one made in mistake of the jurisdiction possessed by the judge. Seen in this light, this Court intervenes not to usurp the lawful jurisdiction of the District Court, but to uphold it and to ensure that it is exercised according to law. An order of judicial review may therefore prima facie issue from the Court to the District Court.
 
Judicial review may be granted
The foregoing conclusions bring me to the two final controversies in this summons. The first was the question whether, following the order dismissing the informations (and the certificate which issued to Mr Cassell, Ex C), this
Court is empowered to issue relief in the nature of the prerogative writs of certiorari and mandamus to quash the purported orders of dismissal and to direct Downs DCJ to resume the trial, stating the case as requested by the DPP and withholding further action under the Court of Criminal Appeal's opinion or order is received. Some old authority, in relation to the prerogative writs themselves, casts doubt upon the Court's power - either as a matter of jurisdiction or discretion where, in effect, an acquittal has been pronounced in a criminal trial. Thus, in Reg versus Duncan [(1881) 7 QBD 198], Lord Coleridge CJ said at 199, in respect of an application for a writ of certiorari where there had been an acquittal by an inferior court: "It is plain that we cannot interfere. What may have been the constitutional legal principles on which the practice was founded it is much too late to enquire. The practice of the Courts has been settled for centuries, and it is that in all cases of a criminal kind where a prisoner or defendant is in danger of imprisonment no new trial will be granted if the prisoner or defendant having stood in that danger, has been acquitted."
This principle was affirmed by the King's
Bench Division in England in
Rex versus Simpson [(1914) 1 KB 66.] At 71, Ridley J said: "That is a principle which I think we should be very slow to transgress. It is true that the charge in the present case was not one of a very serious character, but the principle involved is one of great importance, and if it were once assailed by the introduction of exceptions, they might in course of time be applied to very different cases.
If, therefore, I find that these defendants have once stood in danger and have been acquitted, then in my opinion this 
Court ought not to grant a certiorari to quash the acquittal."
Ridley J cited with approval the Irish decision in Rex v Justices of
Galway [(1906) 2 IR 499] where Lord O'Brien CJ said, at 502: "The question is this - can an order of acquittal pronounced by justices at petty sessions, or by a chairman and justices at quarter sessions, one of whom was biased, be brought up on certiorari and quashed so that the accused may be subjected to trial again? There is no instance in the history of our law of an acquittal under such circumstances being brought up on certiorari. What is the principle? That a man cannot be put in peril twice for the same offence. Was this man put in peril before the tribunal that is alleged to be biased? I am of the opinion that he was, and for this reason that the order of a biased tribunal is voidable only and not void ... Now, if the order is voidable only, and not void, the accused was in peril when he stood before the tribunal. Though in this case he was acquitted, he might have been convicted."
There is an understandable public policy behind the principle to which the Lords Chief Justices of England and
Ireland gave expression in the foregoing cases. It is a principle recognised in international human rights law. Thus, in the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 14.7, it is stated: "14.7 No-one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country."
Australia has ratified the International Covenant. It has adhered to the
First Optional Protocol to give effect to its terms. In case of doubt in the exposition of the common law, this Court may have regard to the principles of the International
Covenant in elucidating the common law. See Mabo v
Queensland (No. 2) [(1992) 175 CLR 1], 430, 447. However, not only does the principle (above) refer to the law of a country which may elaborate and elucidate the rule against double jeopardy. Inherent in the expression of the principle (above) is the notion that an acquittal must have been lawfully and validly entered. Thus, if an acquittal as such were not entered or if it were entered as a result of a slip, clerical mistake, mistake of identity or similar error, it would not be an "acquittal" of the person as the law, or the international principle, contemplates.
There was much debate before this Court as to whether Mr Cassell stood in peril of imprisonment and whether the final order of Downs DCJ was void or voidable. I regard that as a barren controversy. There is no express limitation on the powers of this Court to provide relief under the [Supreme
Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). There is no absolute embargo in the case of a purported order of dismissal of charges or of acquittal. Nevertheless, this Court would provide its relief in terms analogous to the ancient writs. Recent Australian authority has made it plain that as a matter of jurisdiction, relief in the nature of certiorari may be ordered notwithstanding that its effect is to quash an order of acquittal.
See eg Davern versus Messell <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR 21], 112; Reg versus Middlesex
Quarter Sessions (Chairman), Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions  <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 137 (HC)],
But the reasoning which found favour with the High Court in Davern and in
Benz is that expressed by Professor Friedland in
Double Jeopardy, 1969, 293.
This draws a distinction between an acquittal of an accused person, as by a jury after a trial on the merits, and an acquittal in one tier of the court structure where what has occurred is "such a mistrial as to render the proceedings a nullity": "Once the case is in the appellate hierarchy there is no logical reason why the matter should not be determined -
assuming that the point involved is of sufficient importance to warrant the attention of the Court - by the very highest tribunal. There can be no surprise or unfairness; the accused simply takes the appellate structure as he finds it.
If the House of Lords agrees with the Court of Criminal
Appeal then the accused has no complaint; if it disagrees, then the accused is simply back in at least as good a position as he was before invoking the appellate process."
By analogous reasoning, if an accused has been discharged upon an order of a technical nature, but it has been found that this discharge followed an error of the judge in failing to accede to a procedure which would have permitted him to have the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the accused can scarcely complain about a later order correcting the error. The result of this Court's intervention is not to substitute a conviction for the order of discharge. An acquittal may still ultimately follow. It is simply to require that the matter proceed to be decided according to law. There is no value which it is more important for the courts of this country to uphold than the rule of law. It is that rule which ultimately underpins the rights of the accused and the defence of their rights and the fundamental human rights of all.
That this is the law in this jurisdiction is made clear by the recent authority of the Court in New South
Wales Meat Industry Authority versus Randall and Anor (1994) 1 NSW Cts Rev #8, 84 (CA). In that case, at 87, Mahoney JA said: ". .
If the proceeding has been withdrawn, ordinarily the rule will not prevent a subsequent proceeding. In the present case, the matter was not disposed of on the merits or as a result of a formal and substantial hearing. There was, for example, no hearing at which Mr Randall gave evidence and the judge made findings for him. As I have indicated, the proceeding was dismissed simply because, in the absence of notice, the Authority did not appear. This, in my opinion, does not involve an application of the rule.
The judge did not consider the information in any way. I appreciate that, on quashing of the order for acquittal, if it be such, the accused will have to attend a further hearing of the proceeding on which before the magistrate, he was convicted But by reason of the Court's error, the accused could not, in reality, be convicted by the judge.
Thai is, I think not a "hearing on the merits" for the purpose of this rule."
A like point was made many years earlier by Cardozo
J in Palco v
Connecticut <case>; [302 US 319] (1937) at 328: "The state is not attempting to wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials. It asks no more than this, that the case ... shall go on until there be a trial free from the corrosion of substantial legal error."
See also Reg versus Morgentaler et al (1985) 52 OR (2nd) 353 (Ont CA), 403.
By analogous reasoning, I do not consider that what happened before Downs
DCJ was a hearing on the merits of the appeal before the District Court. The order which his Honour finally entered, whether an acquittal or not, was not an order which followed such a hearing on the merits which this Court would be loath indeed to disturb. Cf. Bridie versus Messina [(1965) 66 SR 446 (FC)];
Nadilo versus The Director of Public Prosecutions and Anor, Court of Appeal , unreported, 15 February 1995; (1995) NSWJB 10. Mr
Cassell succeeded on a technical point. He can now hardly complain if the DPP takes a substantial point, fundamental to the hearing in which the earlier order was made. Now the
DPP asserts before this Court that the judge mistook his jurisdiction and declined to exercise it as the law permitted and required. At least in a case such as the present, therefore, judicial review in the nature of certiorari may issue. It may do so although it will have the effect of quashing a dismissal of the charges, a discharge of the appellant and, possibly a technical acquittal.
 
The discretion should be exercised
The final point urged for Mr Cassell was that the
Court would not, as a matter of discretion, provide relief to the DPP in the circumstances of this case. There is a controversy as to the extent and content of the discretion to issue public law remedies. The controversy arises from the fact that the community has an interest in upholding the rule of law. That interest is not confined to the parties to the litigation. Conventionally, however, it is considered that a court whose jurisdiction to grant judicial review is invoked, has a residual discretion to provide relief or to withhold it. I shall assume that that is so in this case.
A number of considerations were referred to on Mr Cassell's behalf in support of the argument that the Court should withhold relief in the exercise of its discretion: 
Mr Cassell heard the order quashing his convictions and dismissing the information brought against him pronounced in open court. He walked from the court a person apparently discharged by a lawful order of a judge, subsequently formalised in a certificate of acquittal.
These are the public formalities of our system of justice. They should not be lightly undone; 
The quashing of the convictions and discharge of Mr Cassell followed what was held to be an obdurate refusal of the Crown, right to the last moment, to provide appropriate specification of the charge in the informations and proper particularisation as the law insists upon. The adequate specification of criminal charges is a high public policy of great importance. The orders in the instant case serve to uphold that policy and to remind the Crown and the DPP of it; 
It had not been shown that the DPP was likely to succeed in the Court of Criminal Appeal so as to make the provision of an opinion by that court on a question of law determinative of the outcome of the proceedings or such as was likely to have caused
Downs DCJ to alter the course which he ultimately took; 
As a matter of general principle, the High Court and the
Court of Criminal Appeal of this State have already clarified the law in question. No social utility would be served by the mere application of the settled principles to the facts of this case. That could properly be left to the primary judge; 
Then it was said that the DPP had not sufficiently specified its application for Downs DCJ as to whether he was obliged to state a case. There is no merit in this objection. The transcript sufficiently discloses the assertion by the DPP, with reference to relevant authority, of his Honour's obligation to state a case. If Downs DCJ had been correct in his belief that the time had passed for the stating of a case, it would not have been competent for him, in law, to state any case - even one relating to his powers in that regard. As, in my view, the time for stating a case had not passed, it was necessary, in the circumstances, for his Honour to state a case on the substantive matter raised before him; and 
The events out of which the charge arose allegedly occurred as long ago as 1987 and concerned evidence given to the
Independent Commission Against Corruption in 1989. Mr Cassell had had the charges "hanging over his head" for three years. He had been in peril of the sentence of imprisonment imposed in the
Local Court when he appeared before Downs DCJ. He should not face the double jeopardy of the restoration of that peril, which he was entitled to regard as having been lifted from him by
Downs DCJ's orders.
I take all of these discretionary considerations into account. It is true that Mr Cassell walked from the Court with an apparent dismissal of the informations against him and secured a certificate of acquittal. But as I have demonstrated, these were the result of serious jurisdictional error. They were scarcely the product of a trial of the important allegations against Mr
Cassell on the merits of those charges. It is not appropriate to foreshadow what the Court of Criminal Appeal might have said in answer to a stated case, or what it might now say once the proceedings are revived.
It is sufficient for me to observe that the invocation of that Court's jurisdiction is an important facility to the parties and to the District Court itself. It is not futile in the instant case. It would have been open to Downs DCJ, having concluded as he apparently did, to afford the DPP an adjournment, even for an hour or so, to require proper specification and particularisation. The sanction of dismissal of proceedings in such a case is an ultimate one, protective of the Court's process. But it should be reserved to occasions where other attempts at rectification have failed. The jurisdiction invoked under [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) is particular to the case in hand. It is no answer to a refusal to conform to a request under the section that no new law would be stated. It is the nature of the jurisdiction invoked that it concerns the application of the law to the particular case in which it is asked for.
Whilst it is true that Mr Cassell has been facing criminal charges, and was for a time in peril of the sentence of imprisonment which the magistrate imposed, it is also true that the result of the earlier hearing has been a departure from compliance with the law as it is understood in this State.
Upholding the legitimate expectations of persons who have been publicly discharged is important. But so also is upholding due process of law in the courts, hearing charges of serious offences against an Act such as the [Independent Commission Against Corruption Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/icaca1988442/). In compliance with established authority, should the opinion on a point of law from the Court of Criminal
Appeal require that the
District Court proceed to a hearing of the charges against Mr Cassell, and should he be convicted of those charges, the events which have occurred (including his apparent discharge) would clearly be taken into account in the consideration by the District Court of the order which it should make in the circumstances. See, e.g. R versus Tail and Bartley [(1979) 24 ALR (FFC)], 476.
Even if it should be accepted that judicial review, disturbing an apparent order of discharge, should be conserved to cases involving special circumstances, I am of the view that such circumstances have been shown in this case. I would grant the DPP the relief which he seeks.
 
Orders
The following orders should be made: 
Bring up the record of the District Court (91/12/1051) in the matter of the appeal of Barry John Cassell; 
Order that the purported order of his Honour Judge Downs therein, quashing the convictions of the said Barry John Cassell and dismissing the information laid against him, be quashed by order of this
Court;
Order that the proceedings be returned to the District
Court for consideration according to law, of the application by the
DPP that the judge of the District Court submit a question of law arising in the appeal to that Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal; and 
Order that the opponent pay the costs of the DPP in this
Court but have, in respect of such costs, a certificate under the [Suitors'
Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
JUDGE2
PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with the conclusions reached by Kirby P.
In this case there was no acquittal on the merits, or according to law.
That could not happen until, at least, the District Court Judge exercised jurisdiction under <case> of the Criminal appeal Act 1912, as he was requested to do. He apparently thought the request was made too late. The cases discussed by Kirby P show he was wrong in this. He thus wrongly declined to exercise jurisdiction.
In my opinion this court has jurisdiction to make orders in the nature of mandamus in this case: see In re Harrington [(1984) AC 743]; New South Wales Meat Authority versus Randall (CA 20 April 1994).
The case seems to me to be one where it is appropriate that orders in the nature of mandamus should be made. I see no reason why the charges against Mr
Cassell should not be dealt with according to law, nor why "acquittals" not according to law should stand, where they were not obtained after a hearing on the merits of the case.
I agree with the orders proposed by Kirby P.
JUDGE3
POWELL JA: I have read, in draft, the Judgments which have been prepared by
Kirby P and Priestley JA.
I agree that, in the circumstances, Downs DCJ fell into error when he declined to state a case pursuant to the provisions of [s.5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal
Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), and, having done so, made the Orders which he did. So, too, do I agree that his Honour's error was such that, subject to the effect to be given, in law, to the Orders which he made, it might be corrected by this
Court making Orders which are prerogative in nature.
I am, however, unable to agree that the Orders which Downs DCJ made are properly to be described as "an acquittal", a description which, at least for the purposes of "the double jeopardy rule", contemplates that there should first have been a hearing on the merits of a criminal charge by a court of competent jurisdiction. On the contrary, the function of an information, or indictment, being to found the jurisdiction of the relevant court to deal with an alleged offence, and the rule of the common law being that an information, or indictment, was defective in law, and invalid - and thus should be quashed - if it failed to inform the relevant court of the nature of the offence alleged, and the manner in which it was said to have occurred, to conclude, as
Downs DCJ did, that, in the circumstances, the informations were incurably defective, was to do no more than determine that the court had no jurisdiction to deal with the alleged offences and that, accordingly, the informations ought to be dismissed. The course which was followed on the hearing before
Downs DCJ was, thus, in substance, no different from that which was formerly followed when an accused demurred to an indictment, or from that which is now followed when an accused moves to quash an indictment (see, for example, John
L Pty. Limited v. Attorney-General  <case>; [(1987) 163 CLR 508)], in the light of which fact it is not without point to note that [s.5C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5c.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) - which was not said to apply in the present case - provides a right of appeal in Crown proceedings in which any information or indictment or any count thereof has been quashed.
Subject to this comment, I agree with the Orders proposed by Kirby P, and his reasons for so doing.
