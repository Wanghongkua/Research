K Metry Building Co P/L versus Joukhdor [1997] NSWSC 42 (19 February 1997) `K METRY BUILDING CO PTY LTD versus JOUKHDOR` `1013/97` `19 February 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is an application made by a builder to extend the caveat over land on which it was erecting a building, pursuant to what is rather enigmatically called a "plain English building agreement edition 9". Clause 20 of that document says:` `"If there is an amount outstanding, including any legal fees and costs associated with recovering that amount under this Agreement the Owner agrees that the Land on which the Building Works are being undertaken is hereby charged in favour of the Contractor to such outstanding amount. This clause shall not merge on completion."` `` ` I must confess that I find this verbiage extremely obscure. Presumably the last sentence means on completion of the building rather than completion of anything else, but it is not the usual sense in which those words are used.
For the clause to apply there must be an amount outstanding under the agreement. It is extremely doubtful to my mind whether, if an agreement is terminated and the contractor sues for loss of profit, that is loss of the contract, that that is a claim "under this Agreement". The point is doubtful and there are arguments either way, and in an appropriate case where everything else was equal the court might think that the caveat to protect such a claim may have substance and, upon taking an undertaking as to damages, extend the caveat. However, there are two reasons why that cannot happen in the instant case. The first is that as Mr Cohen for the owner submitted, the evidence shows that no moneys were owing under the agreement for the simple reason that progress claims, which are the principal basis for the contractor's claim, were only to be paid if the financing bank agreed. As a consequence of the report of the quantity surveyor obtained by the owner, the bank did not agree. A precondition to moneys becoming outstanding, accordingly, was not fulfilled and it would seem on the evidence before me more likely than not that there was no amount outstanding within the meaning of clause 20.` `` The second reason is that the caveat is completely bad in form. It claims "moneys outstanding under building agreement". That does not comply with the
Act by stating an "estate or interest in the land" which the caveator claims.
Miss Olssen for the plaintiff indicated that if the present caveat went she would seek to lodge a substitute caveat protecting an equitable interest in the land by way of equitable charge to secure approximately $500,000 pursuant to clause 20 of the building agreement. Had I been satisfied that there was sufficient material to show that that case might have been made out, and had there been an undertaking as to damages given, I may have made such an order.

The court may under section 74K(5) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) impose a condition that a caveat only be extended if the caveator gives an undertaking as to damages. The plaintiff has declined to give such an undertaking. The evidence shows that the development in which the parties were involved is one which had to be financed to a large extent and is about to be refinanced. The extent of the caveat severely prejudices that refinancing. As at the very highest that is assuming the caveat falls into the class of a claim which "may have merit", the court would not grant an injunction or even extend the caveat without there being an appropriate undertaking as to damages. This not being proffered, the claim must fail.

Accordingly, the proceedings are dismissed with costs and the caveat will automatically expire tomorrow. The exhibits may be returned.
