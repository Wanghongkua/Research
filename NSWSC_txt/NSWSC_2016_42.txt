JUDGMENT
This is an application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police for orders under [ss 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) and [38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s38.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth). The application is supported by an affidavit of Jody Brian Earl sworn 3 December 2015. The Plaintiff is a proceeds of crime authority. Mr Earl deposes to the fact that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of [s 338](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s338.html) of the Act.
Mr Earl also deposes to the fact that he suspects the property identified in schedules 1 to 5 of the Summons have the proceeds are the proceeds of an indictable offence under [s 19(1)(d)(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the Act and/or an instrument of a serious offence under [s 19(1)(d)(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) both contrary to <case>.91 of the Criminal Code. Mr Earl bases his suspicion on the matters which he has set out in his affidavit and in the exhibits to that affidavit. I have read the affidavit and the relevant annexures to that affidavit.
Section 19 provides that a restraining order must be made if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or is an instrument of a serious offence, the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer who states that he suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence, the affidavit includes the grounds on which he holds the suspicion, and when the Court is satisfied that the authorised officer holds the suspicion in the affidavit on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that Mr Earl holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds.
Two of the three interested parties affected by the order have consented to the orders sought by the plaintiff in the matter. There is no consent from the third interested person, that is Cuong Viet Bui. However, his legal representative appears today and has not actively opposed the order being made.
I note that under <case> of the Act, where there is consent the order may be made without a consideration of the matters required otherwise to be considered. In any event, I am satisfied on the basis of the material in Mr Earl's affidavit that the order should be made.
I note the undertaking provided by Mr Skeels on behalf of the Commonwealth. In relation to Mr Tran and Ms To, by consent I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 5 of the consent order. I grant the leave referred to in paragraph 6. I stand the proceedings over to the Common Law Registrar for further directions on 24 May. I grant liberty to restore on three days' notice.
In relation to the property in schedules 1 and 2 where the relevant interested person is Mr Bui, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 9 of the draft order provided to me. I grant the leave referred to in paragraph 10. I stand the proceedings over to the Common Law Registrar on 24 May. I grant liberty to restore on three days' notice. I direct that all of the orders should be entered forthwith.
