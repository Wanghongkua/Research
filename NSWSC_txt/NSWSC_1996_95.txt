David MURPHY versus Rodney Bevan CAUST /96 
MONDAY 6 MAY 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ABADEE J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: By his determination the magistrate decided to strike out the plaintiff's amended statement of claim. By that amended statement of claim the plaintiff/appellant claimed from the defendant in those proceedings under two different causes of action, one being monies owing by the defendant to the plaintiff/appellant under a deed entered between them, and the other monies had and received by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff/appellant. The statement of claim was amended by the plaintiff/appellant to also plead that he advanced monies to the defendant under mistake of fact of the amount of $4,900.00. The relevant interest rate it is accepted was a rate at twenty seven and a half per cent per annum. On 14 October 1994 the learned magistrate struck out the plaintiff's amended statement of claim and ordered the plaintiff/appellant to pay the defendant's costs.

The facts as found by the magistrate are set forth in the case stated. They are, essentially, that the plaintiff/appellant disclosed no reasonable cause of action in his amended statement of claim and that if the plaintiff/appellant could establish a cause of action in his amended statement of claim, he did not have evidence to support a cause of action contemplated by his amended statement of liquidated claim. He found that the action brought by the plaintiff/appellant lacked merit and, accordingly, was frivolous and abuse of the process of court.

It was not disputed before the magistrate, nor, as I understand it before me, that the learned magistrate had jurisdiction to deal with the matter in terms of striking out the plaintiff's amended statement of claim. Indeed, the matter came before the learned magistrate by way of notice of motion seeking that the proceedings be struck out in their entirety. The stated case dated 8 March disclosed that the principal reason for the magistrate ordering a striking out in the amended statement of claim was the fact that the plaintiff/appellant had offended the provisions of the [Credit Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/) and the [Credit (Administration) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/).

It is accepted by the parties that the pleadings revealed that there had been a loan for $4,000.00 which is a loan less than the sum of $20,000.00 and at an interest rate in excess of the fourteen per cent referred to in the relevant [Credit (Administration)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) and the [Credit
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/). It is accepted by the parties that the loan contract became a regulated contract within the meaning of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/index.html#p3) of the [Credit (Administration)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). It was accepted before the magistrate and is accepted before me that the plaintiff/appellant in the proceedings before the magistrate was in the business of providing credit within the meaning of the [Credit
Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/) and as
I also understand it for the purposes of the [Credit Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/).

The critical findings relevantly made by the magistrate are as follows, that the plaintiff/appellant was not a holder of a credit provider's licence, and that the plaintiff/appellant purported to rely in his proceedings on a regulated contract being contract loan for an amount less than $20,000.00 and at an interest rate exceeding 14 per cent per annum. The magistrate determined that the plaintiff/appellant was not entitled to seek any amount allegedly financed to the defendant by reason of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) of the [Credit (Administration)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/). This was, as I understand it, because the plaintiff/appellant did not hold a relevant credit provider's licence. It seems that the magistrate then went on to hold by virtue of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s8.html) of the
Act that the defendant was not liable to pay any monies to the plaintiff/appellant pursuant to the alleged loan agreement.

It has been submitted before the court that the learned magistrate was erroneous in point of law upon a number of grounds. It is not necessary for me to repeat the argument advanced in support of that contention. It is sufficient for me to say that they are essentially set forth in the stated case from the learned magistrate. In my view there is no substance in any of the submissions advanced. Indeed, those submissions advanced are inconsistent with the findings of facts made by the magistrate. It seems, having regard to the findings, that those findings are not capable of being successfully challenged on any successful ground before me.

The submissions, therefore, are rejected, essentially for these brief reasons.
Once the magistrate made the findings of fact to which I have earlier referred, it appears to me that the magistrate was correct in then determining that he should strike out the plaintiff's amended statement of claim.

A further submission has been made in the proceedings before me that the magistrate was in error in failing to transfer the proceedings to the
Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales pursuant to the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/ca1984226/s6.html) of the [Credit
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/). This point was also one raised in the case stated in the plaintiff's contention. It can be shortly disposed of on the basis that no application was made by the plaintiff/appellant to the magistrate for such a transfer. Absent such an application it is hard to find that the magistrate was in error in refusing to exercise or consider exercising discretion to transfer the proceedings from the Local Court to the Commercial Tribunal. I see no error, in any event, in the magistrate declining to exercise a discretion to transfer the proceedings to the Commercial Tribunal.

For these reasons, there is no substance in the claim by the plaintiff/appellant that the relevant discretion made by the magistrate miscarried or was not exercised on proper grounds. The question raised for my consideration is whether the determination made by the magistrate was erroneous in law. For these reasons the answer is, "No".

The plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs.
