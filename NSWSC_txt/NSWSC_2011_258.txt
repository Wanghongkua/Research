Judgment 
These proceedings concern an application for finance made by Agusta Pty Ltd ("Agusta") in October 2005. An offer was made by Provident Capital Ltd ("Provident") on 16 March 2006, which offer was accepted by Agusta and guaranteed by Ms Nida Ferella, who was at the time a director of Agusta.  
Agusta was described in the loan application and the letter of 16 March 2006 as trustee of the Cavallino Trust ("the Trust").  
The Trust had been established in 1995. It has had a number of names and has had a number of trustees. On 19 April 2005, Mr Gustavo Ferella and Mr Angelo Ferella ("the Ferellas") resigned as trustees of the Trust and were replaced by Riva Pty Ltd ("Riva"). On 14 October 2005, the Ferellas were declared bankrupt. On 9 February 2006, Riva resigned as trustee and Agusta was appointed trustee by deed dated 9 February 2006: see pages 54-55 of Exhibit A (" the Court Book"). This deed is signed by Ms Ferella on behalf of both Riva and Agusta. According to Exhibits C and D, Ms Ferella was a director of both these companies on that date.  
By the letter of offer, Provident offered a loan of $5.5million, which offer was accepted by Agusta. Agusta agreed to pay several amounts to Provident even if the loan contemplated by the letter of offer did not proceed: see pages 59-64 of the Court Book. Ms Ferella guaranteed the amounts due from Agusta. The loan did not proceed. Provident sought payment of the amounts due under the loan agreement from both Agusta and Ms Ferella, and following non-payment, Provident commenced proceedings in the District Court.  
On 23 November 2007, Provident obtained judgment in the District Court against both Agusta and Ms Ferella for $119,341 and interest in the amount of $19,225.35 ("Judgment Debt"). No appeal was brought by Agusta or Ms Ferella.  
Provident sought to enforce the Judgment Debt obtained by it against Agusta by a writ of execution taken out on 18 June 2009 on a property at Kings Park (" the Property") of which Agusta was the registered proprietor.  
On 18 June 2010 it appears that the writ expired and notwithstanding the efforts of Provident to prevent any dealing with the Property between 18 June and 23 June 2010, Riva, on 23 June 2010, was able to lodge a transfer of the Property from Agusta to itself. Riva had earlier complained to the Sheriff about the execution of the writ on the Property and had commenced proceedings in both the District Court and this Court in that connection. The proceedings in the District Court did not proceed but in this Court Riva brought proceedings on behalf of the Trust asserting that Agusta had not been properly appointed and claiming that Riva should be the registered proprietor of the Property.  
Following the lapsing of the writ and the registration of Riva, Riva no longer needed the intervention of the Court to become registered proprietor and the only relief now sought by Riva is the removal of a notation on the title:  "AFS97049 NOTE: NO DEALINGS TO BE REGISTERED. REFER ALL INQUIRIES TO LEG 2.
SEE LM 220100868"
Provident maintains that the transfer of the Property by Agusta to Riva falls within <case> of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) ("the Act") which is in the following terms:  "(1) Save as provided in this section, every alienation of property, made whether before or after the commencement of the Conveyancing (Amendment) Act , with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.

This section does not affect the law of bankruptcy for the time being in force.

This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property alienated to a purchaser in good faith not having, at the time of the alienation, notice of the intent to defraud creditors."
Ms B Nolan of counsel appears for Provident and Mr J E O'Sullivan of counsel appears for Agusta and Riva.  
Agusta had become the registered proprietor of the Property on 1 May 2006 when the Ferellas, who had been trustees of the Trust until 19 April 2005 executed, a transfer to Agusta from themselves as registered proprietors of the Property. Since the Ferellas were no longer trustees of the Trust, if the Property was Trust property, which both parties accept it was, they were entitled to transfer it to the new trustee. If the Ferellas owned the Property beneficially, then they had no power to transfer the Property because it would pass to their trustee in bankruptcy. There was initially a suggestion, on behalf of Riva and Agusta, that the transfer from the Ferellas to Agusta was invalid because they were, at the time of the transfer, undischarged bankrupts, but I think it was accepted that since they were trustees only they were entitled to transfer the Property to a new trustee, namely Agusta.  
It was also asserted that Agusta was not validly appointed as trustee of the Trust. Whilst it is possible that Agusta was not validly appointed as trustee, I do not think that this has been established. I proceed upon the basis that Agusta was entitled to act as trustee of the Trust in 2006. It was not suggested by either party that the appointment of Riva as trustee in 2008 was an invalid appointment, and so I proceed on the basis that that too was a valid appointment.  
The case for Riva and Agusta is that Riva was entitled and required, as trustee, to ensure the transfer of the Property to itself and that Agusta consented to that course by execution of the transfer on 23 June 2010. Prior to that date, the transfer could not be lodged because Provident had lodged a writ on title which writ lapsed on 18 June 2010. There was also a mortgage on title which mortgage was discharged on 23 June 2010 (see second page of Exhibit B). That mortgage would appear to be one to Perpetual Trustee (see Exhibit B), but it was not identified and no details of the amount owing on the mortgage as at 23 June 2010 were provided to the Court.  
Agusta and Riva, by the amended summons filed in this Court, sought declarations that Riva was the registered proprietor of the Property and an order that the Torrens Title register (the "Register") should be amended to reflect that. The summons asserted that Agusta had been invalidly recorded as registered proprietor and did not hold the Property in its own right (see page 2 of the Court Book). Agusta and Riva do not now press for any relief other than the removal of the notation on the Register referred to in [8] above because on the lapsing of Provident's writ, Riva was able to register the transfer. It was accepted by Ms Nolan that the lapsing of the writ did not occur by reason of anything done by Agusta or Riva. Indeed, the lapsing was described by Ms Nolan as resulting from a "bungle" in the District Court registry. It is not clear how exactly the writ came to lapse without being replaced by a new writ, but it is clear that it did so lapse and it is accepted that the reason for the lapse has nothing to do with Riva or Agusta. It appears that the inability of Provident to execute the writ within the 12-month period was a result of action taken by and complaints made to the Sheriff by Agusta.  
In Agusta Pty Ltd as trustees for Cavallino Unit Trust versus Official Trustee in Bankruptcy as trustee of bankrupt Estates of Ferella <case> ("Proceedings 4820/06"), Agusta and Riva sought a determination as against the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy that first Riva had been appointed trustee of the Trust and then Agusta had been appointed, and that the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy had no claim on the balance of the sale proceeds obtained from the Point Piper property (that property was the subject, incidentally, of the Provident agreement). Nicholas J noted at [23]:  "Initially, [Agusta and Riva] contended that the Ferellas had been replaced as trustees by Agusta, alternatively, by Riva. However, during the course of submissions the case for Agusta was not pressed and the preference for Riva was stated (T pp 175, 181 and 186). I was left with the impression that the plaintiffs accepted the indubitably correct situation that upon the bankruptcy of the Ferellas <case> and [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s58.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Cth) operated to vest the rights and powers attached to their units in the defendant so that they became unable to vote for, or to otherwise approve, a change to Agusta under either cl 15(a) or cl 15(b) of the trust deed. (See
Wood versus W & G Dean Pty Ltd  <case> ; [(1929) 43 CLR 77], per Isaacs J.) Accordingly, I have proceeded on the basis that it was Riva which the plaintiffs finally claimed to be the trustee at the relevant time. In support, they relied upon the deed of 19 April 2005 and the remedial deed of 5 April 2006."
Nicholas J determined that although Riva was the trustee at the relevant time, the Trust assets had not vested in Riva. An appeal was brought by Agusta and Riva (Agusta Pty Ltd versus Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (as trustee of estates of Ferella) <case> on specific items to which the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy was held to be entitled but the appeal had no relevance to the current matter, save for the Court of Appeal's acceptance at [15] per Tobias JA (with whom Beazley and Macfarlan JJA agreed) of the principles as set out in [35] of Nicholas J's judgment at first instance. Although Riva was found to be the trustee, as against the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy's contention that the Ferellas were the trustees, the question of whether Agusta was validly appointed was not the subject of determination by Nicholas J. It was agreed before me that the determination by Nicholas J that Riva was the trustee from 2005 was not evidence or binding on me and this concession is clearly correct.  
Mr O'Sullivan's submission, however, seems to rely on the conclusion that Riva was held to be the trustee, as justifying a belief that Riva should become the registered proprietor of the Property. This seems to slide into a proposition that Agusta was not acting in bad faith of Provident because it was merely taking steps in accordance with Nicholas J's determination.  
As I have pointed out, Nicholas J's determination that Riva was the trustee was based upon an agreement between Agusta and Riva that Riva was not replaced by Agusta. In any event, I do not think Riva needs to defend the transfer to it of Trust property in a general sense since by deed of 26 July 2008 it had become trustee. A number of submissions were made by Mr O'Sullivan concerning Riva's knowledge and position. The relevant "person" is the debtor ie Agusta, not the transferee, unless the transferee asserts that it is a bona fide purchaser for value without knowledge of the intent to defraud a creditor.  
Evidence of Mr Angelo Ferella 
Agusta and Riva rely on the affidavit of Mr Angelo Ferella ("Mr Ferella") of 29 March 2010.  
Mr Ferella is not a director of Agusta or Riva but he says he is a manager of both companies. He does not say how long he has been manager. No director of Agusta (or Riva) gave evidence.  
Mr Ferella annexed the deed of 9 February 2006 appointing Agusta (see pages 53-54 of the Court Book), but whilst he said (at paragraph 11 of his affidavit of 29 March 2010 at pages 8-9 of the Court Book) that Agusta "purportedly became the trustee", he offered no evidence as to why what is contained in the deed was not correct. He was a witness to Ms Ferella's signature on behalf of both Agusta and Riva. He made reference to the letter of offer (pages 59-64 of the Court Book) to Agusta from Provident but did not positively assert that Agusta was not acting as trustee or assert that it was not entitled to so act.  
Whilst it appears that Mr Ferella seeks to assert that the deed of 9 February 2006 appointing Agusta was invalid, the basis is quite unclear. Mr O'Sullivan submitted that the word "purportedly" was used because as at 9 February 2006, the Ferellas were bankrupt (see T51.19-20). This is not of itself a reason why a properly constituted meeting of unit holders could not appoint a new trustee. To the extent that there is any reliance on the judgment of Nicholas J in Proceedings 4820/06, as I have indicated, whether Riva or Agusta was the trustee was not an issue determined by his Honour. Mr Ferella offers no direct evidence as to why the appointment of Agusta was invalid or ineffective. Although he refers to the letter of offer to Agusta from Provident and the consequences (see paragraphs 18-21 of his affidavit of 29 March 2010 at pages 8-10 of the Court Book), he does not assert that (other than implicitly by reason of the decision of Nicholas J) that Agusta was not acting or entitled to act as trustee.  
In my opinion, if it was Agusta's case that it was never validly appointed, it was incumbent on it to bring evidence forward to support that contention and a concession made by it in other proceedings that Riva was the trustee is not evidence. No evidence was given by unit holders in the Trust as to the process or lack of process by which Agusta (or Riva for that matter) was appointed as trustee.  
On the rights and liabilities of trustees in dealing with third parties, there are some basic principles, which I take from the restatement by Brereton J in Lemery Holdings Pty Ltd versus Reliance Financial Services Pty Ltd <case>; [(2008) 74 NSWLR 550] at [14]-[22], that need to be borne in mind to understand the parameters of the present dispute:  "14 First, as against a third party, a trustee is personally liable for debts and liabilities incurred in its capacity as trustee: Vacuum Oil Co Pty Ltd v
Wiltshire <case>; [(1945) 72 CLR 319]; Octavo Investments Pty Ltd versus Knight <case>; [(1979) 144 CLR 360] at 367.
 Second, however, the trustee has a right of indemnity out of the trust assets for expenses or liabilities incurred by the trustee, by recoupment of expenditure and exoneration from liability: Octavo Investments versus Knight (at ); Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties for New South Wales versus Buckle <case>; [(1998) 192 CLR 226] at 245.
 Third, this right of indemnity, recoupment and exoneration is secured by an equitable lien over the trust assets, which arises by operation of law and confers a proprietary interest, in the nature of a security interest, in the trust assets, and takes priority over the claims of beneficiaries: Octavo
Investments versus Knight (at 367, 370); Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties for
New South Wales versus Buckle (at 246).
 Fourth, this equitable lien extends to all of the trust assets, save only those that are specifically excluded by the trust instrument: Dowse versus Gorton [[1891] AC 190]; Octavo Investments versus Knight (at 367).
 Fifth, being an equitable lien, the security is enforceable by the trustee only by judicial sale or appointment of a receiver, and not by foreclosure or by sale out of Court: Tennant versus Trenchard [(1869) LR 4 Ch App 537];
ANZ Banking Group Ltd versus Intagro Projects Pty Ltd  <case> at <case>;
Melbourne Tramways Trust versus Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company Ltd <case>; [(1887) 13 VLR 487] at 490; Re Pumfrey [(1882) 22 Ch D 255] at 265;
Re Stucley [[1906] 1 Ch 67]; Davies versus Littlejohn <case>; [(1923) 34 CLR 174] at 184; Hewett versus Court <case>; [(1983) 149 CLR 639] at 663; EISykes and SWalker, The Law of Securities: an account of the law pertaining to securities over real and personal property under the laws of Australian jurisdictions, 5th ed (1993) Sydney, Lawbook Co
Ltd a t 198.
 Sixth, the right of indemnity accrues at the time the obligation is incurred: Xebec Pty Ltd (In Liq) versus Enthe Pty Ltd [(1987) 18 ATR 893]; Southern
Wine Corporation Pty Ltd (In Liq) versus Frankland River Olive Co Ltd <case>; <case>; and is not subsequently lost by cessation of office, whether by retirement or removal: Xebec versus Enthe (at 898); Coates versus McInerney [(1992) 7 WAR ];
Southern Wine Corporation (at [30]); Dimos versus Dikeakos Nominees Pty Ltd <case>; [(1996) 68 FCR 39] at 43.
 Seventh, upon bankruptcy or liquidation of a trustee, its right of indemnity vests in its trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator: Official Assignee of O'Neill versus O'Neill [(1898) 16 NZLR 628]; Jennings v Mather [[1901] 1 KB 108] at 117; Savage versus Union Bank of Australia Ltd <case>; [(1906) 3 CLR 1170] at 1188, 1196; Octavo Investments versus Knight ; Re Suco Gold
Pty Ltd (In Liq) [(1983) 33 SASR 99.] Eighth, if the trust property is transferred to a new trustee, the lien survives and the new trustee takes subject to the lien of the old trustee - except perhaps in the exceptional case of a bona fide purchaser for value without notice: Belar Pty Ltd (In Liq) versus Mahaffey <case>; <case>; Octavo
Investments versus Knight (at 370); Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties for New
South Wales versus Buckle (at 246); Re Exhall Coal Co Ltd <case>; [(1866) 55 ER 970.] Ninth, a trustee is entitled to retain possession of trust property against a beneficiary until its indemnity is exercised: Octavo Investments versus Knight (at 369-370); Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties for New South Wales v
Buckle (at 246); Re Exhall Coal Co Ltd (at 972); Re Enhill Pty Ltd <case>; [[1983] 1 VR 561."]
To this has to be added the fact that the Torrens system of land in New South Wales does not permit trust interests to be recorded in the Register: see [s 82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) of the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) . The [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) does permit trust instruments to be lodged and if lodged, the Registrar-General is required to record in the Register a caveat. In the absence of the trust instrument being lodged, the fact that the registered proprietor holds the land as trustee is relevant only as between himself and the trust but not as between himself and third parties. In the High Court's decision of Black versus Garnock <case>; [(2007) 230 CLR 438], Hayne, Gummow and Callinan JJ emphasised the significance of the Register and rejected the claim of a third party purchaser for value who had no notice of a writ of execution on land lodged by the Sheriff two hours before settlement.  
It follows from the principles set out at [24] and [25] above that:  * (1) Agusta was liable to Provident on the contract made on 16 March 2006;  * (2) Agusta's registration as owner of the Property did not require any notation as "trustee", and it was, as trustee, entitled to be registered as the owner of the Property without lodging the trust instrument; and  * (3) if Agusta was validly appointed as trustee, it was entitled to an indemnity out of Trust assets for the Judgment Debt owed to Provident. I shall deal separately with Agusta's entitlement to indemnity even if it was not validly appointed.  
For a transfer of an interest in land to be voidable under <case> of the Act, there are four elements which need to be established:  * (1) that there has been an alienation;  * (2) of property;  * (3) with intent to defraud creditors; and  * (4) that the person seeking to set aside the transfer has been prejudiced.  
Mr O'Sullivan conceded that the transfer constituted an alienation of property, thereby accepting implicitly the correctness of the following cases: Green versus Schneller <case>; [(2002) 29 Fam LR 346]  
The contest between the parties centred upon:  whether an intent to defraud creditors, a requirement of <case> of the Act, was established; whether Provident had established that it was prejudiced by the alienation; and the nature of the relief to be granted, as Mr O'Sullivan contended that even if the transaction was avoided, it would not assist Provident because
Agusta is not the trustee and has no right to be recorded as registered proprietor of the Property, so the Registrar-General would not have the power to place Agusta on the Register. The Court, Mr O'Sullivan submitted, would not order the Registrar-General to do what he has no power to do.
 
Intent to defraud creditors 
At the hearing, it was accepted that the Court of Appeal's decision in Chen versus Marcolongo <case>; [(2009) 260 ALR 353] and unanimously overturned the Court of Appeal's decision. Counsel agreed on a regime for an exchange of written submissions so that they could deal with the High Court's decision and I received detailed written submissions.  
The plurality in Marcolongo (French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ) examined the history of <case> of the Act and its analogues and held that the statute should be given a liberal construction and that "defraud" should be read as "delay, hinder or [otherwise] defraud": see [19], [32], [56] and [58]. It was not necessary to show that the debtor wanted creditors to suffer a loss or that the debtor had a purpose of causing loss, rather, "it was necessary to show the existence of an intention to hinder, delay or defeat creditors and in that sense to show that accordingly the debtor had acted dishonestly." (emphasis added): see [32].  
In Marcolongo, Mr Chen had encouraged or procured Ms Yang to sell the property to him in haste and at a relatively low price ($15 million), telling her that there were outstanding claims against her company Lym International Pty Ltd ("Lym"), and that if she did not do that Lym would suffer a big loss and have its assets frozen.  
Mrs Marcolongo was a next door neighbour who had a claim against Lym in respect of the building works carried out on Lym's property, which at the time of the sale by Lym to Mr Chen, had not yet been the subject of adjudication in the District Court. Mrs Marcolongo did subsequently obtain judgment for $388,000 plus costs against Lym. French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ observed at [56]-[58]:  "56...But the provision in special condition 33(b) for application of the balance of the proceeds to debts owed by Lym and related entities of Lym, and the evidence as to the lack of arrangements for Mr Chen to pay that balance, shows the deterioration to the position of Mrs Marcolongo that inevitably ensued. It is no answer, as it was no answer in In re Fasey; Ex parte
Trustees, that there had been no delay and hindrance occasioned by the transaction because eventually she might have had some recovery for any judgment she recovered and costs.
 The second point is that <case> requires a finding, which Hamilton J made, of intent to achieve the proscribed prejudice. The section does not postulate a mixture of motives from which there must be extracted what is identified as a predominant intent to defraud. Further, as Stephen J indicated in his discussion in Barton versus Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation, a provision such as the Elizabethan Statute does not require for its operation that the proscribed intent to defraud be the sole intent. Nor is it an answer to an application under the section that the transferor formed the intent of which it speaks by reason of the misconduct of another or, as here, of the transferee; the transferor, as in this case, will have remedies against that party but that does not deny success on the application made under the section by the person prejudiced. Counsel for Lym was unable to point to any line of authority in the extensive case law upon the Elizabethan Statute which would confine <case> in this fashion.
 The final point is that the limiting effect which Lym sought to place upon s 37A would be to deny it the liberal construction which the Elizabethan
Statute has long been held to require."
Heydon J, in his judgment, made reference to the fact that Mr Chen had told Ms Yang that she could go to gaol if Lym had liabilities that could not be met. His Honour noted at [78] the trial judge's finding that Ms Yang's reason for signing the contract of sale on behalf of Lym was "to get the property away from those who might claim against that company and to avoid the company suffering a "big loss" in the form of the $600,000 claim." After noting the haste with which the transaction was conducted, Heydon J said at [87]-[88]:  "87 Whatever the precise test called for by <case>, the intent underlying the conduct of Lym International Pty Ltd through Ms Yang was enough to satisfy it.
It was as "actual" and "dishonest" an intent as it is possible to have. The intent was to delay or hinder a creditor, Mrs Marcolongo, by forestalling any attempt by her to obtain an injunction ensuring that assets in the hands of
Lym International Pty Ltd would remain available to satisfy any judgment which she obtained in the District Court proceedings. It was an intention that was primary and not "merely incidental" to other intentions. The intent was not merely a minor element amidst a range of mental states. Lym International Pty
Ltd submitted that Ms Yang's reasons for entering the transaction were many and varied. On examination each of them boils down either to an element of or factor in the intent found by the trial judge, or to a worry Ms Yang was experiencing but which the transfer could not overcome. In the Court of Appeal it was said that she was very worried about "a great number of factors, including the incarceration of her husband in China, the stalled building project, the claims from the first project and her inability to fund the project." The first cannot have been a reason for the transfer, and the remainder are all related to the intent found by the trial judge. Lym
International Pty Ltd submitted that Ms Yang was unwell, but that did not go to her intent. In evidence she identified as other reasons for the transaction the following: the indebtedness of Lym International Pty Ltd; the need for another $3.4 million to complete the project; the need for that money to be invested within two months, when the construction licence would expire; and the need to repay a debt to avoid going to gaol. Of these reasons, only two were not related to the intent found by the trial judge. One was the need to invest the $3.4 million. The other was the need to repay a debt to avoid going to gaol. The transaction with Mr Chen did not meet either need.
 The evidence accepted by the trial judge, and his findings, reveal that the proscribed intention was probably the sole one, but at all events it was a predominant and primary one."
It was accepted that no consideration was paid to Agusta for the transfer of the Property to Riva and it is clear that as soon as the writ lapsed, Agusta and Riva moved rapidly to effect the transfer. There is no doubt that the transfer removed the prospect of Provident being able to lodge a further writ on the title of the Property at least without the intervention of this Court. Although the registration of the writ does not create any interest in land under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) (see [s 105(1))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s105.html), the recording of the writ prevents any registration of dealing which does not recognise the writ as if it were a prior encumbrance: see [s 105A(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s105a.html)  
At first glance it appears obvious that the transfer by Agusta was designed to impede Provident from issuing a fresh writ to enforce its Judgment Debt. The following arguments were advanced by Mr O'Sullivan in his written submissions as to why the requisite intent in <case> of the Act has not been established:  
Provident was hindered or delayed in enforcing its Judgment Debt against
Agusta because the writ lapsed before it was executed.
 
Agusta was not the proper trustee of the Trust "so that it was mistakenly recorded as the proprietor of the Kings Park Property".
 
Provident failed to take advantage of the mistake before Riva and Agusta or the Court were able to rectify it.
 
Provident was unable to obtain a fresh writ because Riva was not a debtor of Provident.
The argument in [37](1) focuses on the writ which had undoubtedly lapsed and as I have noted, not directly by reason of any conduct on the part of Agusta. I think however that the focus is too narrow - Provident would in the normal course have been entitled to the issue of a fresh writ and it was the transfer out of Agusta's name which precluded a fresh writ from being issued.  
The arguments in [37](2) and (3) refer to Agusta being "mistakenly recorded" as the registered proprietor of the Property. If this is intended to assert that Agusta should never have been recorded as proprietor, I do not think that has been established. If it is intended merely to assert that since Riva had been appointed as trustee in 2008, the transfer should have been effected earlier than 2010, I do not think that the phrase "mistakenly recorded" is apt. However, I accept, subject to one important matter, that it was not inappropriate for Agusta to transfer the Property to Riva as the newly appointed trustee and to do so without any consideration as such being paid for the Property.  
The qualification to which I have referred in [39] is this. Agusta, when it incurred the Judgment Debt, had been appointed as trustee and it was conceded by Mr O'Sullivan that it appears that the loan it sought from Provident was for the benefit of the Trust: see T7.5-T7.27. In the absence of any evidence that Agusta was not acting on behalf of the Trust, I infer that it was acting on behalf of the Trust when it entered into the loan contract with Provident. When Agusta transferred the Trust property, it had a judgment against it and was well aware that Provident was seeking to enforce that Judgment Debt. There is no evidence that Agusta made any arrangement with Riva, as incoming trustee, for indemnification out of Trust assets of the Judgment Debt, or for payment of the Judgment Debt by Riva directly to Provident. It is obvious that Riva had no intention of accepting that the Judgment Debt owed by Agusta should be paid by it out of Trust assets or otherwise. There is no evidence before the Court as to why Agusta (or Ms Ferella for that matter) has never paid the Judgment Debt and I infer it is because Agusta does not have the means out of its own assets to pay the Judgment Debt.  
The fact that as at the time Agusta incurred the liability to Provident it was not the registered proprietor of the Property but only became registered at a later time is relied on by Agusta to demonstrate that Provident received a benefit by a fortuitous transfer and the removal of the benefit is in the same category. This has, it is submitted, two aspects. The first is that it is said that there is nothing unfair about the transfer and secondly that the transfer into Agusta's name after it has incurred a liability demonstrates the absence of bad faith.  
There are a number of answers to this point:  
If Agusta was validly appointed as trustee (and as I have said it has not been demonstrated that it was not), then it was appropriate that the assets of the Trust, including the Property, be transferred to it prior to and at least as at 16 March 2006. If that had occurred, Agusta would have been entitled to be registered as the proprietor. When Agusta incurred the liabilities to
Provident (see [19] of Lemery as set out at [24] above), Agusta had a right of indemnity.
 
The first point links to the second. Had the transfer in February 2006 been effected, as it ought to have been, then Agusta would have had protection for debts incurred by it acting as trustee. When Riva was subsequently appointed as trustee and a transfer was arranged from Agusta to it, the matters to which I have referred in (1) above became pertinent.
 
Although the judgment of Nicholas J in Proceeding 4820/06 was handed down on 8 July 2008, no steps were taken by Agusta or Riva to transfer title until 2010. Whilst it is true that from 18 June 2009, the writ of execution had been lodged, there was a period of almost a year before that in which no steps were taken.
Mr O'Sullivan also relied on the failure of Ms Nolan to cross-examine Mr Ferella on his affidavit and he argued that there were potential reasons for the failure to transfer the Property prior to 23 June 2010, particularly the mortgage that were not explored with Mr Ferella. Mr O'Sullivan submitted that it would be unfair to infer fraudulent conduct on the part of Agusta or Riva in the absence of cross-examination. Ms Nolan replied to this (at T69), pointing out that it was not necessary to bring evidence of the state of mind of the alienor and that the Court could infer the necessary intention for the purposes of <case> of the Act. Ms Nolan's second point was that Mr Ferella was not the directing mind of either Agusta or Riva and rather significantly, in any event, his affidavit is dated March 2010, ie three months before the impugned transaction. Whether Mr Ferella could have provided evidence on behalf of Agusta and Riva as to the intentions behind the transfer, the fact is that he did not do so. Nor did he explain the delay from July 2008 to June 2010. He gave no evidence about the mortgage which is recorded on the title of the Property: see the second page of Exhibit B. If Mr Ferella had the ability to deal with matters to rebut Provident's case based on his knowledge of the facts, his failure to do so points to the conclusion that the evidence he could give would not assist the case of Agusta and Riva: see Commercial Union Assurance Co. of Australia versus Ferrcom Pty Ltd [(1991) 22 NSWLR 389] at 371. In the circumstances, I do not think that Ms Nolan's failure to cross-examine Mr Ferella precludes the conclusion that the transfer of the Property without adequate protection of Agusta's rights to indemnity from the Trust was not a breach of <case> of the Act. The conclusion that Agusta and Riva had the required intent under <case> of the Act does not, in my view, require a finding that Mr Ferella had that intent, but if it does then I would make that finding.  
In response to Ms Nolan's submissions that Agusta had acted in secrecy in lodging the transfer of the Property, Mr O'Sullivan submitted that his clients had acted openly because they had commenced proceedings in this Court to obtain relief and had notified Provident's solicitors on two occasions after the transfer was lodged. I think the latter notifications do not assist because by then the transfer had been effected. So far as the commencement of proceedings is concerned, I do not think that this rebuts the claim of secrecy since the action taken by Agusta (and Riva) was taken outside of the proceedings.  
The position then in essence is that:  
Agusta had acted as trustee of the Trust and incurred a debt to Provident in the course of so acting.
 
Provident obtained judgement against Agusta.
 
Agusta did not meet that Judgment Debt.
 
Agusta had assets of the Trust transferred to it after the contract with
Provident was entered into but which it was entitled to have transferred upon execution of the deed of 9 February 2006.
 
After Provident had obtained judgment, but before a writ was issued, Riva was reappointed as trustee.
 
A writ was issued at the request of Provident as judgment creditor.
 
Efforts were made by Agusta and Riva to block the Sheriff's attempts to sell the Property (see for example page 73 of the Court Book).
 
After the writ was issued and three days after the writ had expired,
Agusta transferred the Trust property to Riva without any arrangement being made for Agusta to be indemnified or Riva to pay Provident the Judgment Debt out of the Trust assets.
 
Provident could not obtain a writ on the Property (without this Court's intervention) and was thereby prejudiced because it could not execute the writ and obtain an order for the sale of the Property to satisfy the Judgment Debt.
Provident was also exposed to the risk that the new trustee could sell the
Property to a third party for valuable consideration and then distribute the net proceeds of sale to the beneficiaries of the Trust.
Agusta, as trustee, had the right to be indemnified out of Trust assets and thus protect itself and Provident, as a judgment creditor (with or without a writ), and what Agusta did was to transfer the Property without any arrangement being made in its or Provident's favour. In my view, this at the least hindered or delayed Provident's claims, as a judgment creditor, against Agusta. If it is said that Agusta still has the right to be indemnified out of Trust assets, then its path to recovery of the Judgment Debt will be far slower than it would have been had Agusta obtained indemnity from the Trust when it had the opportunity to do so: see [52] and [56] of the High Court's decision in Marcolongo in this connection.  
Ms Nolan submitted that even if Agusta was not validly appointed as trustee, but was acting as trustee in good faith believing itself to have been duly appointed, it was entitled to indemnity as if it were a duly appointed trustee: see Travis versus Illingworth [[1868] WN 206] at 13, 15, 17 require the rejection of that contention.  
The Precise Form of Relief 
Section 37A of the Act renders the transfer of the Property voidable but Mr O'Sullivan raised the point that even if the transfer is voidable, the Court should not order the Register to be "rectified" because it would, in effect, reinstate Agusta as the registered proprietor when it is not and could not be so described. To the extent that it was suggested that Agusta's debt should be treated as Riva's debt, I agree with Mr O'Sullivan's submission that Riva has not itself incurred any debt and it would be inappropriate to order Riva to pay any money itself.  
Ms Nolan accepted that there are difficulties with ordering the Registrar-General to record Agusta as the registered proprietor of the Property and sought a different form of relief, which I understood to be that Provident should be entitled to stand in Agusta's shoes in relation to Agusta's right to be indemnified out of the Trust property.  
In this connection, Ms Nolan submitted that:  either as trustee in fact or as someone acting as trustee in good faith,
Agusta was entitled to be indemnified out of the Trust assets for its liabilities to Provident; in Silvera versus Savic <case>; [(1999) 46 NSWLR 124], a <case> case, Hodgson CJ in Equity (as his Honour then was) said at [72]: "What <case> says is that the "alienation" is "voidable". In my opinion, when an application is made under <case> to the Supreme Court, that Court can achieve the effect of avoiding the alienation by such measures as seem appropriate in the particular case. For example, the Court could declare that the effect of the Local Court order is spent by reason of its being carried out by the subsequent transfers, and then order appropriate re-transfers of the property. Such orders would not be inconsistent with the Local Court orders, nor could they give rise to any possible embarrassment by reason of the existence of conflicting court orders." and that this case and Houvardas versus Zaravinos <case> support the conclusion that the Court has power to grant relief other than avoidance of the relevant contract to protect the plaintiff's equity; in Houvardas, Bergin J (as her Honour then was) referred to Silvera when considering relief in respect of an impugned transaction (see [125]-[128]). Also see [47]-[51] in the Court of Appeal's decision in
Zaravinos versus Houvardas <case>
I accept the submissions set out in [51](1) and (2).  
Given that the vice in this case was the failure to ensure that Agusta was able to meet its liability on the Judgment Debt to Provident, I think it is appropriate to fashion relief which deals with the specific problem. There are several possibilities, including declaring that Agusta has a lien over the Property, and ordering Agusta to lodge a caveat to protect that interest (see Custom Credit Corp Ltd versus Ravi Nominees Pty Ltd [(1992) 8 WAR 42] and the other cases cited at [14.270] of H A J Ford & W A Lee, Principles of the Law of Trusts, 4 th ed (2010), Thomson Reuters on the right of a trustee to protect its right to indemnity). However, this introduces a degree of complication that can be avoided by a practical solution which is to declare that Provident has an equitable charge over the Property, which it can enforce by sale of the Property if the Judgment Debt and associated enforcement expenses are not paid to it within a short period, and that is the relief I propose to grant, but I will hear the parties on this. I have in mind one month as the appropriate period, but will hear the parties further on that point as well. The notation which is currently on title should remain until an alternative regime is put into effect.  
Costs 
Agusta and Riva should pay Provident's costs.  *
