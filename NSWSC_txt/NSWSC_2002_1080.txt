JUDGMENT  In each of the eight proceedings, leave is given to the applicants to file in court the interlocutory process which I initial and date and the affidavit of Alexander Robert Mackay Macintosh sworn on 12 November 2002. Exhibits ARMM to ARMM3 to the affidavit in 1810/01 tendered by the applicants will be marked Exhibit A.  I direct that Exhibit A and the accompanying executive summary document on
Blake Dawson Waldron letterhead be retained in the court file in a sealed envelope marked "Not to be opened without the leave of a judge and on 48 hours' notice to the liquidators c/- Blake Dawson Waldron".  The liquidators seek the approval of the court under [s.477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) 2001 to enter into an outsourcing agreement involving the provision to each of the eight companies of services related to insurance claims management over a period which will expire in February 2007.  In the circumstances of this liquidation, which will be of considerable duration, the agreement is one that warrants grant of [s.477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) approval, particularly in the light of the matters to which Mr McIntosh deposes as to the benefits it is expected to produce.  It should be noted that the agreement has already been executed by the parties and is dated 6 November 2002. It is, however, expressed to be subject to a condition that, with some exceptions, its provisions are of no legally binding force until the happening of certain events, including the grant of approval of the court. There is provision for waiver of the condition, but not insofar as it contemplates grant of the court's approval. It follows that, even though the document has been executed, its contractual force is limited, pending the grant of that approval, to the provisions excepted from the condition. Those excepted provisions, being the only presently operative parts, involve only obligations to be performed in the short term directed towards satisfaction of the condition.  In these circumstances, I consider the correct characterisation of matters for the purposes of [s.477(2B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s477.html) to be that, insofar as the document the parties have executed entails obligations not to be performed within the period to which the section refers, there is no agreement and will be no agreement unless and until the prerequisite of the court's approval (made indispensable by the parties) has been satisfied. An agreement subject to a suspensory regime of that kind does not give rise to concerns of the kind to which I referred in Re HIH Casualty & General Insurance Co Ltd <case> (6 November 2002).  In each of the eight proceedings, I make the order in the form of order which I initial and date. The orders may be taken out forthwith.
