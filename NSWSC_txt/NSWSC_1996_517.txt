CATCHWORDS: INTEREST - claim against company in liquidation - professional indemnity insurance - whether insurer liable to pay interest on amount of damages - s6 (1) Law Reform (Miscellaneous 
Provisions) Act 1946 - s95 [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ORDERS: Additional orders to orders made on 15 November 1995 
On 15 November 1995, four appeals which arose out of proceedings commenced by
Capita Financial Group Limited (Capita) against Triden Properties Limited , were determined. Judgment was given in favour of Triden
Contractors (Contractors) against Timalco Glass Structures Pty Limited . CE Heath Casualty & General Insurance Limited (Heath) was
Timalco's insurer. On 10 June 1992, a provisional liquidator was appointed and in March 1994 Timalco went into liquidation. Contractors were granted leave to proceed against Heath pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), and relied on a professional insurance indemnity policy existing for the period between 30 April 1990 and 29 April 1991.

In his judgment of 8 June 1994, Cole J found that Contractors were entitled to enforce a charge in respect of the insurance moneys that might become payable by Heath in respect of Timalco's liability, but made no formal order to this effect. On an application by Properties, his Honour's decision of 20 May 1994, which awarded a verdict in favour of Capita Financial Group against Properties and Contractors, was stayed until the determination of Properties' appeal and the delivery of judgment.

On 15 November 1995, the judgment in favour of Contractors against Timalco was increased and Contractors wrote to Heath's solicitors claiming interest on the amount of the judgment pursuant to s95 of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). Heath maintained that it was not liable to pay interest, and Contractors filed a notice of motion seeking an order that Heath pay an amount of interest calculated from 8 June 1994 to the date of the judgment.
 
HELD:
The effect of [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) is to create a charge in respect of insurance moneys which are then payable in respect of liability against which the insured is indemnified. The charge is enforceable against the insurer and the parties shall, to the extent of the charge, have the same rights and liabilities and the Court shall have the same powers, as if the action were against the insured; Bailey versus New South Wales
Medical Defence Union Limited <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 399] at 445. 
Under its professional indemnity policy, Heath agreed to indemnify
Timalco against claims made against it for breach of its professional duty. In these circumstances, there is no reason why that indemnity would not extend to cover interest which had accrued and become part of the claim.
Had Timalco not been in liquidation, it would have been liable to pay interest on the amount it was ordered to pay Contractors on 8 June 1994 pursuant to s95 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). The winding up did not discharge Timalco from its liability to pay interest to the extent that it could be paid from other sources, being, in this case, the insurance moneys charged.

ORDERS . In appeals 40537/94 and 40574/94 in addition to the orders made on 15
November 1995 order: . 
Judgment in favour of the second cross claimant [Contractors] against
Heath in the sum of $1,217,678.10 to take effect from 8 June 1994.

A. Heath to pay to Contractors the amount of $205,320.54 being interest payable pursuant to s95 (1) on the judgment in favour of Contractors in the amount of $1,217,678.10 for the period from 8 June 1994 to 6 December 1995.
 . Heath to pay Contractors' costs of this application.
 
JUDGMENT 
CLARKE JA: I agree with the reasons and orders of Sheller JA.
 
SHELLER JA: 
INTRODUCTION 
On 15 November 1995 the Court, as presently constituted, delivered judgment in four appeals, CA 40356/94, 40357/94, 40574/94, 40392/92, arising out of proceedings which Capita Financial Group Limited (Capita) commenced against Triden Properties Limited (Properties) to recover damages for breaches of the terms of a Development Agreement for the construction of a commercial building at 12 Help Street, Chatswood. Capita alleged, inter alia, that the glass/granite facade of the building was defective because of design faults. Properties cross claimed to recover an indemnity from the builders, Triden Contractors Pty Limited (Contractors), and Contractors cross claimed to recover an indemnity from Timalco Glass Structures Pty Limited (Timalco) which had agreed to design, supply and install the glass curtain wall and other items of the building facade. A provisional liquidator of Timalco was appointed on 10 June 1992 and in March 1994 Timalco went into liquidation. 
On 20 November 1992, on an application by Contractors against CE Heath
Casualty & General Insurance Limited (Heath), the insurer of Timalco,
Rogers CJ Commercial Division made an order in accordance with para 1 of the notice of motion that Contractors have leave, pursuant to [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) (the
Law Reform Act), to proceed against Heath. Pursuant to this order, Contractors cross claimed against Heath (the further amended sixth cross claim) claiming: "1. A declaration that the Cross Defendant to the Second Cross Claim (`Timalco') is indemnified by the Cross Defendant to the Sixth Cross Claim (`Heath') against any liability to Contractors on the cause of action in negligence in design asserted in the Second Cross Claim.
A declaration that all and any insurance monies that are or may become payable by Heath, in respect of any liability of Timalco to Contractors on the cause of action in negligence asserted in the Second Cross Claim, are charged with the amount of that liability, pursuant to [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/).
Such further or other order the Court thinks fit.
The costs of the Cross Claim." 
Contractors relied, inter alia, upon a policy of professional indemnity insurance for the period between 30 April 1990 and 29 April 1991 wherein Heath agreed to indemnify Timalco against claims made and notified during the period of insurance. It agreed "(i)n addition to pay the costs and expenses incurred with the written consent of the company in the defence or settlement of any such claim, provided that if a payment in excess of the amount of indemnity available under this policy has to be made to dispose of a claim, the company's liability for such costs and expenses incurred with its consent shall be such proportion thereof as the amount of indemnity available under this policy bears to the amount paid to dispose of the claims." In its defence to the cross claim under the heading "Nature of dispute", Heath agreed that
Contractors' claim against it was "to establish and enforce a charge pursuant to [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) arising from policies of insurance issued by" Heath to Timalco. Relevantly
Heath asserted that s6 (1) of the Law Reform Act did not create a charge over the policy for the period 30 April 1990 to 29 April 1991 and further that the claims made against Timalco were not the subject of indemnity under the policy.

In his judgment of 6 September 1993, Cole J, who heard the proceedings, determined the issues of liability and held that Capita was entitled to succeed in its claim for breach of contract against Properties; that
Properties was entitled to be indemnified in part by Contractors; and that
Contractors was entitled to be indemnified to the same extent by Timalco, and, to the extent of 81 per cent of the indemnity, to a charge over the insurance moneys enforceable against Heath. His Honour observed that Timalco, being in liquidation, had not appeared at the hearing. Having dealt with the various contentions Heath advanced, Cole J said: "It follows that Contractors are entitled to enforce against Heath a charge in respect of the insurance moneys which Heath would have been obliged to pay to
Timalco, had Timalco claimed under the policy in respect of the period 30
April 1990 - 29 April 1991 in respect of defects of design, which defects became apparent in October 1990." 
In his judgment of 20 May 1994 Cole J included an amount of $45,027.49, the costs of investigating defects, in the verdict for Capita, ordered Properties to pay the whole instead of one-half of the costs of rectification of the construction and design defects and ordered Contractors to pay to Properties one-half of the amount which Properties was ordered to pay to Capita.

Upon the basis that there had not been a hearing of any claim by Triden
Investments Pty Limited (Investments), which was also a party to the building contract, Cole J, in his judgment of 8 June 1994, said that the first cross claimants (Properties and Investments) should have judgment against
Contractors in the sum of $751,653.25, being one half of the rectification and investigation costs. On the second cross claim his Honour gave judgment in favour of Contractors against Timalco in the sum of $612,034.34, being that portion of one half of the rectification and investigation costs as related to design defects. His Honour continued: "Regarding the sixth cross claim, a declaration should be made pursuant to s6 (Law Reform Act) attaching all the insurance moneys that are or may become payable by CE Heath in respect of the liability of Timalco to Contractors." 
Cole J gave judgment, inter alia, that: "1. The first defendant [Properties] pay to the Plaintiff [Capita] the sum of $1,503,306.49.
The first cross defendant [Contractors] pay to the cross claimant's [sic] to the first cross claim the sum of $751,653.25.
The second cross defendant [Timalco] pay to the second cross claimant [Contractors] the sum of $612,034.34." and declared that: "9. There is a charge in favour of Triden Contractors Pty Limited on all insurance moneys that are or may become payable by CE Heath Casualty &
General Insurance Limited in respect of the liability of Timalco Glass
Structures Pty Limited (In Liquidation) to Triden Contractors Pty Limited in consequence of order 3." 
It will be observed that his Honour made no order giving effect to his conclusion that Contractors was entitled to enforce the charge.

In appeal No 40357/94 Contractors appealed against Cole J's judgment limiting
Contractors' "right to recovery against" Heath "to merely one half of the rectification and other costs for which" Properties "has been held liable to".
Capita and Heath cross appealed against the declaration directed to be made on September 1993 and made by Cole J on 8 June 1994. Timalco did not appeal nor did it take part in the hearing of the appeals.

STAY OF EXECUTION 
On 14 July 1994, Colin Biggers & Paisley (CBP), the solicitors for
Properties and Contractors, wrote to Murray Stewart & Fogarty (MSF), the solicitors for Heath, as follows: "We refer to the Judgment of His Honour Mr Justice Cole and the Orders made in this matter in the Court below.

Our client requires payment of the sum the subject of the charge against funds held by your client forthwith.

Would you be kind enough to provide us with your response as a matter of urgency." 
On 15 July 1994 MSF wrote to CBP as follows: "We refer to your facsimile dated 14 July 1994 on which we are seeking further instructions.

Will you please let us know whether or not your client, Triden Contractors Pty
Limited, would persist with its requirement for payment from our client if
Triden Properties Limited were successful in its application for a stay pursuant to the Notice of Motion returnable next Monday 18 July 1994." 
On 18 July 1994 Powell JA heard an application by Properties for a stay of execution pending the hearing of its appeal against Capita. Heath was not required to and did not appear on this application. His Honour made a conditional order that execution on Cole J's judgment delivered on 20 May 1994 be stayed until the determination of the appeal and the delivery of judgment.
On 18 July 1994 CBP wrote to MSF advising that their client had been successful in its stay application and continued: "In the circumstances, unless you hear from us otherwise you may assume that our client will not press its demand for payment." 
COURT OF APPEAL'S DECISION 
By its decision of 15 November 1995, this Court increased the judgment in favour of Contractors against Timalco to $1,217,678.10. The Court dismissed
Heath's cross appeal and ordered Heath to pay Contractors' costs of the appeal.

On 6 December 1995, after the decision in this Court, MSF wrote to CBP enclosing their client's cheque in favour of Contractors for $1,217,678.10 "in accordance with orders made by the Court of Appeal and by Cole J (as he then was) in the Supreme Court." The parties agreed that this amount was correctly calculated.

CONTRACTORS' CLAIM TO INTEREST 
On 8 December 1995 MSF wrote to CBP: "We refer to your facsimile transmission dated 8 December 1995.

Our client rejects your client's demand for interest from 8 June 1994 to the date of payment on the sum of $1,217,678.10.

We refer to correspondence between our respective firms commencing with your serving on us on 28 June 1994 a Notice of Motion for a stay of proceedings between Properties and Capita, and affidavit in support. In your letter dated July 1994, your client required payment of the sum the subject of the charge. We responded by letter dated 15 July asking whether your client Triden
Contractors Pty Limited would persist with its requirement for payment if
Properties were successful in its application for a stay. Subsequently,
Properties was successful and you reported to us in your letter dated 19 July and stated `In the circumstances, unless you hear from us otherwise you may assume that our client will not press its demand for payment' 
Final orders of the Court of Appeal were not made until 15 November 1995.
Payment of the full amount ordered to be paid was made within the twenty one days following that order. No interest is payable by our client to yours." 
On 5 February 1996, CBP wrote to MSF recounting the history of the matter after Cole J gave judgment on 20 May 1994 and advising that if interest was not paid Contractors would move the Court for an order. On 15 March 1996, MSF wrote to CBP as follows: "We refer to your letter dated February 5, 1996.

In our view, Triden Contractors Pty Limited (`Triden Contractors') is not entitled to the sum which you have claimed in that letter as interest pursuant to Section 95 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) on the amount of the judgment ordered by the Court of Appeal, viz. $1,217,678.10.

By reason of the operation of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p40) [Rule 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s3.html)
SCR and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p51) [Rule 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s2.html)
SCR, read with the provisions of [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s107.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), in our view, the judgment of the Court of Appeal took effect on November 15, 1995.
The orders of the Court were to set aside the relevant orders of Cole J and to make fresh orders `in lieu thereof'. Those fresh orders became operative only when made by the Court of Appeal and cannot properly be viewed as being backdated to the date of his Honour's original orders, viz May 20, 1994 (or perhaps, June 8, 1994) merely by reason of the fact that they were made by way of substitution for his Honour's orders.

The amount of the judgment ordered by the Court of Appeal was paid within twenty-one (21) days of November 15, 1995.

Accordingly, no interest pursuant to Section 95 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is payable.

Alternatively, if that conclusion is incorrect, in our opinion, the charge declared by his Honour, which has not been interfered with in any way by the
Court of Appeal, only attaches to the amount of `damages or compensation' ordered by the Court. The proper construction of [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) does not authorise or permit that charge to extent to interest payable pursuant to
Section 95 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/).

Alternatively, even if both of the above arguments are incorrect, no interest pursuant to Section 95 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is payable by Heath unless and until a money judgment or order is made against it. At the moment, no such order has been made. All that has happened is that the Court has declared the existence of the statutory charge contemplated by [Section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s6.html) 
Accordingly, for the above reasons, Heath takes the view that it is not liable to pay interest to Triden Contractors, having regard to the terms of the orders made by the Court of Appeal and having regard to all other relevant facts." 
NOTICE OF MOTION 
On or about 27 March 1996 Contractors filed a notice of motion in this Court in which Heath was the opponent for the following order: "Pursuant to [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) (New
South Wales), alternatively pursuant to [Part .3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/index.html#p40.3) of the Rules of this Honourable Court, alternatively pursuant to s95 (2) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) the
Respondent pay the Applicant/Claimant interest on the sum of $1,217,678.10 from 20 May 1994 to the date of payment." 
It is agreed that the starting date should have been not 20 May but 8 June.
Heath resists this claim on the basis that this Court has no power to make such an order. It is agreed that the amount of interest, if payable, should be $205,320.54.

Section 95 (1) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) provides: "Where judgment is given or an order is made for the payment of money, interest shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be payable at the prescribed rate from the date when the judgment or order takes effect on so much of the money as is from time to time unpaid." 
Heath's submissions, in opposition to the grant of the relief sought, fall under the following heads:
Neither Cole J nor this Court gave judgment or made an order against Heath "for the payment of money" so that interest is not payable pursuant to s95 . At no time to the present has Contractors sought a judgment or order for a money amount by an amendment of its claim.
Since the amount of the judgment against Timalco had been paid it was now too late for this Court to make an order to take effect from 8 June 1994 for the payment of this amount of money on which s95 (1) could operate.
Because Timalco was at all relevant times in liquidation, s95 (1) did not operate to make interest payable on the order for payment made against it.
The charge created by s6 of the Law Reform Act attached to the amount
Timalco was bound to pay Contractors by way of indemnity, but did not attach to interest on that amount.
This Court had no power to order Heath to pay interest.

CHARGE ON INSURANCE MONEYS 
In Bailey versus New South Wales Medical Defence Union Limited <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 399] at 445 and following, McHugh and Gummow JJ discussed the construction of s6 of the Law Reform Act and at 446-7 said: "Section 6 is to be read against the background of these distinctions in property law. However, what s6 achieves is the creation of a new right with an associated remedy to enforce it (see Pasmore versus Oswaldtwistle Urban District
Council [[1898] AC 387]; Josephson versus Walker <case>; [(1914) 18 CLR 691]; Houston versus Dewi Thomas Pty Ltd <case>; [[1967] VR 300).] ........ By its own force, the statute, in circumstances where it applies, creates, on the happening of the event giving rise to the claim for damages or compensation, a charge on all insurance moneys which are then payable in respect of the liability against which the insured is indemnified and on all such insurance moneys that may become payable in respect of that liability.

That the charge arises on the happening of the event giving rise to the claim for damages or compensation is apparent not only from s6 (1) itself, but from subss (2) and (3). If, on the happening of that event, the insured is being wound up, the charge arises and applies notwithstanding the currency of the winding up;.........

The obligations, the performance of which s6 seeks to secure, are not only payment by the insurer to the insured of all insurance moneys that are or may become payable, but also the performance by the insured of the obligation to pay damages or compensation to the claimant in discharge of the liability of the insured to the claimant.

This is achieved by creating in favour of the claimant a charge on all insurance moneys that are or may become payable in respect of the liability of the insured to pay damages or compensation to the claimant." 
Section 6 (4) of the Law Reform Act provides, inter alia, that the charge shall be enforceable by way of action against the insurer in the same way and in the same court as if the action were an action to recover damages from the insured and that in respect of any such action and of the judgment given therein the parties shall, to the extent of the charge, have the same rights and liabilities, and the Court shall have the same powers, as if the action were against the insured. After discussing this subsection, McHugh and Gummow
JJ in Bailey said at 449-50: "It is necessary now to return to the text of s6 (1). As we have indicated, the charge is created, by force of the legislation, on the happening of the event giving rise to the claim for damages. It is expressed to be a charge on all insurance moneys that are payable in respect of that liability. That clearly would cover the case where the terms of the policy and the events that had happened were such that it could be said that a particular sum was payable by the insurer to the insured. In that state of affairs, the charge has an immediate operation upon an existing and quantified obligation of the insurer to make payment to the insured. ......

The phrase in s6 (1), `insurance moneys that .... may become payable', is apt to deal with the situation where, whilst the charge has descended, there is as yet no sum which could be identified as presently payable by the insurer to the insured. In such a case, the statutory charge operates, by loose analogy to an agreement for a charge on after-acquired property, upon such moneys as and when they do become payable.
 .......

However, once the charge has descended on the happening of the event giving rise to the claim for damages or compensation, no mutual or unilateral action of insurer or insured which is taken otherwise than under or pursuant to the contract of insurance or the general law as it operates upon the contract may vary, discharge or otherwise qualify or abrogate the contract of insurance so as to deny to the claimant what otherwise would be the fruits of enforcement of the charge by action taken under s6 (4) against the insurer. The contract of insurance is that as it stood when the charge descended. Nor, after the charge has descended, is it open to the insurer to rely upon a payment made under the contract to the insured, unless the payment was made without actual notice of the existence of the claimant's charge (s6 (6)). In these ways the position of the claimant is protected." 
At 415 the other members of the Court expressed their agreement with what
McHugh and Gummow JJ said about the effect of s6.
 
INTEREST UNDER S95 (1) OF THE [SUPREME COURT ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) 
Interest payable pursuant to s95 (1) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is intended to compensate the judgment creditor for the loss of the use of money suffered by non-payment of the judgment or order. Had Timalco not been in liquidation, interest would have been payable pursuant to s95 (1) on the amount it was ordered to pay Contractors on 8 June 1994. By its professional indemnity policy Heath agreed to indemnify Timalco against claims made against
Timalco for breach of its professional duty. There is no reason why this indemnity would not extend to cover interest which accrued on and became part of the claim. In particular, Heath had agreed in the policy to pay costs and expenses incurred in Timalco's defence of Contractors' claim.

The interest, which would have been payable by Timalco but for its liquidation, was to compensate Contractors for delays in payment of the judgment arising from the appeal process combined with the effect of the stay ordered by Powell JA. In my opinion, if Timalco was bound to compensate
Contractors by the payment of interest under s95 (1) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), s6 of the Law Reform Act operated to secure Timalco's performance of that obligation to Contractors. The charge operated upon all insurance moneys that became payable in respect of that liability.

THE EFFECT OF THE WINDING UP OF TIMALCO 
That consequence was not, in my opinion, affected by the rule of convenience in bankruptcy whereunder a creditor is not entitled to prove for interest accruing after the commencement of the winding up. Dixon J discussed this rule in MacKenzie versus Rees <case>; [(1941) 65 CLR 1] at 88, the rule "is not meant at all to interfere with the rights of the creditor, if he can get payment from other sources, to combine and retain all that he can obtain from all those sources until he is paid not only his principal but all his interest, and so the debt is entirely satisfied." The winding up did not discharge Timalco from its liability under s95 (1) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to pay interest by to the extent that could be paid from other sources, in this case, the insurance moneys charged. Contractors' claim, based on s6 of the Law Reform Act, derived from a charge which applied notwithstanding the currency of the winding up. The charge over the insurance moneys in respect of this liability to compensate Contractors was unaffected.

CONCLUSION 
Heath did not argue that Cole J had no power to make an order on 8 June 1994 that Heath pay to Contractors $1,217,678.10. Had his Honour done so, interest would have been payable by Heath pursuant to s95(1) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). Heath submitted that at no time had Contractors sought an order for payment.
Ordinarily, in commercial litigation, parties would expect an insurer to abide by the spirit of a declaratory order. In Royal Insurance Co Limited versus Mylius <case>; [(1926) 38 CLR 477], although the insurer had not refused to comply with a statutory requirement pursuant to s49 of the [Imperial Acts Application Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/iaaa1922240/) requiring it to apply insurance moneys to rebuilding insured premises destroyed by fire, Isaacs J said at 497: "Apparently the parties seek merely to know their rights. A declaration under the rules of Court is, therefore, at present sufficient. The declaration of the Supreme Court is right. Every order for declaration of right carries with it liberty to apply, and, if the defendant acts contrary to it, the Court on a proper application, and on proper notice may enforce it (per Lord Macnaghten in Fischer versus Secretary for India [[1898] LR 26 Ind App 16] at 29)." 
Heath's cross appeal against Cole J's declaration that it was bound to indemnify Timalco failed. The cross appeal was one in a web of appeals and cross appeals which, as the result of a stay of execution, delayed ultimate payment up the chain of liability to Capita. Until Heath's cross appeal was decided any attempt to enforce the charge was premature.

The orders of this Court have not been entered. [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s75a.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) provides: "The Court may make any finding or assessment, give any judgment, make any order or give any direction which ought to have been given or made or which the nature of the case requires." 
In my opinion this subsection enables the Court to make the following orders in appeals 40537/94 and 40574/94 in addition to those made on 15 November .
