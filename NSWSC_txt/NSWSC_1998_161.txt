HEADNOTE 
L sought leave to appeal against the trial judge's interlocutory order upholding the National Crime Authority's objection to producing certain documents under a subpoena on the basis of the protection conferred on the
Authority by [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) of the [National Crime Authority Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/) . The essential issue was whether there had been a prosecution instituted as a result of an investigation by the Authority within [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) which constituted an exception to the provision that documents or matter obtained in the course of the Authority performing its duties shall not be required to be produced in Court.

Held: - Whether there was an investigation carried out by the Authority was a question of fact. The judge was entitled to find on the materials that there was no such investigation and was correct in his reasons for so finding.
 - There was no tolerably arguable point.
 - Meaning of investigation discussed.

ORDER:
Leave to appeal refused.

JUDGMENT 
SMART J: Ronald Stephen Lilley now seeks leave to appeal pursuant to [Section 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) against an interlocutory order of Acting Judge Ford declining to require certain documents to be produced under a subpoena addressed to the National Crime Authority because of the statutory protection conferred by [Section 51](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) (3) of the [National Crime Authority Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/), 1984. 
Mr Lilley initially also sought leave to appeal against a decision refusing a stay of proceedings. In this court he sought an adjournment of that application and when it was indicated that that was unlikely to be granted and that the Court would entertain the application on the merits in conjunction with the adjournment application, the application for leave to appeal against the order refusing the stay was withdrawn.

The applicant was indicted on a charge of being knowingly concerned in the supply of a large commercial quantity of heroin. He and his co accused, David
Hatch, were due to stand trial on 2 June 1997 but that trial did not proceed when Hatch did not appear and was unable to be located.

Thereafter the judge dealt with certain interlocutory applications and in particular, the application relating to the production of documents by the
National Crime Authority and the ambit of the protection of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) (3) of that Act.

Before turning to the terms of the Section, I will briefly outline the history of the NCA's involvement and the Crown case as they appear from the materials before this Court.

An informant, McGregor, contacted Superintendent Purchas, an officer of the
Federal Police on secondment as Chief Investigator of the National Crime
Authority and gave him some information.

It was not a matter which the National Crime Authority wished to pursue itself so the Authority disseminated the information to the New South Wales Police
Service which conducted an investigation which led to the applicant's arrest.

During the course of that Service's investigation, Mr Purchas made some investigators available to assist the New South Wales police service for limited surveillance. Superintendent Purchas, also carried out some limited surveillance.

The New South Wales Police Service kept all the records which were created.
The investigators, who retained their status as serving members of the Police
Service from which they had come, were allocated to the New South Wales Police
Service to function in their capacities as members of a police service and not as investigators of the Authority.

The Director of Public Prosecutions of New South Wales instituted proceedings against Hatch and Lilley based upon evidence obtained by the New South Wales
Police Service. McGregor gave evidence at the committal proceedings.

The Crown alleges that Hatch offered to supply heroin to McGregor. On 13 June Hatch met McGregor at Sydney Airport and said that he would telephone
Ron.

McGregor handed his mobile telephone to Hatch to enable him to do so. Hatch made a telephone call and told McGregor that he had just spoken to his contact who had said that he would "do a pound first for $120,000 and if that goes OK he'll do another and another and another up to four pounds." McGregor agreed. His mobile telephone record shows that a call was made that day to a telephone number used by Lilley.

Later, Hatch and Lilley were observed at the Novotel Hotel at Brighton-le-
Sands. Listening devices were placed in the rooms individually occupied by
Hatch and Lilley. Hatch handed an undercover police officer a sample of heroin and was shown bundles of bank notes. Hatch went to the nearby room occupied by
Lilley, who would not proceed with the transaction until he had the money.

Hatch returned to the room where the undercover operatives were waiting but they would not part with the money until they had been given the heroin.
Lilley refused to change his mind. An impasse developed and the deal was called off. Conversations were recorded on the listening devices.

Counsel for Lilley told the primary judge that the Crown case against Lilley was based on surveillance material and the tapes of the conversations between
Hatch and Lilley in the hotel rooms. Counsel emphasised to the judge that after the conversations Lilley left the hotel. He was stopped but no drugs were found upon him.

The applicant served a subpoena on the proper officer of the National Crime
Authority to produce some eight categories of documents. Four of these related to an operation which was neither an operation or an investigation conducted by the
National Crime Authority. Nor had it prepared any of the documents sought relating to it.

The other four categories read: "1 All correspondence, material, documents, memoranda and any other information held, whether electronically or in hard copy, in relation to ...
MacGregor.
All correspondence, material, documents and any other information held whether electronically or in hard copy including notebook entries in relation to dealings between any officers of seconded to or part of the National Crime
Authority and ... MacGregor.
Records of all payments made by the New South Wales Police Service to ...
MacGregor.
All correspondence, material, documents and other information held, whether electronically or hard copy in relation to the involvement of ...
MacGregor in the matters of Klor, Von Snarski and any other matter in which ... MacGregor acted as a police agent or informant." 
The National Crime Authority objected to producing the documents because of the effect of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) (3) of the [National Crime Authority Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/), which, it claimed, exempted it from producing the documents.

The general functions of the National Crime Authority are set out in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s11.html) which relevantly reads: "11 (1) The general functions of the Authority are: to collect and analyse criminal information and intelligence relating to relevant criminal activities and disseminate that information and intelligence to: law enforcement agencies; and any person authorized by the Governor-General, the Governor of a State, a
Minister of State of the Commonwealth or a Minister of the Crown of a State to hold an inquiry to which the information or intelligence is relevant; to investigate, otherwise than pursuant to a reference made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s13.html) or in accordance with [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s14.html), matters relating to relevant criminal activities;" [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s11.html) (2) provides that the special functions of the Authority are to investigate matters which are referred to it under [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s13.html) and [14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s14.html) of the Act. There was no reference applicable to this matter.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) (2) prohibits a member of the Authority or a member of the staff of the Authority divulging information obtained in the course of performing his duties.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) (3) provides: "(3) A person to whom this section applies shall not be required to produce in any court any document that has come into his custody or control in the course of, or by reason of, the performance of his duties under this Act, or to divulge or communicate to a court a matter or thing that has come to his notice in the performance of his duties under this Act, except where the
Authority, or a member or acting member in his official capacity, is a party to the relevant proceeding or it is necessary to do so: for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act; or for the purposes of a prosecution instituted as a result of an investigation carried out by the Authority in the performance of its functions." 
The Authority is not a party to the trial. The judge held that the exception in paragraph (a) had no application. That is obviously correct. It is not necessary for the purposes of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act to produce in any court the documents, the subject of the subpoena.

Nor does paragraph (b) apply. There was no investigation carried out by the
Authority. It received information which it could have checked. The Authority referred it and the informant to the New South Wales Police Service. The
Authority also made available some investigators who were police officers to assist with some limited surveillance. It was a State investigation and a
State prosecution.

I agree with the judge that the definition of investigation in the Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary is helpful, namely "a search, enquiry, systematic examination or minute and careful research." The relevant definition in the
Macquarie Dictionary is "a searching inquiry in order to ascertain facts; a detailed or careful examination." 
There is not a great deal of difference between the two dictionary meanings.
It is, in my view, clear that in this case there was no investigation by the
Authority.

Essentially, whether there was an investigation carried out by the Authority was a question of fact. The judge was entitled to find on the materials that there was no such investigation.

In my opinion the judge correctly found that there had been no investigation by the Authority. I agree with his reasons.

I would refuse leave to appeal on the ground that there is no tolerably arguable point.

I have found it unnecessary to consider further the meaning of the phrase "it is necessary to do so" in [s (3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/s51.html) 
It is of interest to note that the judge remarked that Lilley may well be able to obtain anything that is significant as a result of the subpoena served on the Commissioner of Police.

Leave to appeal should be refused.

GLEESON CJ: I agree. 
DOWD J: I also agree. 
GLEESON CJ: The order of the Court will be as proposed by Smart J. * * *
