JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
HAMILTON J  
MONDAY, 10 DECEMBER 2001  /01 RE JAMES  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings the Director General of the Department of
Community Services as plaintiff seeks in effect a review of an interlocutory ruling by a magistrate of the Children's Court as to the location of a child who is already under State care pending the hearing in the Children's Court of a final hearing of the proceedings as to the location of the child. The order is sought as an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court as parens patriae over children.  In the Children's Court Ms Lori Robertson, solicitor, had been appointed as the legal representative under the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s99.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/) to carry out the functions prescribed by that section. The child is not at the present time joined as a party to the proceedings in this Court. It has been thought appropriate by the Director General and by Ms Robertson that she should be appointed to play a similar role representing the child in these review proceedings and that course is not opposed by counsel for the mother or by counsel for the grandparents of the child, who are also involved in these proceedings. The course also seems appropriate to me.  Various ways of achieving this result were discussed in the course of debate. However, Mr Mark Anderson of counsel has referred me to the decision of Austin J in DOCS versus R C  <case>, where his Honour in proceedings in which this jurisdiction of the Court was also invoked appointed a lawyer as legal representative of the subject child to carry out similar functions under the [Children (Care and Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/capa1987250/) as are now provided for by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s99.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/). In that case his Honour made the child a ward of Court before making the order for the appointment of a special representative. In this case I do not think that is appropriate at this stage, but I do think it appropriate to join the child as a defendant to the proceedings and then to appoint Ms Lori Robertson as a special representative.  I therefore order that the child be joined as the sixth defendant in the proceedings and that Lori Robertson, solicitor, be appointed the legal representative of the child to carry out the same functions in these proceedings as would a legal representative appointed under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s99.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/) in proceedings in the Children's Court.
