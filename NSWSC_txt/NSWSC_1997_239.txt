The evidence in this case is by affidavit. The passage which counsel wishes to have admitted is a statement in an affidavit by the plaintiff, "We then attempted to apply a [sic] for a Homefund loan but was [sic] told that our joint incomes were too much to enable us to qualify for the loan."` ` [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s29.html) speaks about "giving evidence". It occurs in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p2)
Division 3 of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) which is headed "General rules about giving evidence". When one looks at the various sections in that division they are virtually all concerned with oral evidence.
Indeed, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s33.html) emphasises the fact that the Court is dealing with oral evidence rather than a written statement.` ` I consider that [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s29.html) only applies where evidence is given orally, not when it is given by affidavit.` ` I am further reinforced in that view by the reason why [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s29.html) was put into the Act. This reason, which can be found in Cross on
Evidence, 5th Australian Edition, Butterworths, Sydney, 1996 [17145] or the second edition of Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law, Federation Press, Sydney, (par [29.3]) was that it was thought that there were some witnesses who were psychologically unable to do justice to their case by responding to questions. However those persons might be able to give a free report as to what they had seen or heard. That consideration has no part to play when affidavit evidence is presented because the witness has the assistance of professional advice in preparing the document.` ` In any event, if the statement is any more than background it would be necessary for the Court to have the details of the attempt and the details of who said what on behalf of the Homefund Authority if the statement really was to assist the Court. Narrative evidence is permitted to assist the Court getting at the truth, not as a substitute for an inadequate statement made by the witness.` ` Accordingly for all these reasons I reject this application.` `` 
JUDGMENT P2 
The plaintiff is currently in the witness box. She was asked about a payment of about $13,000 to a travel agent. She was asked when she paid that sum. She answered, "When did I pay it? I have a receipt, if you want to know the exact date. Would you like to know? You don't have the receipt? I have a copy here if you want." Mr Durston of counsel for the defendant has asked for an order under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s36.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) that the plaintiff produce the receipt to the court. Section 12 of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ea189880/) used to cover this situation. The way in which <case> operated was that any document that was within the precincts of the courtroom could be impounded by the judge and the judge could give access to it. Section 36 is in very different terms to <case>.
Section 12 of the 1898 Act focuses on the person with the document: <case> of the 1995 Act focuses on the court. Under <case>, a court may order a person "to give evidence and to produce documents". It would seem that by using the word "and" the section is directed to a person who is not already giving evidence.
Accordingly, <case> cannot be availed of to order the witness who is in the box to produce a document. For some unknown reason the conjunction "or" is used in <case>, but I do not think that that alters the prima facie construction of <case>.

Accordingly, I decline to make any order under that section that the witness produce the document to the court.

Although <case> is not applicable, the principle referred to in Dwyer v
Collins <case>; [(1852) 7 Ex 639]; [155 ER 1104] does apply. The extent of the principle is debatable, but it is at least authority for the proposition that if a witness in the box proffers a document then the witness should be allowed to produce it to the court and thereby secure the best evidence of its context. Once it is then in the custody of the court the court may give access.

In Glass' Seminars on Evidence (Law Book Co, Sydney) 1970, pp 11-19, there is an extensive discussion of the inherent power of a judge to see that justice in done in his or her court, cf Summers versus Moseley [(1834) 2 C & M 477], 486; <case>; [149
ER 849], 852.

The document should be produced to the court.

JEANETTE RAMIREZ versus THE TRUSTEE OF THE PROPERTY OF ZOLTAN SANDOR, A BANKRUPT /95 
WEDNESDAY 23 APRIL 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 23 Baltimore Road, Mortdale Heights is land under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) on which there is erected a house in which the plaintiff lives. The register appears to say that the proprietor is Zoltan Sandor.

Zoltan Sandor became bankrupt on 30 September 1994. The defendant, the well- known liquidator, Mr Hugh Jenner Wily, is the Trustee of Mr Sandor's bankrupt estate.

The plaintiff claims that Mr Sandor, thus Mr Wily, holds the property on trust for her because she paid the whole of the purchase price and that Mr Sandor became the registered proprietor as her nominee.

The matters that are posed for decision really depend on questions of fact and credibility. Unfortunately for the tribunal of fact, most of the alleged payments were made in cash so there is little by way of corroborative documentary evidence to assist.

The contract for the purchase was exchanged on 21 February 1991. The purchase price was $175,000 with the usual ten per cent deposit. That deposit was paid to the estate agent on 4 February 1991. The estate agent gave a receipt made out to Mr Z Sandor acknowledging receipt of a cheque for $17,500. Ms Ramirez and/or Mr Sandor employed Messrs McBride Harle & Company, Solicitors, to act for the purchaser on the purchase. Those solicitors received a bank cheque for $5,002 on account of stamp duty on 15 March and cash of $49,500 to complete the purchase on 23 April 1991. There is no doubt at all that the cash was conveyed to the solicitors by the plaintiff. There was a shortfall of approximately $110,000 and this was borrowed from a body which is popularly called "Homefund". The purchase was settled on 24 April 1991.

The plaintiff had two bank accounts, each a savings account, one with the
National Bank at Kingsford and the other with the Commonwealth Savings Bank.
The second has little part to play in what occurred. The plaintiff's bank statements for the National Bank are in evidence.

There is no doubt at all that in January 1991 the plaintiff received two cheques from her former solicitors totalling approximately $84,000 as part of a divorce settlement with her former husband. She deposited these into her account with the National Bank. After some withdrawals, but whilst she still had approximately $80,000 in the account, the plaintiff, on 10 and 11 January respectively, withdrew $20,000 and $40,000 out of that account. The evidence as to exactly what happened to that $60,000 and why is rather obscure.

The plaintiff says that she was intending to go to Chile with her children and another person and that she had assigned $20,000 to the cost of the Chile trip and of that $20,000 sum just under $13,000 was for the air tickets. She paid that to the travel agent, but was able, a short time later, to reclaim it.
That money, in due course, was part of the money used for the house at
Mortdale Heights. She says that the travel agent would not give her cash even though she demanded it, but gave her a cash cheque and she went to the bank on which the cheque was drawn and cashed it. This was not completely correct, as other evidence shows that the cheque was paid into Mr Sandor's bank account.

The plaintiff also says that she put $40,000 of the money withdrawn into an investment with National Mutual Assets Management which runs both a property trust and a cash management trust. The records from that body show that the plaintiff did invest $30,000, $20,000 in the property trust and $10,000 in the cash management trust on 15 January but that the investment of $20,000 was reversed on 6 February 1991 and the funds returned by cheque. The $10,000 remained with National Mutual for a month and was paid out to the plaintiff on February with interest. The other $10,000 the plaintiff says she managed to withdraw from her investment advisor before it actually got into the National
Mutual books.

The way in which money travelled from the plaintiff's National Bank account to
Mr Sandor's account at the Commonwealth Bank at Broadway and back, in some cases, to the plaintiff, is rather strange. Although Mr Tregenza of counsel for the plaintiff put bluntly that people who live in ivory towers might think it strange, but "resourceful battlers" have no other alternative, I still wonder why such a convoluted route for the money was necessary. However, this is really a matter of speculation.

There is no doubt at all that some of the details which the plaintiff gave as to the way in which the moneys were spent is strange, and there is also no doubt at all that some of the details that she gave as to what money was used for which purpose back in 1991 differ with other accounts. The comment was made that when one sees this type of conflicting evidence it reflects on the credibility of the witness. Mr Tregenza says that, when it is realised that what happened took place six years ago, one should not expect people with very little documentation still at hand to be able to get all the details right. I think this comment is right, though it is also right to say that the credibility of the plaintiff is very much affected by the general outlook that she displayed. Mr Tregenza put it very nicely that battlers have to be resourceful, but the resourcefulness which Ms Ramirez showed included involvement in making false statutory declarations to a lending authority because, on her case, she knew she would not be able to achieve her goal in any other way. That fact itself reflects on her credibility. However, the mere fact that the plaintiff has some defects in character does not mean that she must lose any litigation which she commences. It merely means that the judge, when evaluating the evidence, has to be particularly careful.

Mr Durston of counsel for the defendant referred me to Michael versus Thompson <case>; [(1894) 20 VLR 548], 552 where Madden CJ said, with respect to a voluntary settlement attacked under the Bankruptcy Act: "Where all the facts concerning the settlement are within the knowledge of the settlor and settlee and are not within the knowledge of the creditors impugning the settlement, although the burden of proof is on those impugning the settlement, a very slight degree of proof should be sufficient to shift that burden." 
That passage was recently applied by Fisher J in Official Trustee v
Marchiori [(1983) 69 FLR 290] at 297 and is referred to as still being the law in the current release of the 5th edition of McDonald, Henry & Meek Australian Bankruptcy Law and
Practice at Note 120.1.20.

I had some worries that <case> of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ea189880/) may have displaced that rule. That section rather imperiously says that: "(1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities." 
There is nothing in subs (1) which refers to the "comfortable satisfaction principle" of Helton versus Allen [(1940) 63 CLR 961] nor to the type of case envisaged in Michael versus Thompson. However, <case>(b), although expressed in a rather elliptical fashion, seems to suggest that in working out the balance of probabilities under subs (1), one does take into account the nature of the subject- matter of the proceeding. Whilst that would obviously deal with the Helton versus Allen situation, it is less clear that it deals with a situation where the facts are mainly in the camp of the opponent.
Indeed that situation does not appear within any of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of <case>. However, I believe that, despite the imperious way in which s (1) is phrased, the legislature did not intend to displace the principle referred to by Madden CJ in Michael's case and that it should apply in this sort of case.

Of course, the principle is not directly applicable because Ms Ramirez is a plaintiff and she is the person who is alleged to have become involved in what was, if the defendant's case is correct, a fraud on the creditors. However, by analogy, one must look with suspicion and require a greater degree of comfortable satisfaction when considering the balance of probabilities in such a case.

Although when one looks at all the details one can see that they do not all fit together nicely, if one looks at the bigger picture it seems to me very hard to see how the purchase price could have come about otherwise than the way the plaintiff says it came about.

The only moneys which Mr Sandor seems to have had were in his bank account with the Commonwealth Bank in Broadway. Mr Durston says "We don't know whether the bankrupt had other bank accounts". That comment is quite accurate, but I can only act on the material that the parties have placed before me, doubtless after appropriate preparation considering all the circumstances. Mr Sandor did have some money in his bank account which was money that had come from his sister in Germany. He also had some money which the plaintiff had handed to him and at the end of April 1991 he withdrew $24,400 from his bank account.
The deposit slip which is part of Exhibit DX08 has a deposit made on 7
February into that account which shows that $12,640 came in from the Coemini
Travel Service and this would almost certainly be the refund of the airfares to Chile which was from the plaintiff. On 21 April $24,400 was paid out by the
Commonwealth Bank to Mr Sandor in cash, $20,000 in fifty dollar notes and $4,400 in hundred dollar notes. Part of this money found its way back to Ms
Ramirez and then on to McBride Harle & Company. Part of it was used by Mr
Sandor, on his evidence, to repay some debts.

Of the creditors of Mr Sandor, one is currently in Africa and she did not give evidence. A comment was validly made that she is a rather peripatetic lady and was in Australia at some time after this litigation was commenced and she could have then given evidence, and I take that into account. A second was Mr
Janos Hemelia. He did swear an affidavit, but he was not present for cross- examination and I read para 1 of his affidavit, which confirmed he had lent Mr
Sandor some money, on the basis that that would have been tested in cross- examination by counsel for the defendant. The third was Mr Sebes. He ran a cafe at Glebe. Although the details do not completely coincide between Mr 
Sebes' evidence and Mr Sandor's evidence, both agree that $1,500 in cash was lent to Mr Sandor by Mr Sebes and that that money was repaid in cash somewhere early in 1991. Mr Sebes' evidence seemed to me to be completely credible. He gave evidence openly and there is no reason at all why I should disbelieve anything he says. His evidence corroborates Mr Sandor as to part of the disposal of the moneys which Mr Sandor received on 21 April from the
Commonwealth Bank.

The plaintiff gave her evidence confidently. She was cross-examined for almost three hours and although she did have the propensity for saying "Do you want me to lie?" every so often, it seemed to me, in view of the fact these events happened six years ago, that she gave her evidence confidently and honestly and I accept her evidence.

Mr Sandor was not as impressive. He was not as fluent, but perhaps that is partly explained by the fact his mastery of English was not quite as good as the plaintiff's. Both the plaintiff and Mr Sandor were involved in an enterprise which was illegal, but this would not be the first case I have tried in which persons have justified in their own minds that their need to obtain something, such as a roof over their heads, justifies them in "cutting corners" even dishonestly or criminally.

It seems to me on the evidence which has been given by the plaintiff, corroborated by the little material that there is, even bearing in mind the rule in Michael's case, on the balance of probabilities the cash component for the purchase of the property was provided by the plaintiff and that Mr
Sandor, the registered proprietor, would hold it on trust for her accordingly.

A mortgage, however, was taken out. The reason for the deception was, as the plaintiff herself said in her affidavit, that she had approached mortgagees and that she found that she was not able to obtain a loan. She also thought that it may have been possible for her to obtain a loan together with Mr
Sandor but she was told by "the lady from Homefund" that their combined income would put them over the limit on which Homefund lent to the poorer section of the community. Accordingly she asked Mr Sandor whether he would be the borrower and whether the house could be put in his name and both the plaintiff's evidence and Mr Sandor's evidence agree that, after a couple of days' consideration, he agreed this is what would happen. The plaintiff then completed a loan application form for a "Homefund Low Start Loan", a copy of which is annexure G to the affidavit of Miss Collin of 23 August 1995. The document was signed by Mr Sandor and indeed it was verified by statutory declaration which Mr Sandor made before a Justice of the Peace. The details of assets in <case>.1 of the form were "a sort of combination" of Ms Ramirez's assets and Mr Sandor's. They justified it, at least in their own minds, by the fact that Ms Ramirez had actually paid over into Mr Sandor's account the relevant amount of cash so that he could say in his statutory declaration that he had that amount of cash in his bank.

The mortgage was then entered into by Mr Sandor alone because Homefund did not want to know about Ms Ramirez as a mortgagor.

Mr Durston puts that Mr Sandor must therefore be taken to have made a contribution because he was liable for the whole of the $110,000 to Homefund, and even if there was an indemnity from Ms Ramirez, his personal covenant was still a contribution by him to the purchase. He cites as authority for that line of thinking Calverley versus Green <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR 242.] 
That case really has little to do with this situation. It dealt with the situation where a man and a woman had to put property in joint names. As the property was in joint names, they were equally liable on the mortgage and each was entitled to treat what was advanced by the mortgagee as advanced in equal moieties to each of them.

In the present case the sole mortgagor was Mr Sandor. On the facts as I have found them Mr Sandor was merely the nominee for Ms Ramirez. It was always intended between the two of them that, although the property was "technically mine" as Mr Sandor put it, the property was really (in other words in equity) the sole property of Ms Ramirez. Mr Sandor was entering into the mortgage as
Ms Ramirez's nominee. He would be entitled to be indemnified at least out of the trust property if not by Ms Ramirez and I do not consider the mere fact he entered into the mortgage or the fact he was personally liable under the mortgage amounts to any contribution.

There is also no doubt at all that the money to pay the stamp duty was paid out of Ms Ramirez's money. Mr Durston cited Little versus Little [(1988) 15
NSWLR 43], 46 for the proposition that: "What one gets for paying stamp duty is a stamp, not a piece of land." 
As with all epigrams, this contains some degree of truth, but is far short of giving the whole picture. The payment of the stamp duty amount is corroborative evidence that the property was Ms Ramirez's because people just do not pay the stamp duty on other people's property unless there is some particular reason for doing so, such as a close bond of affection. Again, if one does pay the stamp duty on someone else's property I would have thought, at the very least, apart from buying the pretty stamp on the document - now reduced to a cash register imprint - one also gets subrogated to the
Commissioner's charge if one is not the person primarily liable.

There was some suggestion by the defendant that there was a close bond of affection and that Ms Ramirez was really the de facto wife of Mr Sandor. The suggestion was provided by an officer and a former officer of the Trustee. The evidence was not to my mind of very great weight. First of all, it was quite apparent that the officers had been influenced by the material which they had been given by the solicitor for the petitioning creditor, who was hardly sympathetic to Mr Sandor. Secondly, the evidence of Ms Ramirez, which, as I said, I accepted, and indeed the evidence of Mr Sandor shows that, whilst there had been a relationship between himself and the plaintiff in the late '80s, there was no current relationship. I can only conclude that there has been some misunderstanding on the part of the Trustee's officers. I certainly would not find on their evidence that the parties were in a de facto relationship or any other close relationship as at 1994-1996.

It follows that I accept the plaintiff's case and she is entitled to relief.

A problem which was adverted to during submissions was that Homefund is not a party to these proceedings. There is no doubt at all that Homefund has a registered mortgage and that any interest which the plaintiff takes is subject to that mortgage.

At present Homefund may have the benefit of a personal covenant from Mr Sandor but as he is bankrupt that is probably worth very little. It should, however, be given the opportunity of considering whether it wishes to make submissions as to the type of decree that should be made in these proceedings even if it is not formally added as a party. Accordingly, I will publish these reasons.
In current circumstances it usually takes a little while for the reasons to be produced, corrected and distributed so I think it is probably appropriate to stand the matter over for, say, six weeks for the plaintiff to bring in short minutes of order.

The question of costs will need to be considered when the short minutes are brought in. Mr Tregenza says the plaintiff is entitled to costs because she has been successful. That proposition is almost certainly correct. The question, however, that will be troublesome is whether the costs order should just be made without condition, or whether, as there was an amendment of the proceedings to state the defendant as "The Trustee of the Property of Zoltan
Sandor, a Bankrupt" in lieu of the previous defendant, Hugh Jenner Wily, the person who actually is that trustee, the costs order should be limited to the assets available to Mr Wily as trustee of the bankrupt in this case. That matter can be argued on the next occasion.

Accordingly the only things I do at this stage are: 
Publish my reasons.

Extend caveat U494337 until further order.

Stand the matter over to 9.30 in my list on 12 June 1997 provided that, if counsel contact my Associate no later than 5 June, that date may be altered.
