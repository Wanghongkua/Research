Giles versus Winn /97 August 1997 
Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /97 - GILES V WINN 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a suit for dissolution of the partnership which operated the Royal Mail Hotel at Narrandera. The parties signed a partnership agreement on 10 January 1994, paragraph 18 of which provided for dissolution by three months' notice by either party. On 10 January 1997, the plaintiff gave the defendant three months' notice. The defendant made no response to that notice, as a result of which I am satisfied that the partnership was dissolved on 18 April 1997. 
The defendant did not appear, even though served in accordance with the order for substituted service made by Santow J last Friday. I am satisfied that, as the partnership has been duly dissolved and the defendant is not co-operating in its winding up, the plaintiff is entitled to have an order that it be wound up under the supervision of the court and for the appointment of a Receiver.
Mr Dean-Willcocks, a professional accountant and liquidator, has consented to be appointed Receiver, and he seems to be an appropriate person to appoint.

Accordingly, I make orders 1 to 7 in the short minutes, which I have initialled, dated and placed with the papers.

The costs of both parties in the proceedings are to be paid out of the assets of the partnership.
