Order that the appellants (claimants) pay the respondent's (opponent's) costs of the appeal and of the summons for leave to appeal.
JUDGE1
KIRBY P: Before the Court is a summons for leave to appeal. The parties agreed that, if the Court were minded to grant leave to appeal, it should treat the hearing of the summons as the hearing of the appeal. The summons concerns the exercise of the discretion provided to Judges of the District Court by Part
A rule 9 DCR, where a judgment is recovered which is no more than an offer of compromise made by a defendant before the hearing. The case is complicated by the inter-position of an arbitration conducted in accordance with the [Arbitration (Civil Actions) Act 1983](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/) (the Act). It is further complicated by the way in which the particular arbitration was conducted in this case.
 
Injury, arbitration and hearing
Gonul Mustafa (the opponent) claimed damages for injuries received in a motor vehicle accident which occurred in
January 1992. The motor vehicle which she was driving came into collision with a motor vehicle owned by My Loan
Quach and driven by Buo, Lam Quach (the claimants). It was conceded by the claimants that the collision was caused by negligence for which they were responsible in law. Liability was not in issue. The matter in contest was the assessment of the damages of the opponent.
The opponent's claim was commenced in the District Court. On 29 October , the claimants' solicitors served a notice of offer of compromise in accordance with [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) DCR. The offer was to settle the opponent's claim in the sum of $25,000 together with her costs. Unknown to the opponent some twelve days prior to the offer being made she had been the subject of extensive film surveillance. The film which was exposed covered her activities over two days. It required approximately five to six hours to view the film in its entirety. It may be inferred that the offer of compromise was made on behalf of the claimants with knowledge of the contents of the film. The opponent, on the other hand, was unaware that the film was available to the claimants.
The offer of compromise was not accepted within the time fixed by [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r DCR. However, the opponent, by her solicitor, applied for a reference of her claim to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the
Act. The Court was informed that the claimants resisted the reference of the claim to arbitration. The
Court was also informed that, in the Parramatta Registry of the District Court where the opponent's proceedings had been commenced, reference to arbitration is virtually automatic. This is not the case in which to explore that assertion which was not founded on evidence. It must, however, be emphasised that reference to arbitration is not automatic by force of the Act or of [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p51a) DCR. A discretion is involved which must be exercised judicially to reflect the purposes of the Act. If Parliament had intended that all actions in the District Court be referred to arbitration it would have so provided.
The arbitration came on for hearing before Arbitrator P Dooley. He reviewed the medical reports. He appears to have rejected the more extreme complaints of the opponent as to pain in her neck and back. Nonetheless, he concluded that she had problems in her cervical spine and her lower back and was also suffering from anxiety and depression. In respect of the anxiety and depression he could not be satisfied that these all related to the motor vehicle accident. He made an award in the opponent's favour in the sum of $76,022.05. This included substantial amounts for past and future economic loss. The award was entered on 9 May 1994. Obviously, the award was for a sum greater than the $25,000 and costs offered seven months earlier by the claimants. The award therefore carried the opponent's costs. Had there been no application for a rehearing, the award of the arbitrator would have been "final and conclusive". It could not be called in question. See the
Act, [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html)
However, the claimants sought a rehearing by the District Court. That application was made on 18 July 1994. The rehearing took place before Karpin
DCJ on 31 October 1994. Her Honour reserved her judgment. On 27 February 1995,
Karpin DCJ delivered her reasons.
She found a verdict and entered judgment for the opponent in the sum of $20,206.05. That sum was therefore not only a substantial improvement in the position of the claimants when compared to their position under the arbitrator's award (on which see [Pt 15A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p15a) art 12(1))
DCR. It also constituted a judgment on the claim, to which the offer earlier made for the claimants related, being for a sum not more favourable to the opponent than the terms of the claimants' offer.
It is this margin of deficit which occasioned the application for costs on the part of the claimants. They sought their costs from the date of the offer.
It is the refusal by
Karpin DCJ to provide such costs which occasions this summons.
 
The Judge's reasons for Judgment and costs
Karpin DCJ was, of course, unaware of the amount awarded by the arbitrator in favour of the opponent. Her Honour, as the law required, determined the matter solely on the material placed before her. That material included a lengthy film taken in October 1993. According to the evidence of the opponent's solicitor, this was not shown to the arbitrator in the course of the arbitration hearing on 9 May 1994, although
I would infer that it was available to the representatives of the claimants at that time. Certain other segments of film were also shown to Karpin DCJ. These were exposed in March and October 1994. The film of March 1994 was also not shown to the arbitrator in the course of the arbitration hearing in May 1994. The opponent was crossexamined before the arbitrator about certain matters relevant to the two films but without express reference to, or showing of, the film.
Karpin DCJ was obviously much affected by the three films which were seen by her. She described the opponent's appearance when first giving evidence and her "very limited movement in her neck". She described the opponent's demonstration of her inability to move her neck. She then described the films which had been shown during the claimants' case before her: "The lengthiest being some hours of film taken on 17 October at a barbeque attended by the plaintiff. That film is most revealing. It clearly demonstrates a young woman who on that day was suffering no visible disabilities. Indeed, she appeared to be strong and energetic. She was moving her head in all directions including looking up at persons to whom she was talking when she was crouching on the ground, bending down, bending her head, crouching, sitting cross-legged, moving about constantly carrying awkward items, stretching into the car to obtain items from the car, running and picking up a child; carrying a child of approximately 14 or 15 months with one arm on her hip on several occasions and over some distance; holding a child out at arm's length briefly and undertaking various other activities. ... There is not a moment when the plaintiff showed any sign of discomfort or difficulty in her movements.
Indeed, on the contrary, she seemed to be supple and able to undertake any physical activity she wished, including pushing her child on a swing, raising her arms well above the shoulder level and generally showing every sign of being able to participate actively and fully in a family barbeque."
The further film which was shown merely confirmed the judge's opinion of the opponent's capacity of free movement. Addressing the suggestion that the opponent had "good days", Karpin DCJ said: "Coincidence is no doubt a strange thing. I am not, however, persuaded that the film obtained of the plaintiff was coincidentally always obtained when she was having a good day or feeling better. I have formed the view not only on the basis of the film, but on the basis of the plaintiffs evidence that she is grossly exaggerating her symptoms. It may be, indeed, that she has been exaggerating them to her family as well. On the whole of the evidence I am not prepared to give great credence to assertions made by the plaintiff."
Karpin DCJ repeated this statement in two other parts of her reasons for judgment. Because of her "very unfavourable view of the plaintiff and of her credibility" she concluded that the opponent had suffered an injury which caused a temporary period of pain and limitation in movement of the neck and spine and a period of headaches. It was on this footing that her Honour reached the verdict and judgment previously stated. She ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the trial as agreed or assessed.
It was upon the announcement of the order for costs that, quite properly, the solicitor for the claimants, taking the judgment, informed her Honour of the notice of offer of compromise of 28 October 1993. The solicitor for the opponent made submissions. He acknowledged that that the matter had gone to the arbitrator who had entered an award "considerably more" than the judgment found by her Honour. The transcript then reads: "SOLICITOR: ... I can't really make any further submissions than - apart from when the matter went to the arbitrator, the plaintiff did receive a considerably higher verdict, although your Honour has substantially reduced that amount. Thank you your Honour.

HER HONOUR: The total amount involved is somewhat less than in the offer of compromise but in all of the circumstances, I do not propose to vary the costs. The costs order will be that the defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs. I publish my reasons."
On application her Honour later ordered that the filing fee for the hearing in the District Court be refunded. This is provided for in [Pt 51A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p51a) r (1) DCR by which a party, which substantially improves its position as compared to the position held under the arbitrator's award, may recover the filing fee.
 
Proceedings in the Court of Appeal
When the summons was heard, the claimants made it plain that their complaints were, essentially, two-fold:
That Karpin DCJ had failed to give any reasons for her decision not to "vary the costs". It was said that her Honour's reference to "all of the circumstances" was too general, enigmatic and if allowed to stand would effectively write out of the law the rules governing costs in such cases; and 
Insofar as any reasons were given, or existed, they did not constitute sufficient reasons for "otherwise ordering" as contemplated by the
Rules of the District Court governing costs where judgment is recovered after an offer of compromise which is effectively less than the offer made. That rule is [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r (6) DCR which reads: "(6) Where an offer is made by a defendant and not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains ... a judgment on the claim to which the offer relates not more favourable to him than the terms of the offer, then, unless the Court otherwise orders, the plaintiff shall be entitled to an order against the defendant for his costs in respect of the claim up to and including the day the offer was made, assessed on a party and party basis, and, unless the Court otherwise orders, the defendant shall be entitled to an order against the plaintiff for his costs in respect of the claim thereafter, assessed on a party and party basis."
According to the claimants, it was necessary, in the lawful disposal of the application for costs following signification of the offer of compromise, for Karpin DO to consider whether the Court should "otherwise order" under [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR. Such an "otherwise order" had to be considered in the context of a rule which is expressed in mandatory terms ("the defendant shall be entitled"). Furthermore, it had to be considered in the context of the public policy which stands behind the rule. This is a policy which is designed to promote the settlement of cases; the serious consideration of offers of compromise; and to attach a sanction to a refusal of an offer which the subsequent litigation demonstrates to have been reasonable when made. In the present case, the offer was made after the first lengthy segment of film was taken of the opponent. The offer was made by the claimants knowing the condition of the opponent demonstrated in that film. By definition, the opponent would herself have known of her true condition at the time the offer was made. She would therefore, so the argument ran, have known that the offer was reasonable. It might not have been reasonable to the complaints which she was making. But those complaints were (as ultimately found) grossly exaggerated and unreliable. The plaintiff should then, acting honestly and reasonably, have accepted the offer. Her failure to do so, after the period expired, put her at risk of the operation of [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR. The facility to "otherwise order" was available to cover the exceptional case of truly extenuating circumstances. It was available to ensure that the rule did not have an entirely mechanical application. See Maitland Hospital versus Fisher (No 2) [(1992) 27 NSWLR 721 (CA)], 726. The difference between the offer made and the judgment recovered was not trivial. The offer contained a real element of "compromise".
See Huddersfield Bank Limited versus Lister and Son Ltd [(1895) 2 Ch ], 355;
Forbes Services Memorial Club Limited versus Hodge, unreported, Court of Appeal, 8
March 1995, 14. The important public policy behind the rule must be upheld by the Court. It must be seen as part of the law designed to encourage resolution of disputes outside the courts and to divert proceedings from the over-burdened courts. Even if it is not necessary for a "compelling" reason to be demonstrated to secure an "otherwise order", such an order was undoubtedly to be regarded as exceptional. Cf Wills and Anor versus Big Mac Pty Limited and
Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited, Federal Court of Australia, unreported, Heerey J, 9 December 1994; Hillier versus Sheather,
Court of Appeal , unreported, 21 April 1995 (1995) NSWJB 34. It was to be reserved for exceptional cases. This was not exceptional.
The rule should therefore apply.
So went the arguments for the claimants.
 
Defects in the primary judge's determination of costs
With respect to Karpin DCJ, who was probably not expecting the application made by the solicitor for the claimants, and whose judgment in the substantive proceedings is a model of clarity, the reasons given for the rejection of the cost consequences of [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9 DCR are inadequate.
The judicial obligation to give reasons is not in doubt. See Pettitt v
Dunkley [(1971) 1 NSWLR 376 (CA).] It applies to interlocutory orders which have serious consequences for the parties. See Apps and Anor versus Pilet [(1987) 11
NSWLR 350 (CA)], 352. The interlocutory orders here in question effectively concluded a matter most important to the parties. It does not take too much judicial imagination to realise the consequence of shifting the costs after 29
October 1993 from the claimants to the opponent.
There would not be much change for the opponent from the modest judgment which Karpin DCJ entered.
Furthermore, the reference in her Honour's reasons to "all of the circumstances" indicates no real attention of the mind to the precise terms of the Rules of the District Court governing the provision of costs in the circumstances which were before Karpin DCJ. It is true that the parties did not specifically call her Honour's attention to the mandatory language of [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR, nor to the prima facie entitlement of the defendants to the orders sought and to the need for the Court to "otherwise order" if the prima facie entitlement were to be departed from. The mere fact that the opponent had recovered less from her Honour than she had from the arbitrator, whilst a matter to occasion natural sympathy in some circumstances for a person in the position of the opponent, was not enough to attract an "otherwise order" under [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR. By definition, in every case where an "otherwise order" is sought the plaintiff will have recovered less than the offer of compromise.
Plaintiffs are, by definition, usually in a disadvantageous position when this occurs. They do not have the capital, in most cases, to venture great risks upon litigation. They are not in an exactly equal position to most defendants in cases of this kind. However, defendants submit to the heavier obligation to pay indemnity costs where they refuse a plaintiff's offer and sustain a
judgment which is greater than that offer. See [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(5) DCR. Thus, the sole argument pressed upon Karpin DO for the opponent, viz the recovery of a "considerably reduced amount", was far from being a circumstance which warranted an "otherwise order". It was precisely the circumstance which attracted the prima facie entitlement provided for by [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR.
Therefore, on the face of the record of the District Court, disclosed in the transcript which was placed before this Court, the order for costs made by
Karpin DO evidences error either for absence of reasons or for apparent reference to the only reason mentioned which was irrelevant. Specifically, it does not indicate that attention was paid by her Honour to the governing rule of the District Court.
Upon this footing, I would grant leave to appeal so that this Court may reconsider the application for costs. Addressing itself to [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR this Court can then consider the application afresh. It can determine whether it should "otherwise order". Both parties were content that this Court should exercise the discretion of the District Court. Having regard to the means of the parties, the amount at stake, the history of the litigation and the desirability of finality of proceedings such as this, I am of the view that the Court should accede to the parties' request.
 
Fresh exercise of the discretion
Should the Court order otherwise than the terms of [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR ordinarily would require in the circumstances disclosed here? The appellants , predictable enough, pointed to the terms of the rule, the policy behind it, the merits of the case and the innocence of the appellants with respect to the reference to arbitration (which was opposed by them and sought by the respondent alone).
The respondent (opponent) did not contend before this Court that the fact that she had recovered a judgment less than the arbitrator's award was a consideration relevant to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court to "otherwise order" so as to relieve her of the operation of the rule. Instead, it was urged that the Court would provide relief because the appellants had elected not to exhibit before the arbitrator the film which was taken in
October 1993 and March 1994. The film was then available to the appellants.
Had it been shown before the arbitrator, it is likely that the arbitrator would have brought in a much lower award. Had this been done, the entire proceedings might have terminated at the arbitration. Instead, the appellants indulged in a form of litigious charade before the arbitrator. They hinted at, but did not reveal, their telling evidence. They exposed the respondent to a futile proceeding which made no real sense. They thereby escalated the costs and now seek to take advantage of their own earlier action to recover the costs incurred since their earlier offer in October .
The appellants stated that the course which they had followed was one which is ordinarily pursued by a defendant with investigative films. For forensic reasons, a defendant will rarely disclose the film before the arbitrator. It will keep the film in reserve for the trial in the District
Court. If shown before the arbitrator, the element of surprise will be lost.
The forensic utility of the film will be squandered.
Of course, I can understand the forensic reasons behind the decision of the appellants not to exhibit their film before the arbitrator. But if a party elects that course, it cannot later expect to benefit from it. It is now impossible to know what reaction the arbitrator might have had, had the films been shown before him. It seems likely, from his description of the respondent's complaints during the arbitration, and Karpin DCJ's description of the film, that the award entered by the arbitrator would have been for a sum substantially less. As a matter of principle, to secure the operation of arbitration proceedings as the Act appears to contemplate (as a true alternative to a hearing in the District Court and to relieve that court of the burden of hearings) the failure of the appellants to show their film has a consequence. There has been a considerable waste of public and private time and cost. The process of settlement which it is the object of [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9 DCR to promote is frustrated. At least in the circumstances of this case, where the films were obviously most significant, the failure to show them before the arbitrator should have cost consequences. Those consequences are sufficient to sustain an order of this Court providing otherwise than [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) DCR would ordinarily require.
In Ettingshausen versus Australian Consolidated Press Limited, unreported,
Supreme Court ,
Badgery-Parker J, 24 February 1995 in the circumstances of an offer under [Pt 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p22) SCR, it was held that a plaintiff's offer of compromise had no application where there was a second trial following a successful appeal to this Court. That decision is the subject of an application for leave to appeal to this Court. No party sought to argue that a similar principle applied where an arbitration intervened between a defendant's offer of compromise and the judgment ultimately entered. It was not the intervention of the arbitration as such which stimulated the respondent's arguments. Rather, it was the way in which the arbitration was conducted for the appellants.
Having come to this conclusion it is clear that the appellants were not entitled to relief based upon their early offer of compromise. Whether they were entitled to any relief based upon the effective success of the arbitration is another question. It is not one which has been argued before this Court.
I therefore reach the same conclusion as Karpin DCJ did. I hope that I have demonstrated that, in doing so, it is necessary to pay respect to the terms and policy of [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9 DCR. A judge of the District Court does not have a broad, unfettered discretion in respect of costs, following the making of an offer of compromise. The judge's discretion is controlled, in the case of a defendant's offer, by the terms of [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(6) (or [Pt 19A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/index.html#p19a) r 9(5) DCR in the case of a plaintiff's offer). Ordinarily, the party making the offer of compromise is entitled, by force of the rule, to its costs. But in this case, sufficient reason has been shown to order otherwise.
 
Orders
The result is that I favour the following orders:
Grant leave to appeal;
Dismiss the appeal; and
Order that the appellants (claimants) pay the respondent's (opponent's) costs of the appeal and of the summons for leave to appeal.
