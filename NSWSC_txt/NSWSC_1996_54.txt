ORDER
Summons dismissed
JUDGE1
ALLEN J  The plaintiff has been convicted in a Local Court of the offence that she used for the purpose of soliciting for prostitution premises held out as being available for the provision of massage. She applies to this Court by summons for an order quashing the conviction. Her case is that the evidence adduced in the Local Court did not extend to the commission by her of the offence charged.
She was charged under [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html) of the [Summary Offences Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/). That section provides: "16. A person shall not use, for the purpose of prostitution or of soliciting for prostitution, any premises held out as being available- for the provision of massage, sauna baths, steam baths or facilities for physical exercise; or for the taking of photographs; or as a photographic studio, or for services of a like nature." 
The determination of the application to this Court requires consideration of the meaning of that provision and in particular the meaning of the phrase "soliciting for prostitution".
The argument for the plaintiff is that "soliciting for prostitution" where used in such a section requires more than the woman personally offering in the premises her services as a prostitute. It requires an element of pestering by her by accosting, importuning, or flaunting herself. The argument is ill-founded.
Four of the established principles of construction are of particular importance in the understanding of [s 16.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html) They are: 
The phrase "soliciting for prostitution" must be considered not in isolation but in the context of the section as a whole. 
Account must be taken of the apparent objective underlying the section.

Regard may be had to the relevant material in Hansard to confirm what is the objective underlying the section (Interpretation Act 1987 <case>). 
A construction which would promote that underlying objective is to be preferred to one which would not (Interpretation Act 1987 <case>). 
Little assistance can be derived from cases which have dealt with what might be called "street" offences directed to preventing the public nuisance of people being accosted or importuned by prostitutes in public places or of prostitutes disturbing ordinary use of public places by flaunting themselves by words, appearance or conduct.
Section 16 does not make soliciting for prostitution an offence as such.
The offence created is the use of particular types of premises for that purpose.
Section 16 is a re-enactment of <case> of the Prostitution Act 1979. In his
Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Assembly on the prostitution bill, the responsible minister said: "The prostitution bill contains the provisions that the
Government considers necessary to control the more repugnant aspects of prostitution not otherwise subject to the criminal law ... Cl 6 provides that it is an offence for a person to use, for the purpose of prostitution or of soliciting for prostitution, any premises held out as being available for the provision of massage, sauna baths, steam baths, facilities for physical exercise or services of a like nature, or held out as being available for the taking of photographs or as a photographic studio."
What are the "more repugnant aspects of prostitution" dealt with by <case> of the Prostitution Act 1979, now re-enacted as [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html) of the [Summary Offences Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/)? They are related to the use of premises held out as being available for specified respectable services. Clearly the vast majority of those providing such respectable services would be appalled to have their avocation tarnished as being associated with prostitution.
Indeed, their livelihood might be affected should that occur. Further, it requires no feat of imagination to contemplate that it well might be embarrassing, or at least annoying, to a man attending such premises held out as available for these respectable services to find, upon entering, that the premises are a brothel.
The natural, and in my view correct, inference to be drawn from the provision made by [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html) is that its underlying objective is to prevent or at least discourage conduct conducive to those unacceptable situations occurring, situations which are "repugnant". A construction of [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html) which would promote the obtaining of that underlying objective is to be preferred to one which would not.
The objective would not be obtained, in respect of "soliciting for prostitution", if the prostitute is left free to use the premises for the offering of her services provided she does not pester prospective customers or flaunt herself. The attaining of the objective would be promoted if using the premises for the mere personal offering of the prostitution service is an offence. That is the construction to be preferred - provided the language of the section is apt.
There is no doubt that "soliciting" in relation to prostitution commonly conveys an element of pestering by way of accosting, importuning or flaunting.
Standard dictionary definitions reflect that common element.
But the expression "soliciting" does not necessarily convey that element. A commercial traveller, for example, is still soliciting for orders if he offers his company products politely and succinctly without any element of pestering. The element of pestering commonly conveyed by speaking of soliciting for prostitution is that in the usual setting for that activity, namely, streets or at least public places, the prostitute, if she is to succeed, has to attract attention - that is, intrude upon the privacy of others to offer for sale her sexual wares.
The setting for an offence under [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html), however, is quite different. From the nature of the services held out as provided in the premises, be it massage, saunas, steam baths or any of the other services referred to in [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html), it is likely that people will attend for those respectable services and approach, accordingly, the person who is in the premises whom they may assume is there to provide them. There is no need for the prostitute who has used the cover of those premises to accost such a person or to flaunt herself to get his attention. The soliciting for prostitution in those circumstances does not require that element. In that setting it is in my judgment a natural use of the expression "soliciting for prostitution" that it suffices that the prostitute personally offers to the person attending the premises her services as a prostitute.
It is not inconsistent with that view that the phrase "soliciting for prostitution" commonly conveys an element of pestering or flaunting when used in the context of street offences or the like. In respect of those offences it is the pestering, the flaunting in public, that is the "more repugnant aspect" which legislation prohibiting soliciting in streets or public places is designed to prevent or at least discourage.
Cases such as Weisz versus Monahan [(1962) 1 All ER 664] are to be distinguished on that ground.
In the present case the uncontested evidence was that the premises were prominently displayed as being a "massage parlour". A plain clothes constable entered the premises. What then occurred is set out in the statement which was in evidence before the Local Court. The statement, so far as relevant, read: "I entered a lounge room of the address where I was met by two Asian females. One of these females who I now know to be the defendant" (and he named her) "escorted me upstairs to a room which contained a double bed and two tables, one of which had towels stacked on it. The defendant was wearing a multi coloured shawl which had flowers on it. At this time the defendant says: 'It's $40 for a massage.' I said: 'What does that include?' She said: 'You want to pay more?' I said: 'I pay more.' She said: 'Oh you pay more and you get full service.' I said: 'What is the full service?' She said: 'For $80 you get sex.' I said: 'Do you do sex?' She said, 'Yes.'
The plain clothes constable then arrested the woman. He lifted the pile of towels and found under it condoms and a water based lubricant."
On that undisputed evidence before the Local Court, the plaintiff was rightly convicted. She used the premises held out as being available for the provision of massage for the purpose of personally offering her services as a prostitute.
The offering of those services in those circumstances constituted soliciting for prostitution within the meaning of [s 16.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soa1988189/s16.html) It was not the case on the evidence that the constable asked her whether she would be prepared to prostitute herself. He did no more than provide a convenient opening for her to take advantage of, if she wished to do so, to make the offer of prostitution herself.
It was an offer by her-not acceptance by her of an offer by him.
The summons is dismissed. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the second defendant (the first defendant having entered a submitting appearance).
