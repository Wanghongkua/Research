COSTS  
JUDGMENT  
The judgment in these proceedings was handed down on 16 February 2012. The parties were required to bring in short minutes of order reflecting the reasons for the decision at which time the parties would be given an opportunity to address on costs. 
Both parties have now acted accordingly. It falls for the Court to make orders in relation to costs. 
Principles to be applied  
While the Court has a wide discretionary power as to costs, which is to be liberally construed, the discretion must be exercised judicially in accordance with established principle: NSW versus Stanley  <case> at <case>; Elite Protective Personnel Pty Ltd versus Salmon (No 2)  <case> at <case>; Oshlack versus Richmond River Council <case>; <case>. 
The principle is that the presumption that the successful party is entitled to costs will only be displaced where there has been some sort of disentitling conduct on the part of the successful party: Oshlack at [40] and [69]. 
The Court must not exercise its discretion to award costs against a successful party arbitrarily or capriciously, or on no grounds at all: Oshlack at [22]. The discretion must be exercised judicially and "according to rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion ... or even benevolence ... or sympathy": Williams versus Lewer  <case>. 
It is for the losing party to establish a basis for departure from the usual rule: Waterman versus Gerling Australia Insurance Co Pty Ltd (No 2)  <case> at <case>; NSW versus Stanley  <case> at <case>. 
It is common ground that the proceedings were exceedingly unusual as is evidenced by the published judgment. 
THE RESPECTIVE POSITIONS TAKEN BY THE PARTIES  
The defendant submits that the plaintiff has failed to establish any basis on which the Court should depart from the usual rule in UCPR 42.1. 
The plaintiff contends that there should be no order for costs so that each party is to bear its own costs. 
On 13 May 2011, Emil made a formal Calderbank offer to settle the proceedings on the basis that he receive the legal title to the Mellor Street property, that he pay his father $250,000 and that there be no order as to costs (with the costs order made in Emil's favour by Hall J on 17 March 2011 vacated). 
When that offer was received by the plaintiff's solicitors, the legal issues were clear and the plaintiff knew what the effect of the cross-claimant's evidence was to be on the central factual question of the representations. He must also have known that his own evidence in this regard was false. 
Had Josip accepted that offer, he would have been significantly better off than he is under the judgment that was ultimately given. Significant further legal costs would not have been spent (by both parties) and the use of five days of the Court's time would have been avoided. 
On 7 February 2012, on the second day of the hearing, Emil made a formal Offer of Compromise under UCPR r 20.26 to settle the matter on the basis that he receive legal title to the Mellor Street property and pay his father $200,000. Once again, had Josip accepted that offer, he would have been significantly better off than he is under the judgment that was ultimately given. 
To my mind the 7 February 2012 formal offer of compromise should be discarded for the reason that the offer was simply too late. 
In all the circumstances the principled approach to the question of costs is as follows : 
There is to be no order for costs against the plaintiff in respect of the so-called formal offer of compromise concerning the 7 February offer of compromise; 
The plaintiff is otherwise to pay the defendant's costs (including those costs ordered by Justice Hall in these proceedings on 17 March 2011) on the ordinary basis up to 13 May 2011 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.
