JUDGMENT
At about 12.30pm on 30 October 2013, the jury sent a note which was marked as MFI-68. The note, written by the foreperson of the jury, referred to the fact that one juror had undertaken legal research by way of an Internet search.
The procedure then adopted pursuant to directions I gave on the above date was to have the Sheriff's officer request the foreperson to leave the jury room and accompany him to the Court. Following his examination, the Sheriff's officer was requested to follow the same procedure in order to have the juror in question brought into the courtroom.
At about 2.00pm on that date, I proceeded to conduct an examination of the foreperson pursuant to [s 55DA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s55da.html) of the [Jury Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/)").
The information provided by the foreperson in answer to questions which I directed to him has been extracted into the reasons for the order made under [s 53C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s53c.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) in R versus JP (No 2)  <case> at <case>.
I also proceeded with an examination of the juror in question. The questions and answers in relation to that examination have also been set out in R versus JP (No 2) at [13].

The Statutory Provisions [Part 7A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/index.html#p7a) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) is entitled "Discharge of Jurors". The provisions of [ss 53A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s53a.html) and [53B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s53b.html) are concerned with the discharge of individual jurors.
[Section 53A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s53a.html) is concerned with the mandatory discharge of an individual juror. Pursuant to the provisions of that section, a court must discharge a juror if in the course of any trial: "(a) The juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial ..."
The term "misconduct" is defined in [s 53A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s53a.html) to included: "Conduct that constitutes an offence against this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/)."
A juror who conducted legal research on the internet would be in breach of the trial directions which I gave at the commencement of the trial. It would also constitute a breach of the provisions of [s 68C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s68c.html) and also [s 68C(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s68c.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/). In this respect, I respectfully agree and adopt what has been said in this regard in R versus Sio (No 3)  <case> at <case> per Adamson J.
Both counsel for the Crown, and the accused, submitted that the juror referred to in MFI-68 had to be discharged. That accorded with the conclusion which I had reached following the examination of the juror in question conducted pursuant to [s 55DA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s55da.html) and expressed.
On 30 October 2013 I made an order that the relevant juror be discharged. I indicated that I would publish my reasons on a later date. 
Following the completion of the examination, the juror in question was immediately separated from the jurors who were then in the jury room. Arrangements were made for the Sheriff's officer to retrieve her personal belongings from the jury room on her behalf.
The jury, constituted by the eleven remaining jurors, was brought back into Court and informed that the relevant juror had been discharged, and in that respect the jury were given a direction in line with the Criminal Bench Book direction at [1-515]. 
Finding and Order
The discharged juror engaged in misconduct in breach of [s 68C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s68c.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/). Upon that finding, on 30 October 2013 I made the following order: 
Order that the juror be discharged from the jury pursuant to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s53a.html) of the [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/).
