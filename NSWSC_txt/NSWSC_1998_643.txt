SELLERS FABRICS PTY LIMITED V HAPAG-LLOYD AG 
RE THE SHIP "ENCOUNTER BAY" 
JUDGMENT - On further submission by Dr White to exclude reports of Captain Bozier. See page 147 of transcript.

HIS HONOUR: Dr White has submitted that the reports of Captain Bozier have never been served as reports on which the plaintiff seeks to rely and that, conformably with my rulings about the service of witness statements, the documents should not be admissible. However, there is a very real distinction between the tender of these documents and the tender of witness statements. These documents, as I sought to make clear, are tendered as business records of another party and in those circumstances they fall, in my view, into a category different from witness statements which a party is entitled to consider as being part of the evidence to be adduced. 
Secondly, the documents were enclosed in the bundle of documents which was furnished by the solicitors for the plaintiff, which would, undoubtedly, have provided a reasonable clue to those representing the defendant that it was proposed to rely upon them.

Thirdly, the reports were addressed to Norton Smith & Co, the solicitors on the record for the defendant, and I would assume have been in the possession of that firm since at least October in 1996.

In these circumstances I do not consider that the second submission made by Dr
White is one that should preclude the tender of the document.
