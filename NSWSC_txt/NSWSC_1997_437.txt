MVA - third party insurance policy - availability of action per quod servitium amisit; whether policy responds to such claim.

Held: 
The action per quod servitium amisit survives in the common law.

The statutory scheme under the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) does not exclude the action.

The employer's right to recover the benefits paid to a worker under s
Z(1)(d) [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) does not exclude the employer's action for loss of services.

No other provision of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) precludes an action for loss of services.

GIO AUSTRALIA LIMITED versus Phillip ROBSON 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: I agree with Stein JA, whose judgment I have had the privilege of reading. 
The broader construction of the policy (sufficient to cover the per quod action) is dictated by a number of factors. It furthers the beneficial purpose of the compulsory third party insurance legislation, which seeks to protect the interests of plaintiffs and defendants alike. It gives to the words "in respect of" their well-established amplitude: see Antico versus CE Heath Casualty and General Insurance Ltd [(1996) 38 NSWLR 681] at 696 (where authorities are collected). It is faithful to the High Court's intent, in State Government Insurance Office (Qld) versus Crittenden <case>; [(1966) 117 CLR 412], to resolve earlier disagreements that were not, in the final analysis, dictated by the wording of different statutes. And it thereby ensures uniformity of outcome for State and Territory legislative schemes whose different wording reflects the personal predilections of parliamentary counsel rather than distinctive policies.

JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: In this appeal I have had the benefit of reading in draft form the reasons for judgment of Stein JA. I agree with his reasons and conclusions but wish to add additional observations on two issues. 
Mr Deakin QC submitted that the employer's action for loss of services had been abolished by [s
Z(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151z.html) of the [Workers Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) . This section (which had its counterpart in <case> (1) (b) of the 1926 Act) entitled an employer, who has paid compensation to a worker, to be indemnified by a tortfeasor responsible for the worker's injuries. Mr Deakin relied on a statement by Sugerman AP in Sydney City Council versus Bosnich [(1968) 3 NSWR ]
at 726. The Council had sued a tortfeasor to recover $430.03 compensation paid to its injured worker under the 1926 Act and $85.52 accident pay paid independently of the Act. Its particulars of claim in the District Court contained two counts, one at common law for loss of services and one for an indemnity under <case> (1) (b). The Council recovered its workers' compensation in the District Court, but failed in respect of the accident pay. Its appeal was allowed and judgment given for the accident pay as well. The statement of
Sugerman AP relied upon was: "This $430.03 is the subject of a special statutory remedy under <case> (1) (b) of the Act which in my opinion excludes the common law remedy in cases in which it is applicable".

It would be quite wrong in my view to read this sentence from that learned and careful Judge as a decision that the statutory remedy had abolished the action for loss of services, especially when the Court allowed recovery of the accident pay under the common law count.

The statutory remedy is only available for an employer who has actually paid compensation and only until the worker recovers damages. In the passage relied on, Sugerman AP was merely stating that an employer may not circumvent the conditions which qualify the statutory remedy by suing at common law. He was not saying that the action for loss of services had been abolished. See also to the same effect Scott versus Bowyer (Victorian Court of Appeal, 21/2/97, unreported, at p 13).

Asprey JA, on the other hand, was of the view that the workers' compensation was also recoverable under the count for loss of services (729), while Hardie
AJA expressed no opinion on this question. Thus although there were differing views on whether an employer could recover workers' compensation payments in an action for loss of services, the case provides no support for the view that s 151Z(1)(d) or its predecessors has abolished that cause of action.

Mr Deakin also submitted that the provisions of the Motor Accidents Act 1965 relating to contributory negligence were inconsistent with the continued availability of this cause of action. This submission was based on Curran v
Young <case>; [(1965) 112 CLR 99] which decided that the contributory negligence of a wife was no defence to an action per quod consortium amisit brought by her husband where she was not acting at the time as his servant or agent. However that case is not authority for the proposition that the contributory negligence of an employee, injured in the course of his or her employment, is not an answer to the employer's action for loss of services. In fact it is authority for the opposite proposition.
Barwick CJ said at 101: "The wife's failure to take care for herself which disentitles her to succeed is, in my opinion, an irrelevant circumstance in an action by the husband. The matter, of course, would be different if the husband were suing for the consequences of the defendant's negligence in circumstances where the conduct of the wife, when she was doing something which she was either expressly or impliedly authorised to do on his behalf, was a contributing cause to that damage. In such a case his responsibility for her acts may result in his being disentitled to succeed".

Taylor J said at 109: "Whether or not the defence of contibutory negligence will be available against a master ... will depend upon whether the injuries were occasioned in such circumstances as to render the master responsible for the servant's actions, that is to say, whether they were being done in the course of the servant's employment".

See also at 111, and per McTiernan J at 103 and per Kitto J at 104. The case was decided before the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lrpa404/) when contributory negligence was still a complete defence.

Section 10 (1) of the 1965 Act applies to a claimant suing for injury to another, for example under the Compensation to Relatives Act, if the claimant's own negligence contributed to that injury. See Benjamin versus Currie <case>; [(1958) VR 259] and Dodds versus Dodds [(1978) QB 543.] 
In my view therefore the contributory negligence of an employee injured in the course of his employment is available as an answer to an action by his employer for loss of services, if the employer is vicariously liable for that contributory negligence. It follows that the provisions of the [Motor
Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) relating to this defence do not support the submission that the Act has impliedly abolished the action for loss of services.

I agree with the orders proposed by Stein JA.
 
JUDGMENT 
STEIN JA: Nowlin Pty Limited (Nowlin) is a proprietary company and its directors and shareholders are James Clifford Craig and his wife, Margaret Anne Craig. The company carries on business as a taxi operator and, as at 6 October 1990, employed Mr and Mrs Craig as drivers. On that day Margaret Craig was driving a taxi owned by Nowlin when it was involved in an accident. Nowlin issued a statement of claim in the District Court in August 1993 against Phillip Robson. It alleged that the collision was caused by the negligence of Robson. As a result of injuries sustained by its employee Margaret Craig the claim alleged that she had been unable to work for Nowlin and it had been deprived of her services as a driver and the consequent income and profits it would have derived. Damages were claimed under the [Motor Accidents Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) (the Act). It may be mentioned that Margaret Craig also brought a separate action for damages for personal injuries. The defendant Robson is insured with GIO Australia Ltd which refused him indemnity under the policy. He cross-claimed for indemnity against the GIO. 
The proceedings were removed to the Supreme Court and McInerney J ordered that a separate question be tried. In essence this was whether the third party policy under the Act insures the owner or driver of a motor vehicle (to which the policy relates) against liability for a claim by a company for loss of services of an employee, where the loss is caused by the fault of the insured.
The issue was referred to Hamilton AJ to determine. The question, as reformulated before his Honour, was: 
Whether the Third Party Policy issued by the insurer to the cross claimant responds to the plaintiff's claim in these proceedings should the plaintiff otherwise be able validly to initiate and maintain that claim including by meeting necessary requirements for notification of claim under the [Motor
Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) if any.

His Honour answered this in the affirmative and the GIO has appealed with the leave of the court. The appellant raises a number of contentions:
The law in New South Wales should no longer recognise the action for loss of services (per quod servitium amisit).
The statutory third party policy issued under <case> of the Act and Schedule does not apply to an action for loss of services.
The statutory right of the employer (Nowlin) to be indemnified by Robson if its employee (Craig) suffered injury as a result of Robson's negligence (s 151Z(1)(d) [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) ) excludes any broader entitlement to damages for loss of services.
The liability incurred by Robson is "under an agreement" and thereby excluded by <case>(b) of the Act.
A separate claim, based upon a common law right vested in a person other than the injured party (being pure economic loss by an employer for loss of services) is contrary to part 6 of the Act, particularly <case>.
The provision made by the Act referable to contributory negligence (ss 74 and 75) is incompatible with the common law's rejection of contributory negligence as a defence to the action for loss of services.
The statutory policy extends only to natural persons and not to corporate employers.

IS THE ACTION FOR LOSS OF SERVICES NO LONGER AVAILABLE? 
On behalf of the appellant Mr Deakin QC submits that the law should no longer recognise the action per quod servitium amisit. He submits that it is anachronistic, derivative and arbitrary. Because of the authority of
Commissioner for Railways versus Scott <case>; [(1958-1959) 102 CLR 392] Mr
Deakin's submission is a formal one only. In addition, this court confirmed the action in Marinovski versus Zutti Pty Ltd [(1984) 2 NSWLR 571.] While an action for loss or deprivation of the consortium of a husband or wife was abolished by the [Law Reform (Marital Consortium) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lrca1984327/) the action per quod servitium amisit was not. The law has been stated by the High
Court in Scott, with which we are bound and it is patently inappropriate for an intermediate appellant court to seek to restate the common law contrary to the High Court. Any question about the abolition of the action or its continued existence at common law is a matter for the legislature or the High
Court.
 does the statutory third party policy respond to an action for loss of services? 
Hamilton AJ concluded that the subject policy responded to Nowlin's claim for damages for loss of services. He relied upon construction of the statute aided by the guidance of the High Court in State Government Insurance Office (Qld) v
Crittenden <case>; [(1966) 117 CLR 412.] The appellant submits that his Honour erred in applying the wording of the Queensland statute (in Crittenden) rather than the subject statutory form of policy. Mr Deakin submits that the reasoning in Joyes v
National Insurance Company of New Zealand [(1932) NZLR 802], followed in
Boyle versus The Nominal Defendant [(1959) 59 SR 413], ought to be applied and seeks to distinguish Crittenden.

The relevant words of <case> of the Act, as at 6 October 1990, were: 
A third party-policy under this Act is a policy which:- insures the owner of the motor vehicle to which the policy relates and any other person who at any time drives the vehicle (whether or not with the consent of the owner) against liability in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault of the owner or driver of the vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle in any part of the 
Commonwealth (whether or not on a public street); and is in the terms of Schedule 1.

Schedule 1 is to similar effect.

The Queensland policy in Crittenden provided: ... all sums for which he or his estate shall become legally liable by way of damages in respect of such motor vehicle for accidental bodily injury (fatal or non-fatal) to any person ... where such injury is caused by, through or in connection with such motor vehicle.

Crittenden was a case concerning damages for loss of marital consortium.
Taylor J referred to the `conflict of opinion in some of the State courts and in New Zealand on what is, for all practical purposes, the same question', (at ). His Honour specifically referred to Joyes and Boyle.

Taylor J stated that given the context of the statute, a narrow literal construction was not open. The words `in respect of' in the Queensland policy should be given a wide meaning and not limited to a liability to pay damages to the injured person only. It was wide enough to extend to `all legal liability for damages in respect of accidental bodily injury to any person whether the claim is asserted by the injured person or by any other person whose rights have been infringed as a direct result or consequence of the injury' (at 419). While not expressly stated, it is apparent that Taylor J was not following Joyes and was overruling Boyle.

Menzies J considered that the statute, designed to meet well recognised social and economic problems, should not be construed so narrowly as to reduce it to a partial solution. He rejected the narrow construction urged by the appellant `of such a beneficial provision', (421). His Honour expressly indicated agreement with the judgment of Gibbs J (as he then was) in the Queensland Full
Court, (Purkess versus Crittenden, unreported) and Gibbs J's analysis of the conflict of authority. In his judgment on the demurrer Gibbs J had referred to
Joyes and contrasted it with the decision of Ligertwood J in Walton v
Fawcett <case>; [1948 SASR 158.]
His Honour noted the preference of the majority in Boyle for the reasoning in the New Zealand Court of Appeal to that of Ligertwood J. Gibbs J also noted the dissent of Herron J (as he then was) who had agreed with the reasoning in
Walton. He further noted that Ligertwood J and Herron J's views were supported by North British & Mercantile Insurance versus Smith <case>; [1960 VR 78] and a
Canadian decision of De Brady versus Ferrill [1954 2 DLR 253.] Because the decisions turned on statutory provisions different to Queensland, Gibbs J indicated that it was unnecessary to express any opinion on their correctness.
Nonetheless, he added: 
However, I must say, with respect, that I have found the reasoning of 
Ligertwood J and Herron CJ helpful, and indeed convincing, when applied to the Queensland provisions, ...

Returning to the High Court decision in Crittenden, Windeyer J endorsed
Taylor J's reasoning and construction noting that the `apparent remedial purpose should not be defeated by a meticulous construction'. McTiernan ACJ was also of the opinion that the policy covered a claim for loss of services or consortium applying a broad construction to the words of the section.

A reading of their Honours' judgments makes it plain that the High Court was not following the New Zealand decision of Joyes and was, in effect, overruling the NSW Full Court in Boyle.

Mr Smark of counsel, appearing for the first respondent Robson, helpfully took us to the judgments of Owen J on the issue, starting with Genders versus GIO [(1958) 76 WN 381.]
In Genders Owen J, then on the NSW Full Court, held that the remedy provided by the statute was only available to the person who sustained actual bodily injury or his or her relatives. Boyle was decided by the Full Court in
December 1958 wherein Owen J reiterated his opinion in Genders and relied on
Joyes. The judgment of Street CJ is to similar effect. Herron J dissented, as he had in Genders.

In early 1959 another case before the Full Court raised a similar issue (Yellow Express Carriers versus GIO [(1960) 60 SR 227).]
It related to whether an insured's claim for costs was covered by the statute.
Owen J, adhering to the view he had expressed in Genders and Boyle, held that it did not. Street CJ agreed and Herron J again dissented.

Genders went on appeal to the High Court (Genders versus GIO <case>; [(1959) 102 CLR 363).] It is apparent from the joint judgment of Dixon CJ,
McTiernan, Taylor and Windeyer JJ that their Honours did not share Owen J's opinion, see 379-380 and also Menzies J at 390.

Owen J was appointed to the High Court in September 1961. He was not a member of the bench which heard Crittenden. However, he was in Club Motor
Insurance Agency Pty Ltd versus Sargent <case>; [(1969) 118 CLR 658.] In Club Motor Taylor J saw no reason to depart from the views he had expressed in Crittenden concerning the width of the expression in question. Owen J adopted the reasoning of the High Court in Genders and said at 664: 
The words "in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person" are, in my opinion, to be given a wide meaning, as Taylor J. pointed out in State
Government Insurance Office (Q) versus Crittenden, and they are amply wide enough to cover a case such as the present one.

No doubt aided by the High Court decisions in Genders and Crittenden Owen
J had turned the full circle. It may also be noted that Crittenden was followed by the NSW Supreme Court in Fitzroy Stevedoring Co. Pty Ltd versus Harris [(1969) 1 NSWLR 499.] See also Glass JA in Rheem Australia versus Manufacturers
Mutual Insurance Ltd [(1984) 2 NSWLR 370] at -375.

More recently the High Court had reason to consider Crittenden in Workers'
Compensation Board (Q) versus Technical Products Pty Ltd [(1988) 165 CLR .]
The court explained that the meaning to be given to the phrase `in respect of that injury' depended very much on the context. In the context of workers compensation legislation it was to be given a narrower construction more consonant with the primary meaning of the words and the purpose of the statute. The context was the protection of workers and their dependents in respect of injury suffered by the worker in the course of his employment.

Wilson and Gaudron JJ said (at 652): 
We should add that we have not found the cases dealing with the scope of insurance policies prescribed by statutes dealing with motor vehicles - of which Crittenden is an example - to be of any assistance in the consideration of this matter.

In the joint judgment of Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ the following observation is made: 
In the context of some enactments words such as "damages in respect of an injury" or, at all events words such as "liability for damages in respect of an injury" may extend to liability at the suit of some person other than the person sustaining the injury. Thus in State Government Insurance Office (Q.) v Crittenden it was held that the clause of an insurance policy issued pursuant to the Motor Vehicles Insurance Act 1936 (Q.) indemnifying the holder against "all sums for which he or his estate shall become legally liable by way of damages in respect of such motor vehicle for accidental bodily injury (fatal or non-fatal) to any person ... where such injury is caused by, through, or in connection with such motor vehicle" covered the insured against liability for loss of consortium by the husband of a person injured by the operation of a motor vehicle. But the object of the relevant
Act in that case was evidently "to afford protection to users of motor vehicles who become subject to liability because of bodily injury caused to others by the use of their motor vehicles, and to persons who become entitled to damages by reason of the bodily injury so caused". Moreover, the reference to fatal injury was, in the context, an indication that Lord Campbell's Act  actions were contemplated and that they are not actions to recover damages in respect of personal injury: ...

Properly understood, and contrary to the submission of the appellant,
Technical Products does not derogate from the force of Crittenden.

Should the wording in <case> and schedule 1 of the Act `liability in respect of the death of a bodily injury to a person' be construed narrowly so as to limit compensation to the person who was the subject of the physical injury, or more widely as per Crittenden? 
The evident intent of the Act, and <case> in particular, is to ensure that persons injured by the negligence of motor vehicle users should not be left without remedy, nor insured persons left without indemnity. In this context
Crittenden, although dealing with slightly different wording, is both apt and compelling. The policy under the NSW Act is comparable to that under consideration in Crittenden. Both statutes were intended to cover claims made under Lord Campbell's Act and for contribution. I see no reason to confine Crittenden to the meaning and operation of the Queensland policy.
Section 9 of the Act is to be understood as permitting compensation in respect of harm suffered by a person other than the deceased by its reference to `liability in respect of the death ... of a person'. The provision is intended to protect all potential plaintiffs as compared to workers' compensation, which is to protect one particular class of plaintiffs and their dependants (Technical Products).

In my opinion, the context of the Act leads to a wide construction consistent with Crittenden being given to the phrase `against liability in respect of the death of or injury to a person', (s 9). A narrow construction which would confine compensation to the person the subject of the injury is not consonant with the intent and purpose of the statute. In addition, in the interests of maintaining a relatively uniform and co-operative national scheme of compulsory third party motor vehicle insurance the court should avoid creating distinctions between the States unless it is clear that the statute and the policy were intended to have a different effect.

Hamilton AJ was correct in concluding that the subject policy does respond to the Nowlin's claim for damages. The action per quod arises by reason of the injury to the employee.
 [s 151Z(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151z.html) OF THE [WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) 
The GIO submits that the employee (Mrs Craig) is entitled to the benefits provided by the [Workers Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) . Her employer, Nowlin, is liable to pay such compensation but is entitled to be indemnified by Robson if the employee suffered injury as a result of his negligence [(s
Z(1)(d)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151z.html)
It is argued that this statutory right to recover the workers compensation payments excludes any broader claim for damages under a loss of services action. Reliance is placed upon the judgment of Sugerman AP in Sydney City
Council versus Bosnich [(1968) 3 NSWLR 725.] 
For [s
Z(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151z.html) to operate there needs to have been a recovery of compensation under the Act.
In these circumstances, an employer who paid the compensation is entitled to be indemnified by the person liable to pay damages to the employee. It may be observed that the `liability' does not necessarily equal the statutory indemnity but the section expressly limits the recovery to workers' compensation paid under that Act.

It is apparent that Bosnich is not authority for the proposition advanced by the appellant. Even accepting the appellant's understanding of the judgment of
Sugerman AP, it is apparent that Asprey JA decided to the contrary and Hardie
JA expressed no opinion on the matter. In any event, it is not obvious to me that Sugerman AP was saying that the right to recover workers' compensation excluded the employer's right to recover on the per quod action. It may be that his Honour was saying that you cannot use the common law to circumvent the restrictions on the statutory indemnity given by <case>(b) of the
Workers' Compensation Act 1926 , the predecessor of <case>(d). I accept the submission of Mr Smark (on behalf of the respondent Robson) that although s 151Z(1)(d) allows for recovery of amounts paid under the statutory regime,
Bosnich does not require the conclusion that it provides a statutory bar to common law recovery. As he observes, the remedies lie in different fields and, to the extent there is any overlap, the section would govern recovery.

It may also be noted that Sugerman AP himself allowed recovery of $85.32 accident pay as part of the damages per quod. This demonstrates that the mere right to recover workers' compensation payments does not exclude the per quod action. See also Scott (440) and Luntz, Assessment of Damages 3rd
Ed 10.3.18.

In my view, <case>(d) does not exclude any common law right to recover damages for loss of services of an employee.

IS THE CLAIM EXCLUDED UNDER <case>(b) OF THE ACT? 
Section 16(b) of the Act provides: 
A third-party policy shall not extend to insure the owner or driver of a motor vehicle against: a liability which may be incurred by the owner or driver under an agreement unless the liability is one which would have arisen in the absence of the agreement.

The appellant submits that the claim is properly characterised as a liability under the agreement constituted by the contract of service between Nowlin and its employee, Mrs Craig. It is therefore claimed to be a liability under an agreement specifically excluded by <case>(b). It seems to me that <case>(b) has no application to the circumstances. The appellant's liability does not arise under any agreement. Rather it is incurred by the commission of the tortious conduct.

DOES PART 6 OF THE ACT (AND <case>) PROHIBIT DAMAGES TO OTHER THAN THE INJURED PARTY 
It is the submission of the appellant that since a court may not award damages contrary to Part 6 of the Act (s 70), the common law has only a very limited operation. Without a clear legislative intention to the contrary, a separate claim based upon a different common law right, vested in a person other than the injured party, should not be readily inferred. However, as Hamilton AJ observed, <case> is not an exclusive or exhaustive code for damages. For example, Part 6 contains no provision for out-of-pocket expenses. I am unable to see how damages for loss of services caused by the negligence of the defendant Robson would be in breach of the prohibition in <case>. It speaks of damages `contrary to this Part'. I am unable to accept that the damages claimed by Nowlin in respect of the motor vehicle accident are contrary to
Part 6 of the Act.

CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE 
The appellant submits that since contributory negligence is not a defence to an action for loss of services (Curran versus Young <case>; [(1965) 112 CLR 99)], but is a defence to claims under the Motor Accidents Act , this is a further reason for holding that an action for loss of services is not available under that Act. It is submitted that to permit a claim for loss of services to be made could lead to potentially anomalous and unjust situations. The appellant submits that this could never have been the intention of the legislature. Mr Deakin referred us to a discussion of the position in Victoria in Scott versus Bowyer (unreported, Victorian Court of
Appeal, 21 February 1997).

Hamilton AJ was of the view that the present situation depended upon <case> of the Act read together with <case> of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lrpa404/) . Although he acknowledged that <case> did not sit easily with <case>, nonetheless the distinction between the `injured person' and the `plaintiff' in ss 74(2) and (3) (as contrasted with the corresponding words of <case>), led him to conclude that there now is apportionment for the contributory negligence of the servant in a per quod action involving a motor accident. It seems to me that there is much to be said for the grafting of contributory negligence onto a per quod action to avoid any possible anomaly.

The judgment of Clarke JA in Baldi & Fletcher Pty Ltd versus Rabmar Pty Ltd 1R 101 at 106 is relied on by the appellant in support of its submission. However, it is apparent that his Honour was dealing with a different matter. In the passage relied on Clarke JA was saying that the vicarious responsibility of the employer for any tort committed by the injured person was not the test of the availability of a per quod action; a contract of service must be proved, (see p 104).

In any event, assuming, as Hamilton AJ did, that contributory negligence is not available and that this may produce an anomalous situation, it is an anomaly which has been long established since Curran versus Young. If the situation is seen as anomalous the parliament may correct it.

MAY ONLY NATURAL PERSONS BE CLAIMANTS? 
Assuming the per quod action is embraced by the policy, it is submitted that it should be confined to employers who are natural persons. Corporations, it is said, do not come within the concept of `injured person' or `claimant' in the Act. A number of provisions are relied on viz: ss 40, 44, 48, 49, 50A, 72,
A and 79. However, unless displaced by a contrary intention the definition of `person' in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s21.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) would apply and `person' taken to include a corporation.

The appellant submits the legislative intent is frustrated if companies are included. Further, a corporation cannot suffer an `injury' as defined by the
Act. As to the latter argument, I have already indicated that the per quod action is available to an employer under the Act in respect of an injury to an employee caused by the fault of the owner or driver of the insured vehicle.
I see no reason why the action (under the policy) should be confined to natural persons and exclude corporations. Indeed, examples come to mind where it would produce anomalies to exclude companies. A corporate defendant may seek contribution from another motor vehicle driver; a corporation may be a cross-claimant or the estate of a deceased victim may be vested in a corporate trustee. For my part I do not see how the Act, read as a whole, or the many provisions relied on by the appellant, evince an intention to displace the definition of `person' in <case> [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) which includes corporations.

In any event, assuming (as I find) that a per quod action is available under the Act, acceptance of the appellant's submission would introduce an anomaly, because the action would be available to an employer who is a natural person but not to a corporate employer.

In my opinion, Hamilton AJ was correct in his answer to the separate question of whether the policy responds to Nowlin's claim in the proceedings. The appeal should be dismissed with costs. The subject action and the proceeding brought by Margaret Craig against Mr Robson should be consolidated.
