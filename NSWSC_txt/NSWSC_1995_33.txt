JUDGE1
HODGSON J:  Braha Corporation Pty. Limited (which I will call "Braha Corpn.") was incorporated in 1988, and in January 1989, it commenced manufacture of potato chips. A short time earlier, the plaintiff (which I will call "LeighMardon" or the plaintiff) commenced supplying Braha Corpn. with packaging products for the chips; and the plaintiff claims that, between 10th
November 1989 and 21st January 1990, it supplied packaging for which it was entitled to be paid something in excess of $674,000.00 by Braha Corpn., which it was not paid. on 22nd February 1990, a secured creditor of
Braha Corpn.,
Royal Australia Finance Limited (which I will call "RAF") appointed a receiver of Braha Corpn.; and a liquidator of
Braha Corpn. was appointed on 14th March .
From about mid-1988 until after the appointment of the receiver, the first three defendants (who I will call respectively "Wawn", "Rutherford", and "Brunninghausen") and the fourth cross-defendant (who I will call "Braha") were directors of Braha Corpn.; and in these proceedings the plaintiff sought payment of its claimed debts of over $674,000.00, plus interest, from the first three defendants, pursuant to s.556 of the Companies Code, claiming that, when the relevant debts were incurred, there were reasonable grounds to expect that Braha Corpn. would not be able to pay all its debts as and when they became due. The defendants put in issue the incurring of the debts, and they denied the existence of such reasonable grounds; and each defendant also relied on the defences in ss.(2) of s.556, alleging that any debts were incurred without his authority or consent, and that he did not have reasonable cause to expect that Braha Corpn. would not be able to pay its debts as and when they became due. Also,
Wawn put on a cross-claim seeking contribution and/or indemnity from Rutherford, Brunninghausen and Braha.
The proceedings have been settled as between the plaintiff on the one hand, and Wawn and Brunninghausen on the other, pursuant to an agreement whereby the plaintiff is to receive from them $600,000.00 inclusive of costs, and to be entitled to judgment for that sum if it is not paid by 27th June
The plaintiff has withdrawn its claim against Rutherford, and Wawn has withdrawn his cross-claim against Braha.
The only matter outstanding, which I have to determine, is Wawn's cross-claim for contribution against Rutherford.
 
OUTLINE OF FACTS
It is convenient to commence by outlining the relevant history of Braha
Corpn.
In about February 1987, Braha consulted
Wawn, a solicitor, seeking advice about a potato chip manufacturing business; and in early 1988, Braha asked
Wawn if he could suggest potential investors for this business. Wawn introduced Braha to Peter Lance (who I will call "Lance") and Paul Rigby (who
I will call "Rigby"), and later to Rutherford and Brunninghausen.
In March 1988, Wawn acquired a shelf company which, on 27th April ,
became Braha Corporation Pty. Limited. Braha, Lance, Rigby, Rutherford,
Brunninghausen and Wawn became directors of this company, and investors in the business.
In late 1988, Braha Corpn. arranged finance with RAF and with the National
Australia Bank Limited (which I will call "NAB") . The RAF loan was fully drawn to $1.25 million on 11th November 1988, and an NAB term loan was fully drawn to $750,000.00 on 13th January 1989. An overdraft of $200,000.00 was established with NAB on 14th November 1988, to be reviewed on th November .
During the period October to December 1988, Braha Corpn. finalised arrangements necessary to begin production, leasing factory premises in
Arncliffe. Braha made reports to the board at around this period, to the effect that the potato chips would have a much longer shelf life with competing products, and would have other advantages; and that in the first year, profit would be between 27% and 30% before tax.
Production of potato chips commenced in 1989. During January and February,
Braha reported to the board that sales were exceeding the budget.
However, Braha Corpn. apparently required further funding, and from 24th
January 1989, the directors (apart from Braha) progressively advanced money to it. The initial advance on 24th January 1989 totalled $160,000.00, being contributed in the proportions 16:10:10:9:5 by Wawn, Brunninghausen,
Rutherford, Lance and Rigby. Further advances were made in March and April , totalling $200,000.00, in the same proportions. From June 1989 onwards, further loans were made; with Lance making his last advance on 5th July 1989 and Rigby making his last advance on 26th July 1989. From then on, until 13th
October 1989, Wawn, Brunninghausen and Rutherford continued to make loans to the company in the proportions 16:10:10 (or 8:5:5), after which Wawn ceased making advances, while Brunninghausen and Rutherford continued to make equal advances during November and
December 1989.
Altogether, between 24th January 1989 and 19th December 1989, Wawn advanced $657,439.00; Brunninghausen advanced $775,300.00; Rutherford advanced $775,324.00; Lance advanced $76,800.00; and Rigby advanced $50,188.00.
On 14th February 1989, an additional loan of $350,000.00 from RAF was established.
In April 1989, the directors noted that sales began to fall below sales forecast. At a board meeting on 1st May 1989, the directors were advised of packaging problems with presentation boxes, which had been supplied by
Universal Containers Consolidated Pty. Limited (which I will call "Universal
Containers"): the glue which was supposed to hold the boxes together was coming unsealed, causing the boxes to fall apart on supermarket shelves.
During May, it became apparent that this was a major problem, and that retailers were removing Braha Corpn. products from sale because of it.
The response of the directors to this packaging problem was to withhold payment of about $195,000.00 claimed by Universal Packaging, and to work towards a "re-launch" of the relevant lines of potato chips, in new packaging, in September or October 1989. There was subsequently litigation between Braha
Corpn. and Universal Containers, with Universal Containers claiming the price of goods sold and Braha Corpn. cross-claiming for damages: this litigation was settled in 1992 on terms not to be disclosed.
In a letter dated 23rd June 1989, NAB advised the directors of Braha
Corpn. that the overdraft limit was increased to $650,000.00, until 31st
December 1989 when it was to reduce again to $200,000.00.
At a directors' meeting on 6th July 1989, Braha reported to the board that Universal Containers admitted liability for the packaging problem, and that the total claim against it would be in the order of $400,000.00 to $450,000.00. He also reported that he would restrict payments to creditors, that one payment which had to be met was Leigh-Mardon, and that the rest he would keep on "feeding in terms of dribbles to satisfy them". At that meeting also,
Rutherford said "We need another $1 million to take the pressure off".
In early July 1989, the directors (other than Braha) asked Wawn to advise them concerning Braha's position with the company; and Wawn in turn retained a chartered accountant, Michael
Wayland (who I will call "Wayland"), to advise.
At a directors meeting on 17th July 1989, Wayland attended, perused the draft accounts as at 30th June 1989, and said he could not see an investor putting in funds without getting at least 75% of the equity of the company.
There was discussion of what was described as the desperate financial position of the company, and the urgent and immediate need for another injection of at least $100,000.00 before the close of business the next day. The cash flow at the meeting showed that almost $500,000.00 was required, and Lance and Rigby said that they had no further funds to lend. Rigby resigned as a director at the meeting, and Lance did likewise after the meeting. That meeting also dismissed Braha from the company's employment, and removed him as managing director. However, he continued to be a director of the company, and attended subsequent directors' meetings.
Evidence was given by Mr. Bourke, a general manager of Braha Corpn., that, after the departure of Braha, he would from time to time, along with the
Braha Corpn. accountant, identify those creditors which had to be paid immediately, and those which could be kept waiting. He accepted that there was no express arrangement with the latter group to extend the due date for payment of their debts.
During the period July to October, the directors continued to make advances to the company: in July, a total of $296,000.00; in August, a total of $221,000.00; in September, a total of $325,000.00; and in October, a total of $280,000.00. The October figure included the last loan made by Wawn, a loan of $80,000.00 made on 13th October.
It appears that the company's accounts for the year ended 30th June 1989 became available by some time in October 1989, because on 31st October 1989
Wayland produced a report valuing the business, which refers to those accounts. As noted in the report, these accounts showed a loss of $1.585 million during the year, and a deficiency of assets at the end of the year of about $1.55 million. Liabilities noted in the report included current liabilities of about $1.455 million (presumably, the NAB overdraft and trade creditors), shareholders loans of $550,600.00, and secured loans of about $2.8 million (presumably, the fully drawn NAB advance and the RAF loan). The report indicated that, in the months of July and August 1989, there was a further loss of about $569,000.00, giving rise to a total deficiency of about $2.12 million.
The report stated that unless the shareholders' loan could be established as long term capital, the company was technically insolvent, and the business could be deemed to have no value. It further stated that, even if the loans could be so established, on the basis of the budget prepared by the directors, the goodwill was worth only about $155,000.00, so that the net value of the concern was a negative $1.966 million.
According to a diary note made by Mr. Veitch, the manager of NAB's
Edgecliff branch, on 1st November , he telephoned Wawn to discuss the overdraft, which then stood at $679,910.00, and the reduction of it to $200,000.00. According to this note, Wawn said that funds would be injected that day to regularise (presumably, bring the overdraft down to $650,000.00) and that Rutherford and Brunninghausen would call to discuss the extension of the $650,000.00 limit.
Rutherford and Brunninghausen did call to see Veitch the following day, and requested an extension of the overdraft at the present level. They also advised that $50,000.00 would be deposited on that day. They did not bring with them the company accounts, and these were requested by Veitch.
In fact, no money was deposited on 1st or 2nd November: however, $100,000.00 was deposited on 6th November 1989, reducing the overdraft from about $734,000.00 to about $634,000.00.
On 9th November 1989, a facsimile from the company's bookkeeper,
Ms.
Ellis, to Wawn, enclosing a cashflow summary, showed that, to pay expenditure for the week ending 10th November 1989, $234,000.00 needed to be deposited by shareholders; and to pay anticipated expenditure for the week ending 17th
November, a further $121,810.00 needed to be deposited. Included in the debts shown for the week ending 10th November 1989 was group tax for October amounting to $22,572.00: such tax is due for payment on the seventh day of the month following the month in which it was incurred, in this case th November.
In fact, $100,000.00 was deposited on 10th November, and a further $60,000.00 on 20th November (making a total of $260,000.00 for the whole of
November), and no more was deposited until 1st December. The group tax for
October was not paid, and was not subsequently paid prior to the appointment of the receiver.
On 10th November 1989, there began the delivery by the plaintiff of the goods alleged to give rise to the subject claims. These deliveries were made pursuant to orders placed on 15th
September 1989 and 17th November 1989.
According to the plaintiff, on 15th September 1989, the plaintiff was induced to release a $50,000.00 bank guarantee by an assurance by Wawn that Braha
Corpn. was in a "strong financial position".
On 20th November , Rutherford went to the bank with "draft" company accounts. According to Mr. Veitch's notes, Rutherford said that the company had been offered refinance, and asked to extend the existing $650,000.00 limit until this re-financing was in place.
At a board meeting of Braha Corpn. held on 22nd November 1989, the accounts for the year ended 30th June 1989 were approved, and according to the minutes they showed a loss of about $1.55 million. (The accounts which are in evidence in fact show a loss of about $1.2 million, and I do not believe there is any explanation for the difference in the evidence). At this meeting,
Wayland advised that there had been a further loss of $200,000.00 for the month of October, and that the losses totalled $2.7 million to that date. Wawn advised the meeting that the company was only being kept afloat by the investors, and was in dire financial straits.
On 4th December , the overdraft was about $852,000.00, despite a deposit of $100,000.00 having been made by the directors on 1st December.
Veitch telephoned Wawn, and later that day, Rutherford deposited a further $200,000.00.
On 8th December 1989, the plaintiff commenced delivering goods pursuant to the order made in November, while also continuing the delivery of goods pursuant to the September order.
On 12th December 1989, a facsimile was sent by Ms. Ellis to Wawn, enclosing a cashflow summary, which showed that to pay for expenditure for the week ending 15th December 1989, $305,572.00 needed to be deposited by shareholders.
Included in the debts shown for the week ending 15th December were group tax for October $22,572.00, group tax for November $26,930.00, and sales tax approximately $50,000.00.
In fact, following this facsimile, $50,000.00 was deposited by the directors on 15th December, and a further $140,000.00 on 19th December, making a total of $490,000.00 for December, contributed equally by Brunninghausen and
Rutherford.
No further contributions were made. The group tax for October and
November was not paid at any time prior to the appointment of the receiver, nor was sales tax.
On or about 15th December 1989, the directors received a letter from NAB dated 11th December , advising that the overdraft had to be reduced to $200,000.00 by the end of December. According to a diary note by Mr. Veitch, he telephoned Wawn and saw Rutherford on 7th December, and explained this to them.
The company continued to trade after this.
However, NAB commenced dishonouring cheques on 29th December 1989, and, following a meeting on 10th
January 1980 between Wawn and
Rutherford and representatives of NAB, on 12th
January 1990 Wawn instructed the management of Braha Corpn. not to incur further debts.
On 22nd February 1990, RAF appointed a receiver of Braha Corpn.
In April 1990, the directors (apart from Braha) paid out NAB pursuant to their guarantees: about $400,000.00 was paid by Wawn, about $249,000.00 by
Brunninghausen, and about $244,000.00 by Rutherford.
 
ISSUES
Section 556 of the Companies Code is in the following terms: "556(1) If - a company incurs a debt, whether within or outside the
Territory, immediately before the time when the debt is incurred there are reasonable grounds to expect that the company will not be able to pay all its debts as and when they become due; or there are reasonable grounds to expect that, if the company incurs the debt, it will not be able to pay all its debts as and when they become due; and the company is, at the time when the debt is incurred, or becomes at a later time, a company to which this section applies, any person who was a director of the company, or took part in the management of the company, at the time when the debt was incurred is guilty of an offence and the company and that person or, if there are 2 or more such persons, those persons are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the debt.
Penalty: $5,000 or imprisonment for 1 year, or both.

In any proceedings against a person under sub-section , it is a defence if the defendant proves - that the debt was incurred without his express or implied authority or consent; or that at the time when the debt was incurred, he did not have reasonable cause to expect - that the company would not be able to pay all its debts as and when they became due; or that, if the company incurred that debt, it would not be able to pay all its debts as and when they became due.
 
Proceedings may be brought under sub-section (1) for the recovery of a debt whether or not the person against whom the proceedings are brought, or any other person, has been convicted of an offence under sub-section (1) in respect of the incurring of that debt.

When sub-section (1) renders a person or persons liable to pay a debt incurred by a company, the payment by that person or either or any of those persons of the whole or any part of that debt does not render the company liable to the persons concerned in respect of the amount so paid.

If - a company does any act (including the making of a contract or the entering into of a transaction) with intent to defraud creditors of the company or of any other person or for any other fraudulent purpose; and the company is at the time when it does the act, or becomes at a later time, a company to which this section applies, any person who was knowingly concerned in the doing of the act with that intent or for that purpose is guilty of an offence.
Penalty: $10,000 or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.

A certificate issued by the proper officer of a court stating that a persons specified in the certificate - was convicted of an offence under sub-section (1) in relation to a debt specified in the certificate incurred by a company so specified; or was convicted of an offence under sub-section (5) in relation to a company specified in the certificate, is, in any proceedings, prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.

A document purporting to be a certificate issued under sub-section (6) shall, unless the contrary is established, be deemed to be such a certificate and to have been duly issued."
The basis of Wawn's claim against Rutherford is that, where more than one person is liable for the same debt, each are liable to contribute equally towards that debt, and each is entitled to compel the others to bear their appropriate shares. Here, it is submitted on behalf of Wawn that:
Wawn, Brunninghausen and Rutherford are all liable to the plaintiff under s.556 of the Code for debts claimed by the plaintiff in these proceedings; although the plaintiff claimed $674,000.00 plus interest (which, at Schedule Rates for the period 14th March 1991 to th February 1995 would amount to $381,000.00, giving a total claim of $1.055 million), the plaintiff had settled with
Wawn and Brunninghausen for $600,000.00 including costs as at 27th June 1995, and withdrawn his claim against
Rutherford; therefore Rutherford should contribute one-third of $600,000.00; and also one-third of the costs incurred by
Wawn in achieving this favourable result; and there should also be an order against Rutherford for
Wawn's costs of this cross-claim against him.
In opposing Wawn's cross-claim for contribution, Rutherford contends that it has not been established that, at the times when the relevant debts were incurred, there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts as and when they became due; that at such times, he did not have reasonable cause to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts as and when they became due; that, because of the difference in position between him and Wawn, he should not have to contribute equally with
Wawn towards the plaintiff's debt; and that he should not have to contribute towards Wawn's legal costs.
Accordingly, the following issues arise.
Were all of Wawn, Brunninghausen and Rutherford liable to the plaintiff for debts incurred by the company, and did such debts amount at least to $600,000.00? It is clear that all three of these persons were directors of the company, and that the company was ordered to be wound up, so that it is a company to which s.556 applies; and there is no suggestion of any lack of authority or consent to the incurring of the debts. Accordingly, the issues that arise under this question are whether there were "reasonable grounds" at the time when relevant debts were incurred; and whether any of these persons, and in particular Rutherford, has shown that he did not have "reasonable cause".
What, if any, contribution should Rutherford make? In particular, is there any ground to depart from the prima facie rule that the persons liable should contribute equally, and should Rutherford be ordered to contribute towards Wawn's costs of defending the plaintiff's claim.
What order for costs should be made in relation to this cross-claim against Rutherford? 
REASONABLE GROUNDS AND INCURRING DEBTS
It is clear that from prior to the 15th September 1989, when the first of the relevant orders was placed with the plaintiff, the company had been in dire financial straits. So much was expressly recognised, for example, at the directors' meetings of 6th and 17th July 1989. However, even after 17th July , Wawn, Brunninghausen and Rutherford continued to advance very large sums of money to the company to enable it to pay its debts: between 18th July and th December inclusive,
Wawn advanced around $450,000.00, and Brunninghausen and Rutherford each advanced around $665,000.00. So, despite the company's desperate financial straits, it was being provided with funds to pay debts, and the directors were demonstrating in a very tangible way their confidence that the company would ultimately be able to pay its debts and make a profit.
However, the question is not whether there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not eventually be able to pay all its debts, but whether there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay all its debts as and when they fell due. In fact, at the directors' meeting of 6th July, Braha reported to the directors that he would restrict payments to creditors and that, apart from meeting Leigh-Mardon's payments, the rest he would keep on "feeding in terms of dribbles to satisfy them". Furthermore, after Braha was dismissed from the company's employment on th July, Mr. Bourke and the company accountant would identify creditors which had to be paid and those who could be kept waiting. Those matters do suggest that the company was, from July 1989, adopting a policy of not paying debts when they fell due, but only when they had to be paid.
In any event, in my opinion, it is clear that, by 10th November 1989, there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts as and when they became due. The cash flow summary received by
Wawn the previous day showed that, to pay expenditure for the week ending 10th
November 1989, $234,000.00 needed to be deposited by shareholders. In fact, only $100,000.00 was deposited on 10th November, and a further $60,000.00 on th November.
Group tax for October, amounting to $22,572.00, being due for payment of 7th November 1989, was included in the debts shown as payable in the week ending 10th November, and was not paid: indeed, it was not paid (nor was group tax for any subsequent month) at any time before the company was wound up.
In my opinion, it is entirely clear that the company could not then pay its debts as they became due from its own resources; and that, for whatever reason, the directors who were providing money to the company to keep it going were not providing enough for it to pay all its debts as they became due. The objective facts, known to at least one director as at 10th November 1989, made this crystal clear. Nothing occurred to change this situation after 10th
November 1989; so, in my opinion, it is clear that from 10th November 1989 onwards there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay all its debts as and when they fell due.
In order to decide what, if any, liability this involved under s.556, it is necessary to consider what, if any, debts were incurred by the company to the plaintiff from 10th November 1989 onwards.
It is submitted for Wawn that debts for goods delivered by the plaintiff to the company were incurred when the relevant goods were delivered: see
Hussein v. Good [(1990) 8 ACLC 390] at 379. Accordingly, all of the $674,000.00 claimed by the plaintiff was incurred at times when there were the requisite reasonable grounds.
In my opinion, there is no hard and fast rule that a company incurs the debt for goods sold and delivered at the time when the goods are delivered to the company, and not at any earlier time.
In Hussein v. Good, goods were ordered in November and delivered in
May 1988. There had been a part payment for the goods, and the balance was not payable until delivery. Southwell,
J. in the Supreme Court of Victoria held that the debt for the balance of the price was not incurred until delivery in
May 1988.
He held that "debt" should be limited to that which is actually owed immediately it is incurred, so as to exclude contingent debts.
Insofar as the decision was based on that reasoning, it does seem inconsistent with Hawkins v. Bank of China [(1992) 26 NSWLR 562], in which it was held that a company incurs a debt for the purposes of s.556 of the Code when it enters into a guarantee by which it subjects itself to a conditional but unavoidable obligation to pay a sum of money at a future time; so that a relevant debt was incurred when the company in that case entered into a guarantee under which it was obliged to pay a liquidated amount contingent upon demand following default.
As I stated in Standard Chartered Bank of Australia Ltd. v. Antico (unreported, 31st May 1995) at pp 123-4, in my opinion, a company incurs a debt when, by its choice, it does or omits something which, as a matter of substance and commercial reality, renders it liable for a debt for which it otherwise would not have been liable. In relation to sale of goods, it seems to me that, in some cases, it will be the order which in substance and commercial reality renders the company liable for the price of the goods, even if that price is not actually payable until delivery; whilst in other cases, it will be the acceptance of delivery which, as a matter of substance and commercial reality, so renders the company liable. And intermediate positions are possible.
For example, if the goods which are ordered are readily saleable by the vendor elsewhere at the same price, so that to refuse delivery not only precludes any liability for the price, but also involves at worst minimal damages, one might readily say that the debt is incurred, not by placing the order, but by accepting delivery.
On the other hand, if what is ordered is goods which are to be specially manufactured for the company, and are not saleable elsewhere, so that to refuse delivery would be a breach of contract sounding in damages approximating to the full price of the goods, then, as a matter of substance and commercial reality, one would regard the debt as having been incurred by placing the order and binding the company to it, or possibly by not cancelling the order at a time before the damages flowing from such cancellation would be of a similar order to the price of the goods.
In this case, the goods which were ordered was packaging for Braha
Corpn.'s chips, containing Braha Corpn. artwork, and so unlikely to be of any commercial value to anyone else.
Accordingly, in relation to goods delivered pursuant to the order of 15th
September 1989 between 10th November 1989 and 30th November 1989, there is a real question as to whether the debts in respect of those goods were incurred on or after 10th November 1989. I do not believe that, on the evidence, I can find that cancellation of the order for those goods, and/or refusal to accept delivery of those goods, would have significantly reduced the liability which the company would have had in respect of them. In those circumstances, I do not believe that I can be satisfied that the debts in relation to those goods were incurred on or after 10th November 1989.
As regards goods delivered from 8th December 1989 onwards, it is clear that, insofar as those goods were in satisfaction of the order placed on 17th
November 1989, the debts in relation to those goods were incurred after 10th
November 1989. Insofar as the deliveries from 8th December 1989 were in satisfaction for the order placed on 15th September 1989, I believe the material is sufficient to justify a finding that, if on or shortly after 10th
November 1989, the order for those goods had been cancelled, the liability of the company in relation to those goods would have been very much less than the price of the goods. I note that deliveries based on the orders placed on 17th
November commenced about three weeks after those orders; and, although I cannot find with confidence that manufacture of the goods, which were delivered in satisfaction of the order of 15th September, on and after 8th
December, had not commenced by 10th November, it seems clear that the company's liability arising from cancellation of the order on or shortly after th November would have been so different, in amount and type, from its liability for the price of those goods when they were delivered, as to make it reasonable to find that, in substance and reality, the debt in respect of those goods was incurred after 10th November.
Accordingly, I find that the company did, from th November 1989 onwards, incur debts in relation to all goods delivered from 8th December 1989 onwards; and the price of those goods amounts to about $390,000.00.
I see no reason why interest at Schedule Rates would not be allowed on that amount, commencing from the time when s.556 became applicable to the company, that is, 14th March 1991. That interest, calculated up to 27th June ,
would amount to about $204,000.00. It is reasonable also to regard Wawn,
Brunninghausen and Rutherford as being liable for the plaintiff's costs, incurred up to the time when the settlement was agreed upon and the proceedings against Rutherford withdrawn. It is safe to say that those taxed costs, including costs of four days of hearing, would have been in excess of $6,000.00.
Accordingly, without having to come to a final conclusion as to whether reasonable grounds existed prior to 10th November, the reasonable grounds which existed on and from 10th November would be sufficient, assuming all the other elements, to establish a liability in Wawn, Brunninghausen and
Rutherford of at least $600,000.00.
 
REASONABLE CAUSE
Mr. Rutherford's evidence was to the effect that he was willing and able, over the relevant period, to lend to the company whatever was necessary to keep it going; and that he did in fact lend to the company whatever Wawn requested him to lend. He did not know that debts such as the debt for group tax for October 1989 were not being paid as they became due.
However, Mr. Rutherford accepted that he was aware of the discussions about keeping creditors waiting, which took place at the directors' meeting of th July 1989, to which I have referred, and he accepted that, to his knowledge, the company adopted a policy of paying creditors as late as possible. Mr. Rutherford said he considered that to be a fairly normal approach.
Mr. Rutherford also said that he would have relied on Wawn, who was in close control of the situation, and who also was a solicitor, to advise him if the course being adopted was dangerous; and Wawn did not do this. Furthermore, he said, from January , once he realised the company was insolvent, he immediately informed creditors; he worked hard then to make the company viable, he believed it was a viable business, and, but for the non-co-operation of other parties, it would have survived.
I accept
Rutherford's evidence that Wawn did not give him the details of cash flow requirements such as set out in the document of 9th November ;
and I accept that Rutherford and Brunninghausen provided money as requested by
Wawn, at least up to mid-December. However, the onus is squarely on Rutherford to satisfy me that he did not have reasonable cause to expect that Braha
Corpn. would not be able to pay all its debts as and when they became due; and, in circumstances where he knew that the company was adopting a policy of paying debts as late as possible, without regard to when they actually fell due, I cannot be so satisfied. When the fact is that the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, because the directors were not lending it enough money to do so; and when Rutherford was aware that the company had adopted a policy of delaying payment as long as possible, it is no answer to say that that kind of policy is usual in business. The question is not whether the company was adopting a procedure which is not unusual, or whether it could be expected eventually to pay all its debts; but whether Rutherford has satisfied me that he did not have reasonable cause to expect that it would not be able to pay all its debts when they became due. I am not so satisfied.
 
CONTRIBUTION
Mr. Thomson for Wawn relied on a number of authorities in support of his contention that there should be equal contribution: McLean v. Discount and
Finance Ltd. <case>; [(1939) 64 CLR 312] at ; Albion Insurance Co. v. Government Insurance Office(1969) <case>; [121 CLR 342] at 621; Mahoney v. McManus <case>; [(1981) 36 ALR 545] at 549, 551, 559. There was no general discretion to depart from such equality.
Mr. Rutherford submitted that his position as an uninformed non-executive director was quite different from that of Wawn, who did not keep Rutherford and the other nonexecutives fully informed as to the affairs of the company, and in particular whether the company was experiencing difficulties in meeting its debts.
In my view, the authorities relied on by Mr. Thomson indicate that there is no general discretion to adjust contributions by reason of some perceived difference in responsibility of the debtors for the incurring of the debt: that is, there is nothing like the apportionment discretion that applies in cases of contribution between tortfeasors or in cases of contributory negligence.
However, I think there are three particular matters that need attention: the relevance of the existence of a fourth director, namely
Braha; the relevance of the 8:5:5 proportions in the loan contributions; and the question of responsibility for Wawn's own legal costs. I will deal with these in turn.
Braha was still a director of the company from 10th November 1989 onwards, although he was no longer managing director, and had in fact been dismissed from the company's employment. Although he put on a defence to
Wawn's crossclaim against him, he did not appear at the hearing and no evidence in support of his defence was read at the hearing.
He explained his non-attendance by letters sent to me, which I made available to the parties.
Had the cross-claim against Braha been continued, it would have been necessary for me to decide whether, from all the evidence in the case, I was satisfied either that the debts in question were incurred without Braha's authority or consent, or that Braha did not have reasonable cause to expect that the company would not be able to pay all its debts as they became due. It is possible that, by virtue of Braha's exclusion from the affairs of the company,
I would have come to that conclusion; although it is by no means certain. The existence of another possible co-debtor, where none of the parties found to be co-debtors have sought to have that other person make a contribution, would not appear to justify reducing the proportion payable by Rutherford: cf.
Wolmershausen v. Gullick [(1893) 2 Ch 514] at 529-30.
It was held by Giles, J. in Morgan Equipment Co. v. Rodgers [(1993) 32
NSWLR 467] that the general rule that there be equal contribution between co-sureties may be modified or excluded by the common intention of the sureties; and that there was in that case a common intention that liability under the guarantee would be born by the guarantors inter se in proportion in their interests in the principal debtor. In the present case, loans were made available to Braha Corpn.
by the three relevant directors in the proportions :5:5, this reflecting their percentage interest in the venture. For the period th November to 19th December, no contributions were made by Wawn, and equal contributions by Brunninghausen and Rutherford, apparently pursuant to an agreement that, when the company got to a profit situation, profits would then be shared on the basis of funds actually injected into the company (see transcript p.113-4). When the National Bank was subsequently paid out, it appears that it was paid out in accordance with the earlier proportions, with
Wawn contributing about $400,000.00, and Brunninghausen and Rutherford each contributing something like $250,000.00. In my view, one can infer from this an intention that losses from the venture occurring after the business ceased would be shared between these three persons in those proportions. At present, therefore, my view is that this consideration would justify a departure from the usual rule to the extent of limiting Rutherford's contribution to five-eighteenths of the $600,000.00.
I note that this matter was not expressly raised in argument, and if there is some matter which Mr. Thomson would wish to advance in opposition to this, which he has not had an opportunity to advance, I would be prepared to hear submissions on that.
On the question of whether Rutherford should make a contribution towards
Wawn's costs of defending the plaintiff's claim, I accept that it may be appropriate, in certain circumstances, to take that course. In Morgan
Equipment Co. v. Rodgers, Giles,
J. held that, in circumstances where the creditor's claim was defended and settled upon terms whereby the creditor accepted two-thirds of its claim, the defence was apt to, and did, inure to the benefit of the co-guarantor; and that accordingly, the coguarantor should contribute towards those costs in the same way as towards his co-ordinate liability for the debt. However, in this case, the creditor's claim was defended, not only by Wawn, but also by Brunninghausen (with the aid of legal representation) and by Rutherford (without such aid). The settlement, which quantified the creditor's claim at $600,000.00, was negotiated between the creditor on the one hand, and Wawn and Brunninghausen on the other. I am prepared to hold that it was an advantageous settlement, in that it avoided the risk of a larger liability based upon a finding of reasonable grounds existing earlier than 10th November 1989. However, I do not think that is sufficient to make it appropriate for Rutherford to be required to contribute to Wawn's costs of defending the creditor's action, when that action was also defended by Brunninghausen and Rutherford. Furthermore, I believe I can, on this aspect at least, take into account Wawn's much greater involvement in the running of the company at the time the debt was incurred, as compared with
Rutherford; and on this basis also, decline to require that Rutherford contribute to Wawn's costs.
 
COSTS OF THE CROSS-CLAIM .
Wawn has been successful in the cross-claim against Rutherford, albeit not quite to the full extent of his claim. I think it is appropriate, in general terms, that Rutherford be ordered to pay those costs of the cross-claim which are clearly additional to those which Wawn incurred, in any event, in his defence of the plaintiff's claim. I would propose to order that
Rutherford pay Wawn's costs of the cross-claim, limited to the preparation and filing of the cross-claim document, the costs of the day's hearing before me on th March 1995, and costs incurred subsequently to that. It may possibly be that there are other costs referable to the cross-claim; but I believe all other costs would also have had some bearing on the defence of the plaintiff's claim, and I do not propose to make an order against Mr. Rutherford in respect of any of such matters.
It follows that I am prepared to make a declaration to the effect that
Rutherford is liable to contribute a sum of $166,167.00 towards the $600,000.00 to be paid to the plaintiff; and to make consequential orders to enable enforcement of that liability against Rutherford. I am also prepared to make an order for costs in Wawn's favour, to the extent I have indicated. When the parties have had a chance to consider my judgment, and to attempt to agree on appropriate orders, the matter may be re-listed by arrangement with my
Associate.
