Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from the judgment of Master Malpass dated 4 June 1997 whereby he refused an application by the appellant to extend the limitation period. 
The background facts are not in dispute. The appellant suffered personal injury in an accident which occurred on 26 May 1988: she was employed as a mail officer/sorter at the Turrella mail exchange by the Australian Postal
Commission when a bottle of artificial nail adhesive contained in a postal package broke and the plaintiff inhaled its vapours. She instituted proceedings in the District Court (14175 of 1991) against Ribus Holdings Pty.
Limited, the company responsible for the posting of the bottle concerned. The matter was heard before His Honour Judge Cooper who found for her and assessed damages in the sum of $354,286.10. Initially, an insurance company, CIC
Insurance, was a third party at the suit of Ribus Holdings but during the hearing they were dismissed from the suit. After the hearing it became apparent that the company could not meet the judgment and that there was a dispute between the insurance company, CIC, and the company in respect of the nature of the cover.

The present proceedings in respect of which an application is made to extend the limitation period were commenced by statement of claim filed on 7 November
The defendant (respondent) in these proceedings is Mrs. Stevens who was a director of the company, Ribus Holdings, and the person who wrapped and posted the package. Mrs. Stevens gave that evidence on 24 November 1995 in the course of the hearing before Cooper, DCJ.

The appellant deposes in her affidavit that the first time she became aware of the identity of the present defendant was on 24 November 1995. There is no evidence to the contrary and I accept that evidence, as the master appears to have done. The issue is whether the appellant had taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the identity of Mrs. Stevens pursuant to [s.57B(1)(e)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/); alternatively, whether, subject to an argument as to its application, the appellant ought to have become aware of Mrs. Stevens' identity within the meaning of [s.60I(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) of the same Act more than three years before the application for relief.

Some other proceedings are on foot between the appellant and the insurers relating to this accident but I do not regard those as material to this application.

The appellant seeks relief pursuant to [ss.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) and [60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). The relevant limitation period expired in May 1994 and as set out above, the appellant's case is that it was not until 24 November 1995 she became aware of the identity of Mrs. Stevens as a tortfeasor.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) appears in subdivision (1) Division 3 of the Act and the relevant provisions are as follows:- "57B(1) For the purposes of this subdivision:- ...
 the material facts relating to a cause of action include the following:- the fact of the occurrence of negligence nuisance or breach of duty on which the cause of action is founded; the identity of the person against whom the cause of action lies; the fact that the negligence nuisance or breach of duty causes personal injury; the nature and extent of the personal injury so caused; and the extent to which the personal injury is caused by the negligence nuisance or breach of duty; ...
 a fact is not within the means of knowledge of a person at a particular time if, but only if:- he does not, at that time, know the fact; and in so far as the fact is capable of being ascertained by him, he has, before that time, taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the fact; and ..." 
The respondent contended that it was not good enough for the appellant merely to identify the company responsible and institute proceedings against it. The respondent further contended that there was a duty on the appellant to make enquiries as to the financial stability or otherwise of the company.

The appellant contended that having identified the company as the entity responsible, that was not necessary to make further enquiry to identify the particular employee or individual and there was nothing at that time to indicate that the employee was doing other than carrying out the normal system relating to packaging and posting goods which operated within the company. In the absence of any notice of problems relating to the financial state of the company and bearing in mind the legislation which counsel for both the appellant and respondent agreed was in force at the material time requiring employers to indemnify employees for acts done in the course of their employment, the appellant says there was no need to do more. Further, the appellant says it would have been unusual to serve interrogatories directed to ascertaining the identity of the employee and referred to a number of cases, namely: John Fairfax & Sons v. Cojuangco <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 346]; Cojuangco v. John Fairfax & Sons (No. 2) [(1991)
Aust. Torts. R. 81-068]; Taylor v. Osborne [(1973) 1 NSWLR 52]; National
Education Advancement Programmes Pty. Limited v. Ashton [(1995) 128 FLR ];
Howell v. Nominal Defendant <case>; [(1962) 108 CLR 552] in support of an argument that even if interrogatories had been sought as to the identity of the employee, they would not have been successful.

Both counsel agreed in argument that it would be unusual in cases such as this to sue the employee as well as the employer.

The question therefore is, should the appellant prior to the expiration of the limitation period have taken steps to ascertain the identity of the employee and also name such employee as a defendant. In my view it was not necessary so to do. Putting the matter the other way, was it unreasonable for the appellant and her advisers not to ascertain the identity of the employee? Given the circumstances at the time, I do not think the appellant acted unreasonably.

The master dealt with this issue at pp.7-8 of his judgment. He concluded that he was not satisfied that the identity of the present defendant was not within the appellant's means of knowledge pursuant to [s.58(2)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) 
It follows in my judgment, that the master found that in relation to [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) the plaintiff had not crossed the threshold giving rise to considering the operation of his discretion. As I have taken a different view and consider the plaintiff has crossed the threshold, it falls to me to exercise my discretion as to whether leave should be granted pursuant to [s.58.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html)
The principles to be applied have been set out by the High Court in Brisbane
South Regional Health Authority v. Taylor <case>; [(1996) 70 ALJR 866] and discussed in The Council of the City of Sydney v.
Zegarac (Court of Appeal, unreported 26 February 1998). No evidence relating to prejudice has been filed by the respondent but in argument two matters were raised: first, it was said delay of itself is prejudicial and secondly, that if Mrs. Stevens had been named as a defendant in the first place she might not have given evidence. I start from the premise that the onus rests on the appellant to satisfy me that discretion should be exercised in her favour. It appears to me that this matter was fully litigated in front of Cooper, DCJ.
and nothing in these proceedings would come as a surprise to the respondent.
Therefore in this case I do not see delay as being prejudicial. I do not regard the point made about whether or not Mrs. Stevens would have given evidence as carrying the matter any further. I proceed on the basis that the evidence she gave was truthful and do not enter into speculation as to who might or might not have called her were she an individual defendant. The present proceedings were commenced within one year of the date upon which the plaintiff became aware of the identity of Mrs. Stevens.

In my judgment there is nothing to prevent a fair trial of the issues between the appellant and the respondent taking place. Further, I am satisfied it is appropriate to exercise my discretion in favour of the appellant and order pursuant to [s.58(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) that the limitation period be extended.

That is enough to dispose of the instant appeal. However, argument was also addressed on the application of [s.60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) and the application is made pursuant to it. I should therefore deal with those arguments.

On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that by reason of the wording of [s.60I(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) the identity of the defendant was not a relevant consideration. The respondent contrasted with that section the wording of [s.57B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html), in particular [s.57B(1)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html), the terms of which are set out previously in this judgment. The respondent further relied on the case of Bridge Shipping Pty. Limited v. Grand Shipping
S.A. & Anor <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 231] in support of its contention.

The appellant contended that the identity of the defendant in the present action was encompassed in the wording of [s.60I(1)(a)(iii).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) 
In my view, the appellant's contention is correct because in relation to the present action the appellant has deposed and it is not contradicted that she was unaware that the present respondent was responsible for the acts until she gave evidence before Cooper, DCJ. In my judgment that identity is a very material consideration and I do not consider the Bridge Shipping case to be of assistance.

The issue then under [s.60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) is whether the appellant ought to have become aware of the identity of the respondent at a stage earlier than three years prior to the date of the application in this matter. In my judgment that is the same argument as has already been dealt with in relation to [s.57B(1)(e)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57b.html), and for the same reasons I do not think the appellant ought to have become aware of the identity of the defendant in the present case more than three years before the application was made. The master dealt with this at p.7 of his judgment and said, in effect, that he thought she ought to have become aware of the identity of the respondent more than three years before the application was made. Accordingly, he again found she had not passed the threshold giving rise to the application of his discretion and I can approach it afresh.
 [Section
G(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) says the court may, "if it decides that it is just and reasonable to do so, order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended for such period as it determines". I bear in mind the same considerations as set out in approaching the question of exercising my discretion under [s.57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s57.html) and I am satisfied that it is just and reasonable to order that the limitation period for the cause of action in the present proceedings be extended.

Accordingly, I make the following orders:-
The appeal is allowed.
The orders of Master Malpass dated 4 June 1997 are set aside.
In lieu thereof the time for commencement of these proceedings is extended until the date of filing of the statement of claim.
The respondent pay the costs of this appeal.
The costs of the motion before the master be costs in the cause.
The respondent's notice of motion dated 3 February 1997 is dismissed.
