EQUITY DIVISION  
WINDEYER J  
FRIDAY 12 SEPTEMBER 2003  /01 NEW CAP REINSURANCE CORPORATION LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) & ANOR V FARADAY UNDERWRITING LIMITED AND ORS  
JUDGMENT  
Outline  This judgment deals with questions which have arisen in the winding up of
New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Limited (In Liquidation) (NCRA). The first important matter for determination is whether or not [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) which was in force prior to 1 July 2002 (the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)) applies to the liquidation or whether it was repealed by express repeal by the [General
Insurance Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/gira2001240/) or by implied repeal by the Corporations Law or the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); and if it was repealed whether rights or obligations were preserved by s8 of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) so as to bear upon rights the parties here have as creditors in the liquidation. If s116(3) does apply the further question arises as to the proper interpretation of s116(3) of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/). The second matter of importance is the effect [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) has upon the winding up whether or not s116 of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) bears upon rights in the winding up. There are numerous other questions upon which the liquidator seeks directions.  My determination of some of the early [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) questions may make some of the directions sought unnecessary. For the most part however I have dealt with the direction in deference to the very careful arguments which have been put and in case my decision is taken on appeal.  
Parties  This is really test litigation, the defendants being joined by agreement not as representative parties, but as parties having particular and sometimes contrary interests so far as the relief by way of declaration and directions sought by the liquidator is concerned. The first defendant represents certain
Lloyds Underwriting syndicates. It reinsured certain insurance risks with
NCRA. It is a London based company. The second defendant is an Australian reinsurer which reinsured some of its risk by way of retrocession agreement with NCRA. The third defendant is a creditor of NCRA in liquidation. Its debt does not arise under any policy of insurance. The Australian Prudential
Regulatory Authority (APRA) was given leave to make submissions through counsel.  Each of the parties has provided very helpful written submissions which set out the contentions on each of the questions. In view of the opposing positions and the large number of questions for decision I will deal with the questions without specifically referring to the written and oral submissions but nevertheless dealing with the arguments advanced on each side. Mr Coles
QC, senior counsel for the liquidator has very helpfully put forward the questions and general arguments and has in addition in most cases argued for or at least supported a particular conclusion especially if there was no other contradictor or supporter. His written submissions have been especially valuable.  
Facts  NCRA was incorporated on 11 October 1996. Its principal shareholder was another Australian company, NC Re Corporation Limited, now in liquidation, (NC
Re), the third defendant. NC Re is wholly owned by a Bermuda company New Cap
Reinsurance Corporation Bermuda Limited (NCRB) (now in liquidation) which is in turn owned by another Bermuda company also in liquidation.  The business of NCRA was writing international reinsurance. On 21 April 1999
Mr Gibbons, the second plaintiff, was appointed voluntary administrator and on September 1999, by resolution of creditors it was resolved the company be wound up and Mr Gibbons thereupon became liquidator.  NCRA itself took out reinsurance cover (outward reinsurance) for part of its liabilities under the inwards reinsurance policies issued by it. The recoveries under those policies by the liquidator are substantial and further substantial recoveries are expected. Nevertheless there will be a substantial deficiency in NCRA. How that deficiency will be borne as among insurance creditors of NCRA and as between insurance creditors and general creditors gives rise to the necessity for these proceedings.  NC Re is a general creditor of NCRA for US$30 million. That sum was borrowed by NC Re from NCRB on 31 December 1998 and re-lent on that day to NCRA by way of perpetual subordinated loan on the terms of a perpetual unsecured note instrument which provided for its governing law to be that of New South Wales.  NCRA had only one office. That was in Sydney. NC Re is an Australian company. It is accepted that the debt under the notes was a liability of NCRA in Australia. Where under legislation preference in the winding up is given to creditors who claim under liabilities in Australia, the interest of the third defendant to have as restrictive an interpretation as possible placed on the class of creditors. Where there is a question of whether some priority is given to insurance creditors as opposed to general creditors it is in the interests of the third defendant to argue for an inclusive class of creditors both insurance and general.  The originating process in this action refers to two reinsurance contract claims under reinsurance contracts issued by NCRA in favour of the first defendant. The policy TY165A for the 1998 year was a property excess of loss reinsurance contract for that year. The cover was in respect of events or losses occurring anywhere arranged through brokers in England and Canada. NCRA had no specific facultative outwards reinsurance in respect of liability under the policy, but it did purchase outwards excess of loss and quota share reinsurance to protect its liability under general business classes. The policy included an arbitration clause which provided for the seat of the arbitration to be in London and for enforcement of awards in the High Court of
Justice in England or in a court of competent jurisdiction in any territory in which the defaulting party "is domiciled, has assets or carries on business".
It is not a Scott versus Avery clause. There was in addition a clause nominating London brokers as the intermediary through whom all transactions and communications were to take place.  The second policy was relevant to a claim under a facultative reinsurance contract in respect of an original insured AK Steel Corporation where the direct broker (between original insured and insurer) was Johnson and Higgins
Limited in London, the facultative broker (between original insurer and reinsurer) was Willcox Johnson and Higgins Reinsurance Brokers Limited, also in London, the underwriters who were reinsured with NCRA were various Lloyds syndicates and the local broker (between facultative broker and reinsurer) in
Australia was Australian Independent Reinsurance Services Pty Limited. The original events insured against could only happen outside Australia. There was no facultative reinsurance protection for the contract. There was, however, some recovery under a whole account quota share reinsurance. I will return to these policies when considering the interpretation of [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/).  The second defendant, Gerling Global Reinsurance Company of Australia Pty
Limited was insured with the NCRA under a policy of reinsurance. As any payment to it under a policy with NCRA would be made in Australia there is no doubt its claim was a liability in Australia. It is therefore in its interests to have a narrow construction put upon the class of creditors whose claims are held to be liabilities of NCRA in Australia. In addition the Gerling liability was covered by NCRA with an outwards quota share agreement with NCRB. Gerling would benefit by a finding of narrow pooling under a question I will come to later.  
Legislation  [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)  At the dates of appointment of administrator and liquidator [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) and s[31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html) of the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) (the Old [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)) provided as follows:  . Body corporate not to carry on insurance business after commencement of winding up  
If a body corporate that is authorised under this Act to carry on insurance business is begun to be wound up:  the body must not carry on insurance business after the date of commencement of the winding up; and 
APRA must cause to be published in the Gazette a notice stating that, because of the commencement of the winding up, the body is no longer permitted to carry on insurance business.  
A body corporate is not guilty of a contravention of subsection (1) by reason only that it is carrying on business for the purpose of discharging liabilities assumed by it before the date of commencement of the winding up.  
In the winding up of a body corporate authorized under this Act to carry on insurance business, or in the winding up of a supervised body corporate, the assets in Australia of the body corporate shall not be applied in the discharge of its liabilities other than its liabilities in Australia unless it has no liabilities in Australia.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html) has effect for the purposes of this section.  
Nothing in this section affects the validity of a contract entered into by a body corporate after it is commenced to be wound up.  
This section has effect and shall be complied with notwithstanding anything in any law of a State or Territory.  Liabilities  
In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to liabilities of a body corporate includes a reference to provision for liabilities made in its accounts, or directed in accordance with this section to be made, but does not include:  a liability in respect of share capital; or  where the body corporate is registered under the [Life Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/lia1995144/), a liability that is, in accordance with that Act:  referable to a class of life insurance business carried on by the body corporate in respect of which it has established a statutory fund under that
Act; or  charged on any of the assets of such a statutory fund.  
For the purposes of this Act, a body corporate carrying on insurance business shall make in its accounts provision in respect of liabilities.  ... 
For the purposes of this Part, where a liability is undertaken by a body corporate under:  a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made in Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued in Australia, not being a contract:  that relates only to a liability contingent upon an event that can happen only outside Australia, not being a liability that the body corporate has undertaken to satisfy in Australia; or  where the body corporate carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia, that relates only to a liability that the body corporate has undertaken to satisfy outside Australia; or  a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made outside Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued outside
Australia where any part of the negotiations or arrangements leading to the making of the contract, to the acceptance of the proposal or to the issue of the policy took place or were made in Australia, being a contract:  that relates to a liability contingent upon an event that can happen only in Australia; or  where the body corporate carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia, that relates to a liability that the body corporate has undertaken to satisfy in Australia;  that liability is a liability in Australia.  ...  The [General Insurance Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/gira2001240/) commenced on 1 July 2002. That Act repealed [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) and replaced it with a new [s116.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html)
This replacement section applies only to a general insurer. NCRA is not a general insurer as defined by [s11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s11.html) of that Act as it is not authorized to carry on insurance business in Australia.
I will refer to the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) as amended by the [General Insurance Reform
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/gira2001240/) as "the
New [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)".  Schedule 2 of the [General Insurance Reform
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/gira2001240/) contains transitional provisions, item 4 of which authorizes the Australian Prudential
Regulatory Authority (APRA) to make a determination that certain provisions of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) continue to apply to an insurer. No such determination has been made in respect of NCRA.
The transitional period ends on 1 July 2004.  [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provisions  As originally enacted the Corporations Law did not distinguish in what was then s447 between insurance and reinsurance policies in determining a priority entitlement on a winding up. While applying its direct matching provisions to contracts of reinsurance was difficult, it had been held that the predecessors of the section applied to both insurance and reinsurance policies. The Harmer Report which resulted in the [Corporate Law Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/clra1992225/) brought about a change to this. Contracts of reinsurance were excluded from the operation of the new s562, which was otherwise unvaried, and s562A was inserted dealing with reinsurance. The relevant sections of the Corporations
Law after 1992 and of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) for the purpose of this action are as follows:  . Application of Part  
Except so far as the contrary intention appears, the provisions of this Act about winding up apply in relation to the winding up of a company whether in insolvency, by the Court or voluntarily.  . General rule---compute amount as at relevant date  
The amount of a debt or claim of a company (including a debt or claim that is for or includes interest) is to be computed for the purposes of the winding up as at the relevant date.  
Subsection (1) does not apply to an amount admissible to proof under [subsection (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s553.html)  
Priorities  Debts and claims proved to rank equally except as otherwise provided  
Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all debts and claims proved in a winding up rank equally and, if the property of the company is insufficient to meet them in full, they must be paid proportionately.  Application of proceeds of contracts of insurance  
Where a company is, under a contract of insurance (not being a contract of reinsurance) entered into before the relevant date, insured against liability to third parties, then, if such a liability is incurred by the company (whether before or after the relevant date) and an amount in respect of that liability has been or is received by the company or the liquidator from the insurer, the amount must, after deducting any expenses of or incidental to getting in that amount, be paid by the liquidator to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred to the extent necessary to discharge that liability, or any part of that liability remaining undischarged, in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html)  
If the liability of the insurer to the company is less than the liability of the company to the third party, subsection (1) does not limit the rights of the third party in respect of the balance.  
This section has effect notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.  
A Application of proceeds of contracts of reinsurance  
This section applies where:  a company is insured, under a contract of reinsurance entered into before the relevant date, against liability to pay amounts in respect of a relevant contract of insurance or relevant contracts of insurance; and  an amount in respect of that liability has been or is received by the company or the liquidator under the contract of reinsurance.  
Subject to subsection (4), if the amount received, after deducting expenses of or incidental to getting in that amount, equals or exceeds the total of all the amounts that are payable by the company under relevant contracts of insurance, the liquidator must, out of the amount received and in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html), pay the amounts that are so payable under those contracts of insurance.  
Subject to subsection (4), if subsection (2) does not apply, the liquidator must, out of the amount received and in priority to all payments in respect of the debts mentioned in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html), pay to each person to whom an amount is payable by the company under a relevant contract of insurance an amount calculated in accordance with the formula:  
Particular amount owed x Reinsurance payment 
Total amount owed  where:  particular amount owed means the amount payable to the person under the relevant contract of insurance.  reinsurance payment means the amount received under the contract of reinsurance, less any expenses of or incidental to getting in that amount.  total amount owed means the total of all the amounts payable by the company under, relevant contracts of insurance.  
The Court may, on application by a person to whom an amount is payable under a relevant contract of insurance, make an order to the effect that subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to the amount received under the contract of reinsurance and that that amount must, instead, be applied by the liquidator in the manner specified in the order, being a manner that the Court considers just and equitable in the circumstances.  
The matters that the Court may take into account in considering whether to make an order under subsection (4) include, but are not limited to:  whether it is possible to identify particular relevant contracts of insurance as being the contracts in respect of which the contract of reinsurance was entered into; and  whether it is possible to identify persons who can be said to have paid extra in order to have particular relevant contracts of insurance protected by reinsurance; and  whether particular relevant contracts of insurance include statements to the effect that the contracts are to be protected by reinsurance; and  whether a person to whom an amount is payable under a relevant contract of insurance would be severely prejudiced if subsections (2) and (3) applied to the amount received under the contract of reinsurance.  
If receipt of a payment under this section only partially discharges a liability of the company to a person, nothing in this section affects the rights of the person in respect of the balance of the liability.  
This section has effect despite any agreement to the contrary.  
In this section:  relevant contract of insurance means a contract of insurance entered into by a company, as insurer, before the relevant date.  The Corporations Law, a New South Wales Act was superseded on 15 July when the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) came into force re-enacting [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) and s[562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the earlier Act as the same numbered sections.  By reason of s109 of the Commonwealth of Australia [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)
Act if there were inconsistency between s116 of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) and the
Corporations Law the former as a Commonwealth Act would prevail over the latter, being a State Act to the extent of any inconsistency. The position however changed on the enactment of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), it being a Commonwealth Act.  [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth)  The relevant sections of this Act are as follows:  Effect of repeal  
Where an Act repeals in the whole or in part a former Act, then unless the contrary intention appears the repeal shall not:  revive anything not in force or existing, at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or  affect the previous operation of any Act so repealed, or anything duly done or suffered under any Act so repealed; or  affect any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under any Act so repealed; or  affect any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any Act so repealed; or  affect any investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right privilege obligation liability penalty forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid;  and any such investigation legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued or enforced, and any such penalty forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been passed.  
A Implied repeals etc.  
A reference in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s7.html) or 8 to the repeal of an Act or of a part of an Act includes a reference to:  a repeal effected by implication;  the abrogation or limitation of the effect of the Act or part;  and  the exclusion of the application of the Act or part to any person, subject matter or circumstance.  ...  
AA Regard to be had to purpose or object of Act  
In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.  
Does s116(3) of the Old [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) bear upon the winding up?  This question raises matters of implied repeal, direct repeal, retrospective operation and existing rights and obligations. At the commencement of the winding up the provisions of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/), so far as they were inconsistent with the Corporations Law, prevailed over the
Corporations Law for the reasons set out in paragraph 18. The argument is that on the passing of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) [s513](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s513.html), s[554](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s554.html), s[555](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s555.html), s[556](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html), s[562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) and s[562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) operated so as to bring about an implied repeal of [s116(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html)
The question should first be considered without taking into account the provisions of s8 and s8A of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/). Repeal by implication needs to be reasonably obvious before it comes about. There is no doubt that the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is a specific Act dealing with companies including the winding up of companies and that the opening words of [s555](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s555.html) are "except as otherwise provided by this Act". On the other hand the Old [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) is an act specific to insurance companies with [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) being limited to the winding up of such companies. As I will explain later it is not impossible for both [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) and s562A to bear upon a situation and to both have some effect and a different effect depending upon which takes priority. One gives priority through geographic facts, the other priority to particular class (insured) claimants against particular class (reinsurance) assets. They are not so inconsistent as to require a finding of implied repeal. The repeal, and reinstatement of [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) in the New [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) is at least inconsistent with the implied repeal or for that matter intended repeal by the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). I find there was no implied repeal.  The next question is the effect of the repeal of s116(3) of the Old [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) in 2002 and its re-enactment in a form not applicable to NCRA. It is not applicable as s11 of the New [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) defines general insurer as a body corporate that is authorized under [s12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s12.html) to carry on insurance business in Australia and NCRA has no such authority. It was argued that the transitional provisions indicate a retrospective intention other than as expressed by the transitional provisions thereby indicating a contrary intention within s8 of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/). It is convenient to deal with the s8 question as I think it determines the matter.
First however, the repeal of the section in the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) and its reinstatement so far as [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) is concerned by s116(3) of the New [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) indicates a continuance and a prospective operation of the repeal. It would be strange to legislate for an interregnum. Second, the transitional provisions in Schedule to the New [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) are not contrary to an intention to retain existing rights. They are appropriate to insurers in run down mode, or to companies that, while they may not presently fulfil all the requirements of the New [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/), are not thought to be a risk, and are thought to be capable of compliance within a limited period.  On the basis that there is no contrary intention expressed in the New [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) the question is whether s8(c) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) means that the creditors' claims are to be dealt with on the basis of s116(3) of the
Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/). Thus the question is whether or not s116(3) of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) gave rise to any right, privilege, obligation or liability. From the point of view of a creditor entitled to priority under the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) it is argued that there was a right to have that creditor's claim dealt with so as to give effect to [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) priority. From the position of the liquidator it is said by the same creditors that there was obligation on the liquidator to deal with claims on the basis of the [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) priority and that this right and this obligation are maintained through [s8(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s8.html)  It has been established that rights are not restricted to proprietary rights: Mathieson versus Burton <case>; [(1971) 124 CLR 1] at 12. But whether rights or obligations are the centre of attention, the relevant question is whether or not a creditor entitled to [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) priority at the date of the commencement of the winding up had any entitlement to have his or her proof of debt dealt with on the basis of the law in force at the commencement of the winding up. In support of this contention, counsel for Gerling and NC Re point to the provisions of [ss554](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s554.html) and [555](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s555.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) which are predicated on rights accruing as a result of a debt due or a contingent liability at the commencement of the winding. Two Australian cases support the contentions of the second defendant which are supported by the third defendant. These are Steinberg versus Herbert <case>; [(2002) 54 NSWLR 179.] The first of these cases was a decision of the Full
Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. At issue so far as is relevant here was the priority in a winding up for payments due to an employee of the company, who was its managing director, in respect of leave of absence.
This case involved priorities on receivership but the same principles would have applied to a winding up. At the date of the commencement of the receivership there was a sum of $22,000 due to the former managing director for long service leave not taken. After that date and before an application for directions by the liquidators came on for hearing by the court the relevant State legislation was amended to provide that priority claims in respect of leave of absence were restricted to $1,500 in respect of a certain category of employee into which the managing director fell. While the decision was a majority decision, all the judges dealt with the legislation on the basis that it affected rights. Wallace J, who was in the minority considered that it was clear that the later legislation was an amendment and not a repeal but in any event it was clearly intended to have retrospective operation.
Brinsden J held that there was no retrospective intent. So far as what could be described as the s8(c) question, but under the relevant state legislation he said at pages 89-90:  
So far as the argument goes that the right to payment had not vested in or accrued to the appellant and therefore the section as amended applied to him I do not believe any question of vesting enters into the resolution of the matter. I adopt perhaps a simplistic approach. That is based entirely on the construction of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s331.html) and (2). They read, and relevantly read, at the date the receiver was appointed, that he "shall pay, out of the property coming into his hands, the following debts or amounts in priority . . ., any debt or amount that in a winding up is payable in priority to other unsecured debts pursuant to paragraph 441(g)". The order of priority (and the extent of that priority) was fixed at the date the receiver was appointed. The provision in sub-s (2) that the receiver shall pay out of the property coming into his hands debts in priority set out, is a provision which requires him to pay the preferential creditors out of any assets coming into his hands as receiver: Westminster
Corporation versus Haste [[1950] Ch 442] at 447. If he has had any assets out of which this payment could have been made, (and he has), he is under a liability in tort to pay it to the creditor entitled. The relevant date therefore is the date of appointment of the receiver and it is at that date the order of priority is determines in accordance with the provisions of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s331.html) as they appeared at the date of this receiver's appointment. The fact that subsequently the order of priority is varied, or the amount of priority reduced, is irrelevant since the amended provisions of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s331.html) were not the provisions having effect as at the date of appointment.  
Kennedy J was of the same opinion. At page 96 et seq he said:  
The cross-appeal 
The cross-appeal raises a quite separate question. [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s331.html) of the Code imposes upon a receiver, or other person taking possession or assuming control of property of a company, to pay out of the property coming into his hands the specified debts in the stated priorities. Obviously enough, that is a statutory duty and it has been held that a receiver who neglects to provide for such payments will be held personally liable in damages to preferential creditors who have not been paid:. See Woods versus Winskill [[1913] 2 Ch 303]; Westminster Corp versus Haste [[1950] Ch 442]; Westminster
City Council versus Treby [[1936] 2 All ER 21] and
Inland Revenue Commissioners versus Goldblatt [[1972] Ch 498.] It is a statutory duty imposed upon a receiver from the time of his appointment and must give rise to a correlative entitlement on the part of preferential creditors, although it may not be a right to immediate payment. (my underlining)  
It is not apparent from the evidence when the receivers would have been in a position to pay the preferential debts; but there is nothing to indicate that they were not in such a position prior to the date upon which the originating summons was issued by them and before the amending legislation was passed. It is not in question that the receivers, before that time, had in their hands the property out of which [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s331.html), of the Code directed them to pay the preferred debts. Although, almost inevitably, the payment of preferred creditors must be delayed for sometime to enable a receiver to realise assets coming into his hands, the critical time for the determination of those creditors' rights appears to me to be the time at which the floating charge crystallised, upon the appointment of the receiver (or, perhaps, upon the entry of the receiver: see per Dixon J in
Australian Mutual Provident Society versus Geo Myers & Co Ltd (in liq) <case>; [(1931) 47 CLR 65] at 83). Preferential claims arising after crystallisation are not within the statutory provision and they remain subordinate to a floating charge: Re Griffin Hotel Co Ltd [[1941] Ch .]
Furthermore, any right of set off is determined at the same time: Business
Computers Ltd versus Anglo African Leasing Ltd [[1977] 1 WLR 578.] The fact that the preferred creditors may not be able forthwith to be paid, whilst the receiver realises sufficient of the assets of the company in order to enable him to pay them is, in my view, immaterial.  
It appears to me to be unnecessary to embark upon any detailed consideration of whether the effect of the 1985 Act was to repeal <case>(g) so as to attract the provisions of <case> of the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) (WA) Code and consequently preserving, unless the contrary intention appears in the 1985 Act, any rights which the appellant had acquired or which had accrued, or any obligation incurred by the receivers. Whilst it is true that; in form, <case>(g) was repealed and a new provision was substituted, the new provision followed very closely the wording of the earlier provision, and was designed only to impose a limitation with respect to the preferred claims of "excepted" employees. In Mathieson v
Burton <case>; [(1971) 124 CLR 1] at 10, although he accepted that, in determining whether an enactment involves a repeal of earlier legislation, it is the substantial effect which it produces and not the linguistic method by which it produces it which is important: as to which see Beaumont versus Yeomans <case>; [(1934) 34 SR 562] per
Jordan CJ at 569, Windeyer J was of the view that "an amendment which permanently reduces the ambit of any of the provisions of an Act involves a repeal of it in part. That is because after the amendment the statute no longer operates as it formerly did: and the only way by which a statute which has come into operation can cease to operate is by repeal, express or implied; or by its expiry in the case of a temporary statute; or by something that was made a condition of its continued operation coming to an end. An Act that excludes from the operation of a former Act some matter formerly within its purview thus repeals it pro tanto, that is to say 'in part'." A somewhat different approach was adopted in the same case by Gibbs J, at 20-2, although he also referred to Ku-ring-gai Municipal Council versus Attorney General  <case>; [(1957) 99 CLR 251] at 265, in which it is indicated that a provision such as <case> applies as much to a repeal to make way for a substituted provision as to a simple repeal. However; as counsel for the respondents acknowledged, nothing turns upon this question in the present case, because there is, at common law, a general rule that a statute changing the law ought not, unless the intention appears with reasonable certainty, to be understood as applying to facts or events that have already occurred in such a way as to confer or impose or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law had defined by reference to the past events: per Dixon CJ in Maxwell versus Murphy <case>; [(1957) 96 CLR 261] at 267.  In Fisher versus Madden, a decision of the Court of Appeal of this
State, Meagher JA referred to Steinberg with apparent approval when dealing with and accepting the submission that in a receivership, and it would follow from his reasoning in a winding up, all claims and debts had to be listed and valued at the one date; and that rights to priority payments were just that, namely rights to take in priority to other creditors, coupled with an obligation by the liquidator to give effect to those rights. The decision of Sheller JA at least at page 191 was to the same effect.  After judgment here was reserved, and while I was considering these reasons, Senior Counsel for the plaintiff quite properly drew my attention to the Privy Council decision in Wight & Ors versus Eckhardt Marine GmBH <case> The essential facts of that case were that the respondent, Eckhardt Marine, had sold a tanker to a Bangladesh company for scrap. The purchasing company was to provide a letter of credit for the purchase price opened 10 days before the arrival of the vessel in Bangladesh and to provide a deposit of 10% by way of a guarantee if the letter of credit was not opened. The guarantee was provided by the Chittagong, Bangalesh branch of Bank of Credit Commerce
International (Overseas) Ltd (BCCI(O)) a bank incorporated in the Cayman
Islands. Notice of expected arrival was given on 5 July 1991, but on that day
BCCI(O) was closed down worldwide. The letter of credit was not opened. A call was made on the guarantee but no payment was made.  An order for the winding up BCCI(O) was made in the Cayman Islands on 14
January 1992 pursuant to a petition issued on 22 July 1991. The Government of
Bangladesh determined not to take part in a scheme proposed by the liquidators in the Cayman Islands which could have resulted in equal treatment of creditors. Instead it established a new bank, Eastern Bank Limited, under a legislative scheme pursuant to which all assets and liabilities of BCCI(O) in
Bangladesh were transferred to Eastern Bank and the liabilities of BCCI(O) in
Bangladesh became liabilities of Eastern Bank. Eckhardt lodged a proof of debt with the liquidators in the Cayman Islands. This was rejected on the basis that the claim had been assumed by the Eastern Bank. An appeal against the rejection of the proof of debt was dismissed on the ground that the proper law of the debt was Bangladesh, that that law had extinguished the cause of action against BCCI(O) and substituted a new claim against Eastern Bank so that no debt could be proved. The Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands allowed an appeal on the basis that the validity of the debt was governed by its situs, that the situs was arguably Bangladesh but upon the making of the winding up order the debt became a claim to participate in the distribution of assets in the Cayman Islands which became the situs of the claim which could not be affected by the Bangladesh scheme. On appeal to the Privy Council this decision was reversed.  After determining that by the law of Bangladesh the debt owing by BCCI(O) to Eckhardt was discharged their Lordships moved to consider the matters relevant here, namely the fact that the winding up order was made before the
Bangladesh scheme took effect. The argument was that Eckhardt had a debt due under the proper law (that of Bangalesh) at the date of winding up which could not be divested by a change in the proper law. As this is an important matter it is necessary to quote some paragraphs of the judgment of the Privy Council which was delivered by Lord Hoffmann commencing at paragraph 21: 
Central to both these arguments is the proposition that the right to share in a liquidation is a new right which comes into existence in substitution for the previous debt and is governed by the law of the place where the liquidation is taking place, rather in the way that obtaining a judgment merges the cause of action in the judgment and creates a new form of obligation, namely a judgment debt, governed by its own rules of enforceability. 
In support of this proposition, the Court of Appeal relied upon the principle that the winding up order deprives the company of the beneficial interest in its assets. The company becomes trustee of its assets for its creditors: Ayerst (inspector of Taxes) versus C & K (Construction) Ltd [[1976] AC 167.] In this respect winding up is certainly an epoch in the company's life, but their Lordships do not understand how this 'can affect the question of who counts as a creditor entitled to prove and receive a distribution under the statutory trusts. 
Mr Lowe, on the other hand, relied on the principle that the claims of creditors -are valued as at the date of the winding up order. As Selwyn LJ said in in re Humber Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co (1869) [LR 4 Ch App ], -647, the assets held on the statutory trusts should be distributed as if they had all been collected and distributed on the date of the winding up order:  "I think the tree must lie as it falls; that it must be ascertained what are the debts as they exist at* the date of the winding up, and that all dividends in the case of an insolvent estate must be declared in respect of the debts so ascertained." 
On this principle, no allowance is made for interest accruing after the date of the winding up order (the Humber Ironworks case) or subsequent exchange rate fluctuations which affect the sterling value of a debt in foreign currency (In re Dynamics Corporation of America [(1976) 1 WLR ];
In re Lines Bros Ltd [[1983] Ch 1].) 
So Mr Lowe submits that the question of whether Eckhardt was owed a debt must be ascertained at the date of the winding up. If, as is assumed to be the case, it was at that date entitled to payment under the law of Bangladesh, it cannot be deprived of its entitlement by subsequent events. 
This argument was skilfully deployed but their Lordships think that it is wrong. It is first necessary to remember that a winding up order is not the equivalent of a judgment against the company which converts the creditor's claim into something juridically different, like a judgment debt. Winding up is, as Brightman LJ said in In re Lines Bros Ltd [[1983] Ch 1], 20, "a process of collective enforcement of debts". The creditor who petitions for a winding up is  "not engaged in proceedings to establish the company's liability or the quantum of the liability (although liability and quantum may be put in issue) but to enforce the liability." 
The winding up leaves the debts of the creditors untouched. It only affects the way in which they can be enforced. When the order is made, ordinary proceedings against the company are stayed (although the stay can be enforced only against creditors subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court). The creditors are confined to a collective enforcement procedure that results in pari passu distribution of the company's assets. The winding up does not either create new substantive rights in the creditors or destroy the old ones. Their debts, if they are owing, remain debts throughout. They are discharged by the winding up only to the extent that they are paid out of dividends. But when the process of distribution is complete, there are no further assets against which they can be enforced. There is no equivalent of the discharge of a personal bankrupt which extinguishes his debts. When the company is dissolved, there is no longer an entity which the creditor can sue.
But even then, discovery of an asset can result in the company being restored for the process to continue. 
Secondly, as Oliver J explained in the Dynamics Corporation case (at p.
), the purpose of the rule that debts are valued at the date of winding up is to give effect to the principle of pari passu distribution it is a principle of fairness between creditors:  "It is only in this way that a rateable or pari passu distribution of available property can be achieved, and it is, as I see it, axiomatic that the claims of creditors amongst whom the division is to be effected must all be crystallised at the same date ..., for otherwise one is not comparing like with like." 
The image of collecting and uno flatu distributing the assets of the company on the day of the winding up order is a vivid one, but the courts apply it to give effect to the underlying purpose of fair distribution between creditors pari passu and not as a rigid rule. Section 136(a) of the
Companies Law (2002 Revision) provides that "the property of the company shall be applied in satisfaction of its liabilities pari passu ..." The principle of valuation at the date of winding up ensures that distribution among creditors is truly pari passu. It would, however, be pure conceptualism to apply it so as to require payment. of a dividend to someone who, at the time of the distribution, is not a creditor at all.  Their Lordships then gave illustrations of values of contingent claims when the contingent event occurred after commencement of the winding up but during it - the hindsight principle - as illustrated in In re Northern Counties of England Fire Insurance Co [(1880) 17 Ch D 337], and went on: 
These cases on the use of hindsight to value debts which were contingent at the date of the winding up order show that the scene does not freeze at the date of the winding up order. Adjustments are made to give effect to the underlying principle of pari passu distribution between creditors. Hindsight is used because it is not considered fair to a creditor to value a contingent debt at what it might have been worth at the date of the winding up order when one now knows that prescience would have shown it to be worth more. The same must be true of a contingent debt which prescience would have shown to be worth less. 
It therefore seems to their Lordships that the principle of pari passu distribution according to the values of debts at the date of winding up does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that someone who was a creditor at that date must be allowed to participate in the distribution even when he is no longer a creditor at all. There is nothing unfair, or contrary to principle, in a rule which requires that anyone who claims to participate in a distribution should have the status of a creditor at the time when he makes that claim. It would be strange if the court can have regard to subsequent events in valuing a creditor's contingent claim at much less than it would have been thought to be worth at the date of the order but not to the fact that someone has ceased to be a creditor at all. 
This view is supported by the statutory form of proof. The Companies Law (2002 revision) appears to be based upon the United Kingdom Companies Act 1948 and their Lordships will therefore refer to the form of proof prescribed by
Rule 94 and Form 59 of the Companies (Winding-up) Rules 1949 (SI 1949 No 33).
in the United Kingdom these have been replaced by Rule 4.77 and Form 4.26 of the insolvency Rules 1986 (SI 1986/1925) but there is no material difference.
In each case the creditor is required to swear that the company "on ... the date when the company went into liquidation was and still is justly and truly indebted to me ..." (Emphasis added). 
Their Lordships therefore consider that the winding up order had no effect upon Eckardt's debt, its situs or its proper law. Under the principle of universality, it was at the date of the order provable in the winding up notwithstanding that its lex situs and proper law were both the law of
Bangladesh. But they consider that the right to participate at any stage in the process of collective enforcement by liquidation depends upon being a creditor. So when the debt was discharged under its proper law, it ceased to provable in the Cayman Islands liquidation and was properly rejected. Their
Lordships will therefore humbly advise Her Majesty that the appeal should be allowed and the order of Murphy J restored. The respondent must pay the liquidators' costs in the Court of Appeal and before their Lordships' Board.  How does this bear upon Australian law. It can be accepted that a creditor at the commencement of winding up who ceases to be a creditor before a proof of debt is lodged, cannot prove. But that goes to status and entitlement to claim. Does it mean that s116(3) under the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) confers no rights or gives rise to no obligations which bring s8(c) of the [Acts
Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) to bear.
The two decisions to which I have referred are to the contrary. My duty as a trial judge is to follow the Australian decisions being decisions of either a
Full Court or Court of Appeal. This is not a question of whether or not a debt is due. The debt has not been extinguished. In the Privy Council case the debt due by the company in liquidation had been extinguished. There could be no question of whether or not the legislation was retrospective as its purpose was to operate retrospectively to extinguish one debt and to substitute another. That is what the decision held. It is not the winding up which creates the rights. It is the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) which creates the right, in the event of a winding up, to have priority given to certain debts and to require the liquidators to give effect to that priority.
As counsel for the liquidator said - I think quite correctly - an injunction would go against the liquidators to restrain a distribution contrary to s116(3) of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) when in force. That is the obligation, and the right, which I consider continue in accordance with the decisions which I have discussed. It follows from this that I conclude that priority creditors under s116(3) of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) are entitled to have their priority recognized by the liquidator in distribution of the Australian assets and I so find. I should add that the hindsight principle is relevant only to valuation of contingent debts and that in any event a careful reading of In Re Northern Counties of England shows that the revaluation came about because the provisions of the relevant
Companies Act in the United Kingdom at that time incorporated the provisions of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) which required notice to be taken of events occurring during the winding up - in that case the destruction by fire of the insured property.  
Are provable claims under policies TY165A for the 1998 underwriting year and FC3A for the 1997 and 1998 underwriting years liabilities in Australia of NRCA for the purposes of [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)?  Unless [s31(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html) is an exclusive definition claims under both policies would be liabilities in
Australia under the general law. Liability in respect of a chose in action is normally where the debtor resides. NRCA resides in Australia and only in
Australia. Unless there is some different law relating to liability under policies of insurance that is an end to the matter. Jabbour versus The
Custodian of Israeli Absentee Property [[1954] 1 WLR 139]; New
York Life Insurance Company versus The Public Trustee <case>; [(1965) 114 CLR 98] at 136, Windeyer J said that a debt made payable at the particular place may sometimes be regarded as being located at that place "but only it seems where the debtor has a place of residence there" referring to
Re Helbert Wagg & Co Limited [[1956] Ch 323.] Reliance was placed by counsel for the second defendant on the judgment of Jordan CJ in
Ex Parte Coote [(1949) 48 SR 179] at where the following passage appears: 
Thus, a simple contract debt is locally situated where the debtor resides, unless it is agreed to be paid in a particular place, in which case it may be locally situated at that place.  This referred back to an earlier decision of the then Chief Justice in
McCaughey versus Commissioner of Stamp Duties <case>; [(1945) 46 SR 192] at where the same passage appears interspersed with supporting authorities.
Although counsel for the second defendant relied on those authorities particularly In Re Russo - Asiatic Bank [[1934] Ch 720], none of them is contrary to Hague versus Hague which I should follow, nor to
Jabbour. Clarke J in Cambridge Credit Corporation Limited v
Lissenden [(1987) 8 NSWLR 411] referred to in the passage from Ex Parte Coote just set out. That was a case of multiple Lloyds Underwriters normally situated overseas with an insured with offices in many Australian States. Whatever problems arose there I consider it to be clear that the liability is situated where the defendant resides, at least where there is only one place of residence. I should add that the contracts in issue here do not provide for payment in a particular place, even though the Schedule B contract has an arbitration provision with the seat of arbitration being London. The fact that in most instances payment is made by the reinsurer to the facultative broker or to the introducing broker does not bear on the matter any more than would be the position if industry custom were for payment to the insured where the insured resided. Leaving aside various provisions for service out of the jurisdiction if a creditor wishes to enforce a liability it will usually be necessary to do so where the debtor resides. I think it clear that the words "may be locally situated at that place" as they appear in Coote and McCaughey only mean that can be the situation if the debtor has an office or business in that place.  There was an argument that Lissenden was applicable in the case of the Schedule B policy because there were multiple insurers. That was not the position. The contract with NCRA was for fifty percent of the risk reinsured.
Another company may have signed for the other fifty percent but if it did so then it was under a separate contract.  The next question is whether [s31(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html) is an exclusive definition of liabilities in Australia. In the long run, it was not argued by counsel for the first or second defendant that it was, although that argument was advanced for the third defendant and counsel for the second defendant said it was exclusive for insurance liabilities. The sub- section is not a definition section. Its effect is to extend the range of liabilities in Australia beyond those which would exist under the rules of
Private International Law.  
Are "liabilities in Australia" under s116(3) of the Old [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) limited to insurance liabilities?  The answer to this question is "No." First, [s116(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) refers to [s31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html) as having effect not [s31(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html)
Second, [s31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s31.html) as it appears in [Part
III](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/index.html#p3) of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) was relevant to the question of authority to carry on insurance business and to ensure that an authorised insurer was solvent. For that purpose all liabilities are taken into account. In the case of NRCA it seems that all creditors, whether insurance or not will therefore be treated equally as all liabilities will be situated in Australia. That of course would not have been the position had NRCA been a company with places of business other than in
Australia.  
Directions sought in relation to [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)  The matters so far dealt with provide the answers as to which of the declarations sought in respect of the [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) application should be made. These cover the directions under paragraph 1, 2 and 3 which overlap with the declarations numbered 1 to 3 sought in respect of [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) under the fourth amended originating process.  
Remaining [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) Directions  
Direction 4 - A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing funds representing the proceeds of collection or realization of assets situated outside of Australia on the basis that those proceeds are not to be regarded as assets in Australia for the purpose of [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) through having been transferred or remitted to Australia in ordinary course of administration.  This direction should be given. The [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) priority is not to be artificially obtained by transfer of funds from overseas into Australia. Assets in Australia must on any fair basis be assets in
Australia when the winding up commences subject to any further consideration when winding up follows an administration.  
Direction 4A. That the liquidator would be justified in distributing funds representing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that, where assets outside Australia were realised by the administrator of NCRA during the course of the voluntary administration of NCRA and the proceeds of realisation were deposited into bank accounts maintained by the administrator in Sydney prior to 16 September 1999, those proceeds have not become assets in Australia for the purposes of [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/).  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) refers to an insurance company which "is begun to be wound up". Under the
Corporations Law and the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) [ss513B(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s513b.html) and [513C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s513c.html) the winding up of NCRA is deemed to have begun on the day on which the administration began. While it does not decide the question the decision of
Santow J in Re NC Capital Limited <case>; [(1999) 32 ACSR 418] seems to proceed on the basis that the date of commencement of winding up under [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) is the date determined by the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). He did not have to decide that and I do not think it would be correct. The date of commencement of winding up was, in 1973, in the case of the court winding up, when the proceedings commenced and in the date of a voluntary winding up when the resolution was passed. However, the wording of [s116(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) which in 1973 was "commenced to be wound up" was altered in 1997 to "begun to be wound up" although on what basis that was thought to be better grammatically, I do not comprehend. Nevertheless I consider that for the purpose of [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) an insurer previously under administration is begun to be wound up when the relevant resolution of creditors is passed thereby bringing the administration to an end. As a company can carry on insurance business while under administration the prohibitions under [s116(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) can only apply when the creditors resolve on a winding up. The introductory words to [s116(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) namely, "begun to be wound up" cannot be anything different from "date of commencement of the winding up" in [s116(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html)
Fleet Motor & General Insurance Co (Australia) Pty Limited v
Tickle [1984] 2 ACLC 282 supports this conclusion. It follows that the direction should not be made.  
Direction No. 5. A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that any moneys recovered pursuant to the provisions of [Part 5.7B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.7b) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) are available to be distributed to creditors of NCRA without regard to [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/).  Such recoveries are not assets in Australia at the date of commencement of winding up as meant by [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/). If a successful claim is made by a liquidator then the proceeds of such claim will be paid to the company in accordance with the general scheme of s588FF. The claim is nevertheless a claim by a liquidator after commencement of the winding. It may bring into existence the funds in Australia available for distribution, but that does not make the claim an asset of the company at winding up. The rights of the liquidator to recover funds for the company are statutory rights and not proprietary rights in the company at the date of the commencement of the winding up: N A Kratzmann Pty Limited (in liquidation) v Tucker (No 2) <case>; [(1968) 123 CLR 295]; SJP Formwork (Aust) Pty Limited (in liq) versus Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation <case>; <case>; [(2003) 44 ACSR 727.]  
Direction No 6. A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that any interest earned on deposits of the proceeds of realisation of assets does not itself constitute an asset in Australia for the purposes of [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/)  For the same reason that assets brought into Australia after the commencement of the winding up are not to be treated as Australian assets for the purpose of [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) interest earned on such repatriated assets should be treated in the same way.
So far as interest is earned on the proceeds of the realization of assets in
Australia at the date of liquidation is concerned, the position is not so clear. The answer should be the same for any income producing asset or account. For instance a real estate investment property earning rent should be treated in the same way as a bank account earning interest. In In Re
Federal Building Assurance Co Limited <case>; [[1932] VLR 301], there was under consideration s448 of the [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1928107/) (Vic) which is the forerunner of s116(3). It seems to have been assumed in that case that interest on assets in Victoria was part of the Victorian assets in respect of which payment of liabilities in Victoria was to be made in priority to payment of other liabilities. That view also seems to have been accepted in Re
National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association Limited [(1995) 15
ACSR 624], though in neither case was interest earned after the date of the commencement of the winding up specifically referred to, but against that no payments in one case in respect of liabilities outside of Victoria or in the other liabilities outside Australia was allowed. It must be assumed that interest was earned on the Victorian or Australian assets at the commencement of the winding up which would lead to the conclusion that if Australian assets are in the first place to satisfy Australian liabilities then the fruit of those assets should also be available for that purpose. The direction should not be given. An amended direction could be given if sought.  
Direction No 7. A direction that the liquidator is not prevented by the provisions of [s 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) from charging against the fund representing the proceeds of collection or realisation of assets in Australia the costs and expenses of the winding up (including the remuneration of the liquidator).  
Direction No 7A. A direction that, to the extent the assets of NCRA the proceeds of which have been realised by the liquidator consist both of assets in Australia and other assets, the liquidator would be justified in allocating the burden of the expenses receiving priority under [s556(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) rateably between the proceeds of assets in Australia and the proceeds of other assets.  The question which arises under these directions is how should the costs of the winding up be borne. [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) must be approached on the basis that a liquidator is not expected to work for nothing. It follows that if an insurance company had all its assets in
Australia and all its liabilities in Australia and there was a deficiency the liquidator must be entitled to recover the costs and expenses of the liquidation out of the assets of the company prior to satisfying in part the liabilities in Australia. He is so entitled not because those expenses are a "liability in Australia" but on the authority of Re Universal Distributing
Co Ltd (In Liquidation) <case>; [(1933) 48 CLR 171.] A close reading of [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) indicates that applying Australian assets to the costs of the liquidator is not an application of assets to liabilities outside Australia.  So far as direction 7 is concerned there is no basis upon which the whole of the liquidator's expenses of the winding up should be borne by the assets in Australia. On the other hand there is no reason why those costs should be borne rateably by the assets in Australia and the assets outside Australia as suggested in 7A. The costs and expenses involved in one collection may be substantially more than the costs and expenses involved with another collection. I am of the view that it is a matter for the liquidator to charge the costs fairly against the two funds having regard to the work involved collecting the assets in Australia and the assets outside Australia and in paying the liabilities having regard to a fair apportionment and spread of the general costs of the winding up. Whether or not a rateable apportionment would be a proper apportionment is for the liquidator to determine in due course.
Neither of the directions sought should be made in the terms set out. However, as it seems that all creditors will claim in respect of liabilities in
Australia there is no point in formulating a different direction.  
Direction  (a) A direction that, following the distribution by the liquidator of the proceeds of realisation of all "assets in Australia" to creditors preferred under [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html), the liquidator would be justified in distributing the balance of the proceeds of realisation of assets by withholding any further dividend distribution to creditors preferred under [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) whilst the balance of the proceeds are distributed to all other creditors until they have received a dividend of equal proportion to that received by the preferred creditors out of the Australian assets, and then making a pari passu distribution of any remaining proceeds to all creditors.  
Alternatively:  (b) A direction that, following the distribution by the liquidator of the proceeds of realisation of all "assets in Australia" to creditors preferred under [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html), the liquidator would be justified in distributing the balance of the proceeds of realisation of assets by recalculating the value of the claims of creditors preferred under [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) by deducting the dividend received out of Australian asset proceeds, and then distributing the remaining proceeds pari passu to all creditors.  
Alternatively:  (c) A direction that, following the distribution by the liquidator of the proceeds of realisation of all "assets in Australia" to creditors preferred under [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html), the liquidator would be justified in distributing the balance of the proceeds of realisation of assets pari passu to all creditors ignoring the fact that certain creditors have already received a dividend out of Australian asset proceeds under [section 116(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html)  The questions here relate to the distribution of assets after distribution of assets in Australia to satisfy liabilities in Australia. The questions of course assume that the liabilities in Australia would not be satisfied out of the assets in Australia which at least in view of my decision on the meaning of liabilities in Australia, is the position. As it seems likely from my earlier determinations that all creditors will be treated equally in distribution of Australian assets, the question may be academic. However, in case the matter goes further it is probably desirable that I provide an answer.  This is a difficult question. A (c) distribution would appear to be the most unfair and the one most contrary to the proportionate distribution required by ss501 and 555 of the Corporations Law and [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). A (b) distribution would be the one most in accord with the position of secured creditors under [s554E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s554e.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). An (a) distribution accords most closely with ss501 and 555 of the Corporations Law and [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). For the purposes of this question [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) is not being taken into account.  [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) differs from ordinary priority in a winding up provided for by [s556](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Because the priorities under [s556](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html) are rated it is assumed either that the assets will be consumed at some step in paying the priority claims or some of them or that after such payments there will be a surplus available for rateable distribution. [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) secures Australian assets for payment of Australian liabilities but there is no reason to think that its effect is to place creditors entitled to the benefit of [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) in the same position as secured creditors under the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) let alone an even stronger position. Re Standard Insurance Company Limited [[1968] QdR 118] raised questions as to distributions in a winding up in
Queensland of a foreign company incorporated in New Zealand also being wound up in New Zealand. Under local Queensland law in such a case land in
Queensland was to be applied in the first instance to payment of debts contracted in Queensland in priority to other debts of the company. The case was one involving the giving of directions to the local liquidator but its effect was to hold that the Queensland creditors who received priority were not to be entitled to rank for any further dividend until all other creditors had received a dividend which would bring them up to a level of the dividend paid to the Queensland preferred creditors. This hotchpot type principle was applied following the cases of Banco de Portugal versus Waddell [(1880) 5
App Cas 161] and In Re Oriental Steam Co [(1874) LR 9 Ch App .] I consider that is the principle that should be applied to the distribution in this case. I do not consider that the decision in Re:
National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association Limited (in liq) contradicts this principle so far as a [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s116.html) priority is concerned. While it is usually stated that the hotchpot principle applies only in cases where winding up is proceeding in more than one jurisdiction the Standard Insurance case was determined on a somewhat wider basis and more recently in Cleaver versus Delta American Reinsurance
Co <case>; [[2001] 2 AC 328], the Privy Council in discussing the hotchpot authorities and whether they had a wider application, appears to have thought they might have a wider application by saying at page 340 the principles applies only to assets which under English Law are regarded as forming part of the estate in liquidations thereby coming to the control of a liquidator thus distinguishing them from assets subject to security.  [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) declarations and directions  The discussion on the directions sought will determine which declarations should be made.  
Direction No 10  (a) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in treating a contract of reinsurance as one to which the provisions of [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) are not applicable whenever the relevant contract or contracts of insurance insured under the contract of reinsurance are themselves contracts of reinsurance.  
Alternatively:  (b) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in treating a contract of reinsurance as one to which the provisions of [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) are applicable notwithstanding that the relevant contract or contracts of insurance insured under the contract of reinsurance are themselves contracts of reinsurance.  The answer to this direction will also determine whether the declaration in paragraph 12 of the fourth amended originating process should be made.
[Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (or
Corporations Law) is set out in paragraph 15 of this judgment. The section was introduced as a result of the Harmer Report and the recognition that the direct matching provisions of [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) as in place prior to 1992 were not satisfactory for contracts of reinsurance.
It had been held that a contract of insurance under [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) in its pre-1992 form and as it existed in earlier manifestations of the
Companies Acts included a contract of reinsurance. Re Dominion Insurance
Co of Australia Limited [[1980] 1 NSWLR 271];
Saltergate Insurance Co Limited (No. 2) <case>; [[1986] VR 439.]  I think it is clear that a contract of reinsurance extends to reinsurance of a contract of reinsurance. While such a contract may be referred to from time to time and often as a retrocession that is not enough to decide that in the absence of an express statement that a contract of reinsurance extends to a retrocession agreement that [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) does not apply. The evidence of Mr Girvan is that retrocession is just a name for an outwards reinsurance contract.  The next question is whether a relevant contract of insurance in [s562A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) extends to or includes a contract of reinsurance, a relevant contract of insurance being defined in [s562A(8).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) assumes that a contract of insurance would embrace a contract of reinsurance if it were not excluded. "Relevant contract of insurance" is not expressed to exclude a contract of reinsurance and as in general and as the evidence shows a reinsurance contract is regarded as a contract of insurance I consider that [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) applies to a contract of reinsurance of a contract of reinsurance. Counsel for the plaintiff in his helpful argument referred to the decision of the House of
Lords in Agnew versus Lansforsakringsbolagens AB <case>; [[2001] 1 AC ]
where it was held that the term "insurance" in [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s3.html) of the Lugano Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1988, which was incorporated into English law for certain purposes, did not include reinsurance, which is of interest as questions relating to jurisdiction matters seem often to be decided on the basis that courts generally wish to assume jurisdiction to themselves. In any event it was said in that case it was a question of construction of the relevant legislation in that case having regard to its intended and stated purpose. I consider that when [ss562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) and [562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) are read together then contract of insurance as it applies under [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) can include a contract of reinsurance.  
Direction 11 - A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is applicable to reinsurance recoveries under all reinsurance contracts whether facultative reinsurance contracts, treaty reinsurance contracts or any other kind of reinsurance contract.  The direction should be given. If the section referred purely to facultative reinsurance then there would have been less reason for the amendment to [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) and the inclusion of [s562A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html)
There was no real argument against this and I think the answer is clear. The policy in Schedule A is treaty reinsurance and the policy in Schedule B a facultative reinsurance contract. There is nothing in the section to suggest that it applies to one and not to the other, or that it does not apply to quota share contract, all of which on the evidence are included in the meaning of contract of reinsurance.  
Direction 12.  (a) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) confers an entitlement in respect of a reinsurance recovery on those Insurance Creditors whose claims against NCRA have actually produced that reinsurance recovery for NCRA and only in respect of that specific reinsurance recovery.  
Alternatively:  (b) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) confers equal entitlement on all Insurance Creditors whose claims against NCRA have actually produced a reinsurance recovery for NCRA with the result that those Insurance Creditors share in all such reinsurance recoveries.  
Alternatively:  (c) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) confers equal priority on all creditors whose claims arise as an insured or reinsured under a contract of insurance ("Insurance Creditors"), regardless of whether their claim against NCRA has produced a reinsurance recovery by NCRA, with the result that all Insurance Creditors will share in all reinsurance recoveries  These three alternatives have been described as narrow matching, narrow pooling and broad pooling.  The section was introduced as a result of the Harmer Report but not in accordance with it. That Report recognized that the direct matching provisions of [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) as in force prior to 1992 were not satisfactory for contracts of reinsurance, which as I have said have been held to be contracts of insurance under [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) in its pre-1992 form and in the earlier manifestations under the Code and earlier Companies Acts.  Narrow matching can be set aside. Apart from anything else if that were the proper interpretation there would be no need for the amendment to [s562](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html) nor for [s562A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html)
The contending constructions are therefore narrow pooling or broad pooling and the answer is not necessarily clear. Without reference to authority I would consider that [s562A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) creates a fund, namely the proceeds of a reinsurance policy giving cover against liability to pay under a contract or under contracts of insurances entered into before the commencement of the winding up; and then when [s562A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) does not apply, [s562A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) provides that the persons entitled to share in that fund in the specified proportions are all persons to whom an amount is payable by NCRA under a policy of insurance entered into before the commencement of the winding up.
Leaving aside retrocession for the moment, that means that if insurer A is liable to insured persons B, C and D under policies of insurance and that liability or part of it has been reinsured with reinsurer E and reinsurance payments are received then not only would B, C and D be entitled to share in those reinsurance payments paid to A by E under the contract of reinsurance but that all persons insured under original insurances issued by A would be entitled to share in the reinsurance recoveries. The same situation will apply to insurers reinsured with NCRA where NCRA has itself reinsured its liability under its original policy of reinsurance. This interpretation comes, I think, from a consistent application of [s562A(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) to the defined expression where it appears in [s556(2)A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html)  The Harmer Report dealt with this subject at paragraphs 762 to 764 as follows: 
Proposal in DP 32. The Commission sought views on whether there should be no change to s447 in its application to insurance company liquidations. The
Commission received a lengthy and most detailed joint submission from a large group of reinsurers arguing that s447 should not apply to reinsurers. The submission pointed out that when the English equivalent of s447 was first enacted, contracts of reinsurance were specifically excluded. This is still the position in England. However, when the Companies Act 1936 which was said to be based on the English legislation was enacted, the provision excluding reinsurance did not appear. The principal argument put forward in the submission for excluding reinsurance from the operation of s447 is that reinsurance arrangements are fundamentally different from insurance polices.
While individual policies of insurance may be specifically reinsured where there is a large or unsecured risks it is much more common for reinsurance to cover classes of policies with the reinsurer agreeing, for example to pay a proportion of the risk or all claims exceeding a specified amount. Not all primary insurance policies will be covered by reinsurance. The decision to reinsure will depend on the overall portfolio of risks of an insurance company. When s447 is applied to the winding up of an insolvent insurance company it allows insureds whose policies are covered by some form of reinsurance to obtain a special priority, whereas those with policies not so covered will rank with other unsecured creditors. The submission suggests that the Dominion Case has created uncertainty among liquidators and reinsurers which has led to the need for court directions, legal costs and additional expenditure on the part of liquidators and reinsurers. The submission further argues that the application of s447 in this way is contrary to the fundamental principle of equal distribution and that no valid reasons have been advanced to justify departure from that principle. 
The Commission's view. The Commission agrees that contracts of reinsurance are for the most part fundamentally different from contracts of insurance and that the application of s447 to reinsurance contracts may lead to inequities. It appears unfair to allow an insured a special priority if the particular insurance policy is backed in some way by reinsurance whereas an insured with a policy not backed by reinsurance ranks with other unsecured creditors. There may however be situations where reinsurance is specifically taken out at the request of an insured even though this may not be a condition of the insurance contract. In such situations it is appropriate for the insured to get the benefit of the application of s447. Generally, however, the
Commission is of the view that s447 should not apply to contracts of reinsurance. 
Recommendation. The Commission recommends that, unless the court orders otherwise, s447 should not apply to a contract of reinsurance. The matters that the court should take into account in deciding whether to make an order include the circumstances under which the contract of reinsurance was entered into, including any contract arrangement or understanding between the insured and the company that the company reinsure the risk and any prejudice likely to be suffered by the insured if an order is not made.  The explanatory paper which accompanied the public exposure draft of the
Corporation Law Reform Bill, in commenting on the proposed s562A - which was in the form of the section as enacted - paragraphs 1093 to 1097 said the following: 
Clause H562 amends subsection 562(1) of the Corporations Law by inserting after the word 'insurance' the expression '(not being a contract of reinsurance)'. The amendment clarifies the existing law so that section 562 does not apply to contracts of insurance. Instead, specific provision is made for contracts of reinsurance under proposed section 562A. 
Section 562 of the Corporations Law presently provides that where a company has entered an insurance contract before the relevant date to provide against liability to third parties, and such liabilities are incurred by the company, the benefit of the insurance contract will be paid to the third party rather than to the creditors of the company as a whole. Section 562 also provides that this provision does not limit the rights of the third party in respect of any shortfall between the amount paid under the insurance premium and the liability of the company to the third party. 
The Harmer Report identified a number of difficulties which arise in relation to the application of section 562 to contracts of reinsurance.
Reinsurance is the process whereby an insurer transfers all or part of its risk to another insurer. The Report noted that a contract of insurance under section 562 has been held to include a contract of reinsurance (Re
Dominion Insurance Company Australia Ltd [[1980] 1 NSWLR 271]; Re
Palmdale Insurance Limited (No.3) <case>; [[1986] VR 439).] The Harmer Report noted that the inclusion of contracts of reinsurance under section 562 may lead to problems if the company being wound up is an insurance company. The Report listed the difficulties as:  * identifying third party claimants who are entitled to the benefit of reinsurance;  where third parties are both creditors and debtors, the applicability of the law of set-off in relation to the proceeds of an insurance policy;  * the possibility that surplus money will result from the failure of the third parties to lodge claims which were reinsured; and  * the inequity of only those persons whose contracts of insurance are backed by reinsurance being able to benefit. 
The Report also noted that reinsurance should be viewed as no more than the means adopted by an insurer to satisfy itself that it can pay claims which might be made under all policies which it has issued irrespective of whether it has reinsured its risk under each of these policies. 
The Harmer Report recommended that, unless a court orders otherwise, section 562 should not apply to a contract of reinsurance. The Report also recommended that the court should take into account, in deciding whether to make an order, the circumstances under which the contract of reinsurance was entered into, including any contract, arrangement or understanding between the insured and the company that the company would reinsure the risk, and any prejudice likely to be suffered by the insured if the order is not made.  The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Corporate Law Reform Bill was in the same terms so far as it relates to this subject. Thus although the
Harmer recommendation was not followed in full, as it recommended that in the absence of special order, there should be no priority claims to proceeds of reinsurance policies so that those proceeds would be available for distribution to all creditors, Parliament decided otherwise and retained priority for insurance creditors. It is not at all clear that paragraph 1096 of the explanatory paper covering this matter, and noted in the Report at paragraph 947 of the explanatory memorandum, is an accurate reflection of the
Harmer Report as those paragraphs relate to insurance creditor claims rather than total creditor claims. Nevertheless the explanatory memorandum and the stated paragraphs do point towards a legislative intention that all policy holders should share in the reinsurance proceeds. When one considers excess of loss or treaty policies of reinsurance that is the most sensible construction, there being no reason why claims first made but unpaid should be in a worse position than later claims triggering a reinsurance recovery.  I turn now to consider two cases. In 35 versus The Douglas Group Pty
Limited [(2000) ACSR 398], Young J considered the effect of s562A. In that case on the facts the only funds of the insolvent insurer were likely to be the proceeds of reinsurance and the liability reinsured was liability to pay over $350,000 in respect of any particular claim. His Honour on the question of declaratory relief had to decide whether the reinsurance payments received by the liquidator:  form a pool of funds for the benefit of all insurance creditors of CEASA, irrespective of whether or not their claims against CEASA exceed $350,000;  form a pool of funds for the benefit of only those insurance creditors of
CEASA whose claims exceed $350,000;  should be distributed only to the particular insurance creditor of CEASA whose claim exceeds $350,000 and in respect of which claim the liquidator has received a reinsurance payment; or  form a separate pool of funds in respect of each policy year for the benefit of only those insurance creditors of CEASA whose claims exceed $350,000 and were notified within that policy year.  None of the counsel appearing argued for (a) and it was not discussed which was a pity as it is supported by the liquidator and the second defendant. His
Honour rejected the narrow matching interpretation under (c) so the contest was between (b) and (d). In that case the liquidator was supporting (b) and was represented by Mr Gleeson. Mr Gee QC appeared for a class creditors who had been supporting (d), drawing attention to the fact that insurance policies were usually annual policies. Young J said at page 405, paragraph 31: 
The choice must therefore be between Mr Gleeson's submissions and Mr Gee
QC's. Of the two, I prefer Mr Gee QC's. This is because Mr Gee QC's submissions take into account that with reinsurance, one is looking at an annual contract and that to just average claims over every insurance year where the policies of reinsurance may be on different terms seems to me to produce an arbitrary result just for the sake of simplicity. To my mind, the intent of the section is that "reinsurance payment" in subs (3) means a reinsurance payment for a particular claims year and what one does is to work out the net payments received from reinsurers in a particular year, and that each claimant in that year gets the fraction of that money as set out in subs .  In Pace Tasmania Pty Ltd (in liquidation) versus FAI General Insurance
Company Ltd (Prov Liq Apptd) <case>,
Cox CJ dealt with an interlocutory application for discovery of policies of reinsurance a question arising whether their existence could bear upon the applicant's rights. At paragraph 6 he said:  ... S562A was inserted into the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (previously
Corporations Law) in 1992 and provides (subject to subs(4)) that where a company is insured under a contract of re-insurance against liability to pay amounts in respect of a relevant contract or contracts of insurance and money is received in respect of liability by the company or the liquidator under the contract of re-insurance, the proceeds are payable rateably to those entitled under the relevant contract or contracts of insurance. Subs(4) provides that the Court may order otherwise where it is considered just and equitable in the circumstances. Mr Tree argues that the effect of [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) is, subject to subs(4) thereof, to create a pool of re-insurance moneys from which all claimants under insurance policies may share whether or not the re- insurance arrangement directly affects their particular policy of insurance.
This, he submits, was the purpose of the amendment as agitation for law reform had suggested that subject to the matters addressed in subs(4) there was no just reason why some policy holders should have the benefit of re-insurance while others did not and the explanatory memorandum issued at the time the amendment was debated seems to contain an acknowledgment of that being the purpose. Nevertheless, the wording of the section is not free from ambiguity and indeed suggest to me that the funds are to be payable to holders of insurance policies which are the subject of re-insurance contracts, they being the "relevant contracts of insurance" for the purposes of [s562A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html)
In Butterell versus The Douglas Group Pty Ltd & Ors <case>; [(2000) 35 ACSR 398], Young J rejected the contention that the re-insurance moneys available in that case were to be divided between all creditors under insurance policies effected with the debtor company irrespective of whether or not the re-insurance arrangement affected them and made a declaration that the re-insurance pool was for a limited class of insured. When I say he rejected the contention, I should add that none of the parties before him put that contention to him, nor had any interest to do so and he merely observed that:  "This possibility has been considered by all the learned counsel involved and none of them support it. Accordingly, I can just put this to one side and in due course I will ante question 1(a) `No"' (at 402).  
This would indicate a leaning towards narrow matching or narrow pooling but cannot be determinative of the question here.  My conclusion is that [s562A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) determines the existence of a fund and that [s562A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) and (3) determine the claimants on the fund. If the claimants were to be restricted to narrow pooling claimants then the obvious way to have achieved this would have been to put the word "such" before the words "relative contract of insurance" instead of the indefinite article "a". I consider that the inclusion of [s562A(5)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) supports this conclusion. I have considered carefully the decision in
Butterell. The evidence is that while policies of reinsurance are annual contracts their periods do not necessarily co-incide with insurance years under the policies reinsured. The decision I favour makes calculation relatively easy - a decision based on annual risks and recoveries make it very difficult if not impossible. However, as Young J pointed out simplicity does not determine construction. Broad pooling was not argued before him but was argued on behalf of the first defendant before me. I consider it is the correct method. The 8(c) direction should be given, but it should be in a form making it subject to any order under [s562A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html)  
Direction 13.  (a) A direction that, in circumstances where the claim of NCRA under a contract of reinsurance has been satisfied in whole or in part by a set-off against other sums owing to the reinsurer by NCRA, the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that, for the purposes of [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), the amount of NCRA's claim satisfied by the set-off does not constitute an amount received under a contract of reinsurance.  
Alternatively:  (b) A direction that, in circumstances where the claim of NCRA under a contract of reinsurance has been satisfied in whole or in part by a set-off against other sums owing to the reinsurer by NCRA, the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that, for the purposes of [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), the amount of NCRA's claim satisfied by the set-off constitutes an amount received under a contract of reinsurance.  The answer comes from [s562A(1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html)
If no amount is received [s562A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) has no application. It does not concern notional receipts. In such a case [s553C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s553c.html) applies. The sum due from one party is to be set off against any sum due from the other party and the balance, if any, is payable to the insolvent company.
The amount of the set off is not received as it is not payable. Amounts subject to set off do not comprise part of the fund established pursuant to [s562(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html)
Direction 13(a) should be given.  
Direction 14.  (a) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that a claim under an inwards reinsurance contract which has not been (and will not be) the subject of any proof of debt in the liquidation nevertheless constitutes an amount payable under a relevant contract of insurance and should be included in the "total amount owed" for the purposes of application of the formula in [subsection 562A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html), with the result that the proportion of the reinsurance recoveries attributable to such claims and therefore not distributed pursuant to [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) will be available for distribution to creditors generally.  
Alternatively:  (b) A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that a claim under an inwards reinsurance contract which has not been (and will not be) the subject of any proof of debt in the liquidation does not constitute an amount payable under a relevant contract of insurance and should not be included in the "total amount owed" for the purposes of application of the formula in [subsection 562A(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html)  [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) is included in Division 6 of Part 5.6 of the Act. Division 6 is headed "Proof and ranking of claims". Only claims and debts the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the commencement of the winding up are admissible to proof. Section 553(1) and the set off provisions under s553C limit claims to the balance of account as admissible to proof. In addition s554 sets out the general rule that the amount of the debt or claim admissible to proof is to be computed as at the date of commencement of winding up.  It is against these provisions that the general rule as to proportionate payment, s555 - subject to the specific provisions for priority payments - must be considered. As I have said if no amount is payable under a policy at the relevant date then no claim can be admitted to proof under that policy. It follows of course that "a particular amount owed" is restricted as the definition makes clear as to amounts payable under a relevant policy. In the same way "total amount owed" should relate to amounts payable under relevant contracts which amounts can be the subject of a proof of debt.  It is to the advantage of the unsecured creditors to have "total amount owed" construed so as to include as much as possible because then the fractional shares which the liquidator is bound to pay under s562A(3) will not exhaust the fund to which s562A(1)(b) is directed. It might be thought it was fairer to construe "total amount owed" as widely as possible. For instance one person insured under a reinsurance policy, itself subject to reinsurance, may have the liability to him under the first policy secured by letter of credit.
If the letter of credit is called upon to satisfy the claim under the policy then presumably the assets of the first reinsurer provided as security to the letter of credit provider will themselves be used to satisfy that security thereby diminishing the general funds of the first reinsurer. If the amount payable under the first policy is not included under "total amount owed" the general creditors would suffer and the insurance creditors would, on one basis, gain a windfall. As against this the policy behind s562A appears to be to secure reinsurance recoveries for insurance creditors. With considerable hesitation I will decide this question accordingly. "Total amount owed" under the definition means total of all amounts payable, which seems to me to mean total of the amounts which can be subject to proof. Amounts reduced by set off, payment out of other security or by prior payment cannot be included in "total amount owed".  
Direction 15 - A direction that, following the distribution by the liquidator of the proceeds of realisation of reinsurance recoveries to creditors preferred under section 562A, the liquidator would be justified in distributing the balance of the proceeds of realisation of assets (including any proceeds of reinsurance recoveries not required to be distributed pursuant to the provisions of section 562A):  by withholding any further dividend distribution to creditors preferred under section 562A whilst the balance of the proceeds are distributed to all other creditors until they have received a dividend of equal proportion to that received by the preferred creditors out of reinsurance recoveries, and then making a pari passu distribution of any remaining proceeds to all creditors.  
Alternatively:  by recalculating the value of the claims of creditors preferred under section 562A by deducting the dividend received out of reinsurance recoveries, and then distributing the remaining proceeds pari passu to all creditors.  
Alternatively:  pari passu to all creditors ignoring the fact that certain creditors have already received a dividend out of reinsurance recoveries under section 562A.  This question is somewhat similar to that raised by direction 8, but of course concerns priority given under a different Act and there is a significant difference brought about by s562A(6). Whatever that sub-section does it makes it perfectly clear that the priority payment under s562A is not the only payment to which a preferred insurance creditor is entitled. As the receipt of a priority payment does not affect the rights of the person in respect of the balance of that person's claim under the policy of insurance I think it clear that it is the amount of the balance to which attention must be given. In those circumstances the third alternative can be put to one side. As a priority creditor is entitled to prove for the balance of the claim, there does not seem to be any reason why in respect of that balance it should not be treated proportionately with all other creditors in accordance with s555 of the Act. In other words it would be treated in a conceptually similar way to a secured creditor under s554E, although if that were intended it could have been said. There is no need to give any attention to the decision to which I came under [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/). So far as this question is concerned it is to be determined entirely within the provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or
Corporations Law. I point out that a similar provision to [s562A(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) is in [s562(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562.html)
It is fair to say that nothing is clear about these sections but I consider that the best construction is that the priority insurance creditor is allowed to prove for the balance not satisfied by the priority and in respect of that balance to be treated proportionately with all other non-priority creditors.  
Direction 15A - A direction that, in circumstances where a creditor's claim in the winding up of NCRA is composed of two or more claims at least one of which is an insurance claim which is entitled to participate in a distribution under [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the proceeds of a reinsurance recovery, and that creditor's claim has been partially satisfied by a set-off against other sums owing by the creditor to NCRA (and those sums do not consist of unpaid premiums directly applicable to one or more insurance claims), the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that the set-off has operated to reduce each of the various claims constituting the creditor's total claim by an equal proportion.  The only equitable way to proceed would be to distribute the set off proportionately between the priority and non-priority claims or amounts. That was the conclusion reached by Walton J in Re Unit 2 Windows [[1985] 1
WLR 1383], where he gave careful consideration to the question as he was not following a dictum of Buckley J in In re E J Morel (1934)
Limited [[1962] 1 Ch 21.] I agree with the decision with Walton J and with respect, his reasons. It follows that the direction should be given.  
Direction 17 - A direction that the liquidator would be justified in distributing the proceeds of assets realised in the liquidation on the basis that, where the application of [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) would require the proceeds to be distributed in a way different to that which would be required pursuant to [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/):  the provisions of [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) prevail;  the provisions of [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) prevail.  As I said earlier I consider that the rights of the parties here and creditors generally must be determined in accordance with the law in force at the commencement of the winding up. On the date in question were in force the
Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) and the
Corporations Law. To the extent to which s562A of the Corporations Law conflicts with [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/), the latter, being a provision in a Commonwealth Act, prevails. It is, I think, likely and almost certain that no one gave the slightest thought to the conflict between the provisions, so one should not think that the legislative intent can be found. However, it must be borne in mind that s562 had in the same general terms been included in corporations legislation for many years and as it had been held that under those provisions insurance included reinsurance, there was no particular reason for the problems springing to attention at the time the Corporations Law Reform Act was enacted.  If I am right in my conclusion as to the relevant law then the direction in (b) should be made but not so as to prevent s562A from having any operation.
In other words liabilities in Australia are to satisfied out of assets in
Australia in priority to all other claims. The only difficult question is whether or not insurance liabilities in Australia, being claims to which [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or
Corporations Law apply, should be paid in priority to other liabilities in
Australia or whether they should be paid pro rata if there is a deficiency.
While counsel, who was given leave to appear for APRA, submitted that the [s562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) creditors should have priority over other persons claiming under liabilities in Australia, I do not think that is correct. Once it is determined that "liabilities in Australia" extends to all liabilities and not only insurance liabilities as I have found to be the position under the construction of s31 of the Old [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/), then it would seem to me to be acting in defiance of that finding to give the s562A creditors a special claim over the assets in Australia. I therefore consider that the order of priority is as follows. 
Liabilities in Australia are to be satisfied out of assets in Australia if necessary pro rata. 
Section 562A priorities are to be satisfied insofar as they have not been satisfied under item 1 out of any balance of assets in Australia and any other assets. 
Thereafter payments are to be made in accordance with [s555](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s555.html) and s[556](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s556.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).  
Direction 18. In the event that a direction is made to the effect that the provisions of [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) prevail over the provisions of [section 562A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), a direction that, in circumstances where a reinsurance recovery has been received in respect of several liabilities under contracts of insurance, some of which are liabilities in Australia and some of which are not, the liquidator would be justified in calculating the amounts payable pursuant to [subsection 562A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) in respect of all such claims, whether or not they are liabilities in Australia, notwithstanding that by reason of [section 116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) of the [Insurance Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/) he may not be able to make payments in respect of those claims which are not liabilities in Australia.  As it is apparent that all contracts of reinsurance issued by NCRA will give rise to liabilities in Australia, there is no need to consider this question.  
Law Reform  There is an urgent need for amending legislation to make clear the intentions so that the problems dealt with in this judgment do not arise again.  
Declarations and orders  The parties and particularly the liquidator should consider these reasons and bring in draft declarations and directions to give effect to them. Some of the directions sought may need to be reworded in light of my reasons. The costs of all parties should be paid out of the assets of the company. While I will consider any argument to the contrary at the time of making final orders, my view at this stage is that the costs should be paid out of assets not subject to [s116(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ia1973116/s116.html) or s562A priority claims.
