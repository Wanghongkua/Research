JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex-parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application under [section 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 15 July 2015. In that affidavit Mr Spark swears to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities as defined in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the Act, namely taking part in the manufacture or production of a prohibited drug, being MDMA, contrary to [s 24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s24.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) , and supply of a prohibited drug, being MDMA, contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of that Act. Both of those offences are serious criminal offences as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Mr Spark's suspicion is held on the basis of information contained in a facts sheet obtained by him from the investigating officer. Mr Spark deposes to the fact that he forwarded an email to that officer asking him if he drafted the facts sheet, if to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief the contents of the facts sheet were true, and if the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. The officer answered in the affirmative to all of those questions.
Having read the material contained in the facts sheet I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion of the Defendant engaging in serious crime related activity is held on reasonable grounds.
I am also satisfied pursuant to [s 10A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property sought to be restrained is in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. Mr Spark gives evidence, based on his long experience in his position, of the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred. In those circumstances I do not consider it is necessary or appropriate that notice should be given to the Defendant before this order is made. In any event, the Defendant has the rights accorded to him for review under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act.
I note also that the Plaintiff claims an order under [s 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) of the Act varying the interests in the property to which the restraining order relates. Such order is sought to permit the Defendant to sell the property but nevertheless for the net proceeds of sale after payment of the various amounts specified in paragraph 3 of the summons to be restrained.
I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given. Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 6, 8, 10 and 11 of the draft order. I grant the leave in paragraph 7 and the liberty in paragraph 9 of that order.
