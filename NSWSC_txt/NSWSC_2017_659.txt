JUDGMENT
These proceedings concern a residential property at Connells Point, a suburb of Sydney.
The property was purchased in September 1987 in the names of the plaintiff, Herbert Zetting, and his mother, Aloisia Muller, as joint tenants.
Ms Muller was born in Austria in September 1923. The plaintiff was born in Austria in April 1946 and was brought up there. He migrated to Australia in September 1965. Ms Muller continued to live in Austria.
The proceedings were commenced by Mr Zetting against Ms Muller in 2015. Ms Muller died in July 2016. In evidence is what purports to be her last will and testament (in German, with a translation), made at Graz in Austria in September 2009. Under that will, she left her share in the Connells Point property to her grandson, Dr Karlheinz Morre. Dr Morre was also identified as her "heir". It is said that "probate" has not been granted, but there is no evidence as to whether there is an Austrian equivalent of our probate procedure. On the evidence, Ms Muller's estate is in fact being administered by a firm of notaries. The administration is not complete.
As a result of Ms Muller's death, Dr Morre has applied to be joined as the defendant in these proceedings pursuant to [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , r 7.10(2)(b). I am satisfied in the circumstances that this order (to which the plaintiff consents) is appropriate.
Mr Zetting's case in the proceedings is that he alone is the beneficial owner of the Connells Point property. He seeks a declaration that Ms Muller held her interest on trust for him and an order vesting the property in him. Initially this was opposed but the proceedings have been settled and the orders sought by the plaintiff have now been consented to. However, as a declaration is sought, the matter has been referred to me.
The evidence on the application establishes that the property was purchased in the joint names of Mr Zetting and Ms Muller because it was contemplated that Ms Muller might come to live in Australia and it was perceived that it would assist her immigration application if she had property in her name. Ms Muller did indeed visit Australia on a number of occasions, staying for two to three months on each occasion, but in fact she never did emigrate from Austria.
Most of the purchase price was provided by Mr Zetting from his own resources. The balance was provided by way of mortgage finance from the ANZ Bank. The mortgage was signed by both Mr Zetting and Ms Muller (as was necessary because they were joint owners of the property) but Mr Zetting alone was the borrower under the loan facility, and he alone was liable to repay the principal and interest on the loan (as he in fact later did).
In these circumstances, there is a presumption that Ms Muller's interest in the property was acquired by way of resulting trust for Mr Zetting, unless there is evidence to rebut that presumption: Calverley versus Green <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR 242] at 246.
Whether a resulting trust is established depends upon the circumstances which existed at the time of the acquisition of the property in question. The evidence of the parties' subsequent conduct is not relevant to the question of whether the property was acquired on a resulting trust basis. It may, however, be relevant to the question of whether some sort of equitable interest in the property has subsequently been created. In the present case, the evidence establishes that Mr Zetting paid all of the financing costs for the property and all of the outgoings on the property (even when Ms Muller was living there during her visits to Australia).
Although the evidence supports the conclusion that Ms Muller held her interest in the property as trustee for Mr Zetting under a resulting trust, the question arises as to whether I should make a declaration to this effect in circumstances where there is now no active opposition to my taking of that course.
It is frequently said that a declaration should not be made by consent. More precisely, in Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank versus British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [[1921] 2 AC 438], the Full Federal Court had to consider whether it was open to the Court to make a declaration of contravention of the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth) in circumstances where the defendant did not oppose that course. The Court held at [30] that the requirement of a proper contradictor was satisfied. This was because when the proceedings had been commenced the defendant had an interest in resisting the relief sought by the ACCC, including the declaratory relief. By the end of the case, the defendant had dropped its opposition to the declaratory relief sought by the ACCC, but this was a matter which went to discretion, not jurisdiction.
So it is in this case. When the proceedings were commenced, Ms Muller was the proper contradictor. The fact that the proceedings have now been settled and the legal representatives for her estate do not wish to resist the plaintiff's claim any further does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to make a declaration if the circumstances are otherwise appropriate.
In my view, the declaration should be made. The evidence presented in support of the claim for a declaration is persuasive. The fact that the defendant has chosen ultimately not to contest the plaintiff's claim makes it even easier to accept. The making of a declaration is a convenient way (indeed, so far as I can see, the only way) in which to resolve the issues put in suit by Mr Zetting's claim.
Accordingly, I propose to make the declaration sought. The convenient method of giving effect to it is through a vesting order under the [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) , [s 71.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s71.html) In my opinion, such an order may be supported on the basis that the trustee, Ms Muller, lived in Austria [(s 71(2)(f))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s71.html); or on the basis that it is uncertain whether she currently has a legal personal representative under Austrian law with respect to the property [(s 71(2)(l)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s71.html) In any event, it seems to me to be expedient in the circumstances of the case to make a vesting order to give effect to the declaration [(s 71(2)(o)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s71.html)
Accordingly, the Court makes the following orders:
Pursuant to UCPR r 7.10(2)(b) Karlheinz Morre be appointed to represent the estate of the deceased defendant, and be joined to the proceedings as defendant in substitution for Aloisia Muller.
Declare that the deceased held her interest in the property at 40 Duggan
Crescent, Connells Point, Lot 33 in Deposited Plan 238406, on trust for the plaintiff.
Order pursuant to the [Trustee Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) , [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s71.html) that the interest of the deceased held in the property vest in the plaintiff forthwith.
No order as to costs.
Note the undertaking by the defendant and the defendant's legal representative to execute all necessary documents and do all things required in order to give effect to order 3 above.
