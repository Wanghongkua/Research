ORDER
Appeal dismissed with costs
JUDGE1
KIRBY P: I am prepared to approach the matter on the basis that the appellants have an appeal to this Court as of right. Equally clearly, they should have the time for filing their appeal extended, if that be necessary.
It was accepted for the appellant that failure by them to succeed on both points argued would require dismissal of the appeal.
It is enough for me to confine my opinion to the question whether the respondent's discharge by his composition with his creditors in November 1984 also secured a discharge of the possible claims for contribution which the appellants had against him.
Cole JA has collected the opinions of the Judges of the Federal Court which stand against the proposition advanced for the appellants. I concede, as
Powell JA has demonstrated, that those opinions are not holdings in the cases in which they appear.
They are obiter dicta. But they are nonetheless considered judicial opinions. Even if I disagreed with those opinions (which I do not) I would be most reluctant to strike out upon a different course, having regard to the particular responsibility of the Federal
Court of
Australia for the general administration of the Bankruptcy Act. See generally
Fernando and Anor versus Commissioner of Police and Anor, Court of Appeal , 29
March 1995; (1995) NSWJB 27.
I therefore agree in the opinion of Cole JA that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Curing the time default of the appellants therefore becomes unnecessary.
JUDGE2
POWELL JA Both the basic facts which have given rise to the matters debated on the hearing of this appeal, and the relevant provisions of the [Bankruptcy
Act 1966](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/)") and of the Bankruptcy Rules ("the Rules") have been set out in the Judgment which has been prepared by Cole JA, which Judgment
I have had the opportunity to read in draft. That being so, it is unnecessary for me, in this Judgment, to deal with those facts, or with those statutory provisions or the provisions of the Rules, in any detail and I am content to adopt his Honour's statement of them.
In their Written Submissions, the Appellants sought to raise for consideration three questions, they being - I take them out of the order in which they were advanced - whether, in the circumstances, leave to appeal from the Judgment of
Brownie
J was necessary, and, if so, should it be granted; and, in the event that leave to appeal not be necessary, whether the time within which a Notice of Appeal might be filed be extended nunc pro tunc; whether the right of the Appellants to claim contribution against the
Respondent arose, in the case of the Appellant Mr. Gye, on 3rd April 1985, and, in the case of the Appellant Mr. Perkes, on 28th June 1985, those being the days fixed by the Federal Court of Australia as the days for calculation of set-off as between the Mr. Gye and Mr. Parkes respectively and Mrs.
McIntyre, in which event, as Master Macready held - his decision, in this respect being upheld by Brownie J - the Appellants' claim for contribution was statute- barred; or whether that claim arose on 24th June - the date upon which the Appellants obtained their Judgment in deceit against Mrs. McIntyre, against the amount payable pursuant to which Judgment Mrs. McIntyre was later to claim the benefit of a set-off; and whether the potential claim for contribution which, as at 16th November , the Appellants had against Mr. Davies, were debts or liabilities which were "provable debts" within the meaning of Part X of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), and which were thus released as at 16th November 1984, when Mr. Davies entered into the composition with his creditors; or, as Master
Macready held - but Brownie J expressed no view - that claim was neither a contingent, nor a future, debt or liability.
As
Mr. R. M. McDougall QC, who appeared on the hearing of the appeal with
Mr. J. Robson for Mr. Davies, did not, either in his Written
Submissions on behalf of Mr. Davies, or in his oral submissions, seek to contend, either, that the Judgment of Brownie J was interlocutory in character, or, that there was any discretionary consideration which dictated that leave to appeal, or an extension of time within which to file a Notice of Appeal, ought to be refused, I am content to proceed upon the bases, first, that an appeal lies as of right in the present case, and second, that there ought to be made, nunc pro tunc, an order extending the time for the filing of a Notice of Appeal up to and including 4th October 1994, the date upon which the Notice of Appeal was in fact filed.
The second of the questions which the Appellants have sought to raise is, however, far less easy to dispose of than was the first.
In the course of development his submissions in respect of this question (Transcript pp. 2-3) Mr. J.D. Heydon Q.C., who appeared with Mr. V.R.W.
Gray for the Appellants, sought to distinguish between two distinct questions - which he described as the "bankruptcy question" and the "contribution question" - which questions, so he submitted, both Master Macready and Brownie
J had compressed together. By way of elaboration, he submitted: - that, having regard to the provisions of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) it was appropriate, as between the Appellants, on the one hand, and Mrs. McIntyre, on the other, that the set-off between their respective liabilities operate as from the dates in when Messrs. Gye and Perkes entered into a composition with their respective creditors; but that, while that was so as between the Appellants, on the one hand, and Mrs. McIntyre on the other, such an approach was not appropriate as between the Appellants, on the one hand, and Mr. Davies, on the other. That this was so is demonstrated by the fact that the right of the Appellants to claim contribution in fact against Mr. Davies did not arise until, at the earliest, it became apparent that the Appellants would be called upon to pay more than their appropriate share of the mortgage debt owed to Mrs. McIntyre -
in which case their only immediate right was to obtain a Declaration as to an entitlement to contribution - or when it became apparent that they had, in fact, paid more than their appropriate share of that debt - the latter date, so it was submitted, was 24th June when the Appellants obtained Judgment against Mrs. McIntyre.
Notwithstanding that it may not, in the end, advance the
Appellants' cause in this appeal, it seems to me that the distinction which Mr. Heydon has sought to draw is a valid one.
Although the origin of the concurrent right, and liability, to a set-off which is now enshrined in the provisions of [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s86.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) is obscure, it seems clear enough that it antedated, by a considerable period, the passing of the Statutes of Set-off ((1729) 2 Geo.
II c 22 s.13; (1735) [8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s8.html) Geo. II c 24 [s.
)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s5.html) - indeed the original mutual credit provision appears to have been enacted in 1705 by the statute 4 and 5 Anne c 17 (although this is the citation of the statute in the Statues at Large, in the 9th Volume of the Statutes of the
Realm prepared by the Record Commission in 1822, it is cited as (1705) 4 and 5
Anne c 4) it would seem (Derham: Set-Off ((1) (1987) pp. 62-65)) that there have been two competing explanations of how the right to a balanced account in bankruptcy developed prior to 1705 which have been put forward.
The first of such explanations, apparently held by Lord Eldon (Ex parte Stephens) ((2) <case>; [(1805) 11 Ves Jun 24],178) and possibly by Sir George Turner (Freemen v. Lomas ((4) <case>; [(1851) 9 Hare 109], 112-113) is that the right may have originated as a principle of equity. The other explanation which has been put forward was that of Professor Christian (Bankrupt Law ((5) 2 Ed (1818) Vol. 1 pp. 499-500) who argued that it had a statutory basis, the law of bankruptcy in force during the 17th century being derived primarily from a statute of Elizabeth ((1570) Eliz. c 7), later supplemented by a statute of James I ((1603) 1 Jac. c ).
But whatever be the origin of the practice, it seems to have been adopted as early as 1612 (Powel v. Stuff and Timewell ((6) (1612) 2 Bulst. 26)) although the first proper judicial statement of the right to a balanced account which I have been able to find does not appear to have been made until (Anon. ((7) (1675) 1 Mod. 215) in which case
Sir Francis North CJ said: - "If there are accounts between two merchants, and one of them become bankrupt, the course is not to make the other, who perhaps upon stating the accounts is found to be indebted to the bankrupt, to pay the whole that originally was entrusted to him, and to put in for the recovery of what the bankrupt owes him, into the same condition with the rest of the creditors; but to make him pay that only which appears due to the bankrupt on the foot of the account; otherwise it will be for accounts betwixt them after the time of the others becoming bankrupt, if any such were."
In Chapman v. Derby ((8) (1689) 2 Vern 117) a case which came before the
Lords Commissioners, there is a reference to an earlier Judgment of
Sir
Matthew Hale CJ in which the Chief Justice apparently said that, where there were dealings on account, a man should not be charged with the account on the credit side and be put to come in as a creditor for the debt owing to himself, but should only answer to the bankrupt's estate for the balance of the account.
Although it matters not which of these two explanations is to be preferred, the facts, first, that each of Sir Francis North and Sir Matthew
Hale was a common law judge, and, second, that the Law Reports do not appear to contain any examples of the Lord Chancellor exercising any jurisdiction in bankruptcy prior to the last quarter of the 17th century suggest that it is the latter, rather than the former, explanation which is the more likely to be correct.
 .
The principle which is said to lie behind the right of set-off in bankruptcy was described by Park B (as Lord Wensleydale then was) in Forster v. Wilson ((9) [(1843) 12 M and W 191], 203-204) in the following terms: - "The right of set-off in bankruptcy does not appear to rest on the same principle as the right to set-off between solvent parties. The latter is given by the statutes of set-off (2 Geo.
, c. 22, s. 13, and [8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s8.html) Geo. 2, c. 24, [s.4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s4.html) to prevent cross actions; and If the defendant could sue the plaintiff for a debt due to him not in his representative character, he might set it off under these statutes in an action by a plaintiff suing in his individual character also; though the plaintiff or defendant might claim their respective debts as a trustee for a third person. If the debts were legal debts due to each
In his own right, It would be sufficient. But, under the bankrupt statutes, the mutual credit clause has not been so construed.
The object of this clause (originally introduced in a temporary act, 4 and 
Anne, c. 17, continued by 5 Geo. 2 c. 30, and now re-enacted by the 6 Geo. 4, c. 10) Is not to avoid cross actions, for none would lie against assignees, and one against the bankrupt would be unavailing, but to do substantial justice between the parties, where a debt is really due from the bankrupt to the debtor to his estate; and the Court of King's Bench, in construing this clause, (for it is the same clause in substance in the two last-named statutes), have hold that it did not authorise a set-off, where the debt, though legally due to the debtor from the bankrupt, was really due to him as a trustee for another, and, though recoverable in a cross action, would not have been recovered for his own benefit." to which might be added the following paragraph in the joint Judgment of the
High Court in Gye v. McIntyre ((10) <case>; [(1990-1991) 171 CLR 609], 618-619): - "It has often been pointed out that the object of set-off in bankruptcy is, in the words of Parke B. in Forster v. Wilson, to do substantial justice between the parties, where a debt is really due from the bankrupt to the debtor to his estate'.
Where there are genuine mutual debts, credits or other dealings, it would be unjust If the trustee in bankruptcy could insist upon having 100 cents in the dollar upon the whole of the debt owed to the bankrupt but at the same time insist that the bankrupt's debtor must be satisfied with a dividend of some few cents in the dollar on the whole of the debt owed by the bankrupt to him. It was to prevent such injustice that the 'mutual credits' and 'mutual debts', and later 'mutual dealings', provisions were introduced into bankruptcy legislation: see, e.g. In re Daintrey; Ex parte Mant, Day and
Dent
Constructions Pty. Ltd. v. North Australian Properties
Pty. Ltd. To the extent necessary to achieve that legislative purpose of 'substantial justice' to the parties, it is established by authority that a provision such as [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s86.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) should be given 'the widest possible scope', see, e.g. per
Mason J., Day and Dent Constructions, quoting Lord Esher M.R.
 in Eberle's Hotels end Restaurant Company v. Jonas."
Although both the common law and equity recognised a right, in appropriate cases, to contribution, the circumstances in which, at common law, that right might be enforced and the amount which, at common law, might be recovered in any action for contribution were less extensive than those which obtained in equity, in consequence of which fact, the common law right appears to have lapsed into dessuetude - some of the antecedent history may be found in the Judgment of
Wright J (as Lord Wright then was) in Wolmershausen v.
Gullick ((11) [(1893) 2 Ch 514]; [(1969) 121 CLR ], 349-352). Although it seems likely that it was in cases of joint sureties where the right to contribution was first recognised, and the nature of that right was first analysed, the principles embodied in those early cases (as, for example, Dering v. The Earl of Winchelsea ((13) (1787) 2 Bos. and Pul.
, 272 per Eyre CB) were subsequently extended beyond the boundaries of suretyship to contribution claims between other co-obligors. Although some divergences have arisen because of the particular relationships inter se of some co-obligors, the general principle, as stated in Goff and Jones, The Law of Restitution ((14) (1966) 173), is: "A right to contribution arises whenever a person, who owes with another a duty to a third party and is liable with that other to a common demand, discharges more than his proportionate share of that duty." while, in Albion Insurance Company Limited v.
Government Insurance Office of
New South Wales ((15) supra at 349-350), Kilte J suggested that the underlying principle: "...
is that persons who are under coordinate liabilities to make good the one loss (e.g. sureties liable to make good a failure to pay the one debt) must share the burden pro rata." 
Goff and Jones ((16) ibid) suggest: - "In each of these cases the basis of the right of contribution is unjust enrichment: qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus.
 "If a view is taken of the cases, it will appear that the bottom of contribution is a fixed principle of justice, and is not founded in contract.'" and, further, assert ((17) op cit 174) that the following principles seem to govern most contribution claims: - "1. that prima facie all contributing parties are aequali jure and must bear any loss equally; that, although the right to contribution is based on an equitable principle of unjust enrichment, the liability of co-obligors can be varied inter so by contract; that the amount of an obligors contribution is prima facie to be assessed by dividing the amount of the common obligation by the number of solvent co-obligors still bound at the date of the contribution action; that the right to contribution arises as soon as an obligor has paid a sum which he is liable to pay and which is more than his share of the common obligation, or judgment has been obtained against an obligor for more than his sham, or a claim has been allowed against the estate of a deceased obligor for more than his share."
Since partners are jointly liable for all partnership debts and obligations, partners are entitled to claim contribution inter se, the law in this regard being stated by Lord Cranworth
LC in Re The Royal Bank of
Australia, Robinson's Executors ((18) (1856) 6 De G M and G 572, 587-588; <case>; [43
ER 1356], 1362): - "Every shareholder, as a partner, is liable to every creditor to the full amount of his demand ... the solvent shareholders am bound to make up this sum, not by virtue of any engagement contained in the deed, but because by the general rules of law every partner is liable to the whole of the demands on the partnership ... when, indeed the money has been raised and the demands on the partnership have been liquidated, the shareholder who has paid a sum exceeding his rateable proportion, calculated on the number of his shams, will have a right of contribution against the other shareholders and the extent of that right must be measured according to the provision contained in the deed." 
It should, however, be added that, when a partnership is a going concern, the right of contribution is enforceable only in an action for a general partnership account (see, Boulter v. Peplow ((19) <case>; [(1850) 9 CB 493]
The question then is, what is the relevance of all this to the present case.
It seems to me, with respect, that it can be reduced to two simple propositions, they being: - that, although the date of the making of a sequestration order, or entry into a composition, is the date at which mutual credits, mutual debts or mutual dealings must be shown to exist if the provisions of [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s86.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) are to apply (Hiley v. Peoples Prudential Assurance Co. Limited (In liq) ((21) <case>; [(1938) 60 CLR 468)], it is sufficient for the purposes of the section if the relevant debt,or liability,although contingent at the date of the making of the sequestration order,or the entry into the composition, has subsequently become a fixed liability (Day and Dent Constructions
Pty, Limited (In liq). v.
North Australian Properties Pty, Limited (Prov. Liq. appointed) ((22) <case>; [(1981-1982) 150 CLR 85)]; see also In re Daintrey; Ex parte Mant ((23) (1900)1
QB 546) - these principles form the basis of the decision of the High Court in
Gye v. McIntyre ((24) supra) and of the later Judgment of Beaumont J in the
Federal Court of Australia,when he determined that the dates for calculation of the relevant set-off between Mr. Gye and Mr. Perkes, on the one hand, and
Mrs. McIntyre, on the other, were the dates upon which they respectively entered into a composition with their creditors; and that although a partner, or other co-obligor, is, as from the date of the incurring of the relevant debt, or other liability, liable to a suit for contribution in the event that the other co-obligor or co-obligors have been called upon to pay more than his or their, just share of the debt or other liability, that liability does not crystallise into a cause of action unless, and until, it is apparent that the other co-obligor, or co-obligors, have paid, or become liable to pay, more than his, or their, just share of the relevant debt or liability - (Mahoney v. McManus ((25) <case>; [(1981) 36 ALR 545], -550 per Gibbs CJ) in the present case, June 1988 when Messrs. Gye and
Perkes obtained Judgment against Mrs. McIntyre. It follows, in my view, that the fact that, for the purposes of [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s86.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), the set-off as between the debt claimed by Mrs. McIntyre, on the one hand, and the amount of the Judgment recovered by Mr. Gye and
Mrs. Perkes, on the other, was to be made as at the dates of their respectively entering into a composition with their creditors, had nothing to do with the date on which the right to recover a contribution from Mr. Davies, which each of Mr. Gye and Mr. Perkes sought to put in suit, crystallised at those times and that Master Macready was in error when he held that the right claimed by Mr.
Gye and Mr. Perkes had long since become statute-barred (see Wolmershausen v. Gullick ((26) supra at 529).
It does not, however, follow that the present appeal should be upheld: that would be so only if the right to contribution which Mr. Gye and Mr.
Perkes have sought to put in suit was not a provable debt from which Mr.
Davies was released an the day on which he entered into the composition with his creditors.
In the course of his submissions on this aspect of the appeal, Mr. Heydon submitted: - that the potential liability to which Mr. Davies was subject, in the event that, at some time in the future, Mr. Gye and Mr. Perkes might pay more than their just share of the debt due to Mrs. McIntyre, to contribute was not a debt or liability to which, as at the date of Mr. Davies' entering into the composition with his creditors, he was subject - [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) as modified, and made applicable to such cases by r 82 did not extend to include future, or contingent, debts and liabilities - to the extent to which the decisions of the Federal Court in Morris v. Miroudas ((27) <case>; [(1986) 12 FCR 346)] and Wills v.
Abram ((28) Heerey J 12 May 1993 (unreported)) appeared to assert the contrary, either, those assertions were obiter, or, alternatively, those decisions were wrong.
For his [part Mr.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p1000r) McDougall submitted: - that the views expressed in both Morris v. Miroudas and Wills v. Abram were correct; and that, as from the date upon which the former partners incurred the debt to Mrs. McIntyre, Mr. Davies, in common with all of the partners, incurred an inchoate liability to contribute in the event that any one or more of the others was later called upon to pay more than his fair share (he referred to
Hardy v. Fothergill ((29) [(1888) LR 13 App Cas 351)]; Wolmerhausen v. Gullick ((30) supra)).
With respect to those who may be of a different view, it seems to me that the views expressed by, in particular, Toohey J in Morris v. Miroudas ((31) supra) and by Heerey J in Wills v. Abram ((32) supra) were in each case wholly, or partly, obiter and not part of the ratio decidendi in either case.
Lest it be thought that this is a rather bold statement, I would point out: that in Morris v. Miroudas, the debt in question was founded upon a breach of a contract entered into before the execution of the Deeds of
Assignment, which breach had occurred prior to the execution of the Deeds of
Assignment, and an action to recover damages for which breach had been commenced prior to the execution of the Deeds of Assignment, against the background of which facts it is hardly surprising that Toohey J said ((33) supra at 357): - "Counsel for the respondents submitted that any liability of the appellants to the respondents was contingent only at the date of execution of the Deeds of Assignment.
I find it unnecessary to determine whether a contingent liability is, by reason of the modifications of [s.82(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) by r 82, liability for the purposes of an arrangement with creditors made under [Part X.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10)
For there was no contingent liability in the present case.
Pressed to identify the contingency, counsel for the respondents was unable to do so. This is not surprising for there was in truth no contingency upon which the liability of the appellants to the respondents depended: see Community Development Pty.
Limited v. Engwarda Construction Co. <case>; [(1969) 120 CLR 455."] in Wills v. Abram ((34) supra) the amounts in issue were the sum of $50,000.00, the last instalment provided for of a purchase price of $525,000.00, and the sum of $70,000.00 which was, in certain events, to become payable in lieu of other sums to which those claiming to be creditors would otherwise have been entitled. In the course of his Judgment (Transcript of
Judgment p. 9), Heerey
J described the sum of $50,000.00 as "a future debt because it was not payable under (sic) 30 June 1992", and described the sum of $70,000.00 as "a contingent debt because it was only payable on certain events which might or might not happen: see Ex parte Ruffle" ((35) [(1873) 8 LR Ch App ] at 1001). With respect, while it might have been legitimate to describe the sum of $70,000.00 as a contingent debt, it was, in my view, not correct to describe the sum of $50,000.00 as a future debt - on the contrary, so it seems to me, the true analysis was that it was a present debt albeit not payable until some time in the future - or, as the Latinists, among us would have it, debitum in praesenti, solvendum in futuro.
In the circumstances, and notwithstanding that I accept that, in matters involving the construction of a Commonwealth statute (R v. Abbrederis ((36) [(1981) 1 NSWLR 530], it is highly desirable that there be conformity of decision throughout Australia, I do not regard myself as bound, or even entitled, uncritically, to follow the observations of Toohey J or Heerey J.
To say the least, [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) as amended by r 82 is hardly a shining example of the draftsman's art. However, the fact that, notwithstanding the omission from [s. 82(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) of the words "present or future, certain or contingent" and the further words "or to which he may become subject before his discharge by reason of an obligation incurred before the date of the bankruptcy", the provisions of sub- [ss.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s4.html) to [7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s7.html) inclusive - which provide for what is to occur when "a debt or liability provable in the bankruptcy which, by reason of it being subject to a contingency, or for any other reason, does not bear certain value" - are retained tends strongly to suggest that, notwithstanding that debts and liabilities may be future or contingent, they are nonetheless to be regarded, for the purposes of a composition with creditors, as debts provable.
If this be so, then, as it seems to me, the liability to contribute which
Mr. Gye and Mr. Perkes, sought to enforce as against Mr. Davies in these proceedings was a liability to pay money on a contingency, which liability was provable for the purposes of the composition with creditors, and, thus, was released upon Mr. Davies' entering into the composition. That that liability was a liability to pay money on a contingency would seem to be demonstrated not only by the decisions (Hardy v. Fothergill ((39) supra); Wolmershausen v.
Gullick ((40) supra)) to which Mr. McDougall referred us but also by the decision of the Court of
Exchequer in Adkins v. Farrington ((41) (1860) 5 H N ; <case>; [157 ER 1314)] to which Mr. Heydon, very properly, drew our attention during the course of his submissions.
In the circumstances, although for reasons other than those which prevailed before Master Macready and Brownie J, I am of the opinion that the appeal - the time for filing of the Notice of Appeal in which having first been extended, nunc pro tunc, up to, and including 4th October 1994 - should be dismissed with costs.
JUDGE3
COLE JA This appeal raises two questions. The first involves the proper interpretation and application of provisions of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/). The second is whether the appellants' claim is statute barred. Failure to succeed on either point will result in the appeal being dismissed.
 
PROCEDURAL MATTERS
The appellant filed a notice of motion for leave to appeal and to appeal out of time. The motion was brought because the appeal was lodged one day out of time, and because it was regarded as unclear whether an appeal as of right lay from the decision of Brownie J dismissing an appeal from the decision of master Macready. The respondent takes no objection to the granting of an extension of time within which to appeal. The appellant has an appeal as of right from the decision of Brownie
J ((1) Section 101(1(a)) [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), as amended). Leave should be granted to bring the appeal out of time.
There are thus no procedural barriers to the appeal.

Five persons, Messrs Gye and Perkes, the appellants, Mr Davies, the respondent, and Messrs Pettit and Landon entered into a partnership agreement dated 14 November 1980 for the purpose of acquisition of and running of an hotel/motel. Messrs Gye,
Davies and Perkes each had a 16% interest in the profits and losses of the partnership with Messrs Landon and Pettit having a %
and 20% interest respectively. The partnership borrowed $200,000 from a
Mrs McIntyre, a vendor, secured by second mortgage over the property purchased. There was default under that mortgage. On 29 June 1982 Mrs McIntyre obtained a judgment against all five partners in the sum of $224,240.
On 16 November 1984, Mr Davies entered into a Deed of Arrangement which, correctly as both parties to the appeal accepted, was characterised by master
Macready as a composition with creditors. The deed was pursuant to [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) [Bankruptcy Act 1966](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/). Mrs McIntyre proved in that composition for monies due under her judgment.
Similarly on 3 April 1985 and 28 June 1985 Messrs
Gye and Perkes respectively entered into similar compositions with creditors pursuant to [Part
X.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10)
By 15 November 1987 Mr Davies or his trustee had paid $34,505.46 on account of his liability to Mrs McIntyre pursuant to her judgment.
On 24 June 1988 Messrs Gye and Perkes obtained judgment in deceit against
Mrs McIntyre in the sum of $214,606.89 arising from representations made by
Mrs McIntyre on the sale of the hotel/motel premises and business.
On 6 April 1990 the
Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia determined that Mrs McIntyre was entitled to set off monies owed to her by
Messrs Gye and Perkes under the McIntyre judgment against monies owed by her under the Gye and Perkes judgment ((2) <case>; [(1990) 22 FCR 260).]; [(1991) 171 CLR ).]
On 6 October 1992 the Federal Court of Australia determined that: the date for calculation of the set-off as between
Mr Gye and Mrs
McIntyre was 3 April 1985; and the date for calculation of the set-off as between Mr Perkes and Mrs
McIntyre was 28 June 1985.
Those dates were the dates upon which Messrs Gye and Perkes respectively entered into the composition with their creditors. The Federal Court also decided that, after those set-offs, the entire liability of the five partners to Mrs McIntyre under the McIntyre judgment was satisfied and discharged.
Thereafter, on 4 December 1992, the appellants, Messrs Gye and Perkes, commenced an action which, after amendment, was brought against Mr Davies and
Mr Landon. The proceedings against Mr Landon were discontinued.
Messrs Gye and
Perkes sought from Mr Davies contribution for monies deemed paid by them in consequence of the set-off of their judgments against Mrs McIntyre's judgment as determined by the Federal Court.
The response of Mr Davies was, first, that the claim was statute barred, it being asserted that the set-off was operative from the dates of their respective compositions with their creditors, that is April and June 1985.
Messrs Gye and Perkes, contend that the set-off operated from the date of their judgment against Mrs
McIntyre, namely June 1988, and thus the proceedings were not statute barred. The second response was that the provisions of Mr Davies' composition with his creditors dated 16 November , by operation of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), discharged any liability he made have had to Messrs Gye and Perkes, their claims, being liabilities in respect of which Messrs Gye and Perkes could have proved under the composition with creditors.
Master Macready held that although a composition pursuant to [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) extinguished "contingent and future debts", the "debt in this case is not even a contingent debt or liability" ((4) Appeal Book, p.64V).
However, he also held: "The right of set-off in [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s86.html) is self executing and operates at the time the bankruptcy takes effect. See the comments of the
High Court in Gye versus McIntyre ((5) <case>; [(1991) 171 CLR 609] at 622).
The cause of action thus arose at that time and is now statute barred, hard though this result may be" ((6) Appeal
Book, p.65.H-L).
Accordingly the plaintiffs' claim was dismissed.
Brownie J, in a judgment delivered 5 September , dismissed an appeal upon the basis that, as the appellants had claimed in the statement of claim, [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s86.html) operated to achieve a set-off at the date of the respective compositions with creditors, being April and June 1985, and there being "no other rule of law which operates to make the obtaining of the 1988 judgment operate as a set-off as at any other time" ((7) Appeal
Book) the claim was statute barred.
His Honour accordingly found it unnecessary to deal with the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) point.
 
WERE THE POSSIBLE CLAIMS OF MESSRS GYE AND PERKES FOR CONTRIBUTION AGAINST MR
DAVIES DISCHARGED BY HIS COMPOSITION WITH
CREDITORS ON 16 NOVEMBER 1984?
In my view they were. Section 240(1) [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) provides that a composition under [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) operates to release the debtor from all provable debts, other than those (if any) that would not be released by his discharge from bankruptcy if he had become a bankrupt on the day on which the composition was accepted. In the case of Mr Davies that was 16 November .
Section 243(1) [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) relevantly makes, [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) "with the prescribed modifications" applicable in relation to a composition under [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) as if a sequestration order had been made against the debtor on the day in which the special resolution accepting the composition was passed, and the trustee of the composition was the trustee in his bankruptcy.
To understand the argument addressed by the appellants it is convenient to set out, as Master Macready did, the provisions of [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) as applicable to proceedings in bankruptcy, and to compare those provisions, as modified, applicable to a composition under [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) in consequence of their modification pursuant to s.237(2), and [rule 83](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s83.html), in each instance operative as at 16 November 1984. 
DEBTS PROVABLE IN BANKRUPTCY (1) Subject to this Division, all debts and liabilities, present or future, certain or contingent, to which a bankrupt was subject at the date of the bankruptcy, or to which he may become subject before his discharge by reason of an obligation incurred before the date of the bankruptcy, are provable in his bankruptcy. (1A) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), debts and liabilities referred to in that subsection shall be taken to include a debt or liability by way of the whole or a part of: a periodical sum that became payable by the bankrupt before, but not more than one year before, the date of the bankruptcy under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order (whether entered into or made, as the case may be, before or after the commencement of this subsection); and a lump sum (whether payable in one amount or by instalments) that became payable by the bankrupt before the date of the bankruptcy under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order (whether entered into or made, as the case may be, before or after the commencement of this subsection).
 (2) Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise or breach of trust are not provable in bankruptcy. (3) Penalties or fines imposed by a court in respect of an offence against a law, whether a law of the Commonwealth or not, are not provable in bankruptcy. (4) The trustee shall make an estimate of the value of a debt or liability provable in the bankruptcy which, by reason of its being subject to a contingency, or for any other reason, does not bear certain value. (5) A person aggrieved by an estimate so made may appeal to the Court. (6) If the court finds that the value of the debt or liability cannot be fairly estimated, the debt or liability shall be deemed not to be provable in the bankruptcy.
 (7) If the Court finds that the value of the debt or liability can be fairly estimated, the Court shall assess the value in such manner as it thinks proper. (8) In this section, "liability" includes: compensation for work or labour done; an obligation or possible obligation to pay money or money's worth on the breach of an express or express or implied covenant, contract, agreement or undertaking, whether or not the breach occurs, is likely to occur or is capable of occurring, before the discharge of the bankrupt and an express or implied engagement, agreement or undertaking, to pay, or capable of resulting in the payment of, money or money's worth, whether the payment is:  (i) in respect of amount - fixed or unliquidated; in respect of time - present or future, or certain or dependant on a contingency, or in respect of the manner of valuation - capable of being ascertained by fixed rules or only as a matter of opinion. 
DEBTS PROVABLE UNDER DEED OF ARRANGEMENT (1) Subject to this Division, all debts and liabilities to which a bankrupt was subject at the date of the bankruptcy are provable in his bankruptcy. (1A) (2) (SAME) (3) (SAME) (4) (SAME) (5) (SAME) (6) (SAME) (7) (SAME) (8) In this Section, 'liability' includes: compensation for work or labour done; (OMITTED) an express or implied engagement, agreement or undertaking, to pay, or capable of resulting in the payment of, money or money's worth, whether the payment is:  (i) in respect of amount - fixed or unliquidated;  (ii) (iii) in respect of the manner of valuation - capable of being ascertained by fixed rules or only as a matter of opinion.
The appellants' submission was that, as a matter of construction, omitting the words "present or future, certain or contingent" in [s.82(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html), omitting [s.82(8)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) dealing with "possible obligations" to pay money in respect of a future breach of contact, and omitting [s.82(8)(c)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) dealing with future or contingent implied agreements or undertakings to pay monies, made clear, in the case of compositions under [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) that a future or contingent liability was not to be included in the "debts or liabilities" which were either provable in the composition by virtue of the combined operations of s.243 and s.[82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html), or released under the composition by virtue of s.240.
That issue was addressed in the Federal Court of Australia by Toohey
J in
Morris and Anor versus Miroudas and Anor ((8) <case>; [(1986) 12 FCR 346] at 357). His Honour said: "There is however a question as to how far the changes made to [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) by r.82 provide a guide to the Proper construction of the
Subsection as amended. It may be argued that the deletion of any reference to "contingent" is an indication that contingent liabilities are not provable debts where them has been a deed of assignment. On the other hand, "present" and "certain" no longer appear in subs(1) and it is not likely that the intention of r.82 was to ensure that "present" or "certain" debt or liability was not provable. Equally, the removal of par (b) from subs(8) can hardly be taken as an indication that an obligation to pay money on the breach Of a contract is no longer a provable debt. By implication subs(2) preserves a claim for damages arising from breach of contract as debt or liability provable in bankruptcy. The method of permitting a rule to amend a section for certain purposes carries its own dangers. But in my view, where [s.82(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) is applicable, the proper course is to look at [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) as modified and not seek to construe it by reason of semantic differences that exist between [s.82(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) as modified and as unmodified."
Northrop J agreed with that reasoning ((9) <case>; [(1986) 12 FCR 346] at 354).
Spender J was of the opinion that the assumption that the liability there being considered was contingent was incorrect; nonetheless applying the statutory provisions of [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) as modified, his Honour found that the liability was provable under the deed of assignment thus implicitly giving support to the view of Toohey J, and certainly not dissenting from it.
There is thus a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court contrary to the construction of [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html), as modified, advanced by the appellants.
Further, the argument so advanced was specifically put to and rejected by
Heerey
J in Re: Michael Kenneth Robert Wills and Anor versus Graham Frank Abram and
Anor ((10) (unreported) 12 May 1993). His Honour there said: "However I think I should apply the reaoning of Toohey J, with whom Northrop J expressly and Spender J implicitly agreed.
In any case, I respectfully agree with that reasoning.

For present purposes, the critical step in that reasoning is that [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) as modified is to be construed in its own terms and not by reason of "semantic differences" that exists between its modified and unmodified forms. So viewed, it must follow that future debts and contingent debts, which are undoubtedly debts and liabilities, albeit particular species of debts and liabilities, must fall with the genus of "all debts and liabilities". Likewise a future debt and a contingent debt, are debts to which the bankrupt is "subject" as soon as they come into existence, notwithstanding that they are payable in the future or an a future contingency which may not happen. The bankrupt is "subject" to them in the sense that he is liable in respect of them in accordance with their terms. Therefore if they am in existence at the date of bankruptcy they am debts to which the bankrupt is "subject at the date of the bankruptcy" or, in the case of composition, at the date of the special resolution accepting the composition: [s.187(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s187.html) 
Support for this construction is to be found in sub-section , (5), (6) and (7), which remain in [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) in its modified form. Sub-section (4) expressly provides for the valuation of a debt or liability which is "subject to a contingency". This is not consistent with a construction which would have [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html), as modified, inapplicable to contingent debts. Likewise ss.(4) would apply to a future debt, this being an example of a debt or liability which 'for any other reason (scil. than being subject to a contingency) does not bear a certain value".
The value of a future debt may often be uncertain because of, amongst other things, the question of the appropriate rate to be applied."
I respectfully agree with the reasoning of Toohey J and Heerey J. It is true, as Mr Heydon QC for the appellants contended, that the passage in the judgment of Toohey J was obiter dicta because, as his Honour made clear, there was no contingent liability in that case ((11) <case>; [(1986) 12 FCR 346] at 357). That that was recognised does not detract from the integrity and strength of the reasoning advanced.
It follows that the appellants' contentions must be rejected and it be held that such claim as Messrs Gye and Perkes may have had against Mr Davies were extinguished by the composition with creditors entered into on 16
November 1984.
Further, even were I of the view that the construction advanced by the appellants of [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) as modified for the purposes of [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) was correct, and I am not, this Court as an intermediate appellate Court should not depart from an interpretation placed upon uniform national legislation, such as the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), by another intermediate appellate court unless convinced that the interpretation so placed is "plainly wrong" ((12) See for instance
Australian Securities Commission versus Marlborough Goldmines Limited <case>; [(1993) 177
CLR 485] at 492; Fernando and Anor versus Commissioner of Police and Anor
Court of Appeal 29 March 1995 per Clarke JA at p.5). That is particularly so where, as here, the interpretation called in question is that of the Full Court of the Federal Court, which court administers the [Bankruptcy
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/).
In light Of the view I have formed regarding the construction of [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) as modified for the purposes of [Part X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10), it becomes unnecessary to express a concluded view concerning whether such liability as existed in Mr Davies to
Messrs Gye and Perkes as at 16 November 1984 constituted an existing or contingent liability. If it was an existing liability at 16 November 1984, it obviously was extinguished. It is sufficient to note that there is both ancient and modern authority which would arguably support the view that monies which may become payable upon the happening of a possible future event where the obligation to pay derives, apart from that event, from an existing contractual arrangement, may constitute an existing debt provable under [s.82.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s82.html) ((13) See Adkins versus Farrington (1860) 5 H and N 587; <case>; [157 ER 1314] at 878 and authorities there noted).
It also becomes unnecessary to address the limitation point.
In my opinion leave to appeal out of time should be granted and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
