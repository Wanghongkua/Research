M Field versus Offenders Review Board [1996] NSWSC 298 (25 July 1996) 
MICHAEL FIELD versus OFFENDERS REVIEW BOARD /96; 186269 
Thursday 25 July 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
Handley JA, Grove J, Ireland J 
CATCHWORDS: CRIMINAL LAW - parole - application for review - need for fresh evidence.

EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Extempore 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Dismissed 
The applicant who served the minimum term imposed upon him for offences against young boys made an application for parole to the Offenders Review Board. On 29 March 1996 the Board refused parole on the grounds that the applicant was unable to adapt to normal life, there was a risk of him re-offending, he had failed in the past when released on parole, and his release on parole would not be in the public interest. The applicant applied under [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) of the [Sentencing Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) for a review of the decision, but failed to furnish any additional evidence.

HELD, dismissing the application: (1) Applications under [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) of the [Sentencing Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) ordinarily require support from fresh evidence: McPherson versus Offenders Review Board [(1991) 23 NSWLR 61]; (2) In any event the grounds alleging error by the Offenders Review Board were not made out.
 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an application by Michael Field under [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) in relation to the decision of the Parole Board on 29 March 1996 refusing him parole. The applicant had served the minimum term imposed on him by Slattery AJ on 27 March 1992 for offences against young boys and is currently serving his additional term, which is due to expire on 17 November 1997.

The Board at its meeting on 29 March 1996 refused parole on the grounds that the applicant was unable to adapt to normal lawful community life, there was a risk of him reoffending, he had failed in the past when released on parole, and a decision to release him on parole would be inappropriate in the public interest. The applicant was legally represented at the hearing before the
Offenders Review Board.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) of the [Sentencing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) provides: "(1) Where: 
The Board has decided under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s22.html) that a prisoner should not be released on parole; the prisoner alleges that the decision of the Board was made on information which was false, misleading or irrelevant, the prisoner may in accordance with rules of court apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a direction to be given to the Board as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant and the Court of Criminal Appeal may give such direction with respect to the information as it thinks fit.

An applicant under this section is not to be considered by the Court of
Criminal Appeal unless it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application".

There have been a number of decisions of this Court in applications under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) but it is sufficient for me to refer to McPherson versus Offenders Review
Board [(1991) 23 NSWLR 61.] The Court there decided that except in unusual circumstances an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) will only be considered where further evidence becomes available which was not before the Board when it was considering under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s20.html) whether to release the applicant on parole.

This application is not supported by any further evidence and the grounds relied upon which relate to the hearing before the Offenders Review Board, are not made out in any event.

In the circumstances it is clear that this application is hopeless and must be refused.

GROVE J: I agree.

IRELAND J: I also agree.

HANDLEY JA: The order of the court is application under [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s23.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) refused.
