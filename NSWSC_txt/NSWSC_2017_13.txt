JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of an assessment in relation to an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act says that the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer setting out the matters in that subsection and stating the grounds on which the suspicion referred to therein is held if the Court considers that the suspicion is reasonably held.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 12 January 2017. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the Defendant is engaged in serious crime related activity or activities, being the commission of the offences of supplying prohibited drugs greater than a large commercial quantity contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . Those offences fall within the definition of serious criminal offence under [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Mr Spark deposes to the fact that his suspicion is held principally by reading the facts sheet prepared by the police after the arrest of the Defendant. He sought confirmation from the officer who he believed prepared the facts sheet the fact that the officer had done so, that the facts sheet was true to the best of his knowledge and belief, and that the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation. The officer replied in the affirmative to those enquiries.
I have read the facts sheet and I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion that those offences have been committed is reasonably held.
The Plaintiff seeks that the orders be made without prior notice to the Defendant. It does so based on what Mr Spark says in paragraph 9 of his affidavit, that through his long experience with the Plaintiff he is aware that in the absence of a restraining order it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages of real estate very quickly and dispose of motor vehicles very quickly in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act.
I am satisfied that the orders should be made without prior notice to the Defendant. The Defendant has rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review of these orders.
