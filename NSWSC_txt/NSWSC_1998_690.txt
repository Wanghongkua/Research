WORKERS COMPENSATION - AWARD OF WEEKLY PAYMENTS -Respondent applied for weekly compensation payments for partial incapacity under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the Act) - payments depended on the difference between probable earnings uninjured and post injury earnings, [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) - the appellant submitted that the value of the free accommodation and meals, part of the respondent's current work package, should be added to her post injury earnings - trial judge found that although not impossible to calculate, the lack of evidence prevented him from quantifying the relevant values and incorporating them into the final award.

On appeal the appellant submitted that: the trial judge, when applying Ozer versus State Rail Authority [1983] WCR , erred in law by not quantifying the non cash benefits and subsequently making an award for weekly payments in respect of the eighth period, from 1
March 1997 and continuing; the onus is on the worker to present evidence enabling quantification of non cash benefits, for in the absence of such evidence the judge is unable to arrive at a final post injury wage, pursuant to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) of the Act, upon which a final determination of the weekly payment is based,
J & H Timbers Pty Limited versus Nelson <case>; [(1972) 126 CLR 625.] 
Held: as post injury earnings are "susceptible of determination by evidence" the onus was on the respondent to produce evidence of the relevant valuations,
J & H Timbers Pty Limited versus Nelson <case>; [(1972) 126 CLR 625], as per Menzies J at 641; therefore, in the absence of this evidence, the trial judge erred in law when arriving at a figure for weekly compensation payments for the period from March 1997 and continuing; a new trial is necessary to answer the question of what award, if any should be made with regards to the period of 1 March and continuing.

DABAV PTY LIMITED versus FOWLER 
PRIESTLEY JA: On 4 September 1994 the respondent to this appeal was injured at work. She later applied to the Compensation Court for weekly payments of compensation. Her application was based on total incapacity for some periods and partial incapacity for others. Eight periods were claimed for, the last being for the period from "1/3/97 to date and continuing: $91.00". 
Her application was heard by Walker CCJ on 6 November 1997. On 28 November he gave judgment, awarding her weekly payments for all eight periods. He made other orders in respect of interest, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) expenses, and costs.

The employer appealed, but against only the award for a weekly payment of $91 made in respect of the eighth period which was expressed to be from 1 March and continuing in accordance with the provisions of the [Workers
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the
Act).

Because the appeal is limited to a point of law raised only in regard to the one, continuing, award, and because the point of law raised itself requires no statement of the whole facts of the case that were before Walker CCJ, I will refer only to the facts necessary for an understanding of the point of law relied on by the appellant, and the opinion I have formed about it.

Section 40(1) of the Act provides that the weekly payment of compensation to an injured worker in respect of any period of partial incapacity is not to exceed the reduction of the worker's weekly earnings subsequent to the injury and is to bear such relation to the amount of the reduction as appears proper in the circumstances of the case.

Section 40(2) sets out how the reduction in the earnings of the worker is to be calculated. For purposes of the present case, where the worker was working in paid employment during the relevant period, and the appropriateness of taking her earnings in that employment as the relevant earnings has not been challenged, <case> provided that the reduction was the difference between the weekly amount the worker would probably have been earning but for her injury if she had continued in the same or some comparable employment (but not to exceed $1,000) and the average weekly amount she was earning from time to time (but again not to exceed $1,000). I will call these two figures the probable earnings uninjured and the post injury earnings.

The trial judge found the probable earnings uninjured to be $691 and the post injury earnings to be $600. Hence, the award amount of $91.

In the appeal no question was raised about the probable earnings uninjured. It was in regard to the post injury earnings that it was submitted that the trial judge had made an error of law.

The trial judge had arrived at the post injury earnings of $600 in the following way. For the worker a schedule of earnings had been filed on 24
September 1997. It set out: (i) from 1/3/97 to 6/6/97 the worker's actual earnings were $600, her pre-injury earnings $691 and that the difference, $91, was claimed; (ii) from 7/6/97 to 16/7/97, actual earnings were nil, pre injury earnings $691 and that the difference, $691, was claimed; (iii) from 17/7/97 to 3/9/97 the figures and claim were the same as in (i); (iv) from 4/9/97 to date (which was then 24 September 1997) the figures were the same as in (ii).

The employer also tendered a wages schedule which relevantly said "Actual earnings during periods when compensation is claimed are understated".

In her evidence on 6 November 1997 the worker said that from 1 March of that year she had worked as a purser on a ship at a rate of pay of $2,400 a month.
(This was treated by the parties as if it were $600 a week.) It was a requirement of the job that the worker take at least one month off periodically, or longer if the worker wished. After 6 June 1997 the ship the worker was working on was in wet dock for two weeks, and she did not return to work any sooner than six weeks, during which period (7/6/97 to 16/7/97) she was not paid. Then she worked again as a purser at the same rate for the /7/97 to 3/9/97 period, following which, and at the date the schedule was filed, she was on shore again, unpaid. She brought the schedule of earnings up to date, definitely enough, but not particularly clearly so far as later periods on shore unpaid were concerned, by answering "Yes" to a question whether as at 6 November 1997 she continued as a purser.

The following further evidence was elicited from her in cross-examination: "Q. The $600 you get is all earned while you are actually at sea on the ship, is that right. A---Apart from days when we're in Sydney on Tanaram.

Q, But the bulk of the time you are actually on the high seas. A---Yes.

Q. Is accommodation provided for you. A---Yes.

Q. Do you pay anything for that. A---No.

Q. What about your meals. A---No, we're supplied with meals.

Q. So the $600 you get basically is $600 in your hand less whatever you have to pay in tax at the end of the year. A---Yes." 
At the trial, the employer relied on the fact that the worker while working on ship as purser had been supplied with meals and accommodation as part of the job, without charge, to support the contention in its wages schedule that the worker's actual earnings during periods when compensation was claimed had been understated. It was submitted that to the $600 which the worker received as weekly pay there had to be added the value of the accommodation and the meals.

In support of this submission Coleman J's reasons in Ozer versus State Rail
Authority [1983] WCR 246 were relied on. He had held that a right of free travel to and from work was a part of "earnings" within the meaning of s (1) of the Workers Compensation Act 1926, the forerunner of <case> of the Act.
Although he was dealing there with the ascertainment of probable earnings uninjured rather that post injury earnings, I see no reason why what he said should not be applicable to the latter as well as the former, nor do I understand that the worker put any submission to the contrary either at the trial or in this court.

What was relied on for the worker both at trial and in this court was a qualification Coleman J had made part of his opinion. This was that earnings must include the value of benefits other than cash, provided that the value of such benefits can be quantified in money terms. It had been argued in the case before him that the worker's earnings should include the value of the right of free travel to and from work, the value also of free annual leave travel.
Coleman J said he had no difficulty in quantifying the value of the former but that he could not do so in regard to the free annual holiday travel. He explained this opinion by referring to some matters from which it seems, although it is not particularly clear, that the right to free holiday travel could not accumulate or be turned into cash credits in the worker's favour but had to be used by the worker during the relevant year or otherwise be lost.
The worker had not given evidence whether he intended to use the free annual holiday travel had he not been injured. Coleman J said: "I can readily envisage cases where the facts are such that quantification can be made but I am not satisfied that the instant case is one of them." (at )

There was no evidence before the trial court in the present case showing whether assistant pursers were paid subject to an award or industrial agreement or whether board and lodgings were included. The trial judge said that it had been submitted to him that he should offset the expense to the worker of maintaining her home and the costs of sustenance while she lived at home against the board and lodgings she received on ship. He continued: "The value to the applicant of the accommodation and meals is impossible to quantify in monetary terms on the evidence adduced in this case. Equally there is no evidence before me relating to rates and taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance in respect of the Tweed Heads home.

It would not be fair to assess the value of a cabin on the ship on the basis of its cost to a passenger which is really the only manner in which such accommodation is let. There is no evidence before me as to the value of the meals and how that value would compare to the applicant's normal meal costs.

Finding myself unable to quantify the benefits I do not propose to take them into consideration under <case>(b) on the basis of the principle in OZER'S case which excludes non cash benefits that cannot be quantified." (my underlining) 
It is apparent from this passage, particularly from the underlined words, that the trial judge was not saying that the value of the accommodation and meals was intrinsically impossible of quantification, but that lack of evidence prevented him from quantifying the relevant values.

This was the point to which the appellant/employer directed its appeal. It submitted that the onus was on the worker to show the value of the accommodation and meals. That being so, the absence of evidence enabling quantification was a lack of proof by the worker of a necessary ingredient in the post injury wages, which left the judge, as a matter of law, in the position where he could not arrive at the "difference" referred to in s (2) which it was essential to arrive at to establish the "reduction in the worker's weekly earnings" referred to in both subss (1) and (2) of <case> upon which the final determination of the amount of the weekly payment of compensation depended.

This argument is supported by authority, in particular by J & H Timbers
Pty Limited versus Nelson <case>; [(1972) 126 CLR 625.] That was a decision on <case> of the Workers Compensation
Act 1926 from which <case> was copied, in substantially identical terms. The court was divided, Menzies, Owen and Gibbs JJ being the majority with Barwick
CJ and Windeyer J in dissent. What was said by Menzies J (with whom Owen J agreed) at 641 and by Gibbs J, who explained the position in some detail, at -651, clearly supports the appellant/employer's contention in the present appeal. The decision thus represents authority which this court should regard as decisive of the present case. The words of Menzies J in J & H Timbers v Nelson, at 641, that the post injury earnings figure was "one susceptible of determination by evidence" apply in the present case. The evidence in the case did not permit a valuation of the accommodation and food element of the worker's wages, but that was because of the lack of proof, not because the value could not be proved.

Evidence of value could have been put before the court in various ways.
Figures could have been obtained from the ship's own records. Witnesses could have been called to give expert evidence in support of the necessary valuations. Such evidence might not be as accurate as that based on the ship's records. But if the employer felt disadvantaged by the worker's expert evidence on the value of board and food on ship it could call its own evidence. The expert evidence however would discharge the onus on the worker, and would be sufficient for the court to act on if the employer did not call any evidence itself. The worker could have put sufficient evidence before the court to discharge the worker's onus simply by proving what was charged to passengers on the ship. It would have been open to the court to infer that such figures would almost certainly be higher than the value to the worker as part of her wages and to discount them. Again, in the absence of evidence from the employer the evidence would, in my opinion, be a sufficient basis for the court to make an approximate but acceptable calculation in arriving at the worker's post injury earnings.

The conclusion must therefore be, in my opinion, that there was an error of law by the trial judge in arriving at the figure he awarded in respect of the eighth period and the award he made in respect of that period must be set aside.

For the worker, it was submitted as against this conclusion, that, in arriving at the post injury earnings, the trial judge had made a mistake against the worker's interest, in that he does not appear to have taken into account in his calculation the periods when, as part of her job, the worker was ashore without pay. This contention may be well founded, but it is not an answer to the appellant/employer's point that the judge had erred in law in his method of reaching the figure in question. If the error which it was submitted for the worker had been made by the judge against her interest were one which made it clear that upon the matter being remitted to the Compensation Court, the result of the further hearing would be unlikely to be substantially different from the award already made, then the court might properly dismiss the appeal.
However, I do not feel I can forecast with any sufficient accuracy whether a further hearing in regard to the eighth period would produce a better or worse result for either the worker or the appellant/employer. This means, in my opinion, that there should be a new trial in the Compensation Court of the question of what award, if any, should be made in regard to the eighth period.

I therefore propose that the appeal be allowed, the award in respect of the eighth period set aside and the questions whether weekly compensation should be awarded for that period, and if so in what amount, remitted to the
Compensation Court for determination by that court in accordance with the decision of this court. The worker should bear the costs of the appeal and have a Suitor's Fund Certificate.
