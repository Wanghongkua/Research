REGINA versus PAUL GERARD WARBURTON 
CCA 60425/97 September 1998 
Spigelman CJ, Sully J, Hidden J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 
HEADNOTE 
The appellant was convicted under s6(1)(I) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of having intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting. The Appellant appeals the verdict on the ground that there was no warning to the jury to the effect that the evidence of the complainant may be unreliable by reason of the mental illness of the complainant and the medication she had taken that evening.

Held:
There was a request under s165(2) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/). Accordingly, no direction was required under s165.
There was no basis for the alternative submission based on failure to exercise a common law discretion, that a miscarriage of justice might have occurred. Having regard to the course of the evidence and the shortness of the trial, there was no reasonable prospect the jury could have had any doubt that the reliability of the complainant's evidence was expressly put in issue on the basis of her personality, as aggravated on the evening by an overdose of medication. The central significance of the complainant's evidence was emphasised on a number of occasions during the course of the summing up.

ORDER 
Appeal dismissed.

JUDGMENT 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Solomon at the Lismore District Court on the following charge: "For that he on 4 April 1996 at Lismore in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Paula Appleby, without the consent of the said
Paula Appleby, knowing she was not consenting." 
This was a charge under s6(1)(I) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . The
Appellant pleaded not guilty. He was convicted.

On the day of the offence the complainant said that she had taken about eight tomazopam tablets, being an amount in excess of what had been prescribed to her for insomnia. She had also taken a number of dilantin tablets prescribed for her epilepsy but she could not recall how many. She went to the hospital to obtain assistance because she felt physical danger from the medication she had taken. Later she left the hospital without being discharged. She walked along a street in Lismore past a hotel where the Appellant was one of a group of men. She spoke to them and then accompanied them to a nearby flat.

As the complainant left the flat, the Appellant went with her onto a verandah.
The Appellant made sexual advances to her which she resisted. She said on a number of occasions, "I don't want to have sex." The Appellant penetrated her with his penis and after about a minute withdrew and ejaculated.

The complainant left the premises. She flagged down a police car and said, "I've been raped".

The defence case at the trial was one of consent.

During the trial the Appellant did not give evidence. In the course of cross- examination of the complainant it was put that she had consented to intercourse. It was also put to her that she had told hospital staff that she had taken fifteen dilantin and fifteen tomazopam tablets.

Doctor Robert Delaforce, a consultant psychiatrist specialising in forensic psychiatry, gave evidence for the defence. He had perused various notes from hospitals and clinics which related to the complainant.

Doctor Delaforce read reports from a clinic which had described the complainant as having "a severe personality disorder" or a "borderline personality disorder". In his evidence he described the use of the word "borderline" as misleading and said that the key word was "instability". He said: "So someone with a severe borderline personality disorder has severe instability, instability in relationship to people, instability in moods, very changing moods, very unstable moods, very unstable in their actions related to impulsivity, not stopping and thinking adequately about the consequences." 
Doctor Delaforce also gave evidence about the drugs which the complainant had taken on the night in question. His evidence was that the excessive amount taken by the complainant was capable of causing a number of effects including "confusion, disorientation, problems with memory, problems with being able to talk and walk, co-ordination and many, many other possible side-effects." He gave evidence that taking the quantity of drugs could "very likely" have effect on someone's memory.

A number of matters were put to Doctor Delaforce about the conduct of the complainant on the night in question and he gave evidence to the effect that what this displayed was that she was having problems of memory. Other conduct on the day suggested to the doctor that the complainant had "problems with impulsivity".

The doctor also was asked some questions by the jury, specifically whether he considered the complainant's memory of events to be consistent with an overdose, to which he answered "Yes".

Doctor Delaforce gave evidence about the interaction of the personality disorder and the medication. Specifically, the doctor said that there could be an "additive effect" that a person with a problem of impulsivity or "disinhibition" could, under the influence of the medication ingested by the complainant on the night, have "additive impulsivity".

During the course of the cross-examination of the complainant, she acknowledged that she had taken overdoses of medication on earlier occasions and had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. She admitted that she had a number of admissions to the psychiatric ward attached to the Lismore Base
Hospital. She was cross-examined in some detail about these overdoses and suicide attempts. In the course of the cross-examination she admitted that she did not recall the detail of what she had said at the hospital. Nor did she even recall the act of leaving the hospital.

During the course of the summing-up to the jury the trial judge made reference to the submissions of the defence counsel in the following terms: "He referred you to the evidence of Doctor Delaforce as to the borderline personality problem and the drugs and said it would affect her memory and he said you could not rely safely on her memory." 
His Honour also summarised the effect of Doctor Delaforce's evidence in his summing-up. No criticism is made of that summing-up before this Court. His
Honour made reference to Doctor Delaforce's evidence about "instability" and "impulsivity" and also the effect of the drug overdose in terms of memory and disorientation.

His Honour indicated that what he had provided was a summary of the submissions made by counsel in the case.

The submission made to this Court was based in the alternative on [s165(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and on the requirement of a warning in accordance with Common Law principles.
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) relevantly provides: "165(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: ... evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like. 
If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable; and inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable; and warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury." 
It was common ground before us that no warning was requested pursuant to [subsection (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
Accordingly, [s165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) does not in terms apply by reason of the words "and a party so requests" in [s165(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) 
The issue that arises is whether or not a warning of the character put forward in submissions to this Court should have been made by the trial judge exercising a common law discretion with respect to the conduct of the trial and the overriding duty of the trial judge to ensure a trial is fair. The nature of the warning suggested was to the effect the jury needed to be warned that evidence may be unreliable by reason of the mental illness of the complainant and the medication she had taken that evening.

In my opinion, having regard to the course of the evidence and the shortness of the trial, there was no reasonable prospect the jury could have had any doubt that the reliability of the complainant's evidence was expressly put in issue on the basis of her personality, as aggravated on the evening by an overdose of the two forms of medication. The central significance of the complainant's evidence was emphasised on a number of occasions during the course of the summing-up. His Honour said, inter alia: "The Crown case depends wholly on the evidence of Paula Appleby and, that being the case, it is necessary that you carefully consider and scrutinise her evidence. You have to decide whether you accept what she says in whole or in part.

You have to carefully scrutinise the evidence of Paula Appleby. So I will say again, without that evidence there is no Crown case - that is the only evidence in the Crown case ...".

In the light of the evidence and the contents of his Honour's summing-up, there is no basis for the submission that a miscarriage of justice might have occurred by reason of the absence of any form of "warning" with respect to the evidence of the complainant.

Counsel appearing for the Appellant submitted the same points gave rise to a verdict that was unsafe and unsatisfactory but conceded, if he could not succeed on the miscarriage of justice ground, he could not succeed on the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground.

Pursuant to [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/s4.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/) no "omission to direct" shall be allowed as a ground of appeal without the leave of the
Court. The issues sought to be canvassed in the warning that is now said to have been necessary were fully canvassed during the course of the trial and in his Honour's summing-up. Experienced criminal counsel appearing for the prisoner did not believe anything in the nature of an express warning was necessary. Nothing in the materials before the Court suggest that such a warning was necessary in the interests of a fair trial. There is no basis for the grant of leave. Even if leave were granted, there would be no basis for allowing the appeal.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

SULLY J: I agree. 
HIDDEN J: I agree. 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is, appeal dismissed. * * *
