TUESDAY 2 AUGUST 2005  /04 CAROLYN ANNE MACKENZIE versus WILLIAM HAMILTON OSBURN & ORS (N0 2)  /04 WILLIAM HAMILTON OSBURN V CAROLYN ANNE MACKENZIE  
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT  In proceedings numbered 105416 of 2004, consequent upon a hearing in which the application to have an informal document declared to constitute a will under <case> of the Wills, [Probate and Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/) was opposed, I published my reasons for admitting that document to probate.  There were further proceedings numbered 117650 of 2004 in which one of the defendants in the earlier proceedings sought probate of an earlier will. Those proceedings were stood over pending my determination in the other.  In consequence of my view that the informal testamentary document should be admitted to probate, the second matter fails and the appropriate order, apart from an order as to costs, is that the summons be dismissed.  It seems to me that the appropriate order as to costs is that there be no order with the intent that each party bear his or her own costs, because that application was made but stood over pending the outcome of the first proceedings.  In consequence, I make orders in proceedings numbered 117650 of 2004 that the summons be dismissed and there be no order as to costs.  With respect to the first matter, there is no dispute that the following declaration and orders should be made:  "The Court declares:  The document dated 17 December 2001 is an informal testamentary document within <case> of the Wills, [Probate and Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/). 
The Court orders:  The plaintiff be granted probate of the informal testamentary document dated December 2001.  The grant be referred to the Probate Registrar for completion in accordance with the Rules."  
I make orders in those terms.  The dispute is as to costs. Mr Ellison, who appeared for the successful plaintiff, seeks an order that the plaintiff's costs, on an indemnity basis, be paid by the defendants and there be no order as to the defendants' costs.  Mr Wilson SC, who appeared for the unsuccessful defendants, submitted that the appropriate order for costs was that the plaintiff's costs on an indemnity basis and the defendants' costs on a party and party basis be paid out of the estate assets.  I would be minded to make an order for costs to be paid out of the estate in line with Re Hodges; Shorter versus Hodges [(1988) 14 NSWLR 698] at 709 but for the circumstance that there was in the informal document, notwithstanding my observation at par 50 of my reasons for judgment, no disposition of a residuary estate.  Effectively, the deceased dealt with the entirety of his estate in that document. The only assets of the estate were the house at Mount Colah, the furniture in the house, and cash balances.  On the view that I took of the correct interpretation of the testamentary document, the house and furniture were given to the successful plaintiff and the cash balances were divided equally amongst the unsuccessful defendants.  Technically, however, there was no disposition of the residuary estate and s 46C(2) of the Wills, [Probate and Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/) came into play. It provided:  "Where the estate of a deceased person is solvent the deceased person's real and personal estate shall, subject to the provisions of any Act as to charges on property of the deceased and to the provisions, if any, contained in the deceased person's will, be applicable towards the discharge of the funeral, testamentary, and administrative expenses, debts, and liabilities, payable thereout in the order mentioned in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/index.html#p2) of the Third Schedule."  [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/index.html#p2) of the Third Schedule contained an order of application of assets in a solvent estate. The particular provision applicable in the instant circumstances was cl 6 which provided: "assets specifically disposed of by will, rateably according to value."  The consequence is that if I made an order that the plaintiff's costs be paid out of the estate, she would have to bear the lion's share of that order.  She has been successful in these proceedings and, in my view, it would be inappropriate to make an order that required her to contribute to her own costs.  A Calderbank offer was made shortly before the trial. When I say shortly, about three weeks before the trial. It sought the defendants' agreement to orders that the document of 17 December 2001 be declared to be a testamentary document and an order that it be admitted to probate, an order that the plaintiff have her costs of the proceedings paid out of the estate on an indemnity basis and an order that the costs of the first defendant be paid out of the estate of the deceased on an indemnity basis.  The existence of a Calderbank offer is merely a circumstance that the
Court is entitled to consider in exercising its discretion with respect to costs.  An order for indemnity costs is exceptional and requires the party seeking them to establish some delinquency on the part of the unsuccessful party (Oshlack versus Richmond River Council <case>; [(1998) 193 CLR 72], Colgate-Palmolive Co versus Cussons Pty Ltd <case>; <case>,
LMI Australia Pty Ltd versus Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd <case>  At par 45 of my reasons for judgment, I set out a number of matters that were argued on behalf of the defendants to support their case. These were, first, that there were discrepancies in the letters written by David MacKenzie to Mr Francis; secondly, there was conflict in the testimonies of David
MacKenzie and Stuart MacKenzie; thirdly, there was a failure to mention the informal document at a meeting with Mr Francis; and, finally, there was the giving of the title deed to the house to the Osburns.  It seems to me that those were matters that gave rise to a need to investigate and justified a rejection of the Calderbank offer.  In those circumstances, I am not prepared to make an order on an indemnity basis. Nor am I prepared to make an order that costs be paid out of the estate, which would have the effect of requiring the successful plaintiff in this case to bear part of her own costs.  The order I propose to make in matter numbered 105416 of 2004 is that the plaintiff's costs be paid by the defendants and there be no order as to the defendants' costs.
