JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)
HIS HONOUR: On 13 May 2015, for reasons given on that occasion, I made orders that the claim for relief against the first and second defendants contained in claims 1 through 6, 8 through 12 and 14 through 18 of the originating process be stayed, and that the plaintiff and the first and second defendants be referred for arbitration in respect of those matters. I further ordered that the plaintiff pay the first and second defendants' costs of the interlocutory process. The first and second defendants have applied for an order that those costs be payable on the indemnity basis and forthwith.
The argument that the defendants' costs should be paid on an indemnity basis was founded on a view originating from the judgment of Colman J in the High Court of England and Wales in A versus B [[2007] EWHC 54]
Independently of Hammerschlag J's judgment, I had come to the conclusion that the application for an indemnity costs order should fail, essentially on the basis that, contrary to the reasoning of Colman J that was embraced by Malcolm CJ, in principle the Court does not recognise the difference between party/party costs and indemnity costs as damage occasioned to the person liable to pay those costs <case>; [(2010) 185 FCR 335].] Essentially, the Court values the costs that a party is reasonably caused to incur in proceedings as the party/party costs, taking the view that the difference between party/party costs and the (solicitor/client) costs actually incurred by the party are incurred at that party's own choice, over and above what is necessary for the reasonable defence of the proceedings. In other words, it recognises that while it can be said that the unsuccessful party caused the successful party to incur costs to the extent of party/party costs, in so far as the costs exceed party/party costs, they were incurred not as a necessary and reasonable response to the unsuccessful party's claim, but voluntarily by the successful party such as to, in effect, break the chain of causation or represent a novus actus interveniens. This is all the more so under the costs regime in New South Wales, where the relevant considerations which inform assessment on a party/party basis are not markedly different from those applicable to a solicitor/client amount, so that a party/party order, though not a perfect indemnity, is often not far removed from it.
The award of indemnity costs should be reserved for cases in which one party has wantonly or recklessly caused the other party to incur costs. That is not this case.
Of course, in addition to those reasons, it would be contrary to the dictates of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) to apply a presumption or general rule that a case involving a stay in order to permit arbitration should ordinarily attract indemnity costs.
For those reasons, and for the reasons recently given by Hammerschlag J, I decline to order that the costs be paid on an indemnity basis.
However, having regard to the circumstance that the proceedings will be stayed for some considerable time until the arbitration is determined and that effectively this brings to an end a phase of the proceedings, it is appropriate that there be liberty to proceed to assessment forthwith.
The Court therefore orders that the first and second defendants have liberty to proceed forthwith to assessment of the costs referred to in order 2 of 25 May 2015.
