JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: These are proceedings brought under [section 36A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s36a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) for division of an expensive boat. Today the question has come down to the method of sale and costs. 
I have determined after discussion with counsel that the appropriate method of sale is that an independent solicitor, who will be named in a subsequent order, should conduct the sale. That solicitor should have discretion as to how the sale is conducted, whether by public auction with a reserve or by private treaty as he or she thinks fit. Further, that solicitor as an officer of the court should have access to the Master for the appropriate advice as to the reserve or otherwise.

As to costs, the normal order in this sort of proceedings is that the costs of both parties should come out of the proceeds of sale. This is because they have entered into a joint venture and just as the establishment costs should be paid by them equally, so should the costs of the dissolution.

This matter could have been dealt with by the Master somewhere between May and
July of this year and had it been dealt with in the ordinary course, the costs would have come out of the proceeds of sale. However, the defendant up to today wished to argue that my decision in Naziridis versus Rimis - 24
September 1985, unreported, was wrong. Further he wished to argue that there was a discretion to refuse an order and that because of the agreement between the parties as to the terms on which they held the boat or because of the conduct of the plaintiff, the order should not be made.

I would have thought having read the agreement that the first of those two arguments was very difficult and the second impossible. However, the effect of the defendant's approach to this case has been that the matter has been held up for some time, further affidavits have had to be filed and the parties required to prepare for a hearing.

Today the defendant agreed to the sale and so what has gone before has just wasted time and money. Accordingly, I think that the first $2,000 of each party's costs should come out of the proceeds of sale, but the defendant should pay the balance on the indemnity basis.

I propose to make orders in accordance with the document which I have initialled. The exhibits shall be retained. Subsequent orders may be made either by me or by a Master.
