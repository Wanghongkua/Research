JUDGE1
SANTOW J As a preliminary point, I have to determine whether the decision of the Appeals Committee of New South
Wales Rugby League Limited ("the League") of 22 December 1995 operates as an estoppel per rem judicatem and precludes the Plaintiff from asserting that the Playing Contracts which it seeks to enforce have not been validly terminated. That issue depends upon whether the decision of the Appeals Committee of the League in paragraph 59 on the dispute in relation to that matter referred to the Committee pursuant to clause 14 of the relevant Playing Contracts is final and binding on the parties.
The relevant Playing Contract is that between Bradley Fittler and the
Plaintiff dated 6 July 1994 and that between Matthew Sing and the Plaintiff dated 25 July
I will refer to them collectively as "the Playing
Contracts", which for all material purposes are in equivalent form.
 .
Clause 14 of the Playing Contracts provides as follows: "14. DISPUTES 
Subject to any provisions herein contained to the contrary, if any dispute arises between the parties hereto during the currency of this Agreement or after the expiration or termination thereof concerning the construction thereof, or in respect of any matter under this Agreement or arising therefrom or relating thereto, it shall be a condition precedent to bring any action that the same shall be referred to arbitration by the Appeals Committee of the League, whose decision on all questions of fact shall be final and binding."
It is not disputed that a dispute was referred to arbitration by the
Appeals Committee of the League, such referral being by both parties and being identified at paragraph 22 of the Appeals Committee's decision of 22 December
It is identified as follows: "1. Are the players Brad Fittler and Matt Sing on the one hand and Penrith Rugby League Football Club Limited on the other, subject to a binding contractual obligation whereby those players will play with the Club in the 1996 Australian Rugby 
League premiership season?
Have the Playing Contracts between those players and Penrith
Rugby League Football Club
Limited which were registered with the New South Wales Rugby League been validly terminated by those players?"
At paragraph , the document entitled "Points of Claim" delivered on 24
November 1995 by the solicitors instructed by the two players Bradley
Fittler and Matthew Sing in paragraph 14 describes the dispute as follows: "Has the Playing Contract between Sing and Penrith which was registered with the New South Wales Rugby League been validly terminated." (by Fittler and by Sing?)
At paragraph of the decision of the Appeals Committee, it is stated "... we resolve the dispute referred to us by the players and the Club by deciding as follows:"
There then followed seven matters which are decided, being matters primarily of fact though in some cases such as (7) of law or mixed fact and law. Those matters could be said to be anterior to the actual decision of the
Appeals Committee stated in paragraph 59 as follows: "The decision of the Committee is that the Playing Contracts between
Bradley Scott Fittler and the Penrith Rugby League
Football Club Limited and Matthew Charles Sing and the Penrith
Rugby League
Football Club Limited have been validly terminated by each of the players."
I set out these determinations as I have done, since the question of what decision was made on questions of fact may become relevant, depending upon my answer to the specific question before me concerning estoppel. The Plaintiff contends that there was no question of fact alone which was the subject of decision.
However, the Plaintiff submits that nothing should in practice turn on that, presumably on the basis that the critical questions of fact may not be in dispute. In the event that it is later necessary to determine that aspect, I will first hear submissions from the parties and then deal with, in particular, what questions of fact, if any, were decided in terms of clause 14 of the relevant
Playing Contracts and the relevant referral to arbitration.
This is to consider the status of those determinations and whether final and binding in the context of the dispute referred.
It is not in dispute that an award by an arbitrator may, like a judicial determination, give rise to an estoppel per rem judicatem. This is unless varied or set aside for misconduct or impropriety pursuant to [s42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s42.html) of the [Commercial Arbitration Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/)") or on appeal in the limited circumstances permitted for questions of law pursuant to [s38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s38.html) of that [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/); see
Spencer-Bower and Turner, "Res judicata", 2nd Edition, 1969 at 101, Commings v
Heard [(1869) LR 4 QB 669] at and 746.
However, it is not the case that every award made by an arbitrator is necessarily final and binding on the parties to the agreement so as to give rise to such an estoppel. That depends upon the application of [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/), in relation to the terms of the arbitration agreement itself.
[Section 28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) provides as follows: "28. AWARD TO BE FINAL 
Unless a contrary intention is expressed in the arbitration agreement, the award made by the arbitrator or umpire shall, subject to this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/), be final and binding upon the parties to the agreement."
The critical question in the present case is this. Whether, in the events that have happened and in the context of an arbitration agreement that makes it a condition precedent to bringing any action, that the relevant dispute be first referred to arbitration by the Appeals Committee (as has happened), there is such an expression of contrary intention in clause 14 there contained. That is a question of construction of the Playing Contracts and in particular clause 14. The Plaintiff relies upon the words at the conclusion of clause 14 as evincing such contrary intention, namely: "...
whose decision on all questions of fact shall be final and binding."
The Plaintiff submits that the position is analogous to that contained in proposition 4 of the Judgment of Giles J in Onerati versus Phillips Constructions
Pty Limited (in liquidation) and
Anor [(1989) 16 NSWLR 730] at 746: "4. The same position obtains for arbitrations unless on the proper construction of the agreement for reference or the reference the parties have agreed that the award shall determine their rights and obligations only with respect to the defects or classes of defect referred while leaving their rights and obligations with respect to other defects or classes of defect unaffected."
The present position would involve on the Plaintiff's contention not so much a limited referral of so much of the dispute as relates to questions of fact but rather a referral of the whole dispute but on the basis that a contrary intention has been expressed that only the decision on questions of fact is to be final and binding.
To this the Defendant responds that there would seem no point in a referral to arbitration of what is admittedly a legal question, namely, whether a repudiation or anticipatory breach of contract has occurred (see
Breach of Contract by J W Carter, 2nd Edition, 1991 at 230), if the relevant determination were not final and binding.
To that the Plaintiff responds that there can be a perfectly understandable desire to have such a matter arbitrated and a non-binding award made, appeal being a matter of the parties' election. Reasons may include speed, privacy, informality, and cost - and no doubt because the arbitrator is appointed from a group likely to be familiar with the kind of issues that arise in relation to Playing Contracts and the game of Rugby League. There is thus no absurdity in such disputes not being finally determined insofar as they involve questions of law. There is therefore no compulsion to construe clause 14 to avoid this result. It is of course always open to the parties to accept the arbitrator's determination without electing to take the matter further by way of litigation in the Courts.
The Plaintiff further urges that the very nature of the lay composition of the Appeals Committee under the Rules and Regulations of the New South
Wales Rugby League Limited as a body of three Vice-Presidents of the League meant that the parties would not have wished to entrust final determination of legal questions to such a body. It is true that in the present case, that
Appeals Committee, as entitled to do so under the relevant Rules (see [Part 1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/index.html#p1), [Rule 2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s2.html) did appoint as an additional member to the Committee a legally qualified person, Mr B W Collins, QC. But that was by no means compelled by the Rules and does not detract from the force of the Plaintiff's contention in that regard.
While the Defendant rightly points out that it is not unknown that parties entrust to lay arbitral determination, matters of law, nonetheless this is still a significant factor, especially when read with the concluding words of clause 14.
The Defendant contends that there is no significance in the fact that clause 14 fails to say that a decision of the Appeals Committee on a question of law is binding. This is said to be because [s38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s38.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) necessarily renders questions of law incapable of being wholly binding in the sense that, in the limited circumstances permitted by [s38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s38.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) (as construed in a number of decisions such as Promenade Investments Pty Limited versus State of New
South Wales [(1991) 26 NSWLR 203)], there is a limited avenue of appeal where the appellant can satisfy the substantial onus imposed. However, it would have been readily open to the draftsperson to have expressed finality as to questions of law as "subject to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/)", and in particular [ss38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s38.html) and [42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s42.html). After all, even questions of fact could not be conclusively determined in the event [s42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s42.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) applied to vitiate such award overall.
The competing constructions that the Plaintiff and Defendant place on clause 14 then focussed on construing the words "any action" in that clause.
It is "any action" that first must be referred to arbitration by the
Appeals
Committee as it is a condition precedent to bringing any action that such referral take place. The Plaintiff contends that the natural meaning of the words "any action" in the context of clause 14 is "any action other than one challenging a decision on a question of fact". Whereas, the Defendant considers that the words should be read as "any action to enforce the contract, save actions permitted under [ss38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s38.html) and [42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s42.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/)".
However, it is in fact not particularly helpful so to attempt to construe the concluding words of clause 14 by reference to what "any action" must mean.
It is clear enough that the words "any action" are meant to be of the widest possible import in order to give proper effect to this Scott versus Avery clause.
I return to the words in [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) requiring that the arbitration award by final and binding "unless a contrary intention is expressed". Those quoted words appear elsewhere in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) including [s23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s23.html) and s[24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s24.html), by way of example. It is significant that in s2l of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/), the more precise language appears, namely "unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties to the arbitration agreement". This leaves room in [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) for contrary intention to be gleaned from the arbitration agreement as a whole and by reference to the ordinary principles of interpretation.
Turning to those principles of interpretation, the Plaintiff, naturally enough, relies upon the Latin maxim "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" or "expressum facit cessare taciturn". This maxim is customarily translated in the context of legislation, though by parity of reasoning applicable to private agreements, thus: "When the Legislature has expressly established a particular method it is taken to have impliedly evinced an intention that no other method shall be available." see Myer Queenstown Garden
Plaza and Myer Shopping Centres Pty Limited versus Port Adelaide City
Council and the Attorney General [(1975) 11 SASR 504] at 564 per
Wells J.
The authorities, whilst warning that this maxim must be used with caution, have nonetheless frequently applied it, often as support for an interpretation otherwise justified. Statutory Interpretation in Australia 3rd
Edition by D C
Pearce and R S Geddes 1988 at 79-83 contains many examples of the application of the maxim as well as instances where the Courts have exercised that caution in finding other indications leading to a contrary interpretation.
At page 82, Pearce and Geddes refer to the maxim "expressum tacit cessare tacitum" and the leading authority upon it, R versus Wallis; ex parte Employers
Association of Wool Selling Brokers <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 529] at 550 per Dixon J which
I quote below: (4.23) Expressum facit cessare tacitum. In most circumstances this difficult to translate maxim is a restatement of the expressio unius approach. It was directly so equated by Reynolds
JA in Attorney-General ; Ex rel Franklins Stores Pty Ltd v Lizelle Pty Ltd [(1977) 2 NSWLR 955] where it was applied as if it were the expressio unius principle. However, there is one particular use of expressum facit to which attention should be paid, namely that, where a particular procedure is designated to achieve something, other procedures are thereby excluded. The leading authority is R versus Wallis; Ex parte Employers Association of Wool Selling Brokers <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 529.] At 550 Dixon J said 'an enactment in affirmative words appointing a course to be followed usually may be understood as importing a negative, namely, that the same matter is not to be done according to some other course'. In that case, a section that indicated the manner in which an arbitrator was to deal with a particular issue precluded the arbitrators dealing with that matter in accordance with more general procedures provided for in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/)." 
Dixon J in the analogous context of the manner in which an arbitrator was to deal with the particular issue which had been expressly laid down, adds the following at 550: "this applies especially when the power or duty affirmatively conferred or imposed is qualified by some condition, limitation or direction. In North Stafford Steel Iron and
Coal Co (Burslem), Ltd versus Ward [(1868 L.R. Ex. 172] at 177)
Willes J refers to 'the ordinary rule that if authority is given expressly, though by affirmative words, upon a defined condition, the expression of that condition excludes the doing of the act authorised under other circumstances than those defined'."
The above quoted passage is particularly apposite here. While the arbitrator is not so much directed as to the manner in which it is to deal with a particular issue, nonetheless the arbitrator in dealing with a dispute has attached to the arbitrator's decision a precisely laid down consequence, namely that the decision on "all questions of fact shall be final and binding", with the significant omission of any reference to questions of law.
I might add that a purposive interpretation of [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) and of the
Playing Contract itself, does not, in my judgment, compel an opposition conclusion. The evident purpose of both, is to allow the parties to qualify the extent to which they wish to be bound by an arbitrator's decision of a lay character, imposed by the League; compare clause 9 of the Playing Contract.
While it may be said to be characteristic of a submission to arbitration that the arbitrator has a mandate to make a binding determination of the legal fights of the parties in respect of the matter the subject of the agreement to arbitrate (see for example Mustill and Boyd, Commercial Arbitration, 2nd edition 1989 at 42) it does not follow that this is a universal characteristic. Nor does it follow that the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) should be ignored in its clear differentiation between the kinds of consequences that may attach to an arbitration without losing the essential character of the process as being an arbitration.
Having regard to the foregoing matters, I am satisfied that in all the circumstances, the proper construction of clause 14 of the Playing Contract is that it does express a contrary intention, for the purposes of [s28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s28.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/), that "the award" be final and binding on the parties to the Agreement, in that the arbitration agreement states that only its decision on all questions of fact is final and binding and not its decision on questions of law. It follows from the foregoing that the decision of the Appeals Committee of 22 December , being ultimately a question of law, does not operate as an estoppel per rem judicatem.
