Thursday, 14 October 2010  /133 Application of D 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child that an adoption order be made in favour of D. Subject to one matter, I am also satisfied that each requirement in [s 30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s30.html) of the [Adoption Act 2000](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) ("the Act") to the making of an adoption order in favour of a step-parent of a child is satisfied.  The qualification concerns the consent of the child's mother. Although M has deposed that she consents to the adoption of her child by her husband, that consent is not effective for the purposes of the Act because it is not made in accordance with Division 2 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/index.html#p5) of the Act. For the consent of M to be effective: 
D must ensure that the prescribed mandatory information is given to M [(s (2)(a))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s59.html); 
M must sign an instrument of consent in accordance with the prescribed form [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s61.html); before signing the instrument of consent M must be counselled in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s63.html); the consent cannot be given until at least 14 days after M is given a copy of the instrument of consent and the mandatory written information [(s (b))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s60.html); and the instrument of consent must be witnessed in accordance with the
Regulations by a person of a class or description prescribed by the
Regulations and who is independent of the counsellor [(s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s62.html); [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ar2003198/s35.html) of the [Adoption Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ar2003198/) prescribes who can witness the instrument of consent.
 I do not consider that there is power to make an order dispensing with the requirement that M provide an effective consent. The only arguable power to dispense with M's consent is under [s (1)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ar2003198/s67.html)
But that power would only be available if D were an "authorised carer" of the child [(s (1)(d)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ar2003198/s67.html)
It does not appear that he is an "authorised carer" as that expression is defined. In any event, as the Act prescribes a formal process for obtaining effective parental consent, even in the case of adoption by a step-parent, it would not be a sufficient ground for making a consent dispense order (if there were jurisdiction to do so) that M has expressed her consent in her affidavit.
 The adoption order, when made, will not affect M's status as parent of the child, provided she and D are still living together ([Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/), [s (3)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s95.html)
To avoid any possible later doubts about this I propose, when making the adoption order in favour of D, also to make a declaration that M does not cease to be regarded in law as the parent of the child. For that purpose I will require an up-to-date affidavit that D and M are still living together.
 On there being evidence that M has given her consent to the adoption of the child which is an effective consent for the purposes of the Act, and upon receiving up-to-date evidence that D and M are living together, the adoption order will be made.
