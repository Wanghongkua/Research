SUSAN MARY QUINN versus CIC INSURANCE LIMITED ACN 004 078 880 /96 
Friday 7 March 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
GROVE J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff's summons seeks leave to commence proceedings by way of enforcement of charge in respect of a contract of insurance between the defendant (CIC) and Ribus Holdings Pty Limited (Ribus): [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/), [s 6.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) The evidence on the summons consisting of the affidavits of Genevieve Henderson (2) and James Bernard Riley is uncontroversial.

The plaintiff was employed at a mail exchange. Ribus consigned liquid in a glass container by means of a posted parcel. In transit at the mail exchange, the container broke and strong fumes emanated. The plaintiff suffered physical and psychiatric injury. She sued Ribus in the District Court for damages for negligence and later in that action by motion sought to join CIC as a second defendant. On 5 May 1994 that motion was dismissed. In the meantime, Ribus had joined CIC as a third party in accordance with the procedures of the District
Court.

The hearing commenced on 22 November 1995 and evidence concluded on the following day. On that day Ribus and CIC filed terms of settlement which provided that, by consent and without any admission, there should be verdict and judgment for CIC on the third party proceedings.

The presiding judge (Cooper DCJ) found for the plaintiff against Ribus and entered judgment in her favour on 28 November 1995 for $250,000. There is evidence that the plaintiff is unlikely to be able to have that judgment satisfied by Ribus.

At the date of tort there was in existence a policy of insurance in a form that can conveniently be looked at in the exhibit to Mr Riley's affidavit. The policy was in force as to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s1.html) "public liability" but not as to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s2.html) "products liability".

The current issue requires examination of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s1.html) and exclusion clause (e) viz: "The Company will pay to or on behalf of The Insured all sums which The
Insured shall become legally liable to pay for compensation in respect of bodily injury (which expression in this Policy includes death and illness) damage to property (which expression in this Policy includes loss of property) occurring during the Period of Insurance as a result of an accident and happening in connection with The Business.
 .........................................................

EXCEPTIONS APPLICABLE TO [SECTION ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s1.html) ONLY 
The Company shall not be liable for .........................................................
 claims in respect of bodily injury or damage to property caused by the nature condition or quality of goods (which expression includes containers) sold or supplied by The Insured other than goods under the control or in the actual physical custody of The Insured or any person in the direct service of The Insured goods sold or supplied at or from a canteen provided by The Insured primarily for the use of employees of The Insured. " 
The relevant portion of the statute is the proviso contained in [s (4):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) "6 (4) Every such charge as aforesaid shall be enforceable by way of an action against the insurer in the same way and in the same court as if the action were an action to recover damages or compensation from the insured; and in respect of any such action and of the judgment given therein the parties shall, to the extent of the charge, have the same rights and liabilities, and the court shall have the same powers, as if the action were against the insured: 
Provided that, except where the provisions of subsection (2) apply, no such action shall be commenced in any court except with the leave of that court.
Leave shall not be granted in any case where the court is satisfied that the insurer is entitled under the terms of the contract of insurance to disclaim liability, and that any proceedings, including arbitration proceedings, necessary to establish that the insurer is so entitled to disclaim, have been taken." 
The contentions on behalf of CIC against the grant of leave were threefold.

The first was that the plaintiff's application is barred by operation of the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/). The plaintiff's cause of action accrued against Ribus on 26 May 1988. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/s14.html) of the lastmentioned Act specifies a six year limitation period. The summons for leave was filed in Court on 29 October 1996. It was put that time runs from the creation of the charge which would have been concurrent with the commission of the tort. Such proposition found favour in Cambridge Credit v
Lissenden [1987 8 NSWLR 411] and Ratcliffe versus VS & B Border Homes Limited 1987 ANZ Ins. Cases 60-789. It has however, since been held that as leave is a necessary ingredient in the cause of action, time does not run until that leave is obtained: Ceric versus CE Heath Underwriting & Insurance (Australia)
Pty Limited 1994 122 FLR 123 and Oswald versus Bailey (No 1) [1992 31 NSWLR .] 
Despite these authorities, it was submitted that the reasoning, particularly that which led to the conclusion in Oswald has been invalidated by the approach manifestly taken by the High Court to the construction of [s6(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s6.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) in
Bailey versus New South Wales Medical Defence Union <case>; [1995 184 CLR 399.] It is unnecessary for me to do more than note this submission as it was acknowledged by senior counsel for CIC, with his usual candour, that he anticipated that I would feel constrained to treat myself bound by the direct authority of Oswald - as I do - and accordingly any argument contrary to that case must be addressed to a court having the authority to depart from it.

The second argument asserted that the judgment in the District Court in favour of CIC on the third party claim "concludes the issue". The plaintiff's motion to join CIC as an additional defendant was dismissed by consent in the circumstance that Ribus had brought those third party proceedings. There is no reason to impute to the plaintiff any contemplation that Ribus was not a "perfectly good defendant" from whom she could seek recovery of damages for the tort. Any issue as to the existence of available indemnity lay between
Ribus and CIC. That Ribus did not pursue its claim against CIC was not something to which the plaintiff was a participant nor had she any standing so to do. Although that non pursuit could potentially act against her interests - as it has thus far - it cannot be suggested that she sought the abandonment of the claim by Ribus against CIC.

In support of argument CIC points to the circumstance that the Law Reform Act expressly permits action notwithstanding judgment recovered (s 6(5)) but says nothing about liability having "been formally found not to exist". There was no such finding and the effect of the judgment was that Ribus yielded any claimed right by it to be indemnified by CIC in respect of the claim by the plaintiff against it. There is no relevant res judicata.

The third and principal thrust of CIC's argument was directed to seeking to satisfy the Court that it was entitled under the terms of the contract of insurance to disclaim liability. Save indirectly by the judgment on the third party notice there have apparently been no proceedings seeking to establish whether CIC was entitled to disclaim. The argument was drawn from the findings by Cooper DCJ that the plaintiff's damage occurred in circumstances which he found and described in the following terms: "The evidence quoted thus far satisfies me on the balance of probabilities that inhalation of the vapours emanating from the bottle containing dimethyl-
P-toluidine acrylic monomers brought about physical changes of a permanent nature which have caused hyper sensitivity to certain types of smells. (p 17) ....................................................

Accordingly I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff's complaints are genuine and that they are a direct consequence of the inhalation of vapour from the bottle containing dimethyl-P-toluidine acrylic monomers on 26 May 1988. (p 20)" 
I am unpersuaded that the concept of causation expressed in exclusion condition (e) permits the narrow perception offered. Causation, which was essential to the giving rise of the claim, lies in the assignments of negligence found in combination to have established tort liability and damage was caused by exposure to goods - the vapours of which were harmful - and not by the nature, condition or quality of the goods absent the operative factor of exposure.

On behalf of the plaintiff it was argued that, in any event, the evidence showed that the material was despatched COD so that at the time they were quarantined from the exception by reason of not being at that point "sold and supplied" and being under the control or in the actual physical custody of the postal service which was within the scope of the notion expressed by the phrase in "the direct service of the insured". Surprising as that proposition is at first blush in connection with the postal service it was submitted that the phrase must be intended to extend to persons other than employees for whose acts vicarious responsibility must be assumed and that therefore the postal service is in no different situation from any other contracted carrier in such context.

No consideration, discretionary or otherwise, leads me to conclude that the plaintiff should not have the leave sought.

It is noted that at the hearing the plaintiff foreshadowed some textual amendment to the draft statement of claim exhibited to the affidavit filed on her behalf and that, provided amendment did not go beyond the indicated minor changes, it was not anticipated that CIC would object.

I make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1-4 of the summons.
