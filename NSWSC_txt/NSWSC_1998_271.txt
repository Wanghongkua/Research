Nemeth versus Reachcord Pty Ltd Matter No 1905/98 [1998] NSWSC 271 (3 June )

Last Updated: 12 August 1998 `KATHERINE EVA NEMETH versus REACHCORD PTY LTD` `1905/98` `3 June 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT. 
HIS HONOUR: This is a dispute between a mortgagor and her mortgagee over a residential property at McMahons Point. 
Although there were earlier mortgages between the plaintiff and her former solicitor, Mr Kennedy, the current mortgage is one granted by the plaintiff to
Mr Kennedy on 11 April 1997.

The mortgage, it would appear, is a third mortgage. The mortgage is a [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) mortgage which is registered as 2988566F. It incorporates the provisions of memorandum V703264. The mortgage says that it is in consideration of $40,000 lent to the mortgagor at her request, receipt of which is acknowledged, and provides that that sum will be paid on 11 June 1997, together with interest to be paid on the eleventh of each month.

In actual fact Mr Kennedy and the plaintiff had entered into a series of security documents, mainly to secure costs which Mr Kennedy was claiming from the plaintiff and one of her companies. Such a security is one which can be entered into between solicitor and client because of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s191.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), which replaced similar provisions, though not in the same words, formerly contained in [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s212.html) to [214](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s214.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).

On 13 May 1997, Mr Kennedy entered into heads of agreement with the defendant, whereby Mr Kennedy agreed to assign his mortgage for $35,000. Pursuant to this agreement the parties executed the statutory form of transfer of mortgage, which also bears date 13 May 1997. The transfer was duly registered as
M, but the evidence does not permit me to say exactly when it was registered. Obviously it was after 13 May 1997.

On 17 June 1997 Mr Kennedy purported to give the plaintiff a notice under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) alleging failure to pay at least the interest due on 11 June 1997. The plaintiff received this notice on 20 June. There is no evidence as to what happened, but presumably matters settled down. The only significance is that the notice was given on that day by Mr Kennedy rather than by the defendant.

The next event occurred on 3 February 1998 when the defendant's solicitor wrote to the plaintiff complaining that the plaintiff was substantially in default under the mortgage and that the defendant would be exercising its power of sale. This seems to be the first time that the plaintiff was notified of the transfer of mortgage.

On 23 February 1998 the defendant's solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor a letter which said, inter alia, that "for the sake of completeness" a notice of assignment was being given and that notice, seemingly under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s12.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), was enclosed.

On 16 March 1998 a real estate agent gave notice to the occupier of the subject property that it would be auctioned on 23 April. This came to the plaintiff's knowledge. On 26 March the defendant's solicitor told the plaintiff's solicitor that if they were going to stop the sale they had already delayed too long for an injunction to be granted, but if they were going to move the court they should move promptly. The result was that a summons was filed in this matter on 1 April 1998.

On 16 April 1998 a notice purporting to be under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) was given by the defendant to the plaintiff. A copy of this notice, which will feature largely in these reasons, is attached as an appendix to these reasons.

The plaintiff filed a statement of claim on 1 May 1998 pursuant to directions which were given. The defendant moved to strike out the statement of claim, or part of it, but an order was made by Santow J on 18 May that the matter be set down before me for final hearing today.

Unfortunately, the hearing was on the basis that judgment would be given today because there is a sale scheduled for tomorrow. With great co-operation of counsel we were able to read the affidavits of five witnesses, have two sets of cross-examination and legal submissions made all within an hour and a quarter, and I had two hours to consider my decision. One could have wanted a more leisurely process of thought, but I believe that with counsels' assistance I have been able to finally decide the legal results of the parties' contentions.

A number of matters arise for consideration and I will endeavour to deal with these under a series of heads and in connection with each head mention the relevant facts.

There is very little factual dispute, so there is no need to spend time working out which way the truth lies. The matters which arise for consideration seem to me to be these: 
A. Is the defendant bound by any equities existing between the plaintiff and
Mr Kennedy? 
B. How, if at all, do the provisions of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) affect the defendant? 
C. Can it be said that the mortgage is really for a nil amount because no liability for paying Mr Kennedy's fees has yet arisen? 
D. What is the effect of the transfer of the mortgage? 
E. Is the plaintiff prevented from bringing these proceedings without paying the full amount of the mortgage into court? 
F. Is the notice under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s57.html) of 16 April 1998 valid? 
G. Has the power of sale under the mortgage arisen? 
H. What orders should be made? 
I will deal with these matters in turn.

A. Mr McVay, who appeared for the plaintiff, put that the basic scenario was that this was a mortgage which was given by a client to her solicitor to secure costs. The solicitor knew that, as did the plaintiff. The [Legal
Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s173.html) made it clear that an assignee of a solicitor was to be considered a solicitor for the purpose of recovery of costs. As this action was to recover costs, the defendant was in the same plight as Mr Kennedy.

Furthermore, a notice of assignment under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s12.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) had been given. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s12.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) expressly says that the assignee takes subject to equities and, accordingly, the defendant took subject to the equities (including any applicable estoppel) which had bound Mr Kennedy, the assignor.

It is the case that as a general rule an assignee is bound by the equities which affect the assignor; see for instance Roadshow Entertainment Pty Ltd v (ACN 053006269) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1997) 42 NSWLR 462.] What is an "equity" for the purpose of this rule need not be discussed too keenly in these reasons. Ordinarily it means an interest which will be given effect to by a Court of Equity on the ground of conscience. Usually, it does not cover a situation where, procedurally at common law, the person would be prevented from raising a defence.

The problems involving the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) I will deal with under section B of these reasons.

So far as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s12.html) is concerned, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s6.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) provides that the Act is not to apply to [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) land, with certain exceptions. None of these exceptions apply here. Accordingly, prima facie, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s12.html) does not apply to the transfer of a mortgage of [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) land.
There is, in my opinion, no question of a pro tanto repeal of the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s12.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). This view is reinforced by the fact, as I mention in section D, that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) does provide a full regime for the transfer of [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) mortgages.

Thus in my view the question under heading A must be answered "No".

I should add that there is no evidence that the defendant ever had notice of the fact that the previous mortgagee was taking a mortgage in respect of legal costs. The only evidence on this matter was given by Mr Robinson, who appears to be the controlling director of the defendant. He says he heard through the grapevine that this investment was available and he considered that it was an appropriate purchase, and he purchased the mortgage for the sum that I have already mentioned. There is nothing on the face of the mortgage which shows that it is in connection with legal costs and if it be a question as to whether there are any equities and whether the defendant is a bona fide purchaser for value I would have thought that probably the defendant would come out on the right side of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).
However, for the reasons I have already given, it is not necessary to consider that.

B. What then is the effect of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/)? 
There are various provisions in the Act which restrict the recovery by solicitors of fees. This also refers to people who are assignees (see [s (2)(b)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s173.html)
The question might be asked "assignee of what"? The answer must be the assignee of the claim for costs.

Unless it can be shown that the document is a sham, one must look at a document according to what it says. There is no material to enable me to conclude that the current document is a sham.

There can be a series of different ways of dealing with a transaction where a person wants to have security for costs. One is that the cash can be lent and the bill paid. The second is that the prospective debt for costs can itself be procured. The mortgage in the present case is one which takes the first form.
That is, it records that there has been a debt because moneys have been advanced and the mortgage is to secure those moneys; that was the debt which was assigned by Mr Kennedy to the defendant, not any debt being a prospective claim for costs. Accordingly, the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) can have no further relevance.

However, even if that were wrong, it would not seem to me that the [Legal
Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) would necessarily be an answer to the plaintiff's claim. Provisions such as [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s192.html), which limit recovery by solicitors, do not have quite the same breadth as the plaintiff would claim. For instance, the section does not prevent a statutory demand being given by the solicitor or otherwise issuing extra curial demands; see Clarke & Walker Pty Ltd versus Thew <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 465] and Bartex Fabrics Pty Ltd versus Phillips Fox [(1994) 13 ACSR .]
Indeed, there is some authority referred to in Halsbury's Laws of England th ed vol 44 par 224, that a solicitor can present a bankruptcy petition against his client for costs before delivering a bill. I spot checked the references in the footnote in the limited time that has been available to me and have not yet found a case that actually supports the proposition, so that it is perhaps unsafe to take that matter any further, but the point remains that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s192.html) merely prevents recovery by action by a solicitor.

In the present case it is not the solicitor or his assignee who is commencing action to recover costs, the action has been brought by the client who is the mortgagor. Accordingly, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s192.html) does not stand in the way.
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s182.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) provides that a solicitor's bill is not payable in certain circumstances, which circumstances prima facie exist in the present case, until there has been an assessment of costs. If the mortgage had been a mortgage to secure those costs, then it may be that the mortgagor could say that nothing was due and payable until the costs were assessed because, generally speaking, the expression "due and payable" means at least that circumstances have come into existence which have made the bill actually payable. See Re European Life
Assurance Society [(1869) LR 9 Eq 122], 127.

However, for the reasons I have given, the question posed in heading B should be answered "Not at all".

C. It follows that the mortgage cannot be said to be for a nil amount. The evidence does not go so far as to show that no moneys were advanced by the original mortgagee. The document says they were, and prima facie that must be the position that the court takes.

There is evidence that there were a series of transactions between the plaintiff and Mr Kennedy involving previous mortgages and that the mortgage of December 1996 was one which actually referred to a deed of professional fees dated that day. However, the evidence is not sufficient to show that in the various transactions between Mr Kennedy and the plaintiff there was not an actual transaction of loan.

Accordingly, question in heading C must be answered "No".

D. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) provides that on a transfer of mortgage, which is duly registered, the right to sue upon the mortgage is vested in the transferee and: "All interests in any such debt, sum of money ... Shall be transferred so as to vest the same at law as well as in equity in the transferee thereof." 
The section has been construed so that it does not operate to pass personal rights, such as the benefit of a guarantee; see Consolidated Trust Co Ltd v
Naylor <case>; [(1936) 55 CLR 423], 435, but otherwise it is comprehensive.

The section does not, as compared to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s12.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), refer to any equities. This is understandable because the whole thrust of the Torrens
Act is that equities are to be completely disregarded (see s 41).

It is true that because of judicial decisions and later amendments to the
Torrens Act this statement is no longer completely true, but it certainly still is the whole flavour of the Act that a person who has a registered title is not to be defeated by equitable interests. There may be situations where a personal equity affecting the actual registered proprietor can be given effect to by the court, but there is not a case where an equity in the true sense, or some sort of estoppel which affects the assignor, survives a registered assignment under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/).

Mr McVay referred me to Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd versus Vlattas <case>; [(1973) 129 CLR 1] at 17 where a lease, which was in breach of the New South
Wales Industrial Arbitration Act and vitiated thereby, obtained no further validity by registration, but that, with respect, is a quite different situation to what I have been faced with in the instant case.

It is also true that indefeasibility, if I can use that generic term, is not something which applies to each and every provision in a registered document; see Mercantile Credits Ltd versus The Shell Company of Australia Limited <case>; [(1976) 136 CLR 326.] 
However, there is no doubt at all that indefeasibility does apply to the estate which is transferred and any rights which are so intimately connected with the estate transferred that they cannot be severed. In view of <case>, that must include the assignment of the debt.

E. The next problem is whether the plaintiff is debarred from this action because she has not brought into court the amount due to redeem the mortgage.
This is what is often called the ordinary rule as to mortgagors' suits; see
Harvey versus McWatters <case>; [(1948) 49 SR 173] and Inglis versus Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia (1972) 126 CLR 161.

However, as I explained in my article "A Mortgagor's Right to Approach the
Court" [(1992) 1 APLJ 61] the rule is the ordinary rule and is not to be inflexibly applied in each case. Where a client brings in question a mortgage originally granted to her solicitor the court usually does not apply the rule: MacLeod versus Jones [(1883) 24 Ch D 289.] 
It seems to me that for this reason, and also for the reason that there is a complaint by the plaintiff that no moneys are owing under the mortgage so that the power of sale has not arisen, that the court should entertain the proceedings.

F. Is the notice of 16 April 1998 valid? 
Strictly speaking, this matter arose since the institution of the proceedings, but it has been argued and I should deal with it.

As can be seen from the appendix, there is a mis-statement of the date of registration of the transfer of mortgage in recital B, though this is not likely to be such as to mislead and I can just disregard it.

There are then five headings given of what can neutrally be called complaints by the mortgagee. I will use the numbering referred to in the appendix as I deal with each of those complaints.
The first complaint is that the principal which became due and payable has not been repaid. I cannot see why this is other than a valid complaint for the reasons I have already given.
There is then a complaint that there has been a default under cl 16 of
Memorandum V703264 by granting licences and parting with possession of parts of the mortgaged premises.

The facts appear to be that the plaintiff is a doctor who practices at Penrith and very often works nights. She more often than not stays overnight at premises at Penrith. However, about once a week she resides on the mortgaged premises in her own room, of which she is the exclusive keyholder. There are a series of other people who pay an average of $160 for a room for which they have a key of their own, they come and go when they like, some have shared bathroom facilities, others perhaps a bathroom of their own, and they share the kitchen.

Clause 16 of the memorandum provides that the mortgagor should not without consent: "Part with the possession of the mortgaged premises or allow any other person to be in possession or occupation thereof".

There are a series of cases decided under the [Landlord and Tenant(Amendment)
Act 1948](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1948257/) dealing with that sort of covenant; see eg 10A Challis Avenue Pty Ltd v
Seddon [(1961) 62 SR 450.]
The authorities show that although the question is one of fact and degree, almost always parting with possession of part of the premises is not parting with possession. This has been indeed the law for over a century: see
Bristol Corporation versus Westcott [(1879) 12 Ch D 461.] 
There may have been a breach of the covenant to allow another person to be in occupation of the premises, though again one would have to consider whether on the proper construction of cl 16 of the memorandum that meant the whole of the premises or only part of the premises. However, I do not need to consider that because the court does not permit a person to rely on a ground for a power of sale which he or she could have relied on, but did not.

The other problem that arises here is that the notice does not say what must happen as a result of default, if there be a default. [Section (3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) requires the mortgagor to observe the covenants, agreements or conditions. The notice merely notes that there has been a default, it does not make any requirement on the mortgagor. It can be seen from the correspondence between the solicitors for both parties that the solicitors for the mortgagee (the defendant) took the view that there had been an irremediable breach. The way in which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) is presented is that the tenant is to be given an opportunity to remedy. However, as the breach under 2 has not been made out the matter need not be taken any further.
The next question is whether there has been a breach by contravening the
North Sydney Local Council Environmental Plan 1979 by having the premises used as a boarding house. The second clause in the memorandum requires the mortgagor to comply with all requirements of the local municipal or other authority in respect of the mortgaged premises and cl 3 requires her to comply with all the ordinances of a statutory authority, including the local council.
It is alleged that the mortgagor is in breach of both of these clauses by permitting the house to be used as a boarding house.

The evidence shows that the zoning of this particular part of McMahons Point permits dwelling houses but not boarding houses, unless the consent of the local authority is given. The local authority never gave its consent for using the premises as a boarding house.

I have already related the facts as to the occupation of the premises.

The relevant local environmental plan defines boarding house as meaning: "A residential building that is let in lodgings which primarily or principally provides lodgers with a principal place of residence, but does not include backpackers' accommodation, serviced apartments or a motel." 
Definitions such as this have been considered by the court in previous cases, the most useful of which for present purposes is Church of England
Children's Homes Burwood versus Burwood Municipal Council [(1981) 43 LGRA ], a decision of J McLelland CJ in the Land and Environment Court.

I agree with the submission of Mr Archer for the defendant that the facts in this case clearly show that the premises are being used as a boarding house.

Thus the default referred to in 3 has been made out. However, again the situation is that there is nothing said to the mortgagor requiring her to put things back into order. This is what [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) requires and, indeed, it must always be remembered that covenants in the mortgage or instruments incorporated into the mortgage are there not because they are good in themselves but because they preserve the security of the mortgagee and thus it is more important that they be observed, rather than be used as a technicality for calling up the mortgage.
The next matter involves the costs and expenses in respect of enforcement of the mortgage. It is true that under cl 38(b)(iii) of the mortgage the costs, charges and expenses of a mortgagee in connection with the exercise or attempted exercise of a power of sale are added to the principal sum. These are usually dealt with by way of account between the parties. They can be estimated and added to a notice under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html), but it must appear that the figure arrived at is in the ballpark of what would be allowed by the Master when accounts are taken between the parties.

In the instant case the figure under 4(a) of the appendix for auctioneers' and agents' expenses may very well be in that ballpark figure, but there is nothing to show, especially when there seems to be counsel's fees added as well, why the mortgagor should be liable for counsel's fees in connection with the power of sale. The memorandum thus does not seem to me on the face of it to show a reasonable demand for a figure for the mortgagee to recover.

Of course, it is not always necessary to state the exact sum that is required and a notice can merely say that the mortgagee demands payment of the principal or the interest, and even if a notice over-estimates the amount due it may still succeed as a valid notice; see the cases referred to in par [20.13] of the Australian edition of Fisher and Lightwood's Law of
Mortgage (Butterworths Sydney 1995).

The fact that counsel's fees are mentioned, and on the material before me the amount is more likely than not to be an over-estimate, is not a matter which in itself would invalidate the notice, but it is an issue which needs to be considered in connection with other factors.

It should be pointed out that this is not the matter referred to in [s (3)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) which enables the mortgagee to add to the notice the costs and expenses of preparing and serving the notice.
The fifth matter concerning provision of information by the mortgagor to the defendant is not one which I am satisfied has been established in fact.
The mortgagor was originally obliged to provide insurance policies to Mr
Kennedy. There is no material to show that she knew that there was any transfer of the mortgage until February of this year and, even if she did know, she was not obliged to again give the transferred mortgagee the same information as she might already have given. She did originally give the information to Mr Kennedy and it would seem that she has now given the information to the defendant, and I would not be satisfied that this is a default that can be relied on.

G. Has the power of sale arisen? [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s58.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) show that the power of sale cannot arise until one month after a proper notice is given.
The notice ends up by saying that unless the requirements of this notice are complied with within one month it is proposed to exercise the power of sale.
The requirements are not identified and so the ordinary meaning is that every one of the requirements must be satisfied.

As I have said, there is a valid requirement under 1, there is a possibly valid requirement under 4, and there is a matter under 3 where there is a breach, but there has been no proper requirement to remedy.

The matter is a borderline one as to whether the notice fairly brings to the attention of the mortgagor all that she is required to do. She would think, it seems to me, that she had no chance at all if there was a breach in 3 (and I realise that she has always argued that there has not been). In addition there is always the over-estimate on the evidence of the counsel's fees as stated in and the requirement adverted to in number 5.

I think in all the circumstances that the notice does not sufficiently direct the mortgagor as to what she has to do, nor does it comply with [s (3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) and, accordingly, the power of sale has not arisen.

H. What then is the result of the case? 
It seems to me that the plaintiff is not entitled to the orders that she sought in her summons, which are orders restraining the power of sale. The very most that she is entitled to is an order restraining the defendant from exercising the power of sale without a fresh and proper [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s52.html) notice being issued.

The question then arises as to whether that relief should be given on condition or not.

So far as the statement of claim is concerned, it would seem to me that apart from perhaps prayer (vii), which is the same sort of injunction, and perhaps which is a declaration that the notice already issued is invalid, the plaintiff's claim must be dismissed.

Since saying the above I have put to counsel that it would be appropriate now to adjourn the matter for six weeks. Both counsel concur in that.

Accordingly, I will stand the matter over for mention at 9.30am on 16 July and the only order I make is an order restraining the defendant from exercising its power of sale as mortgagee of land contained in certificate of title 1/921200 up to and including the 16 July 1998 and reserve further consideration.
