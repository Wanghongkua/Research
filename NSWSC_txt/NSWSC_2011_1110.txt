Judgment  
Counsel for the applicants submitted that the order proposed might create difficulties for his clients in that, in its terms, the order might create uncertainty for them. He provided as an example that Nationwide News might publish a matter if it has a subscription arrangement or an arrangement whereby a third party extracts and uploads the material itself. I accept that to widen the ex parte orders might have unintended consequences and create uncertainty. For the reasons enunciated yesterday, I make the following orders: 
The application made by Nationwide News Pty Limited, News Digital Media
Pty Limited and Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited that the orders made on and 3 February 2011 be vacated, is dismissed.
