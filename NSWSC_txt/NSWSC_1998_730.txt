REGINA versus ANDREW JAMES CLARKE /98 April 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application for bail in respect of offences of possess implements and take and drive conveyance, the alleged offence having been committed nine days after the discharge from custody of the applicant after serving six months' fixed term for a similar offence. 
There are matters in the applicant's record which indicate a number of offences of this kind, many aliases and one offence of escape lawful custody and on one occasion the applicant did not appear before the Downing Centre
Local Court.

The application was adjourned from earlier this week until today to permit of an attempt to obtain some form of closed institution pending the disposition of the criminal matters. I have been informed that it is not now sought to proceed for whatever reason with that proposal.

In the absence of some such proposal I am not prepared to grant bail on the basis that it does seem to me that the Crown case on the present charges is a very strong one, that in view of the applicant's record, a custodial sentence would seem very likely and in particular in view of that record it seems to me there is a likelihood that further offences might be committed on bail. I appreciate the applicant's personal circumstances but having weighed the whole of the matters I am of the view that bail should be refused.

Bail is refused.
