JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The Director-General of Fair Trading, the plaintiff in these proceedings, is the successor to the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs. 
By a series of informations laid on 23 November 1993 Forbes Roberts a Public
Officer, Consumer Affairs, in the name of the Commissioner for Consumer
Affairs charged the second defendant, Australia's Best Tyre Service Pty.
Limited, with a series of contraventions of [sections (e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html), [44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html)(f) and [50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) of the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) as amended. On the same day a series of informations were laid against an officer of the second defendant alleging a series of offences under the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) as a person knowingly concerned in the second defendant's alleged contraventions of the said provisions of the Act.

The contraventions alleged related to the publication of two advertisements in relation to the pricing by the second defendant of its motor vehicle tyres.

The total number of informations laid was 46, 23 of which were in respect of the second defendant and 23 in respect of the officer.

The informations came before Local Courts at Burwood and later the Downing
Centre on a number of occasions.

On 9 November 1994 the second defendant and its affected officer challenged the sufficiency of the summonses which had been served upon them and which had been based on the said informations. Thereupon the informant sought the adjournment of the several matters to enable sealed copies of the summonses to be served.

On 19 June 1995 the second defendant and its affected officer further challenged the sufficiency of the summonses but the Court ruled against this challenge.

At this stage the second defendant and its affected officer's new solicitors,
Messrs. Gilbert & Tobin, put a submission to the Commissioner for Consumer
Affairs which Mr. Rares of Senior Counsel for the second defendant described as a "no bill" application.

The said application enjoyed some success in that the Commissioner for
Consumer Affairs indicated by facsimile dated 19 July 1995 that the
Commissioner was prepared to discontinue the informations against the affected officer and also to discontinue the 9 informations charging the second defendant with contraventions of [section (e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/). At the same time, it was clearly indicated that the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs desired to proceed with the 9 remaining informations against the second defendant charging contraventions of [section (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) of the Act, being informations described by him as numbers 10-17 (including a), and the 5 informations charging contraventions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html), being described by him as numbers 18-22.

When the matters next came before the Court, constituted by Her Worship
Magistrate Patricia O'Shane, the first defendant, on 31 July 1995 the 46 informations were given the Court numbers 29-74 on that day. Mr. Thorley of
Counsel appeared for the informant in each matter and Mr. Rares of Senior
Counsel appeared for the defendants. Mr. Thorley informed the Court that the
Commissioner for Consumer Affairs had determined to withdraw all the matters against the affected officer of the second defendant. He identified these as bearing "our numbering" 23 to 45, referring to computer code numbers appearing at the bottom of the several informations against the company officer.

Mr. Thorley then continued:- "In respect of Australia's Best Tyres Service, matters numbers 1 to 9, in our numbering, that is at the bottom of the informations, are to be withdrawn. ...
those are all the matters against [section (e)."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) 
After the learned Magistrate responded with the word "yes" Mr. Thorley continued:- "So what we have left are 10 to 22, including 16a, and they are the matters against 44(f) and 50." 
Once again Her Worship responded with the word "yes".

Mr. Rares proceeded to say:- "... your Worship, we obviously consent to the withdrawal - probably the best way of doing it is to have it dismissed by consent." 
Her Worship responded with the word "right".

Her Worship proceeded to say:- "IN RELATION TO THOSE INFORMATIONS WHICH THE PROSECUTION HAS INFORMED THE
COURT ARE TO BE WITHDRAWN, THOSE INFORMATIONS ARE IN FACT DISMISSED." 
Arrangements were then put in place for Counsel to approach the list clerk with a view to obtaining a fresh hearing date for the other matters i.e. the 9 remaining informations against the second defendant alleging contraventions of [section (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html), being the informations bearing the informant's computer numbers 10-17 (including 16a) at the foot thereof and the 5 informations alleging contraventions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) bearing the informant's computer identifications numbers 18-22 at the foot thereof.

In Local Courts printed forms, commonly referred to as bench sheets, are used to facilitate the recording by Magistrates of the manner in which matters before them have been handled.

In respect of the several informations against the company officer the learned
Magistrate noted the several Court records with the appearances before her, she placed ticks in boxes against the words "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed" and then, in boxes against the words "Signature of Magistrate", she placed her initials.

However, in respect of 22 of the 23 informations against the second defendant the learned Magistrate failed to complete the Court records in a manner which accorded with the request of the informant and her own declared intentions in respect of their disposition. As indicated above she had sent the parties away to approach the list clerk to obtain further hearing dates for the 9 informations alleging contraventions of [section (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) and the 5 alleging contraventions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) and the dates agreed upon were 27-29 November 1995. At the end of the transcript for 31 July 1995 it was recorded:- "ADJOURNED TO 27 NOVEMBER 1995".

Instead of inserting the dates "27-29/11/95" in the boxes on the relevant
Court records against the words "ADJOURNED TO (date)" and placing ticks and other notations in the boxes against the words "For-hearing (time &c.)",
Her Worship placed ticks in the boxes against the words "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed". She noted the appearances in the spaces provided and proceeded to either place her initials or her signature in the boxes against the words "Signature of Magistrate".

Whilst she dealt with the case identified by the informant's computer generated number 1 by placing ticks in the boxes against the words "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed", signing same and thereby disposing of the first of the 9 informations charging the second defendant with contraventions of [section (e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) as the parties intended, she proceeded to cause the record in respect of the remaining 8 informations, which were withdrawn, to be endorsed with words indicating that they were to be adjourned for final hearing on 27-29 November .

The net result of all this is that the learned Magistrate marked the court papers for 8 matters, which were withdrawn, "Adjourned" and 14 matters which were adjourned by consent, "Withdrawn" "Dismissed".

In the foregoing circumstances the second defendant now submits that by signing or initialling the Court records endorsed with notifications indicating "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed" in relation to the several matters charging contraventions of [sections (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) and [50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), which the parties desired to have adjourned on 31 July 1995 for further hearing on the later dates, the learned Magistrate has effectively brought those proceedings to an end, with the consequence that she is now functus officio and incapable of further considering same.

Submissions to this effect were put to the learned Magistrate by Mr. Rares when the 8 remaining informations charging the second defendant with contraventions of [section (e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) were listed before her for final hearing on 27 November 1995. Her Worship accepted these submissions despite submissions put by Mr. Thorley on behalf of the informant that there had been an obvious clerical error and that the Court was under a duty to hear evidence in the 9 cases under [section (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) and the 5 cases under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) if the informant desired to put evidence before the Court. The transcript of proceedings records Mr. Thorley as saying:- "... it is my submission that your Worship, being presented with an information that is within jurisdiction can only act, or has to act under the provisions of the statute, and that effectively we have asked, or the prosecution has asked your Worship to hear evidence and to adjudicate on certain charges, and we say that hasn't yet been done.
 ... we would say that you are not functus officio because you have not deliberated upon the matters, and made a decision following such deliberations. ..." 
Her Worship proceeded to say:- "It is accepted by all, including myself, that I made a serious error in marking the subject papers in the way that I did. However, in terms of whether or not I had any power to record a dismissal of informations, that is I am sure not in dispute. ...

The fact is there was a simple error, but the further fact is that a particular record was made in relation to certain of the informations which do have now a good deal of legal force behind them ...

ACCORDINGLY THIS COURT DOES NOT HAVE ANY FURTHER JURISDICTION, OR ANY FURTHER
POWER TO EXERCISE ANY JURISDICTION IN RELATION TO THOSE PARTICULAR MATTERS." 
In respect of the remaining 8 informations charging contraventions of [section (e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html)
Her Worship then proceeded to formally record ticks against the boxes "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed" on the Court records and signed same.

In these proceedings the plaintiff contends that the 9 informations alleging contraventions of [section (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) and the 5 alleging contraventions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) are not at an end and the Court should order that the matters be remitted to the learned Magistrate for hearing according to law.

The prayers for relief sought by the Plaintiff in the Summons filed 6 February include the following:- "1. An order pursuant to section 134 of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) that the
First Defendant correct her error made on 31 July 1995 when she incorrectly noted as "withdrawn" and "dismissed" fourteen (14) informations alleging offences by the Second Defendant which had not been withdrawn by the Plaintiff as Informant.
A declaration that the First Defendant was not "functus officio" and unable to correct her error when the Plaintiff sought to proceed with the hearing of the said Informations on 27 November 1995.
Alternatively, an order that the error of the First Defendant be corrected and the Informations be remitted to the First Defendant for hearing according to law.
Further or other orders as the court deems fit." 
In my opinion it is necessary to have regard to the following principles in determining the issues arising in this case:-
A court may be invested with express powers and implied powers. It may also possess inherent powers (Grassby v. The Queen <case>; [(1989) 168 CLR 1] at 15-17).
A court's express jurisdiction will arise by Statute.
Its implied jurisdiction will arise upon the principle that a grant of express power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise (per
Dawson J in Grassby at page 16). Recognition of the existence of implied powers is called for whenever they are required for the effective exercise of a jurisdiction which is expressly conferred but are confined to so much as can be "derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction". (Per Dawson J in Grassby at page 17).

By way of illustration, a Magistrate exercising jurisdiction under the [Local
Courts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lca1982149/) as amended has an implied discretionary power to grant leave to an informant to withdraw an information charging an offence punishable summarily where the informant applies for leave to withdraw the information before any hearing has commenced (per James J in Lay versus Cleary unreported, Supreme Court of New
South Wales 23 February 1993 at pages 30-31).
Inherent jurisdiction is not something derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction (per Menzies J in The
Queen v. Forbes; Ex parte Bevan <case>; [(1972) 127 CLR 1] at 7). Inferior courts with limited jurisdiction which do not have any general responsibility for the administration of justice beyond the confines of their constitutions, such as the Local Court, Downing Centre in this case, do not possess any inherent powers (per Dawson J in Grassby at pages 15-16).

Accordingly, for example, such Courts do not possess any inherent power to correct a clerical mistake or error in a judgment or an order if it was the result of an accidental slip or omission (cf. Storey & Keers Pty. Limited v. Johnstone [(1987) 9 NSWLR 446] at 449 per
McHugh J.A.; Ex parte Hassell; Re Quirk <case>; [(1937) 37 SR 192] at 198-9 and Milson v. Carter <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 366] at 376 per Barwick C.J.; Isaacs v. Robertson [(1985) 1 A.C.
] at -2; Cameron v. Cole <case>; [(1944) 68 CLR 571).] Accordingly, once an order disposing of a proceeding has been perfected by being drawn up as the record of a Court, that proceeding, apart from any specific and relevant statutory provision, is at an end in that Court and is in its substance beyond recall by that Court (Bailey versus Marinoff <case>; [(1971) 125 CLR 529] at 539 per
Barwick C.J.).
On the other hand, proceedings in inferior courts can be found to be a nullity. In such cases, the decision which is void may have some effect or existence in law until declared so by a court. Nevertheless, if the proceedings are a nullity, it is open to the Court to retrace its steps and conduct a hearing according to law without the intervention of a higher court (Cameron v. Cole <case>; [(1944) 68 CLR 571] at 586; Taylor v. Taylor <case>; [(1979) 143 CLR 1] at 8; Rex v. Marsham; Ex parte Pethick Lawrence [(1912) 2
KB 362] at 364; Ex parte Kelly; Re Teece (1966) 85 W.N. (Pt.1) 151 at 157; Ex parte Kent; Re Callaghan [(1969) 2 NSWR 184] at 186;
Calvin v. Carr <case>; [(1980) A.C.
] at -90; Russell v. Bates <case>; [(1927) 40 CLR 209] at 213 and Thomas v. Bell [(1989) 42 A Crim R 318] at ).
Unless proceedings in an inferior court, such as the Local Court, Downing
Centre in this case, are a nullity, the presiding Magistrate becomes functus officio once his or her decision is announced (In the Matter of a Plaint of
Irving v. Askew (1870) L.R. V QB 208 at 211; Regina v. Hackett, Ex Parte
Cline (1882) VIII VLR (cases at law) 129 at 131; Regina v. Essex Justices;
Ex Parte Final [(1963) 2 QB 816] at 821 and
Thomas v. Bell (supra) at page 321. See also Graziers Association of New
South Wales v. Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women <case>; [(1949) 49 SR 300] at 303 and note paragraph 13 below).
When, in the case of a summary offence, an informant seeks leave to withdraw an information and a Magistrate grants leave to do so, then there is nothing left to try. Accordingly, cryptic markings by a Magistrate on the
Court's papers "Withdrawn" "Dismissed" should be construed as information withdrawn, summons (not information) dismissed. Withdrawal, by leave, does not give rise to any estoppel by res judicata. (Regina v. Phipps; Ex parte Alton [(1964) 2 QB 420] at 427; Lawson v. Wallace [(1968) 3 NSWR 82] at 85-6).
Every party to proceedings in an inferior court has the right to have his case heard in his presence, to call his witnesses and give his evidence - to appear and present his case (Cameron v. Cole (supra) at page 589 and Taylor v. Taylor (supra) at pages 4, 22).
An inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction (including the making of an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise, jurisdiction) or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that jurisdiction does exist. Such jurisdictional error can infect either a positive act or a refusal or failure to act. (Craig v. The State of South Australia <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 163] at 177; see also Ex parte Russell <case>; [(1908) 8 SR 173] cf. Ex parte Brown; Re McNamara (1967) 85 WN [(Pt )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lca1982149/s2.html) [22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lca1982149/s22.html) at 35).
Where prerogative relief is sought, at least in the nature of certiorari, on the ground of jurisdictional error or breach of procedural fairness, a superior court can, subject to applicable procedural and evidentiary rules, take account of any relevant material placed before it (Craig v. The State of
South Australia (supra) at page 176).
Whilst relief under section 134 of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) as amended is to be distinguished from mandamus, the power of the Court under section 134 is no less than the prerogative power of mandamus. (Sankey v.
Whitlam [(1977) 1 NSWLR 333] at 346-7).

It is also necessary to have regard to the following matters:-
Under the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) as amended and the [Local Courts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lca1982149/) as amended no powers in the nature of a slip rule have been expressly or by implication conferred upon Magistrates sitting in Local Courts (cf [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s24.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/index.html#p16)
Rule 10(1) of the [Local Courts (Civil Claims) Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/lccr1988299/)).
The express powers of a Magistrate to dismiss an information are to be found in [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s74.html), [76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) and [80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s80.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), none of which had any application on 31 July 1995 to the circumstances which prevailed in this case in relation to the 14 matters which the parties desired to have adjourned for hearing as contested matters on 27 November 1995.
In the event that the said matters were lawfully adjourned for hearing on November 1995, Her Worship was bound to proceed to hear the cases on that day given the terms of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s77.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) which provided as follows:- "77. If, upon the day and at the time and place appointed for hearing or to which the hearing or further hearing has been adjourned, both parties appear in person or by their respective counsel or attorneys the Justice or Justices shall proceed to hear the case."
Prior to the commencement of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), section of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) relevantly provided as follows:- "134(1) Where a Justice refuses to do any act relating to the duties of his office as such Justice, the person requiring such act to be done may apply to the Supreme Court, upon an affidavit of the facts, for a rule calling upon such Justice and the person to be affected by such act to show cause why such act should not be done.

If after due service of such rule good cause is not shown against it, the
Court may make the same absolute with or without or upon payment of costs.

Upon being served with the rule absolute, the Justice shall obey the same and do the act by it required to be done.
 ..."
Upon the commencement of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), the power of the Court to issue a writ of mandamus was replaced by a power to make an order in the nature of mandamus (see [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/)). At the same time section 134 of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) was repealed and replaced by a new section 134 which relevantly provided as follows:- "134(1) The Supreme Court may, on application by any person, by order direct a
Justice to do any act relating to the duties of his office." 
In the foregoing circumstances, applying the abovementioned principles and having regard to the abovementioned matters, I am of the opinion that:- 
The several informations charging the second defendant with contraventions of [sections (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) and [50](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) were duly adjourned, by consent, to 27 November 1995.

The several notations made by Her Worship on the Court records of the
Local Court, Downing Centre, with ticks against the boxes "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed" in respect of the said informations were a nullity in circumstances where the informant had not asked Her Worship for leave to withdraw the informations and she had no power to dismiss them even if the ticks in the boxes against the word "Dismissed" were intended to apply to the informations and not simply to the summonses based thereon.

By declining to hear the cases on 27 November 1995 when both parties were represented by Counsel and finding that the Court did not have any further jurisdiction, Her Worship committed a jurisdictional error.

That jurisdictional error is such as to entitle this Court by order to direct Her Worship to proceed to hear the said cases.

This Court may properly have regard to the evidence of Mr. Brunero contained in his affidavit sworn 1 February 1996 and to the Exhibits which have been tendered and admitted into evidence in determining the matter.

Mr. Rares submitted that the manner of expression of the first three prayers for relief contained in the summons in this matter confined the plaintiff to presenting a case for the existence of a power of "correction" in the Local
Court i.e. something in the nature of a slip rule. I do not consider that the case is so confined. The fourth prayer for relief commonly allows a party to express in a different form the substance of the case which it is making and it is clear to me that the thrust of the plaintiff's case is that the use by the learned Magistrate of the ticks in the boxes against the words "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed" on the relevant Court records did not render her functus officio and preclude her from proceeding to hear and determine the matters the subject of such notations which were plainly made by her by mistake when viewed in the light of her orders as orally expressed on 31 July 1995.

In any event, the third prayer for relief clearly seeks an order directing the learned Magistrate to proceed to hear the cases as required by [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s77.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).

Accordingly, subject to the question of discretion, orders should, in my opinion, be made in the plaintiff's favour in respect of the fourteen informations in question.

Mr. Rares submits that relief in the nature of mandamus is not accorded as of right but rather is discretionary. He submits that having regard to the fact that the alleged offences occurred in 1991-2, the delay which has been experienced, the expense which his client has incurred, the penalties which may be imposed are a maximum of $5,000.00 for each offending advertisement, and, so he says, the informations were laid as a result of complaints made by his client's competitors and his client has ceased to offend, the Court ought to exercise its discretion and decline to grant the relief sought.

That the Court has power, in its discretion, to withhold the remedy of mandamus is clear (The King v. Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and
Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Limited <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 389] at 400). The circumstances in which the Court will exercise its discretion to withhold the remedy are illustrated in the following passage from the judgment of the High Court in the Ozone Theatres case at page 400 where it said:- "For example the writ may not be granted if a more convenient and satisfactory remedy exists, if no useful result could ensue, if the party has been guilty of unwarrantable delay or if there has been bad faith on the part of the applicant, either in the transaction out of which the duty to be enforced arises or towards the court to which the application is made. The court's discretion is judicial and if the refusal of a definite public duty is established, the writ issues unless circumstances appear making it just that the remedy should be withheld." 
It seems clear to me that the circumstances of this case do not make it just that the relief sought by the informant under section 134 of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) should be withheld. The informant has not been guilty of any unwarrantable delay, nor has he demonstrated any bad faith in relation to the matter.

In relation to the question of costs I was informed at the commencement of the hearing, although no document is to be found in the Court's file, that the first defendant, the learned Magistrate, had filed a submitting appearance and accordingly did not appear. In my opinion there should be no order in respect of the costs of the first defendant. Otherwise, the plaintiff has been successful in the proceedings and should have his costs.

Mr. Rares has submitted that the proceedings are in the nature of an appeal under the [Suitors' Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) as amended and that his client, not being disqualified by [section (7)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) of the Act, should, in the circumstances of this case and in the event of my findings being as expressed above, be granted an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal under [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) of the Act.

Whilst it may be said that the proceedings are not in the nature of an appeal because the learned Magistrate's notations on the Court records "Withdrawn" and "Dismissed" were a nullity, I think the case falls within the principle enunciated by the Privy Council in Calvin v. Carr (supra) at page 589-90 and hence can properly be described as proceedings in the nature of an appeal.
These proceedings were instituted for the purpose of correcting an error which had been made in the court below. (Ex parte Parsons; Re [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) [(1952) WN 380] at 381 and Builders Licensing Board v. Pride
Constructions Pty. Limited [(1979) 1 NSWLR 607] at 616).

Accordingly, the Court's orders will be:-
Direct the first defendant to hear and determine according to law the 9 cases against the second defendant charging contraventions of [section (f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s44.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) which were the subject of informations laid against it on 23 November 1993.
Direct the first defendant to hear and determine according to law the 5 cases against the second defendant charging contraventions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s50.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) which were the subject of informations laid against it on 23 November 1993.
The second defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs.
No order as to the costs of the first defendant.
Subject to the second defendant establishing, by evidence, that it is not disqualified by [section (7)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) of the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) an indemnity certificate be granted to it under [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) of the Act.
