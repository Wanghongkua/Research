AUSTON versus ORREGO /96 February 1997 
SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ROLFE J 
Stated Case 
Magistrate correct in holding that in the absence of a prescribed notice no notice prohibiting entry to a State forest purportedly given pursuant to [s.36A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) of the [Forestry Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/) was valid.

Notice not saved by [Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s13.html) because failure to prove an essential element; 
Regulation did not have sufficient specificity: 
Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and Actors Equity of Australia Limited v
Saatchi & Saatchi Compton (Vic) Pty Limited [(1985) 10 FCR 1] applied.

Refusal to make order for costs before the Magistrate.

JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: On 22 May 1995 the respondent appeared before a Local Court Magistrate charged:- "...that (she) on the 30 day of September 1994 at Dorrigo, in the State of New South Wales did, without the prior permission of the Commission, enter into an area of Wild Cattle Creek State Forest such area being prohibited by virtue of a notice displayed with the authority of the Commission in accordance with regulation 13(1) of the Forestry Regulations 1994." 
It may be that the word "area", where secondly appearing, should read "entry" although the stated case also uses the word, but nothing turns upon that so far as the submissions before me are concerned. When the prosecution came before the Magistrate he was advised that there was a preliminary point to be argued, namely, the legal efficacy of the notice said to found the contravention by the respondent. The notice was tendered and became exhibit 1. It is headed:- "[Forestry Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/) 
Section 36(a) 
Forestry Regulation , Part 3." 
The notice asserted that the entry of all persons into or on to various land "is hereby prohibited" and that persons entering those areas without consent were to be liable to prosecution. The notice was said to be effective from 6am on 20 September 1994 until further notice.

The matter argued before the Magistrate was whether the notice constituted a notice pursuant to [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) of the [Forestry Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/), ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/)"). That section has a heading, "Control Signs" and, in [subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s1.html), defines those words as meaning:- "A standard, sign, notice or device in or similar to a form or generally answering a description prescribed for the purposes of this section." [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s41.html) (n)(ii) provides that the Governor may make regulations which are not inconsistent with the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/) in respect of:- "Prohibiting or regulating the entry of persons into and providing for the safety of persons in state forests, timber reserves and flora reserves." 
The Magistrate found - and these findings have not been disputed before me nor, as they are findings of fact, could they have been - that the notice was not a notice under [section 36A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) because, inter alia, no regulation had been made prescribing the form of such a notice for the purposes of that section. He accordingly dismissed the proceedings.

The Magistrate was requested to state a case in which he set out with clarity the facts he found, including that the notice was in the immediate vicinity of the forestry area specified and that a control sign prescribed for the purposes of [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) was not in force as at 30 September 1994. He then set out in the stated case his grounds for determination and in subparagraph (g) he stated:- "The sign itself is purporting to be under [s.36A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) [Section 36A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) clearly states that 'any direction given shall only have effect where there is erected or displayed, upon or near the State forest to which the direction relates, a control sign, that is a notice of the direction'. A control sign is defined and it is a sign similar to a form or generally answering a description prescribed for the purposes of the section and it seems to me that the regulations provide for the prescribing of the form or description of control signs, but the legislature appears not to have prescribed any form or description of control sign for the purpose of the section." 
Mr G.J. Bartley of Counsel, for the appellant, submitted that it would have been preferable for the Magistrate to have taken some evidence, but he was not requested to do so and he proceeded to determine the matter in the way in which the parties requested. The appellant cannot complain about any perceived evidentiary deficiencies in those circumstances.

The Magistrate sets out in paragraph 4 of the stated case various contentions put forward by the appellant as suggesting that his decision was erroneous in point of law. However, at the end of the day the matter was argued before me on a very narrow basis.

Firstly, it was conceded by Mr Bartley that the notice was not a notice which could derive any validity from [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/). I should also note for the sake of completeness that no point was taken before the Magistrate nor before me that the reference on the notice was to section (a), it being agreed that that should be treated as reading [section
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fa1916139/s36a.html)
The submission put by Mr Bartley was that there was also reference to the
Forestry Regulation 1994, Pt 3, within which is to be found regulation 13(1), which states:- "The Commission may, by displaying a notice to that effect in a conspicuous position in or in the immediate vicinity of a forestry area, prohibit: all persons...
 ...from entering the area ...the prohibition may be for an indefinite period or for such period or periods as are specified in the notice." 
Before the Magistrate an attempt had been made to save the notice under section 36A by reference to regulation 13(1). He rejected that particular view saying:- "Sergeant Day argues that in fact regulation 13, which is the regulation relied upon in the text of the charge, in fact prescribes the form of a sign, that is because it says" and the Magistrate then set out the terms of regulation 13. He continued:- "Before I was referred to 36A and regulation 41 and looking only at regulation 13 I was of the preliminary view, just on my own research, of forming a view that notice could be non prescribed but applicable when one only relied on regulation 13(1), but the sign itself is purporting to be under section 36A." 
The issue as ultimately argued before me was whether the existence of regulation 13 saved the notice, it being submitted by Mr Bartley that the reference to Part 3 of the Forestry Regulations was a sufficient indication of the power which was being sought to be exercised at the time the notice was displayed.

Before regulation 13(1) will operate, the notice must be displayed not only in the immediate vicinity of the forestry area specified in it, but also in a conspicuous position in the forestry area. There is no finding of fact by the
Magistrate that the notice was displayed, "in a conspicuous position". That, in itself, in my view, was fatal to the appellant's case and would have justified the dismissal of the information even if reliance could otherwise be placed upon regulation 13.

However, in his detailed written submissions Mr T.F. Robertson of Counsel for the respondent submitted another point, which is that where an administrative power is being exercised there is an obligation on the party exercising the power to do so properly. In his written submissions, which I propose to leave with the papers, he refers to a number of authorities. But for the moment I think it is sufficient to refer to the decision of the Full Court of the
Federal Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and Actors Equity of
Australia Limited versus Saatchi & Saatchi Compton (Vic) Pty Limited [(1985) FCR 1.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281985%29%2010%20FCR%201 "View LawCiteRecord" ) At page 9 Bowen CJ said, after recognising that there were circumstances in which an exercise of power for the wrong reason could nonetheless be upheld:- "Nevertheless, the question here is whether a statutory body with functions and powers specified in the legislation can purport to act under one head of power in laying down rules of general application, and have the validity of its rules upheld by a court even though the specified power did not authorise its action, on the ground that there was another appropriate power upon which it could have relied." 
His Honour said he was unaware of any local authority on the point, referred to a statement of the law in America and continued:- "The proliferation of statutory bodies authorised to lay down rules affecting citizens in one way or another makes the question an important one. On the one hand it is desirable that the proper activities of such bodies should not be hampered by unnecessary introduction of technicalities. On the other hand the citizen confronted with rules he is required to observe is entitled to know with some precision what binding authority the rules have and what the consequences of non-observance may be.
 
In my opinion, where an administrative body which states it is exercising a particular power in laying down a general rule lacks power on the stated ground, but could have laid down the rule validly under another head of power, it would generally be wrong for a court to uphold the rule as if it had been made under the unstated head of power, particularly where the consequences for the citizen of each exercise of power are different." 
I do not understand any different principle to have been applied by the other members of the court and, indeed, Fox J seems to have expressly agreed with that statement.

In my view the notice does not specify the power pursuant to which it is now submitted it was given. I do not consider that a general reference to part 3 of the regulations, which commences with regulation 9 and continues on to regulation 33, provides sufficient specificity to enable a party confronted with the notice to be aware of the provision upon which the author of the notice is purporting to rely.

For both of those reasons I am of the view that the Magistrate was correct in dismissing the information and, subject to answering the specific questions raised in the stated case, I am of the opinion that the summons brought by the appellant for the decision or determination of those questions should be dismissed.

Mr Bartley has agreed that the only question I have to answer in light of the reasons I have given is whether the Magistrate's determination was erroneous in point of law. I answer that question "no".

I order that the summons be dismissed. I order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the summons. Mr Robertson sought an order for costs before the Magistrate, although no such order was sought before the
Magistrate. It seems to me that that was the appropriate time for it to be done. There is no doubt the Magistrate had a jurisdiction, if he otherwise saw fit and was satisfied that it was appropriate, to make such an order.

Mr Robertson has submitted that this case is a test case. Apparently legislation was introduced after the Magistrate's decision to overcome its effect, and apparently the Minister said that the appeal to this Court was in the nature of what he referred to as a test case. But that situation is accommodated by the costs' order which I have made dismissing the summons. It does not, in my view, in any way alter the fact that the costs at first instance, unless they were expressly reserved which they were not, should have been sought then. In the exercise of my discretion I decline to make the further order for costs.

Mr Bartley has also referred me to [section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s81.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), which sets out a number of matters which it seems the Magistrate would have been required to look into in order to determine the question of costs. The factual matters set out there are not before me. This is an additional reason for refusing to order the appellant to pay the respondent's costs before the
Magistrate.

I order that the exhibit remain with the papers. I will note that I will leave the written submissions with the papers.
