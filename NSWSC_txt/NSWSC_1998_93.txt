BLAYNEY ABATTOIRS PTY LTD versus Craig McCONNELL & ORS 
The worker made an application in the Compensation Court of New South Wales.
He claimed weekly compensation under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) and lump sum payments under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) against various employers in relation to a series of injuries.

The trial judge awarded both lump sum and weekly payments. The lump sum payments were apportioned equally between three employers however, the weekly payments were awarded solely against Blayney Abattoirs.

On appeal: 
The trial judge, having found that the worker's incapacity resulted from more than one injury, failed to apportion liability for the weekly payments amongst the three employers.

Held: 
There is evidence to support the trial judge's finding that the appellant is wholly liable for the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) weekly payments.

JUDGMENT 
STEIN JA: The worker, Craig McConnell (the first respondent) made an application in the Compensation Court. He claimed weekly compensation under [s 40](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) and lump sum payments under [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and 67 of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) against various employers in relation to a series of injuries. 
On 27 January 1992 the first respondent suffered an accident while employed by the appellant, Blayney Abattoirs Pty Ltd. On a periodic journey to work he was involved in a motor cycle accident. He sustained serious injuries including internal injuries and back pain in the thoracic region and lower back. He was totally incapacitated until 16 June 1992 when he commenced employment with
Goulburn Meatworks. That employment lasted only 10 days because he was dismissed for smoking on the premises. He looked for work, which he ultimately obtained on 15 January 1993 with AC&E Sales Pty Ltd as a process worker.
He stayed with AC&E until 24 January 1994 when he was employed by ICM
Berrima Meats (the second respondent).

On 8 August 1994 he suffered an incident described by Egan ACCJ thus: ... while carrying a piece of a carcass he straightened up and in his words, his back "moved" and he had lower back pain and pain to the buttock. [AB 212] 
The worker continued with Berrima Meats until 15 December 1994 when the abattoirs closed and he was retrenched. While the worker continued on full duties between August and December 1994 he gave evidence, which his Honour accepted, that his back was pretty bad and he was, to some extent, carried by his workmates. [AB 212] 
In January 1995 he commenced work with the Golden Banana (the third respondent) as a packer working 25 hours per week. Of this employment his
Honour said: [the applicant] said it was very heavy work and he had terrible back pain.
This work was quite unsuitable for him. At times he needed to be helped out of bed and his left leg would lock up. He simply could not handle the work and in addition to the back pain he had further pain between the shoulder blades. He said that after he had ceased that work, he could undertake light cleaning work but not on a full time basis. [AB 213] 
The worker was forced to stop work with the third respondent on 3 November because of the continuous pain in his back.

The trial judge concluded that the worker had a 15% permanent impairment of his back. He apportioned it equally between the 3 employers, describing it as an apportionment between the 1992 incident (Blayney), the 1994 incident and `the nature and conditions of the work with the Golden Banana'.
(AB 213) In addition, his Honour found that the worker had a 5% loss of efficient use of the left leg due to the pain referred from his back. It is accepted that the apportionment also applied to this finding.

Acting Judge Egan also found that, under <case>, the worker was one-third of a most extreme case. He added that the unsuitable work at the Golden Banana played a part in the assessment under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and [AB 214] 
Turning to the weekly payments, his Honour said that the appropriate measure of his capacity to earn is that which he could have earned in suitable light to moderate employment, such as he had with AC&E. The measure of his entitlement was the difference between comparable earnings and those at
AC&E. His Honour made the award for weekly payments under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) solely against the appellant.

The appellant relies only on ground 1(b) in the Notice of Appeal. All other grounds are abandoned. This ground has been recast in the following form: b) Incapacity having resulted from more than one injury to the worker His Honour failed to apportion liability, amongst the three employers.

At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal Mr McAuley, counsel for the appellant, informed the court that only paragraph 1(1)(d) of the award was challenged. That is, the appellant conceded that it should be solely liable for the weekly compensation contained in paragraph 1(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the award. Further, as against the Golden Banana, apportionment was only sought from 4 November 1995. Thus the appeal was confined to two periods:- * 16 December 1994 to 3 November 1995, claim for apportionment of weekly compensation payments as between the appellant and the second respondent. * From 4 November 1995 and continuing, claim for apportionment of weekly compensation payments as between the appellant and the second and third respondents. 
The apportionment of compensation is controlled by [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s22.html) and [22A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s22a.html) of the Act. On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that having apportioned liability under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and on an equal basis for each respondent, the court could not find that incapacity did not result from more than one injury and refuse to apportion the weekly payments. The apportionment of the [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and liability and the decision not to apportion liability in respect of weekly compensation, are said to be so radically inconsistent as to point to an incorrect principle of law being applied.

The second and third respondents both contend that since the appeal is confined to a question of law (and not fact), see [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s32.html) of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) , the appeal must fail. The trial judge's findings on apportionment were findings of fact and not open to challenge (Azzopardi versus Tasman UEB Industries [(1985) 4
NSWLR 139).] 
I think that there is substance in the submission. His Honour's findings on the issue of apportionment and weekly payments are questions of fact and not law. If that is correct, then the appeal must be dismissed unless it can be said that his Honour fell into legal error or there was no evidence to support the finding.

It is true that his Honour gave somewhat sparse reasons. However, he did make some relevant comments about the issue with which we are concerned. In dealing with the Golden Banana he said that the unsuitable work at its premises played a part in the lump sum assessments under ss 66 and 67 but added: `his earning capacity is still the same as when he worked for AC&E'.[AB ]

It seems to me that, by implication, his Honour was saying that there should be no weekly payments as against the Golden Banana.

In relation to Berrima Meats, his Honour noted that the worker continued to perform his full duties after the August 1994 incident until the abattoirs closed in December 1994. Indeed, Egan ACCJ noted that `his condition improved' [AB 212] although `his back was pretty bad and he was to some extent carried by his work mates'. (Emphasis added) 
These statements (and the evidence of the worker at AB 52.3) appear to support a finding that Berrima Meats should not be liable for weekly payments.

A more powerful reason why the appeal should fail is found in the weekly payment awards themselves. The weekly payment for partial incapacity from the June 1992 to 24 January 1994 was $150. The appellant does not challenge that this is solely its responsibility. The disputed weekly payments (16
December 1994 and continuing) are also $150. Thus, the additional physical injuries at Berrima and the Golden Banana had not increased the worker's incapacity for work. That is, while the injuries with the second and third respondents may have effected the ss 66 and 67 lump sum assessments, they had no effect on the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s40.html) weekly payments.

In relation to the Golden Banana, the argument is even stronger. This was part-time employment (25 hours per week) earning $250 per week. His Honour found that the worker was capable of performing suitable light to moderate work such as he did with AC&E where he earned $320 per week. Therefore, his post-injury ability to earn was found to have been greater than his actual earnings with the third respondent. It follows that the worker was not entitled to an award under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s40.html) from the Golden Banana notwithstanding that the employment had contributed to his physical disability, see Hawkins versus Australasian United Steam Navigation
Company Ltd [1938] WCR 107 at 109 applied in Palazzotto versus Ardrossan Nursing
Home Pty Ltd (Compensation Court, Unreported, Neilson CCJ, 3 February 1998).
That is, the worker's increased physical disability did not sound in economic loss.

In my opinion, it was open to the trial judge not to apportion any part of the weekly payments after 16 December 1994 to the second or third respondents.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
