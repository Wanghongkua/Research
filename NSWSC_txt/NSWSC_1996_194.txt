JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: These are three appeals, by leave, against the determination by McLelland CJ in Eq of the same separate issue in each of three proceedings. In substance his determination decided two questions of interpretation of the words "enforcement action" in the [Farm Debt Mediation Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) (the Act).

Before setting out the substance of the questions I will mention the relevant parts of the Act.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s3.html) of the Act states its object: "The object of this Act is to provide for mediation concerning farm debts before a creditor can take possession of property or other enforcement action under a farm mortgage." 
A number of the terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s3.html) are defined in later sections, and the procedure for mediation is specified. The defined terms are "creditor", enforcement action" and "farm mortgage".
These are set out in full later in these reasons, but for the moment I need only say that, as I read these and other definitions they have the effect that a creditor is a secured creditor whose security is a farm mortgage; "farm mortgage" is undefined by the Act other than by having specifically included in its otherwise undefined meaning any interest in or power over land or machinery used by a farmer in a farming operation, securing obligations of the farmer. The various definitions and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s5.html) of the Act have the result that the Act only applies to secured creditors of the kind just described.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s6.html) of the Act then makes void any enforcement action by a creditor who has a farm mortgage as security, taken "otherwise than in compliance with" the Act.
This is a necessary part of the scheme to enable the mediation procedure to go forward in those cases in which it is invoked.

To give a farmer a chance to get the mediation procedure going, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s8.html) of the Act provides as the first step: "A creditor to whom money under a farm mortgage is owed by a farmer must not take enforcement action against the farmer in respect of the farm mortgage until at least 21 days have elapsed after the creditor has given a notice to the farmer under this section." 
The first step having been taken, the next step, optional to the farmer, is provided for in [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s9.html)
This allows a farmer who has been given a [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s8.html) notice to request mediation, within 21 days, "concerning the farm debt involved".

If the farmer exercises the [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s9.html) option, and gives notice under the subsection, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s10.html) then prevents a creditor from taking "enforcement action in respect of the farm mortgage" until the mediation procedure has been completed.

The details of the mediation procedure are set out in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s11.html), and are not presently relevant.
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s5.html), already mentioned, limits the application of the Act "in respect of creditors only in so far as they are creditors under a farm debt".
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s4.html) supplies definitions of terms both in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s3.html) and in other sections already referred to. The most relevant ones are: "'creditor' means a person who provides financial accommodation to a farmer that creates or increases a farm debt and includes a bank, or a credit provider within the meaning of the [Credit Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/); 'enforcement action' in relation to a farm mortgage, means taking possession of property under a farm mortgage, the sale of property under a farm mortgage, or any other action to enforce a farm mortgage including the continuing of action already commenced to enforce a farm mortgage but does not include: the completion of the sale of property held under a farm mortgage in respect of which contracts were exchanged before the commencement of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s6.html); or the enforcement of a judgment that was obtained before the commencement of that section; 'farm' means land on which a farmer engages in a farming operation.
 'farm debt' means a debt incurred by a farmer for the purposes of the conduct of a farming operation that is secured wholly or partly by a farm mortgage; 'farm mortgage' includes any interest in, or power over, property (comprising a farm or part of a farm or farm machinery used by a farmer in connection with a farming operation, or both) securing of obligations of the farmer (whether as a debtor or guarantor);" 
I here restate, in a little more detail, a point already touched on. The definition of "creditor" and [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s5.html), taken together, emphasise that the mediation process and restriction of enforcement action are imposed only on creditors owed money under a "farm debt". The definition of "farm debt" means that any such creditor is necessarily the holder of a "farm mortgage" and that any "farm debt" is necessarily secured, wholly or partly, by a "farm mortgage".
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) could therefore be rewritten, using the definitions, as: "A farm debt creditor must not take enforcement action against the farmer in respect of a mortgage wholly or partly securing the farm debt until at least days, etc." 
Although the farm debt is necessarily secured by mortgage, it is noticeable that [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html), as enacted, and more clearly I think in its rewritten form, prohibits enforcement action for the prescribed period, in respect of the farm mortgage, not the farm debt. This seems to me to be relevant to the consideration of the questions McLelland CJ in Eq had to answer.

These, as he recorded them in his reasons, were whether "(i) the service by a creditor on a debtor corporation of a statutory demand, or (ii) the commencement and prosecution by the creditor of proceedings to wind up the debtor corporation, is prohibited by [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) of the Act, where the debtor corporation is a 'farmer' within the meaning of the
Act and the debt the subject of the statutory demand and on which the creditor relies in the winding up proceedings is a 'farm debt' secured by a 'farm mortgage' within the meaning of the Act." 
McLelland CJ in Eq answered the questions "no".

As I see it, the principal argument concerns question (ii), because the nature and effect of a statutory demand (see ss 459E to 459T of the Corporations Law) make its service impossible, in my opinion, to be called enforcement action of any kind, let alone of a mortgage, so that on any view the answer to question must be no.

Question (ii) is whether winding up proceedings fall within the meaning of "enforcement action" as defined in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s4.html) of the Act? The way the definition is expressed requires the question to be stated as "are winding up proceedings 'action to enforce a farm mortgage'"? 
In my opinion the answer is "no". I will mention three principal reasons.
For the reasons I have already mentioned, the Act appears quite plainly to be imposing its temporary moratorium on actions to enforce farm mortgages, not farm debts. The distinction is significant. A farm debt is two things, a debt, and a secured debt. It does not cease to be a debt because it is also a secured debt. Had the purpose been directed against actions to enforce farm debts both as debts and secured debts, nothing would have been easier than to say so.
The result of winding up proceedings, if successful, is a court order that the company proceeded against be wound up. The making of the order itself cannot be enforcement of a mortgage. Nor can the carrying out of the court's order. Any property of an insolvent company being wound up will be sold on behalf of the company for distribution in accordance with the Corporations
Law. This procedure does not, to my mind, resemble enforcement of a mortgage.
Section 554E of the Corporations Law means that the mortgagee of property of an insolvent company in course of winding up must surrender the mortgage to the liquidator, or realise it, if that mortgagee wishes to prove as a creditor in the winding up. It follows that the commencement of winding up proceedings cannot be an action by the mortgagee to enforce the mortgage.
The mortgagee can only take part in the winding up by surrendering or realising the mortgage. This has the result that the mortgagee ceases to be a creditor for the purposes of the Act which no longer applies to the (now unsecured) creditor. Commencement of winding up proceedings by a mortgagee is almost the contrary of action to enforce a mortgage. It is the commencement of proceedings which may, if the creditor later proves all or part of the creditor's debt, result in the creditor's receiving part of a debt secured by mortgage, without having had recourse at any stage of the winding up proceedings to any of the rights and powers which are the distinguishing features of mortgages.

One argument used to support a positive rather than a negative answer to the questions in the case is that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s6.html) makes any enforcement action, including that of a farm debt, void until the mediation procedure has run its course. I understand [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s6.html) differently, because of what I take to be the effect of the words in the section, "otherwise than in compliance with this Act".

Compliance with the Act, as referred to in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s6.html), can be looked at in various ways. One is to say that compliance means doing everything the Act requires to be done to enable the mediation procedure to begin, and if begun, to be carried forward in accordance with the Act. Another way is to say that compliance means doing everything the Act requires a person to do, and not doing anything the Act requires a person not to do.

What the Act requires to be done to enable the mediation procedure to begin is contained in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html), and to enable that procedure, once begun, to continue, is contained in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s10.html) 
What the Act requires a person to do is contained in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) What the Act requires a person not to do is contained in [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) and [10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s10.html).

Thus both of my suggested meanings of compliance lead to [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) and [10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s10.html).
The only prohibitions in those sections are of taking enforcement action in respect of a farm mortgage. This seems to me to be confirmatory of my answers to the questions in the case.

I also agree with the reasons of McLelland CJ in Eq for answering the questions "no".

In my opinion the appeals should be dismissed with costs.
 
CLARKE JA: The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the Bank) served summons for winding up on Trellis Holdings Limited, Cherryop Pty Limited and Australian Cherry Exports Limited (the companies) in January this year. The stated ground upon which the order was sought was that the Bank had served a creditor's statutory demand under <case> of the Corporations Law upon the companies which demand had not been complied with. The statutory demand itself asserted that each company owed the Bank a substantial amount of money and called upon the relevant company, within 21 days after service on the company of the demand; (a) to pay to the creditor the total of the amount of the debts; or (b) to secure or compound for a total of the amount of the debts, to the creditor's reasonable satisfaction. 
Each summons was returnable on 26 February 1996 and when it came before the court was adjourned to a later date. On 4 March Mr T A Hoult, a director of
Trellis Holdings Limited, swore an affidavit in which he said, among other things, that the Bank had not at any time given to Trellis Holdings Limited an notice under <case> of the Farm Debt Mediation Act 1984 (the Act).

It is apparent that this affidavit provoked the filing by the Bank of a notice of motion on 11 March 1996 seeking: "That pursuant to Pt 31 r 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, the Court determine as a separate question in the proceedings before any other questions the following question: Does either: 
The service of the creditor's statutory demand under <case> of the
Corporations Law or; 
The bringing of winding up proceedings based on a failure to comply therewith; constitute the taking of enforcement action under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s8.html) of the [Farm Debt Mediation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/)." 
The motion came before McLelland CJ in Eq on 11 March when his Honour made an order for the separate trial of the identified issue and proceeded to determine the issue. On 18 March his Honour gave a judgment and gave his reasons for judgment in which he concluded that both questions should be answered "No". The companies sought and were granted leave to appeal from this decision.

It is apparent from the course the hearing took and the text of his Honour's judgment that no consideration was given to the facts of the case. In other words his Honour embarked upon an exercise in statutory construction in order to determine whether the two steps identified in the notice of motion constituted the taking of enforcement action under <case> of the Act which reads: "8(1) A creditor to whom money under a farm mortgage is owed by a farmer must not take enforcement action against the farmer in respect of the farm mortgage until at least 21 days have elapsed after the creditor has given a notice to the farmer under this section." 
As this course seems to have had the assent of both parties it should, in my view, be followed in this court. The reasoning underlying the trial judge's conclusion is, I think, summarised in the statement that "where a debt is secured by a mortgage, action to recover the debt which is not dependent upon the existence of the mortgage, cannot properly be described as action to enforce the mortgage." His Honour characterised the argument to the contrary as one which required the words "enforcement action" in <case> to be understood as though they read "action to enforce the payment of a farm debt which is secured by a farm mortgage" and his Honour pointed out that that was not what the Act said.

Section (3) sets out the object of the Act which is "to provide for mediation concerning farm debts before a creditor can take possession of property or other enforcement action under a farm mortgage". The emphasis is on the requirement to mediate before a creditor can take possession of a property secured by a mortgage or take other steps, properly regarded as enforcement action, pursuant to powers contained in the mortgage. As is apparent from the
Act it does not destroy the rights of a creditor. It simply delays them whilst a compulsory mediation takes place and, as was pointed out by counsel for the appellants, it was introduced at a time of great hardship for farmers due to drought.

The following definitions in <case> are relevant: "`creditor' means a person who provides financial accommodation to a farmer that creates or increases a farm debt and includes a bank, or a credit provider within the meaning of the [Credit Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/).
 `enforcement action', in relation to a farm mortgage, means taking possession of property under a farm mortgage, the sale of property under a farm mortgage, or any other action to enforce a farm mortgage including the continuing of action already commenced to enforce a farm mortgage but does not include: the completion of the sale of property held under a farm mortgage in respect of which contracts were exchanged before the commencement of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s6.html); or the enforcement of a judgment that was obtained before the commencement of that section; `farm' means land on which a farmer engages in a farming operation; `farm debt' means a debt incurred by a farmer for the purposes of the conduct of a farming operation that is secured wholly or partly by a farm mortgage; `farm mortgage' includes any interest in, or power over, property (comprising a farm or part of a farm or farm machinery used by a farmer in connection with a farming operation, or both) securing obligations of the farmer (whether as a debtor or guarantor);" 
The critical question which arises is whether the service of a statutory demand or the bringing of winding up proceedings falls within the expression "any other action to enforce a farm mortgage" in the definition in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s4.html) of enforcement of action.

McLelland CJ in Eq considered that the right to serve the demand and bring winding up proceedings arose as an ordinary incident of the creditor/debtor relationship and was in no way dependent upon the existence of a mortgage.
Insofar as the rights arose on the non-payment of a debt, whether or not secured by a mortgage, it could not be said that the taking of the steps I have mentioned constituted action to enforce a farm mortgage. I respectfully agree. Like his Honour I see no reason why the words in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) (understood in the light of the definition of enforcement action in [s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s4.html) should not be given their natural and ordinary meaning.

There are a number of reasons which favour this conclusion. Had the legislature intended that there should be a moratorium on a creditor taking steps to enforce a debt it could have said so. Insofar as it did not do so but quite deliberately limited the provisions of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca198474/s8.html) to the enforcement of a farm mortgage it seems clear to me that it was deliberately limiting the ambit of the Act to the enforcement's of rights under a farm mortgage, such as taking possession of, or selling, the farm the subject of the mortgage.

Again it is not to my mind irrelevant to observe that a creditor could prove the debt without any reference to a mortgage and, of course, in those circumstances the mortgage would not be relevant to either the giving of a statutory notice or the making of a winding up order.

In Mayfair Trading Co Pty Ltd versus Dreyer & Ors <case>; [(1958) 101 CLR 428], Dixon CJ said at 448: "The words `enforce', `enforceable' and `enforcement' when used in relation to a security may properly be applied to the exercise of any of the remedies which the security may give." 
I would respectfully adopt that approach which leads to the conclusion that remedies provided by the law to enforce a debt, whether or not the debt is secured and irrespective of the terms of the security, could not properly be described as enforcement action in respect of the security.

Mr Aldridge, who appeared for the companies, submitted that if the conclusion which I have indicated is correct it would mean that a creditor, who was the mortgagee under a farm mortgage, could circumvent the requirements of the Act simply by filing a summons for winding up consequent upon which the liquidator could exercise powers of sale, thereby dispossessing the mortgagor. This may be correct but <case> of the Act provides some support for the view that it was not intended to interfere with bankruptcy or winding up proceedings.

On the other hand even if Mr Aldridge's proposition is correct that does not, in my view, permit the court to read down the words used in the Act or to give them an artificial meaning.

During argument in the court there was some suggestion that facts may emerge during the subsequent hearing which might throw a different light on the question being considered. This suggestion raises the possibility that the determination of the present question may be academic. If this were so then the appropriate order that the court should make would be an order reversing the grant of leave to appeal.

However, I am unable to conceive of facts which would alter the situation. In other words I do not think that any facts which may be proved would show that the service of a statutory notice or the institution of winding up proceedings would constitute relevant enforcement action. It was argued, in this respect, that if the mortgage contained a provision permitting the creditor to apply to wind up the corporate mortgagor in the event of default then the steps I have mentioned would constitute enforcement action. I am unable to accept that this is correct for, whether or not there is this provision in the mortgage, the right is given by the law and the exercise of that right could not, in my opinion, be regarded as an enforcement of a mortgage right. In these circumstances I would be disposed to dismiss the appeal with costs. I should add that, in the unlikely event that facts do emerge which may have a bearing on the legal situation, it would be open to the trial court to distinguish the present judgment in the light of those facts and to make an order which met the demands of justice. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

COLE JA: Clarke JA has set out the circumstances attending this appeal. In my opinion the position is as follows:
The object of the [Farm Debt Mediation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) is set out in [s.3:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s3.html) "3. The object of this Act is to provide for mediation concerning farm debts before a creditor can take possession of property or other enforcement action under a farm mortgage." 
It is to be noted that the mediation concerns farm debts, not farm mortgages.
The object of the Act is to encompass a wider scope than a farm mortgage. The object is to have mediation concerning the farm debt; only thereafter may powers under a farm mortgage be exercised.
The manner in which the object of the Act is achieved is to render enforcement action taken by a creditor to whom the Act applies void, unless the Act is complied with. That appears from s.6 which provides: "Enforcement action taken by a creditor to whom this Act applies otherwise than in compliance with this Act is void." 
The creditors to whom the Act applies are specified in s.5(1): "This Act applies in respect of creditors only insofar as they are creditors under a farm debt." 
Accordingly, the enforcement action prohibited is that taken by a creditor.
The creditor referred to is a creditor in respect of a farm debt.

It is important to notice that all enforcement action is void if it be by a creditor to whom the Act applies unless the Act has been complied with.
Enforcement action is not limited to enforcement action in respect of or under a farm mortgage. The only restriction on the scope of width of enforcement action referred to in s.6 is that it must be that which is taken by a creditor to whom the Act applies, that is, a creditor under a farm debt.

With respect to those who take a different view, in my opinion because a farm debt must be secured by a farm mortgage that is no reason to read down the general prohibition of enforcement action in s.6 so as to restrict that prohibition only to action in respect of farm mortagages, excluding a prohibition on enforcement action in respect of farm debts.

The plenary nature and scope of "enforcement action" where used in s.6 is reinforced by the definition section, s.4. There appears a definition of "enforcement action" but only in relation to a farm mortgage. "Enforcement action" as used in s.6 is not defined in relation to a farm debt. Section 6 does not read "enforcement action in relation to a farm mortgage, taken by a creditor to whom this Act applies otherwise than in compliance with this Act is void". It thus embraces and renders void enforcement action taken in relation to a farm debt which may include enforcement action taken by a creditor in relation to a farm mortgage.
 "Farm debt" is defined in s.4(1) to mean: "A debt incurred by a farmer for the purpose of the conduct of a farming operation that is secured wholly or partly by a farm mortgage" 
A "farm mortgage" is defined in s.4 to include: "Any interest in, or power over, property (comprising a farm or part of a farm or farm machinery used by a farmer in connection with a farming operation, or both) securing obligations of the farmer (whether as a debtor or guarantor)." 
That definition makes two things clear. First, to be a farm mortgage the mortgage must be over what I shall call farm property, be it land or equipment. Second, the obligations of the farmer which must be secured by the mortgage for the mortgage to become a farm mortgage may be in respect of a debt, or arising from a guarantee. A farmer may, of course, have debts, or liabilities arising under a guarantee, which are quite unrelated to his farming operations. If, what I shall call a farmer's non-farm obligations are secured over farming property, then the mortgage constituting that security falls within the definition of "farm mortgage".

Such non-farm related obligations, however, do not fall within the meaning of the definition of "farm debt". That is because the non-farm obligations are not debts or obligations incurred by a farmer "for the purposes of the conduct of a farming operation". The effect of s.5(1) is to exclude non-farming obligations from the purview of the Act because they are not farm debts, and, as s.3 makes clear, the object of the Act was to provide mediation "concerning farm debts", not all debts of a farmer.
It follows, in my view, that in considering whether an act (or action) constitutes "enforcement action" within the meaning of s.6, and is thus void unless the Act has been complied with, one must first determine whether it is enforcement action in relation to a farm debt.

By definition, if the debt is unsecured it will not be a farm debt. By definition, the fact that it is secured by a farm mortgage, does not mean necessarily that it is a farm debt. The Act excludes from its purview unsecured debts or liabilities, and it further excludes secured debts or liabilities which are not incurred for the purpose of conduct of a farming operation.

There are sound policy reasons why the legislature may have thought it appropriate to protect farmers in times of high interest rates, poor agricultural returns, drought and financial adversity from secured creditors who had lent monies to farmers for the purpose of the conduct of a farming operation. Major debts were likely to be secured; smaller trading debts may have been unsecured and the legislature may well have expected that farmers would be able to meet or compromise such lesser liabilities. Further, the legislature may well have thought that the mere fact that a person was a farmer was no reason why, unlike other members of the community, such a person should be protected from the consequences of having assumed liabilities unrelated to farming operations.
A person who is a creditor in respect of a farm debt, which by definition is secured by a farm mortgage, is not, absent the [Farm Debt Mediation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/), obliged to exercise the powers under the mortgage in seeking to recover monies owed where there has been default. Although it is a secured creditor, the creditor might simply sue to obtain judgment for the debt. Having done so the creditor might seek to recover the judgment debt by executing on non-farm assets, or by bankruptcy proceedings if the farmer be a person. If the farmer be a corporate entity, the secured creditor might proceed to judgment, seek to obtain satisfaction of that judgment from non-farm assets, or might simply seek to wind up the farm debtor and prove in the liquidation. Whether such a creditor is obliged to surrender any security in those circumstances seems to me to be irrelevant. The point is that there are a number of courses open to a farm creditor seeking to recover monies due to it in respect of a farm debt. Each of the courses of action can properly be described, in my view, as "enforcement action". The effect of [s.6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s6.html) is to render void all enforcement action, unless it is enforcement action taken "in compliance with this Act".
The only "enforcement action" which the Act contemplates as being permissible is enforcement action after the provisions of Part 2 of the Act have been complied with. Part 2 contemplates mediation. Shortly stated, Part 2 permits a creditor to take enforcement action "in respect of a farm mortgage" only after 21 days have elapsed from it giving to the farmer a notice informing the farmer of the creditor's intention to take action "in respect of the farm mortgage", and of the availability of mediation in respect of the farm debts (s.8(1) and (2)). The farmer on receipt of such notice may within days request mediation "concerning the farm debt involved" (s.9(1)). Once that notice has been given the creditor must not take enforcement action "in respect of the farm mortgage concerned" unless and until the Authority has given a certificate under s.11 in respect of that farm mortgage (s.10). That certificate is to be issued by the Authority only when it is satisfied that either satisfactory mediation in respect of the farm debt has taken place, the farmer has declined mediation in respect of the farm debt, or three months have elapsed since the creditor gave the notice under s.8 and the creditor has during that period attempted to mediate in good faith.
It follows, in my view, that the effect of s.6 is to extinguish all rights of a secured creditor in respect of farm debts, being those incurred by a farmer for the purpose of the conduct of farming operations and secured over farm property, except rights to take "enforcement action" in relation to the farm mortgage, and then only after the mediation process contemplated by Part has been implemented, or attempted and failed because the farmer has declined mediation or bona fide attempts at mediation by the creditor have been unsuccessful. Only then may the secured creditor take enforcement action in relation to that farm mortgage. That "enforcement action in relation to a farm mortgage", means "taking possession of property under a farm mortgage, the sale of property under a farm mortgage, or any other action to enforce a farm mortgage including the continuing of action already commenced to enforce a farm mortgage".

It is to be noted that there is excluded from the definition of "enforcement action", in relation to a farm mortgage, the following: "(a) The completion of the sale of property held under a farm mortgage in respect of which contracts were exchanged before the commencement of s.6; or the enforcement of a judgment that was obtained before the commencement of that section;" 
Those exclusions are consistent with the interpretation I have adopted. Both and (b) emphasise that the prohibition on action is found in s.6, not s.8.
Enforcement action in relation to a farm mortgage is recognised as including the obtaining of a judgment in respect of monies due under that mortgage.
Implicitly, it recognises that similar action would be enforcement action in respect of the farm debt, as distinct from in relation to the farm mortgage.

Further, s.4(2) reinforces the distinction between a farm mortgage and a farm debt. Enforcement action may not be taken in respect of farm debts, because of the provisions of s.6, but may be taken in respect of a farm mortgage, provided Part 2 is satisfied.
The interpretation I have adopted is also consistent with the provisions of s.5(2) which provides: "(2) This Act does not apply in respect of: 
A farmer whose property is subject to control under Division 2 of Part X of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) of the
Commonwealth; or 
A farmer whose property is the subject of a bankruptcy petition presented by the farmer or the creditor; or 
A farmer, being a corporation, that is an externally administered corporation within the meaning of the Corporations Law." 
With one exception, the essential characteristic of [s.5(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s5.html) to (c) inclusive is that in each instance the property of the farmer is no longer in his or its control, and thus the farmer could have no right or power to enter into a mediation agreement.

In respect of (a), where a person enters into a [Part
X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/index.html#p10) arrangement the debtor's property passes into the control of the Trustee, and the debtor is prohibited from dealing with it[1].

In respect of (b), if a farmer presents his own bankruptcy petition, immediately upon the Registrar endorsing the petition the farmer becomes bankrupt and his property vests forthwith in the Official Receiver.[2] [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s58.html) prevents a creditor enforcing remedies against the property of the bankrupt in respect of a provable debt. If "the creditor", meaning a farm debt creditor, presents a bankruptcy petition, as the farm debt creditor is, by definition, a secured creditor, he must in the petition state that he is willing to surrender his security for the benefit of creditors generally and must do so.[3] He thus becomes the equivalent of an unsecured creditor. The [Farm
Debt Mediation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/) does not apply to unsecured creditors.

In respect of (c), a corporate farmer may become an externally administered corporation pursuant to Chapter 5 Corporations Law pursuant to an arrangement or reconstruction, the appointment of a receiver or manager, the entry into official management, the winding up by the court or being wound up voluntarily. In each instance control of the debtor's property passes from the control of the company to the appropriate body or person designated by the
Corporations Law.

THESE PROCEEDINGS 
The notice of motion before McLelland CJ in Eq. sought separate determination of the following questions: "Did either: 
The service of the Creditors Statutory Demand under s.459E of Corporations
Law; or 
The bringing of winding up proceedings based on a failure to comply therewith; constitute the taking of enforcement action under [s.8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s8.html) of the [Farm Debt Mediation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/)?" 
As it was common ground that no notice had been given to the farmer as contemplated by [s.8(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fdma1994163/s8.html), the questions were distilled by the parties before McLelland CJ in Eq. to become: "Whether: 
The service by a creditor on a debtor corporation of a statutory demand, or 
The commencement and prosecution by the creditor of proceedings to wind up the debtor corporation is prohibited by s.8(1) of the Act, where the debtor corporation is a "farmer" within the meaning of the Act and the debt the subject of the statutory demand and on which the creditor relies in the winding up proceedings is a "farm debt" secured by a "farm mortgage" within the meaning of the Act." 
In my opinion the summons asked the wrong questions. The true questions are whether the service of the creditor's statutory demand or the commencement and prosecution by the creditor of proceedings to wind up the farm debtor corporation constitute enforcement action rendered void by s.6. If either event constitutes enforcement action in relation to the farm debt, as distinct from enforcement action against the farmer in respect of the farm mortgage, it is prohibited by s.6. It is only if either event constitutes enforcement action against the farmer in respect of the farm mortgage that any question of non-compliance with s.8 would arise. In those circumstances if there was such non-compliance the voidness attaching to the Act effected by s.6 would remain; if s.8 had been complied and each event was properly characterised as "enforcement action against the farmer in respect of the farm mortgage", the voidness attaching to each event otherwise resulting from s.6 would be dispelled, and the events would not be prohibited.

In my opinion the service of a statutory demand and the commencement and prosecution of a petition to wind up the debtor corporation constitutes enforcement action for the reasons I have given. If, properly construed, the documents constitute enforcement action in relation to the farm debt, as
McLelland CJ in Eq. was asked to assume, the enforcement action is rendered void by s.6. If, properly construed, the document are enforcement action against the farmer "in respect of the farm mortgage", the action may not be rendered void by s.6 provided the provisions of Part 2, including the giving of notice under s.8(2), have been complied with. The characterisation of the documents, being the statutory demand, and the activity of commencing and prosecuting the petition actually filed are matters for the trial judge. They have not been the subject of any argument before this court.

In my opinion this Court should withdraw the leave to appeal previously granted and refer the matter back to the Equity Division for further consideration. In my opinion the answers given to the questions asked in the notice of motion are not relevant to any matter to be determined in the proceedings.

As the appellants have been unsuccessful, the appellants should pay the respondent's costs of this appeal.
