RESULT: Appeal dismissed 
JUDGMENT 
GROVE J: An indictment was presented against the appellant in the District Court at Sydney charging him with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth contrary to <case> of the [Crimes Act 1914](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/). The trial proceeded before his Honour Judge Luland QC and a jury and, after a verdict of guilty, his Honour sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment. 
Only a general background need be given. Over a period of years one Weston and a corporation controlled by him had for the purpose of tax evasion concealed the rental income derived by them from a number of properties. Weston consulted a solicitor Beaufils - a nephew of his de facto wife - who in turn consulted the appellant, a financial adviser. The essence of the conspiracy was to create a corporate structure wherein new companies would become the owners of the properties and thereby conceal past tax liability and, in any event, to render Weston and his original company unable to meet any taxation assessment which might issue if the concealment scheme failed.

The appellant and Beaufils were jointly tried. The latter has abandoned the appeal of which he originally gave notice. Weston was dealt with separately.

Two grounds of appeal only are pressed and appreciation of the argument in support of them requires outlining some of the course of the trial. It commenced on 29 April 1996 after the empanelment of twelve jurors. An estimated duration of four to six weeks had been announced. On 23 May 1996 one juror was discharged in the light of acknowledgment that the estimate would be overrun and inevitably clash with travel arrangements previously made by that juror. That order was made by the learned trial judge without objection on behalf of either the Crown or defence. His Honour raised the question of potential difficulties arising out of the extended length of trial and invited the remaining eleven jurors to communicate any problems to him. In response a note was received indicating that another juror wished not to continue as he was a self employed farmer and yet another expressed concern about his employment situation. The self employed farmer was discharged from the jury on the application of counsel for the appellant, supported by counsel for the
Crown. Counsel for the appellant also applied for discharge of the third juror but this was opposed by the Crown and no order was made.

The trial continued to conclusion with the court being constituted by the presiding judge and ten jurors.

The jury retired to consider its verdict on the afternoon of Wednesday 3 July
They returned their verdict on the afternoon of Monday 8 July. The jury was permitted to separate after each day's deliberation and over the weekend of 6 and 7 July.

Relevant statutory provisions of the [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) are: "22. Where in the course of any trial or coronial inquest any member of the jury dies or is discharged by the court or coroner whether as being through illness incapable of continuing to act or for any other reason, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial or inquest properly constituted if: in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members: is not reduced below 10; is reduced below 10 but approval in writing is given to the reduced number of jurors by or on behalf of both the person prosecuting for the Crown and the accused or each of the accused; or is reduced below 10 but not below 8 and the trial has been in progress for at least 2 months; ........................................................
 and if the court or the coroner, as the case may be, so orders.
 and,
The jury in criminal proceedings: shall, unless the court otherwise orders, be permitted to separate at any time before they retire to consider their verdict; and may, if the court so orders, be permitted to separate at any time after they retire to consider their verdict." 
The grounds of appeal are:
The trial judge erred in law in allowing an impermissible reduction in the number of jurors contrary to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
The trial judge erred in law because the jurors were allowed to separate during consideration of their verdict after retirement and before verdict.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) provides: "80. The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the
Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes." 
It is common ground, and indisputable, that the trial of the appellant was for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) a trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. Notices under [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) were given. Counsel has made submissions to the Court on behalf of the Attorney-
General of New South Wales who, alone, exercised the right to intervene.

The orders made by the learned trial judge which had the effect of reducing the number of jurors to ten were plainly authorized in the terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s22.html) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/).
The issue raised by ground 1 is whether there is collision between the vesting of relevant power by the Parliament of New South Wales and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Determination of the issue involves characterization of the essential nature of "trial by jury" where that expression appears in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). I have noted that the reduction of the size of the jury panel from twelve to ten occurred as a result, in the instance of one juror by consent of the appellant and in respect of the other on his application. Despite the forensic disadvantage that might ordinarily be implicit in that situation the claims of the appellant cannot be dismissed on the basis that he was the author of it as the constitutional guarantee in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) exists for the benefit of the community as a whole as well as a particular accused: Brown versus The Queen <case>; [1985 160 CLR 171.] 
The verdict of the jury was unanimous and thus the effect of the State legislation was not incompatible with the constitutional guarantee after the fashion which occurred from utilization of a provision in State legislation allowing for majority verdict: Cheatle versus The Queen <case>; [1993 177 CLR 541.] 
Cheatle established that the expression "trial by jury" as it appears in [s 80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) necessarily conveyed that a verdict of guilty could only emerge from unanimity. References in the judgment were made to "the twelve" but they manifested a literary style and did not focus upon any compulsion to have a unanimity of that precise number. Indeed, in dealing with some changes in
Australian society since Federation particularly relating to the qualifications of jurors and the removal of property and gender barriers, the
Court observed: "The relevant essential feature or requirement of the institution was, and is, that the jury be a body of persons representative of the wider community." (@ p 560).

It commented: "The question at issue is whether, [s80's](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) mandatory injunction that such a `trial ......... shall be by jury' carries with it a requirement that any conviction must be by the agreement or consensus of all the persons constituting the jury at the time the verdict is pronounced" (@ p 548) (Emphasis added).

Although the remarks convey an implication that the number constituting the jury may not be immutable, the context does not suggest that attention was specifically being paid to the issue which has now arisen.

Fundamental to the appellant's submission was the proposition that the constitution of the jury by twelve people is an indispensable feature of the meaning of the expression in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) At the time of Federation, all of the uniting colonies exercised the power of the judicial arm of government in respect of charges on indictment by trial before a judge and a jury of twelve. It could not have been intended therefore, so the argument advanced, that some other number of persons could represent the wider community for this purpose. The requirement of a full complement of twelve persons is consistent with noted practice that if a juror died or was taken ill beyond the hope of speedy recovery, a fresh jury was sworn:
Halsbury, 1st Edn, Vol XIII par 623. The importance of the full number was reinforced by the further aspect of practice that where the default related to single members of the jury, as many as were left of the "old" jury were recalled: R versus Beere <case>; [(1843) 2 Mood. & R. 472]; par 623 supra, footnote (k).

As against the lastmentioned, in the Australian context at the time of
Federation the colony of Victoria had legislated in The Juries Statute, 1876: "86. In the event of the death or illness of any juror during a trial civil or criminal, except for a capital offence, the presiding judge shall have power if he shall think fit to direct that the trial shall proceed with a number reduced in no case to less than five-sixths of the jurors originally impanelled, and the verdict of such remaining jurors shall be a sufficient verdict." 
Sir Patrick Devlin (as he then was) delivering the Hamlyn Lectures in November provided valuable resource when he addressed the issue by his parenthetical inquiry: "Consider what the idea is. Twelve (why twelve?) men and women are to be selected at random ........" 
Sir Patrick responded to his own question. He referred to the importation of the device whereby the original jurors were men compelled by the King to take an oath, a procedure brought into England by the Normans. The confidence that the spiritual repercussions of lying upon oath would ensure truth has not survived the centuries. And, of course, jurors now try a case upon the evidence presented rather than being selected because of their pre-existing knowledge. He recounted how King Henry II was directly responsible for turning the jury into an instrument for doing justice - indirectly abetted by Pope
Innocent III who prohibited the existing litigious method of trial by ordeal.
The King ordained that in a dispute about title to land a litigant might obtain a Royal writ to have a jury summoned and those jurors were bound to speak of their knowledge upon oath and when a party got twelve oaths in his favour, he won. The lecture continued: "This is the origin of the trial jury, though there was as yet no sort of trial in the modern sense. It is also the origin of the rule that the trial jury consists of twelve, it is, too, the reason why it is called the petty jury to distinguish it from the larger juries of presentment and attaint and also of the rule that the verdict of the twelve must be unanimous. Many romantic explanations have been offered of the number twelve - the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve Patriarchs, the twelve offices of Solomon recorded in the Book of Kings, and the twelve Apostles. Not all of these suggestions are equally happy; the first implies that there may be a thirteenth juror who has got lost somewhere in the corridor, and the last that there is a Judas on every jury. It is clearer that what was wanted was a number that was large enough to create a formidable body of opinion in favour of the side that won; and doubtless the reason for having twelve instead of ten eleven or thirteen was much the same as gives twelve pennies to the shilling and which exhibits an early English abhorrence of the decimal system." 
As predicated, one can find in writings proposals of historical bases for the emergence of the twelve. In a pamphlet attributed to Lord Somers (published in ) the following appears: "In analogy, of late the jury is reduced to the number of 12, like as the prophets were twelve, to foretell the truth; the apostles twelve to preach the truth; the discoverers twelve, sent in Canaan, to seek and report the truth; and the stones twelve, that the heavenly Hierusalem is built on; and as the
Judges were twelve anciently to try and determine matters of law; and always, when there is any waging law, there must be twelve to swear in it; and also as for matters of State, there were formerly twelve Councillors of State. And anything now which any jury can be said to do, must have the joint consent of twelve, else it is, in construction of law not the doing of the jury, but of private persons, and void." 
References to such sources of "the twelve" are not confined to antiquity. In a recent exchange with counsel in the High Court Kirby J is recorded as saying: "That was clearly addressed to the case of retired jurors or jurors who have to go off. We are talking here of adding people to the twelve. The twelve based on the apostles. We are talking of a completely ahistorical change": Ah
Poh Wai versus The Queen - Application for special leave to appeal, Melbourne
Monday 5 August 1996.

In referring to the extract from Lord Somers pamphlet above, Evatt J in a paper delivered to the Australian Legal Convention 1936 observed: "Because in England the number of petty jurors in criminal cases and of civil juries has been a round dozen, some magic was at one time ascribed to the number alone." 
This appeal directly requires decision whether there is any such "magic".

Research has been unsuccessful in locating any binding authority where that question has been directly addressed. I acknowledge a plenitude of encounter with expressions about "the twelve jurors" in judgments dealing with other aspects of trial, for example Latham CJ wrote of "....... the right to have only the verdict of the full twelve ....." in Newell versus The King (1936) 55
CLR @ 712 but he was there dealing with the application of a statute enacted during the adjournment of a trial which provided for majority verdict.

The most direct criticism of the enshrinement or at least the attribution of "magic" to the number twelve as constituting a jury is to be found in the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Williams versus Florida <case>; [(1970) 399 US 78.] It was delivered by White J whose historical analysis I would respectfully accept and
I quote the final view: "We conclude, in short, as we began: the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system, and wholly without significance `except to mystics'." :@ p. 102.

I find no historical or legal warrant for concluding that trial by jury inheres a concept that the body must consist of an immutable number of twelve persons. The essential is judgment by one's peers rather than judgment by necessarily twelve of one's peers. As Deane J has observed: "Regardless of whether one traces the common law institution of trial by jury to Roman, Saxon, Frankish or Norman origins, the underlying notion of judgment by one's equals under the law was traditionally seen as established in English criminal law, for those who had the power to be heard, at least by 1215 when the Charter of that year provided, among other things, that no man should be arrested, imprisoned, banished or deprived of life otherwise than by the lawful judgment of his equals (`per legale judicium parium suorum') or by the law of the land." Kingswell versus The Queen (1985) 159 CLR @ 299.

In my view the reduction of the number constituting a jury panel from twelve to ten in accordance with the authority of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s22.html) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) does not remove the character of the jury so that the ten persons (whose unanimity is essential for any conviction) cease to be an appropriate body of persons representative of the community in whose judgment confidence is reposed. I am unpersuaded that the intention of the framers of the constitutional guarantee was that the jury consist of no number other than twelve. Indeed it would have been easy enough to include the expression "of twelve persons" - or as is more likely in the context of the times "of twelve men" - if that limitation were intended. I would not presume that at the time of Federation those responsible for constituting the Commonwealth of Australia were unaware that, for example, in Scotland, in contrast to England, a criminal jury consisted of fifteen (and under Scottish law a majority of those fifteen were sufficient for conviction but in Australia the issue of majority verdict upon a "federal" indictment is determined by Cheatle).

I would reject the first ground of appeal.

The second ground relates to a matter which is essentially procedural. It was suggested that in 1900 it may have been likely to be presumed that a jury embarked upon deliberation would not be permitted to separate. Such presumption would not have then been valid in the colony of Victoria: R v
Jeffers [1895 Argus L.R. 71.] The sequestration of a deliberating jury may be said to have passed through the centuries (adopting English history as our own) from one extreme to the other. The harsh pursuit of the achievement of unanimity by keeping a jury together by depriving them of refreshment and sustenance has ameliorated to the judicial discretion vested by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s54.html) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/).
It was said that in the District Court the practice of separating a jury overnight if their deliberations are not concluded on the first day is well nigh universal and in the Supreme Court is common.

I readily accept the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant that it is an essential feature of the jury system that a jury should deliberate upon its verdict uninfluenced by an outsider to the trial process. The argument that total and continuing isolation is essential to the meaning of the expression "trial by jury" where used in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) rings a little hollow however in the age of mass communication. Actual and potential threats to jury integrity may arise during separations before retirement for deliberation and there is apparent community acceptance that safeguards inherent in the trial process and the supervision of the presiding judge suffice. I perceive no vice in allowing the members of a deliberating jury being dispersed to go about their lawful occasions and reassembling in traditional privacy. It is to be noted that such dispersal occurs as a result of the exercise of discretion in each case and any relevant prevailing circumstances must necessarily be taken into account in deciding whether the jury should or should not remain sequestered.

In my view an understanding and construction should be given to the words in [s 80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) that the framers of the Constitutional guarantee intended that a jury exercise its function without fear or favour and without undue influence in the context of community standards and expectations as current from time to time. [S ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s54.html) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) is not incompatible with the Constitutional guarantee. The second ground of appeal should not be sustained.

I propose the appeal be dismissed and the conviction and sentence confirmed.

BRUCE J: I agree with the reasons set out in the judgment of Mr Justice Grove, and the orders proposed by him.

COOPER AJ: I agree with Grove J * * *
