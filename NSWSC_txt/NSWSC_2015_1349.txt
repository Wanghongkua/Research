EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
By summons filed with the leave of the Court this morning the New South Wales Crime Commission, the plaintiff, seeks orders against the defendant, John Charles White, pursuant to [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) ("the Act"). Those orders are sought with respect to a number of items of property which are set out in two schedules to the summons. The Commission has filed a Statement of Facts and Circumstances in accordance with r 1.26 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), and tendered and relied upon an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 7 September 2015.
In his affidavit Mr Spark refers to and exhibits a number of documents which are annexed to his affidavit.
Section 10A of the Act provides for applications such as this to be heard ex parte and the application is being heard and dealt with in the absence of Mr White.
In his affidavit of 7 September 2015 Mr Spark deposes that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of <case> of the Act. He is a person authorised in writing by the Commission to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of <case> and [Pt 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p4) of the Act.
Mr Spark has had access to material produced as a consequence of a Crime Commission and New South Wales Police investigation into the defendant, Mr White, and Mr Spark has become aware of information upon the basis of which he concludes that there is a reasonable basis to suspect, and he holds such a suspicion, that Mr White is involved in serious crime related activities as defined by <case> of the Act.
Those serious crime related activities are the supply of prohibited drugs being cannabis in an amount which is not less than the large commercial quantity specified for that prohibited drug. Such an offence falls within [s 25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/). I am satisfied that it is a serious criminal offence pursuant to [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s6.html) of the Act.
Mr Spark has made a number of inquiries of the New South Wales Police and obtained information as to the alleged activities of Mr White. Mr White has been the subject of an investigation by New South Wales Police involving both physical and electronic surveillance of a number of persons. Mr White's conduct was monitored and it was established that he is the owner of a private aircraft. Police investigations established, and Mr Spark believes and suspects, that Mr White has been involved in the transport of large quantities of prohibited drugs into the State using the aircraft of which he is the proprietor.
During August 2015, investigators discovered that the defendant was engaged in the planning of and negotiation for an arrangement for moving a large amount of prohibited drugs across the border from South Australia into New South Wales, with the defendant using his private aircraft (which is known as a Sting single engine aircraft) to transport a significant quantity of two particular drugs.
Some 100 pounds of cannabis was to be moved from South Australia to the north west of New South Wales, together with a significant quantity of a particular drug called trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine. A further quantity of methylamphetamine was also part of the consignment from South Australia to Deniliquin. The defendant was to be paid a fee of some $25,000 for his role in the transportation of the drug.
Surveillance of various persons involved in this criminal plan captured images of persons loading the defendant's aircraft with the drugs, subsequent to which the defendant flew his aircraft out of South Australia and into New South Wales. He was arrested on landing in this State. His aircraft was searched and the drugs to which I have referred were discovered and seized.
The defendant is said to have made a number of admissions to the New South Wales Police upon his arrest. Those admissions had been recorded electronically.
Trafficking drugs, particularly in such large quantities and with multiple types of drugs, are very serious offences and are likely, to result in a substantial gaol penalty should a conviction ultimately be recorded.
Section 10A(5) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court concludes that the suspicion held by the authorised officer, Mr Spark, is reasonably held. I am satisfied on the evidence provided that the suspicion to which Mr Spark deposes is reasonably held and that the relief claimed by the plaintiff ought to be granted.
Accordingly I am prepared to make the orders which the plaintiff seeks.
