JUDGMENT  For separate reasons consisting of 23 paragraphs, a copy of which I now deliver to the applicants in the absence of the public, I will make the several orders claimed in the amended interlocutory processes filed on 11
October 2005, which amended interlocutory processes sought relief corresponding with and additional to that originally sought (see McGrath & Anor re HIH Insurance Ltd & Ors <case>  Because the amended interlocutory processes were heard in the absence of the public (see McGrath re HIH Insurance Ltd <case>, I order that, until further order, the separate reasons a copy of which I now deliver to the applicants in the absence of the public remain in a sealed envelope in the court file and not be accessed by any person except with the leave of a judge and with 48 hours prior notice to Blake Dawson Waldron. I direct that those separate reasons not be posted on the Caselaw New South
Wales website while the immediately preceding order remains in force.  I direct that the proceedings be listed before me for mention at 9.30 am on June 2006 for the purpose of reviewing the continued appropriateness of the order and direction in paragraph 2 and the corresponding order and direction made on 4 August 2005.
