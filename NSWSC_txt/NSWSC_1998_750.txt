REGINA versus DAMIEN BRUCE NORTHEY /98 May 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: In the matter of Damien Bruce Northey, when the matter was called on for hearing today, Mr. Skidmore appeared on his behalf for the purpose of informing the court that he wished leave to be granted to him to withdraw as he had no current instructions. 
It was suggested from the bar table that the material in the proceedings, which had been listed before me today in consequence of an order made by Mr.
Justice Hunt, the former Chief Judge at Common Law, that a report be provided as to the progress of Mr. Northey within the William Booth Institute was not likely to be of much assistance since it may be that Mr. Northey has absconded from that institute. No information of any kind is forthcoming from the
Salvation Army.

Mr. Northey has not appeared, although he is required by the terms of Mr.
Justice Hunt's order to appear today. I note that should there be a breach of the bail, the orders made by Mr. Justice Hunt provide for automatic revocation. I note that the application is still on foot before me today and has not been finally determined. There being no appearance of Mr. Northey and no explanation, bail is refused.
