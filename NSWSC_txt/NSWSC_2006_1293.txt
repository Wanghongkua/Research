JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE HARRISON 
WEDNESDAY, 29 NOVEMBER 2006 /2005 - SCOTT BEAU HARRISON v 
JIMMY PAUL MELHEM & ANOR (No 2) 
JUDGMENT (Attendant care services - <case> CLA) HER HONOUR: This judgment concerns the interpretation of <case> of the [Civil Liability Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) . [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s15.html) reads: "No damages may be awarded to a claimant for gratuitous attendant care services if the services are provided, or are to be provided: for less than 6 hours per week, and for less than 6 months." The starting point is Geoghan versus D'Aubert <case>
In Geoghan the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered the interpretation of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s72.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) which is in identical terms to <case> of the CLA. The Court looked to the former [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s72.html) which had been replaced in 1993, the second reading speech concerning the current [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s72.html), and the object provisions of the Act. The Court held that a purposive construction led to the conclusion that [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s72.html) required both limbs (a) and (b) to be satisfied before compensation is payable under the provision. The Court did not favour the interpretation that gives the section its natural meaning to the words and in particular the conjunction "and". In Geoghan at [38] the Court held that no compensation is to be awarded for attendant care services if less than 6 hours per week of services is provided or is to be provided. Similarly, the Court held that no compensation is to be awarded if the services are provided or are to be provided for less than 6 months.
 Next the Court of Appeal in Roads and Traffic Authority versus McGregor &
Anor <case> adopted the reasoning in Geoghan and applied it to <case> of the CLA.
The Court held at [163-174] that the purposive approach taken by the court in
Geoghan applied equally to the identically worded <case>.
 Recently the Court of Appeal in Sheridan versus Borgmeyer <case> expressed doubts as to correctness of the approach adopted in McGregor. At [41] Beazley JA stated "As this will be a matter which will undoubtedly be revisited by this Court from time to time, it is appropriate for me to record my doubt as to the correctness of that decision." To my mind <case> should be afforded its natural meaning. This was the approach I adopted prior to being appraised of the authorities referred to above. It seems to me that plaintiffs with back injuries cannot carry out heaving lifting. While tasks that involve heavy lifting may only take a few hours a week plaintiffs are not capable of carrying out these tasks, if they do so they risk further injury to their backs. However, as I have not yet entered judgment and I am bound to follow the decision in McGregor, that being so, I cannot award any damages for attendant care services after 13
December 2001. Therefore the amount allowed for past attendant care services is the sum of $23,107.33.

The Court orders: 
That there be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $637,409.62.

The defendants are to pay the plaintiff's costs as agreed or assessed.
