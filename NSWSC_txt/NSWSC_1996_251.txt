ORDERS 
Appeal dismissed with costs.
 
GLEESON CJ: I have read in draft form the reasons for Judgment of Mahoney P. I agree with those reasons.
 
MAHONEY P: This appeal raises for consideration certain aspects of the power of a coroner in directing a post-mortem pursuant to [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) of the [Coroners Act 1980](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/). The circumstances in which the various issues have arisen are set forth in detail in the judgment of Abadee J at first instance. I shall refer to them only to the extent necessary to indicate the conclusion at which I have arrived. 
On 10 March 1996, Haim Mendel Deitz (also known as Victor Deitz) was injured in a motor vehicle accident: he was struck by a bus. He was taken to the
Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick and remained there until, on 5 May 1996, he died.

On 6 May 1996, Mr Abernethy the Deputy Coroner directed, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) of the Act, that there be a post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased.

On 7 May 1996, Mina Ruth Deitz, the widow of the deceased and his executrix under his will, applied to the Supreme Court in its Administrative Law jurisdiction for the following substantive orders: "1. That the decision of the defendant made on the 6th day of May 1996 to authorise or require the conduct of a post-mortem examination on the body of
Haim Mendel Deitz (aka Victor Deitz) deceased is null and void and of no effect.
An injunction restraining the defendant from performing, permitting to be performed, or directing the performance of an autopsy examination upon the body of Haim Mendel Deitz (aka Victor Deitz) deceased.
An order that the body of the deceased Haim Mendel Deitz (aka Victor
Deitz) be released to the plaintiff for burial." 
No question has been raised as to the standing of Mrs Deitz in the present proceeding. She has been described as the executrix of her late husband. Under the general law, the possession - or at least the possession for the required purpose - of the body of a deceased person is vested in that person's legal personal representative. See Union Bank of Australia versus Harrison <case>; [(1910) 11 CLR 492] at 519. It is part of the duty of a legal personal representative, in ordinary circumstances, to take control of the body and to arrange for its burial or other disposal. See Williams on Executors and
Administrators (11th ed, 1961) p 721 et seq. The position in more recent times has been reviewed in Warner versus Levitt (Brownie J, 23 August 1994, unreported). It is not necessary to examine the extent to which, for example, a legal personal representative may deal with the body of the deceased in a manner other than that directed by the deceased. In the present case, it has been assumed that what Mrs Deitz desires to do is what the deceased and his family would wish to be done. It has not been suggested in this case that, if a grant of representation has not yet formally been made, that affects the standing of Mrs Deitz in the proceeding.

Mrs Deitz's application was resisted by Mr Abernethy. Evidence was given, by affidavit and orally, upon the hearing before Abadee J.

On 8 May 1996, his Honour made final orders to the effect of those sought by
Mrs Deitz in pars 1 and 2. The orders were stayed pending the determination of the appeal to this Court.

On 9 May 1996 Mr Abernethy appealed to this Court. The appeal was heard on that day. At the conclusion of the argument, the Court dismissed the appeal with costs. It then indicated that reasons would be given subsequently. These reasons are my reasons for the orders then made.

In order to understand what was done by Mr Abernethy and the submissions advanced for him, it is necessary to refer to the Act. By [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html), a coroner is given "jurisdiction to hold an inquest concerning the death or suspected death of a person if it appears to the coroner that that person has died, ..." in any of the circumstances specified in [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html)
In the present case, the circumstances in question are those in [s (1)(g):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) "13(1)(g) the person died within a year and a day after the date of any accident to which the cause of his or her death or suspected death is or may be attributable".
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) does not require that, in every case falling within [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html), the coroner must hold an inquest. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) confers "jurisdiction to hold an inquest"; it does not, in terms, require that one be held. There are cases, in which, where a court or analogous body is given power to exercise a judicial or quasi-judicial function, it has been held that a duty is thereby imposed to exercise that jurisdiction when the occasion for it arises. Thus, in Ward versus Williams <case>; [(1955) 92 CLR 496] at 506, the legislation provided that the body "may" exercise the relevant jurisdiction; it was held that, where the occasion for its exercise arose, the jurisdiction must be exercised.

In my opinion, this is not such a case. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html) provides: "14. A coroner who has jurisdiction to hold an inquest may dispense with the inquest except in those cases in which an inquest is required to be held." 
Mr Molomby, for Mr Abernethy, has contended that the legislation operates, in effect, in two stages: first, by the imposition of a duty to hold an inquest; and, second, by the grant of a power to dispense with it. He contended that under the Act the coroner has no power to do other than hold an inquest; it follows from that, he contends, that the only power he may exercise is to dispense with the holding of an inquest and that the occasion for the exercise of that power has not arisen. Accordingly, he submits, there can be no basis on which the Court may examine and pass upon what Mr Abernethy has done.

I do not think that, in the practical situation which ordinarily arises, the two provisions are to be segregated in such a schematic fashion. The holding of an inquest is apt to cause inconvenience or more to the family or relatives of the deceased and some little public expense. I think that when an occasion arises in which an inquest is, to use a neutral term, within jurisdiction, the coroner is to consider whether, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s14.html), he should dispense with it. The two sections and what they require may, in special cases, be separate but in an ordinary case such as this, I do not think that such a separation is warranted.

The term "dispense" may in some cases be used in a context in which a duty is imposed which will operate unless the dispensing power is exercised. But in other contexts it is used in a different and more literal way: see, eg, In re
McKay <case>; [(1936) VLR 365] at 366. The operation of the section is, in my opinion, to impose upon the coroner to determine in each case in which he has jurisdiction to hold an inquest pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s13.html) whether an inquest will be held or is to be dispensed with.

In this context, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) (as far as is here relevant) provides: "48(1). A coroner may, either before commencing or after commencing and before completing an inquest concerning the death of a person, by order in writing, direct: any medical practitioner to perform a post mortem examination of the remains of that person; and ...
 and to furnish, as soon as practicable, a report of the examination or test to the coroner." 
It is accepted that the order made by the coroner on 6 May 1996 was made pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html)
THE NATURE OF THE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM: 
The plaintiff's principal claim is essentially that the order for a post- mortem is null, void and of no effect. The orders in pars 2 and 3 are consequential upon the success of that claim. Accordingly three questions arise: (a) whether the order made is one which can be reviewed by the Supreme
Court; (b) (if it can) whether, on the evidence before the Court, the Court should hold the order void; and (c) what orders should be made.
THE POWER TO REVIEW THE DIRECTION UNDER [S ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html): 
The validity of the exercise of a statutory power is prima facie open to review by a competent court. It is, in this State, open to review in particular by the Supreme Court. Such proceedings are ordinarily dealt with in the Administrative Law Division of the Court. There are special cases in which no review is possible. In the past, there has been legislation forbidding such review. Clauses such as those described as "Henry VIII clauses" have been used: de Smith on Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th ed, 1995) at et seq. In a modern democratic state it is, in my opinion, to be expected that, at least in times of peace, such provisions will not now be enacted.

Mr Molomby's argument suggested, I think, that there are some decisions made in the course of administration which are not reviewable by ordinary judicial procedures. That may be so. Steps taken in the ordinary course of the conduct of a department or other purely ministerial steps not amounting to an act in the law performed in the exercise of a specific legal power may perhaps provide instances of this kind. But a direction given pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ca1980120/s48.html) is not of this kind. It is a direct exercise of a statutory authority and is subject to review accordingly.

Such a review is, of its nature, not a review of the merits of the exercise of the power. Judicial review of this kind is limited essentially to the validity of the act done.

The grounds upon which the court will, on such a review, set aside such an act are well recognised. They include, inter alia, cases in which the power has been exercised for a purpose not within the scope of the power; where, in exercising the power, regard has been had to considerations which are not within the scope of the power or there has been a failure to have regard to considerations which are within the scope of the power; and where the exercise of the power is, within the Wednesbury principle, so unreasonable as not to be an exercise of the power: see Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v
Wednesbury Corporation <case>; [(1948) KB 223.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281948%29%201%20KB%20223 "View LawCiteRecord" ) These are some of the grounds relevant in the present case.

In other legal systems, the validity of such acts is subject to another test, that of proportionality. In the jurisdictions where that principle is adopted, an act may be held invalid if what is done and its consequences are out of proper proportion to the circumstances giving rise to the exercise of the power: see generally de Smith at 593 et seq. It is not necessary to examine how far the principle of proportionality is now operative in the United
Kingdom by reason of the legal incidents of the European Union. The principle, as such, has not been formally adopted in Australia, although reference has been made to it: see South Australia versus Tanner <case>; [(1989) 166 CLR 161]; State of New South Wales versus Macquarie Bank Ltd [(1992) 30
NSWLR 307.] 
These principles are not new: they are, as I have said, well recognised. But it is relevant to reiterate them in the present case having regard to the approach which has been adopted in argument for Mr Abernethy.
WAS THE DIRECTION VALIDLY GIVEN? 
If the court may review the validity of a determination, it must determine whether, in the individual case, (a) the determination has or has not been properly made within the principles to which I have referred; (b) (if it can) whether on such a review, it should be held to be void; and (c) what order should be made.

In order to determine the validity of such a determination, it is necessary to examine what was done, why it was done, what led to the doing of it, and the reasonableness of it in the context. A party who alleges the invalidity of an act has the onus of showing that, by reference to matters such as these, it should be held invalid. Unless such appears, it will ordinarily be presumed that the act is valid.

As I understand the proceedings before Abadee J and the purpose of them, the plaintiff Mrs Deitz directed evidence to such matters. The evidence adduced by
Mrs Deitz was accepted by the trial judge. No evidence of relevance was adduced for Mr Abernethy.

In my opinion, the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence as on a rehearing: [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), <case>; are as follows. The cause and the circumstances of the death of the deceased are already well known. No further information as to these matters would be obtained if a post-mortem were held. Dr Stening made this clear in his evidence. He was one of the doctors who treated the deceased and it may be inferred that he was familiar with his condition. There was, in the evidence given by him or otherwise tendered as to the deceased's medical condition and history, nothing to suggest anything untoward or anything apt to be of interest to a coroner.

There was no suggestion that criminal liability had arisen in relation to the deceased's death. He was struck by a bus. His son, who gave evidence before the judge, indicated that the fault for the accident lay with the deceased and not with the driver. He made clear that no civil proceedings were contemplated and nothing was suggested to give rise to the inference or the possibility that criminal proceedings might be taken. It was not suggested, to Dr Stening or otherwise, that the treatment of the deceased in hospital raised issues which might be of interest to a coroner.

These matters were raised in evidence for the plaintiff Mrs Deitz. There was opportunity for Mr Abernethy, in cross-examination of the witnesses or by evidence called on his behalf, to place before the judge material which would support the validity of the determination. It was, in my opinion, plain from the manner in which the proceeding was conducted that the plaintiff proposed to raise for consideration and argument the grounds upon which the validity of the determination to hold a post-mortem would be judged.

The learned judge directed his attention to these matters. In his judgment he said: "In the present circumstances there is no uncertainty as to the evidence as to the cause of death. In the instant case on the evidence and further absent any evidence from the defendant it could not be suggested that there are reasonable grounds to even suspect that the death of the deceased had not occurred in the way described by Dr Stening." 
Having referred to other cognate legislation his Honour said: "Having regard to the matters to which I have made reference I do not conceive how it could be said, on the evidence before me, that the interests of society should be served or could be served in the circumstances by requiring an autopsy to be performed." 
I agree with the thrust of the conclusions of the learned judge. Considering the evidence as on a rehearing, I have come to the conclusion that there exist in the present case no reasons why, for any purpose under the legislation, a post-mortem should be had. If the situation be as the plaintiff's evidence indicates, there is no medical or legal reason why a post-mortem should be held. If other categories of reasons are relevant, no reason has been advanced for Mr Abernethy why, within the legislation, the post-mortem should be directed. I have come to the conclusion that the direction was not given for a purpose within the legislation and that, in the circumstances, the determination is, within the Wednesbury principle, unreasonable and accordingly not within the power granted by [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) On that basis, the determination that a post-mortem be held, made on 6 May 1996, was invalid.

No evidence was given for Mr Abernethy to suggest what purpose the post-mortem could serve, the reason why it was directed or how it came to be directed. Mr
Molomby, for Mr Abernethy, submitted that Mr Abernethy is not obliged in law to adduce evidence of this kind. Literally understood, this submission is correct. But, where an officer elects to give no evidence upon such a matter, it may in the context of the case be open and proper to infer that he could give no evidence of any reasons which would assist his contention that the exercise of the power was valid. In Padfield versus Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries & Food <case>; [(1968) AC ] at -4, Lord Pearce said: "All the prima facie reasons seem to point in favour of his taking a certain course ... and if he gives no reason whatever for taking a contrary course, the court may infer that he had no good reason and that he is not using the power given by Parliament to carry out its intention".

This view has been adopted and applied in Australian courts: see Public
Service Board of New South Wales versus Osmond [(1986) 159 CLR 656] at 663-4, per Gibbs CJ. The inference which can and should be drawn from silence or the deficiency of evidence in this regard will, of course, depend upon the circumstances of the case. In the present case, it was, in my opinion, the obvious purpose of the plaintiff's case to establish the invalidity of the determination and to do so by establishing, by reference to the principles to which I have referred, why the power given by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) had not been effectively exercised. The plaintiff, by her evidence, sought to show that the grounds - perhaps, the main grounds - by reference to which a post- mortem might validly be directed, viz, those relevant to medical or legal matters, did not exist in this case. The matter was therefore in issue before the court. In my opinion, it is not open to an official - special circumstances apart - to ignore the fact that such an issue is before the court for determination and simply to refuse to call evidence upon the matter.
In a case such as the present, if the official does not seek to provide a basis for the validity of what was done, it may be inferred, as the judge inferred, that nothing could be advanced in support of the validity of the determination.

I do not mean by this that in every administrative law proceeding in the court, the official is required to detail the reasons why he did what he did and what moved him to do it. Nor do I wish to limit the considerations by reference to which, within the legislation, a coroner may determine that a post-mortem should be held. There may be reasons why that information should not be disclosed: matters of confidentiality, privacy or the like may be involved. But where, as in the present case, the validity of a determination is fairly in issue and it is shown that there is no apparent reason why the matter should not be dealt with by the court, absence of evidence or silence may ground inferences such as are to be drawn in the present case.

Nor does this mean that, by this means of administrative review, there is to be established a general review of the merits of each exercise of administrative power. It is to be kept steadily in mind that, in such a case as this, the court is concerned with whether there were purposes and grounds which, in the circumstances, could warrant the doing of what was done. Subject to the Wednesbury principle, the court is not concerned with the correctness or reasonableness of the decision on its merits. It is the absence of relevant purposes and reasons for the determination in this case that warrants the conclusion that the determination was invalid.

In view of the arguments advanced in this appeal, it is, in my opinion, proper to refer to four other matters. First, the power given by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s48.html) to determine whether a post-mortem should be held is, of course, a discretionary power. The grounds to which a coroner can and will ordinarily have regard will no doubt be those which bear directly on the proper exercise of the coronial functions: whether there are medical, legal or other reasons why a post-mortem will be of assistance in, to take examples, determining whether an inquest should be held or in the conduct of the inquest. But grounds of that kind are not the only grounds to which the coroner can and should have regard. It is, in my opinion, proper for a coroner, in determining whether to direct a post- mortem, to take into account the legitimate wishes of the person to whom the body has been committed by law, namely, the legal personal representative and, at least in some cases, the members of the deceased's immediate family. The legislature could not have intended that their wishes be ignored. Ordinarily it is not necessary that the coroner seek out the wishes of others in this regard. But where those wishes are known to him, it will ordinarily be appropriate that he take them into account. Where, for example, a post-mortem would provide only marginal assistance in the discharge of the coronial functions, the fact that a post-mortem would cause deep distress to the legal personal representative or relevant family members may be sufficient to warrant the coroner not directing a post-mortem.

Second, what I have said is not intended to limit the procedures by which a coroner may make determinations of this or analogous kinds. In particular, I do not mean that rules of practice may not be adopted by a coroner in deciding whether, in general or in particular classes of cases within [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s13.html), a post-mortem should be directed. The circumstances in which a person exercising an administrative function may act in accordance with a general administrative rule have been dealt with in the cases. In principle, each exercise of power is an individual case. However, an administrator may adopt a general rule for the making of decisions provided always that in what he does he recognises that each decision is individual and that the general rule is open to reconsideration or to qualification in the light of the individual case. The requirement that an officer take into account relevant and not take into account irrelevant considerations does not require that, in every case, he search out what are relevant and irrelevant considerations and exhaustively examine the facts for their existence: see the observations of Mason CJ in
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs versus Peko-Wallsend Ltd <case>; [(1985-6) 162 CLR 24] at 40-1. What it will be appropriate for a coroner to do, consistently with principles of this kind, will depend upon the circumstances of the case.

Third, I have to this point considered the matter by reference to the decision of the defendant Mr Abernethy, made on 6 May 1996, that a post-mortem be held.
It is the validity of that decision which in terms is in issue in the plaintiff's claim. However, during argument it emerged that the matter could, or might, be determined upon a different basis. An officer having power to make a decision may reverse or set aside that decision in the ordinary course of administration: see, eg, [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s48.html) Mr
Abernethy could, in the present case, set aside the determination he made under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s48.html)
Within limits, it would be his duty to consider whether the determination should be set aside where the occasion arose for it. It may be inferred that, when the determination of 6 May 1996 was made, Mr Abernethy did not have before him the facts as to the wishes of the plaintiff and her immediate family. He could not, of course, be criticised for not taking such matters into account if they were not before him. But subsequently it became apparent that Mrs Deitz desired that his determination be put aside. What they said and did invited him, in effect, to reverse the determination he had made. It is at least arguable that he then was under a duty to consider whether he should do so. From the circumstances of this proceeding it may perhaps be inferred that he took the decision in principle that this should not be done: before this
Court, the stance taken for him was to the effect that he should stand by the determination made and that that determination was not reviewable. It is at least arguable that such an exercise of his power to review what he had done was wrong and that appropriate relief could and should be given in relation to it. However, for myself, I think the matter may be decided by reference to the determination of 6 May 1996 and I deal with the matter on that basis.

Fourth, reference was made in the course of argument to the views which had been expressed by others as to the extent to which the personal or religious views of an executor or the immediate family of the deceased can and should be taken into account in these matters. To this I have referred. If there be reasons, relevant to the coronial functions, why a post-mortem should be directed or an inquest held, that may be done notwithstanding that that decision will be inconsistent with, eg, the religious views of those concerned. As far as the courts are concerned, action taken by a coroner must be taken in accordance with the law. But proper account will be taken of religious and other beliefs as far as the law allows and, in many cases, the law as properly administered will be able to accommodate the religious views of those concerned.

The Court has already directed that the body of the deceased be released to the plaintiff for the purposes of appropriate burial. The Court has had regard to the possibility of further or other orders being made by a coroner in the exercise of the relevant powers. However, it was not suggested to the Court that any such orders should be made and accordingly, the orders previously made were made.

The result of the proceeding is that the appeal has been dismissed with costs.

MEAGHER JA: I agree with the reasons for judgment of Mahoney P.
