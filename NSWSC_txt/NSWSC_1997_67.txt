SANDRA ANNE FIORENTINI versus SONJA O'NEILL /97 
MONDAY 3 MARCH 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
MEAGHER JA 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is another application for a stay in which the claimant is the second wife of the deceased and the opponent is the daughter of the first wife of the deceased. Cowdroy AJ has made an order that an amount be paid out in favour of the opponent in the sum of $110,000. This has undoubtedly caused some hardship to the claimant, and understandably the claimant has lodged an appeal.

Despite the very convincing argument of Mr Armfield, who has said everything that can possibly be said on behalf of his client, I do not think a case for a stay has been made out. The notice of motion is therefore dismissed with costs.
