February 1997) 
WILSON v. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIVE SERVICES & Anor /96 February 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
HUNT CJ AT CL, SMART J, JAMES J 
CATCHWORDS:CANCELLATION OF PERIODIC DETENTION ORDER - NO PREROGATIVE RELIEF 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Dismissed 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ AT CL: I agree with Smart AJA that the application to this Court for relief in the nature of certiorari and prohibition should be dismissed, and that (in the circumstances) no order should be made as to costs. I agree also with the reasons for the dismissal of the application which Smart AJA has given in his judgment in the related matter in the Court of Criminal Appeal, Wilson v. Department of Corrective Services (60650 of 1995).
 
SMART AJA: For the reasons contained in my judgment in the related matter in the Court of Criminal Appeal, Wilson v. Department of Corrective
Services (60650/95) I am of the opinion that the application for relief in the nature of certiorari and prohibition should be dismissed and that no order for costs should be made because of the unfortunate bifurcation of jurisdiction, the difficulty of an applicant knowing what course to take and the essentially criminal character of the substantive issues raised.
 
JAMES AJA: I agree with the judgment of Smart AJA.
