Evidence of complaint in sexual assault cases - admissibility in evidence in chief of complainant pursuant to the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html), [108](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html)(3)(b) - whether use of evidence should be limited pursuant to [s 136.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) 
Evidence of "complaint" made in a sexual assault case is capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the fact in issue (sexual intercourse without consent). It all depends upon the circumstances in which the "complaint" was made. A "complaint" made in a situation where it might be expected that such a complaint would be made by a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted is clearly capable of affecting such an assessment, and it is thus relevant in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). It would not usually be appropriate to exclude evidence of "complaint" pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) in the exercise of any discretion.

It may nevertheless be appropriate in the particular cases to limit, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html), the use of evidence of "complaint" to the issue of credit. (Obiter) per Hunt
CJ at CL: Where "complaint" was made in a situation where it might be expected that such a complaint would be made by a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted, and where the evidence of such "complaint" does not clearly fall within the precise terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html), the use of that evidence should ordinarily be limited only where its unreliability is such that it cannot be cured by the "hearsay" warning required by [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
It is a question which must be determined according to the circumstances of the particular case.

Per Bruce J: Evidence of contemporaneous or near contemporaneous complaint would not ordinarily satisfy the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) but whether it does or not is a question which must be determined in each case depending upon the individual circumstances.

Per Smart J (dissenting): The use of evidence of "complaint" as evidence of the truth of what was said is usually unfairly prejudicial to the accused and its use should be limited.

Evidence of "complaint" will be come admissible in the evidence in chief of the complainant - by leave - if it is going to be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the complainant as to the sexual assault has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion [(s (3)(b)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html)
Such leave should usually be granted unless the accused through his legal representative states expressly that no such suggestion is to be made in relation to the complainant's evidence. Such an issue should be raised at a convenient time in the absence of the jury.

Regina versus Geoffrey Arthur Hall (CCA, 28 February 1997, unreported) discussed ------------------- 
REGINA versus B D 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ at CL: The appellant, to whom I will refer as BD, was found guilty by a District Court jury on three charges of sexual intercourse without consent with SMB in circumstances of aggravation.[1] Judge Coleman QC imposed an effective total sentence of penal servitude for eight years, consisting of a minimum term of five years and an additional term of three years. 
The Crown case was that the complainant, who was the appellant's niece, was living with the appellant and his children on a country property where he was employed. She was, at the time when the offences were alleged to have taken place, just over sixteen years of age, and she was provided with accommodation in return for assistance in the household duties. She was thus said by the
Crown to have been under the authority of the appellant; this constituted the circumstances of aggravation charged.

Evidence was given by the complainant that the appellant did from time to time give her a cuddle, but these cuddles were not of a sexual nature. On the occasion of the first offence alleged against the appellant (a Wednesday), the complainant said that he had asked her for a cuddle. He had then touched her on the breast outside her clothing, removed her clothing and touched her breasts and kissed one of them. When he attempted to remove her pants, she tried to hold on to her pants and held her legs together, but he was successful in removing them. Sexual intercourse had followed in the ordinary sense of the term - his penis penetrated her vagina. The complainant said nothing because she was scared. She "just sort of gave up". When the appellant had finished, she was crying. He promised that he would not do it again. She then went to bed. This was the incident upon which the first count was based.

The complainant avoided the appellant the next day (the Thursday), but he came into her bedroom that evening when she was in bed. She said that he had tried to touch her again on her breasts, and that she had turned away from him on her bed. He had then entered her bed and started to lick her on the back. She protested twice. He had said: "All your uncle asks of you is just one last favour, just one last time, it'll never happen again." 
She again protested, but he pulled her pants down despite her efforts to hold on to them. Anal intercourse followed. That constituted the second count. The appellant then had vaginal intercourse with her and left the room. This was the third count.

The following morning (the Friday) the complainant packed her bag and, after the appellant had left for work, she went to the home of the owner of the property but no-one was home. She telephoned a local school teacher who lived on the next property. The teacher came to fetch the complainant, who told her (according to the evidence of the complainant herself) that she had been raped and that it had happened twice. She was taken to the Base Hospital where she was interviewed by a sexual assault counsellor. She had then travelled to her home in another country centre. She was examined, as were the clothes which she said that she was wearing at the time when the second and third offences were committed. This was on the Saturday. The doctor who examined her said that the complainant had tenderness in the areas of the upper thigh, vagina, perineum and anus. Semen was found on her underpants and compared with a blood sample given by the appellant. DNA testing could not exclude the semen as having come from the appellant.

The school teacher gave evidence that the complainant appeared to be distressed when she had telephoned, and she said that she had been raped. When the teacher went to fetch her, the complainant told her that the appellant had felt her breast and "We did it". (I shall have to return later to the context in which this was said.) After the teacher had left the complainant at the
Base Hospital, she had confronted the appellant with the accusations made by the complainant. The appellant had replied: "I didn't do it. She needs to get out of the country soon or I'll kill her for what she's done to me. ... I didn't touch her, she's my niece." 
The appellant's case was that he did have sexual intercourse with the complainant on the Wednesday, but that he had believed that she was consenting. He denied the allegations in relation to the second and third counts. As to the first, the appellant gave evidence that he had promised the complainant that it would never happen again. He had said this because she was his niece. He explained that it had been a long time since he had had any sexual intercourse. As to his belief that she was consenting, he said that she had earlier said to him in relation to her free board: "I'll have to pay in another way `cause I'm too lazy to do the housework, and the only way, other way, is sex." 
On the Wednesday, she had lain down on the bed with him and had started to feel him up the leg. He had rubbed her back. She had undressed herself. He had not worn a condom. She had appeared to enjoy the sexual intercourse and she had kissed him and cuddled him afterwards. He said that he had formed the opinion that she had wanted to have sexual intercourse. He was "reasonably drunk" at the time.

All three of the filed grounds of appeal relate to two statements made or alleged to have been made by the complainant out of court - they complain of the admission of one of them into evidence and the directions given in relation to the other. The first is the allegation of rape on two occasions which the complainant said that she had made to the school teacher on the
Friday. The second is the version of the same conversation which the teacher gave in evidence - that the complainant had told her "We did it". The first was evidence of "complaint", which was consistent with the evidence which the complainant gave.[2] The second was put forward as an inconsistent statement, limiting the sexual intercourse to one occasion and, moreover, suggesting that the sexual intercourse had been consensual in nature. The complainant agreed in cross-examination that, if she had said "We did it", she would have meant that both parties had agreed to have sexual intercourse. (Again, I will have to return later to the context in which this was said.) 
The trial took place during August last year. The provisions of the [Evidence
Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) applied to it, a fact which was recognized during the trial. Before the complainant was called, an application was made by the Crown to edit the tape of the electronically recorded interview with the appellant in order to excise various statements made by the appellant during the interview which, the Crown submitted, would (if admitted) offend the provisions of <case> of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), in that they would disclose or imply that the complainant had had sexual experience or had taken part in sexual activity and that they did not fall within any of the exceptions permitted by that subsection. One of the arguments put on behalf of the appellant in opposition to such excision was that [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s81.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) had the effect of overruling <case> of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) - an argument which the judge rejected (and correctly so). It is, however, not so clear as to whether those engaged in the trial were aware of the effect of that Act upon both versions of the statement made by the complainant to the teacher.

There was a dispute before this Court as to the impression which the jury would have obtained from the summing up as to the evidentiary status of these out of court statements. Following the general directions as to such matters as the onus and burden of proof and the proper approach to the assessment of witnesses, following the directions of law as to what the Crown had to prove in order to establish each of the ingredients of the offence, and before turning to the evidence in the case, the judge gave two specific directions as to the approach to be taken to the evidence of "complaint", and specifically to the evidence of the "complaint" made to the school teacher. He discussed how the evidence should be used in the case, and the relevance of delay. The first is relevant here. The judge said: "The Crown led that evidence, ladies and gentlemen, as evidence of a complaint made by [SMB] to somebody else. That evidence was led to assist you in deciding whether her conduct was consistent. In relation to that matter, the Crown says, this is conduct that you would expect from the complainant in the circumstances and the Crown says that it assists you because the Crown says that the complainant's conduct, that is [SMB]'s conduct, was consistent with what she says happened and answers any argument that the absence of complaint which suggests that the offence did not take place." 
The judge told the jury that he would come later to what was said by the complainant to the school teacher and to what he said was "the significance" of that conversation.

The judge next summarised the evidence in the case. When dealing with the cross-examination of the complainant, the judge referred to a conflict between her evidence as to what clothes she had been wearing when the sexual intercourse took place on the Wednesday. She had said in her evidence that she was wearing a skivvy and tracksuit pants over a brassiere and panties, but she had told the doctor, as part of the history taken, that she had been wearing "her usual T-shirt and undies for sleepwear". As to this conflict, the judge said: "Those questions were asked of her, ladies and gentlemen, to demonstrate that on a previous occasion she had said something about what she was wearing which was inconsistent with the evidence that she gave before you. Now the purpose of those questions, ladies and gentlemen, was to demonstrate that there was an inconsistency. If you are satisfied, ladies and gentlemen, that there was such an inconsistency, then you can use that evidence in a very particular and a very limited way.

You cannot take her statement to Dr Millard - if you are satisfied that she said to Dr Millard, `I was wearing the long T-shirt and the pants' - you cannot take that as evidence of what she was in fact wearing on the night, but you can take it into account when you come to assess her credit or her reliability as a witness. Now that was why the questions were asked. It was to demonstrate that her evidence was not consistent, and that is an inconsistency ladies and gentlemen that Mr Parker [counsel for the appellant at the trial] says that you will take into account when you come to consider her accuracy or her reliability. The Crown says, ladies and gentlemen, in relation to that, well you would expect inconsistency. You don't expect people to tell the same story. And this inconsistency, we heard the Crown put, was not a matter which was in any way important, as the Crown put it, in the assessment of her evidence. The Crown says you expect people who are upset to be inconsistent in the accounts that they give. That is a matter for you to weigh, ladies and gentlemen. When you take that evidence into account, that is the use that you should make of it. It is there for that limited purpose."[3] 
The second of those directions was adopted by reference when other prior inconsistent statements were referred to - as to whether the complainant had said to the doctor expressly (rather than by description) that the appellant had ejaculated on the second occasion. There was another reference to the lack of "complaint" made to a neighbour, and the judge made reference to "the significance [of complaint] so far as consistency is concerned". Then, when the judge came to the conflict between whether the complainant had told the teacher that "We did it" or "I've been raped", the judge said: "Now, ladies and gentlemen, that is a matter that the accused - and remembering the accused bears no onus of proving anything - that the accused places some emphasis on in his defence. The accused says that that is a difference, ladies and gentlemen, because it goes go the question of what he says really happened. That is, that there was consensual intercourse on the first night and that his niece was ashamed by what had happened and wanted to go back to her mother, and that for that reason she had fabricated the events on the second occasion."[4] 
What impression, then, would the jury have obtained from the summing up as to the evidentiary status of those out of court statements? They would clearly have understood from the first passage which I have quoted that evidence of "complaint" was relevant to the complainant's credit, but that passage did not include any direction - as used to be required in relation to such an out of court statement which was not evidence of the truth of what was said - that it did not constitute such evidence.[5] On the other hand, the jury would clearly have understood from the second passage that evidence of a prior inconsistent statement was also relevant to the complainant's credit, but that such an out of court statement was not evidence as to the truth of what was said.

Notwithstanding the Crown's argument to the contrary, I do not accept that the jury would have assumed from those two passages that all out of court statements relating to the credit of the complainant could only be used for a limited purpose, and thus did not constitute evidence of the truth of what was said. The credit of the complainant was of vital importance to the Crown case, and the summing up suggests that that was indeed the principal issue in the trial. The jury would more likely have noticed that, when dealing with evidence of "complaint", all that the judge did was to explain how it could be relevant to the credit of the complainant. The judge subsequently, as I have said, referred to the significance of the evidence of "complaint" as being its consistency with the complainant's evidence. There was no emphasis placed upon the fact that the "complaint" was an out of court statement, and it would, in my view, require the sophisticated knowledge of a lawyer to reach a conclusion from the summing up that evidence of "complaint" which was consistent with the evidence of the complainant - because it, too, was an out of court statement - did not constitute evidence of the truth of what was said.

The situation is, however, a little blurred by what the judge said in the third passage which I have quoted. The context in which that direction was given was the prior statement by the complainant, "We did it", which (on the appellant's case) was inconsistent with her evidence of sexual intercourse without consent. The reference in that passage to "the question of what he says really happened" is not exactly clear. In isolation, it could perhaps have been understood by the jury in one of two ways - as suggesting no more than that, if the version "We did it" is accepted, it is consistent with the appellant's own version; alternatively, as suggesting that the prior statement was some evidence as to the truth of what was said in that version. As that version was inconsistent with the complainant's evidence, however, and in the light of the previous very clear direction that a prior inconsistent statement is not evidence as to the truth of what was said, I am satisfied that, in that context, the jury would not have understood it in that alternative way. On the other hand, the Crown's version ("I've been raped") was not a prior inconsistent statement, and so the jury may well not, in my view, have understood any of the directions given by the judge as limiting the use to which the evidence of that particular "complaint" could be made.

It follows, therefore, that the jury would have interpreted the judge's directions as requiring them to make limited use only of any inconsistent statement (including "We did it"), so that such statements were not evidence of the truth of what was said, but that the jury may well have interpreted the directions as not limiting the use which they could make of any other "complaint" made out of court by the complainant (including "I've been raped").

Had the judge directed the jury that nothing which the complainant had said out of court could be taken by them as evidence of the truth of what she said, such a direction would have been correct at common law, which permitted evidence of "complaint" - that is, prior consistent statements - to be given, not as evidence of the truth of what was said but as evidence going to the credit of the complainant as a witness, because it was seen as conduct which might be expected of a truthful person who had been sexually assaulted.[6] But it was relevant only to the complainant's credit, and could not be called unless the complainant herself were called.[7] [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), however, now provides that evidence relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible - which the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s3.html)
Dictionary defines as "the credibility rule" - although [Pt .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the Act provides a number of exceptions to the credibility rule, of which only one is relevant - that provided by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html), to which I will return presently. On the other hand, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) of the Act now permits evidence of such out of court statements as "first hand" hearsay in certain circumstances, and thus directly as evidence of the truth of what was said, subject to the power of the trial judge either to exclude it[8] or to limit its use.[9] These provisions were discussed in this Court's judgment in Regina versus Geoffrey Arthur Hall,10 to which I will also return.

The common law also permitted evidence of prior inconsistent statements to be given, again as evidence relating to the credit of the witness who had made them but not as evidence of their truth.[11] [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), however, now provides that evidence of such statements is evidence of the truth of what was said. That section was discussed in this Court's judgment in Regina v
Brian John Welsh.12 
I turn now to the specific grounds of appeal. The appellant has argued that the evidence of "complaint" was wrongly admitted at all (ground 1), that the directions in relation to both the prior statements, both consistent and inconsistent, were erroneous (ground 2) and that the judge erred in failing to direct the jury that both were evidence of the truth of what was said (ground ).

No objection was taken at the trial in relation to any of the directions to which I have referred, and the judge was not asked to give any other directions. In fairness, it should be pointed out that neither of the decisions of this Court to which I have referred had been delivered at the time of the trial. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that the
Act had been in operation for almost twelve months by that time and, although there had been some confusion within the profession as to the status of evidence of "complaint",[13] the effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) upon prior inconsistent statements should have been widely known. It was put forward by the Law Reform Commission as one of the principal areas in which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) would operate,[14] in a passage quoted in the first edition of the text book "Uniform Evidence Law" which was widely used by the time this trial took place. 15 As no objection was taken at the trial, r 4 of the [Criminal Appeal
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/) prevents any such errors being relied upon in this Court without leave. Leave will be granted only if the appellant can show that the error led to a miscarriage of justice.[16] 
I see no miscarriage of justice in relation to the admission of the evidence of "complaint", which is the subject of the first ground of appeal. There are at least three reasons why the erroneous assumption apparently made by everyone at the trial that its admissibility was still governed by the common law did not amount to a miscarriage of justice in this case. First, and notwithstanding the arguments put by the appellant to the contrary, the evidence of "complaint" was admissible in any event as "first hand" hearsay pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/s66.html) of the
Act in the circumstances of this case. It was thus evidence of the truth of what was said (which is how the jury may well have interpreted the directions relating to those complaints which were consistent with the complainant's evidence in any event).

It was argued by the appellant that evidence of "complaint" is not admissible pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/s66.html), upon the basis that the mere assertion of a self-serving statement in relation to the fundamental fact in issue (sexual intercourse without consent) could never rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of that fact, and therefore (in accordance with [s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/car186/s55.html) the statement was not relevant to proof of that fact. I accept the possibility that there may be cases where the mere assertion of a self-serving statement could not rationally affect that assessment, but I do not accept the argument that such a statement could never do so. It all depends upon the circumstances in which the statement was made. In most cases, the circumstances in which the assertion is made will be capable of giving a self-serving statement probative value.[17] Whether or not it does in fact do so will then be a question for the jury. A "complaint" made in a situation where it might be expected that such a complaint would be made by a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted is clearly capable of affecting such an assessment and it is thus relevant. In my opinion, such was the case here.

It was nevertheless argued that the provisions of <case> of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) are significant to this issue, in that (so the argument ran) it indicates a legislative intention that no rational inference can be drawn from the absence of "complaint". That section requires the trial judge to warn the jury that the absence of "complaint" or the delay in complaining "does not necessarily indicate" that the allegation of sexual assault is false, and to inform the jury that there may be good reasons why "complaint" was not made or was delayed. That argument in relation to the absence of "complaint" is of no assistance where what we are concerned with is the making of a "complaint" rather than its absence. It is in any event an invalid argument, as it overlooks the right of the trial judge to tell the jury that they may nevertheless take the absence of "complaint" into account in evaluating the evidence of the complainant.[18] 
I am satisfied that the evidence of "complaint" in the present case was relevant. It would not, in my view, usually be appropriate to exclude evidence of "complaint" pursuant to <case> in the exercise of any discretion. Such evidence is of substantial importance in sexual assault cases. The Law Reform
Commission did not explain in any satisfactory way why it was being excluded as an exception to the restriction imposed by <case>. My own experience in the
Supreme Court of rape trials prior to 1982, and of trials based on the sexual assault legislation which replaced the crime of rape thereafter, persuaded me that evidence of "complaint" was very often the most powerful factor which supported the complainant's credit. If such evidence was not given, juries almost inevitably asked why it had not.

Where the evidence of "complaint" is admissible as "first hand" hearsay pursuant to <case>, it may become appropriate in the particular case to limit its use to the issue of credit pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s136.html)
Since writing this judgment, I have read what Smart J has written. I do not agree with him that such a limitation should usually be imposed in relation to evidence of "complaint", although the result of this appeal does not turn upon which view is correct. Whether such limitation should be imposed will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. The circumstances in which the power can be exercised are narrowly defined by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s136.html) - if there is a danger that the use of the evidence as establishing the truth of what was said might be (a) unfairly prejudicial to a party, or (b) misleading or confusing. Category (b) is self-evident. Category (a) must be applied with some care. The phrase "unfairly prejudicial" or the cognate phrase "unfair prejudice" is also used in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s135.html) and [137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s137.html), and the meaning to be given to each of those phrases must logically be the same in each section - whether or not a weighing exercise is contemplated. The prejudice to which each of the sections refers is not that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way.[19] 
The fact that the evidence is hearsay will attract the obligation upon the trial judge imposed by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, to explain why that is so and to warn of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.[20] In my opinion, where "complaint" was made in a situation where it might be expected that such a complaint would be made by a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted, and where the evidence of such "complaint" does not clearly fall within the precise terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html), the use of that evidence should ordinarily be limited only where its unreliability is such that it cannot be cured by such a warning.[21] As I have already said, it is a question which must be determined according to the circumstances of the particular case. There is, it seems to me (with respect), a considerable degree of artificiality involved where, in order to avoid the consequences of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) that evidence relating only to credit is not admissible, the evidence is first admitted as first hand hearsay pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) (and thus as evidence of the truth of what was said) and then its use is restricted so that it becomes relevant only to credit.

The Crown has submitted that the judge was entitled to limit the use to be made of this evidence in the present case. The first answer to that submission is that the judge never exercised his discretion to do so. I do not believe that the interpretation which I have held that the jury may well have given to the directions relating to evidence of "complaint" which was consistent with the complainant's evidence was one which was intended by the judge. He apparently assumed (in common with both counsel appearing at the trial) that the limitation imposed by the common law applied. The second answer to the submission is that there was nothing misleading or confusing about the evidence or which was unfairly prejudicial to either party which could have warranted any limitation of its use pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) I see no reason why the use to be made of the evidence of "complaint" should have been limited in the present case.

Secondly, in relation to the grant of leave to argue that the evidence was inadmissible, this Court is entitled to take into account the nature of the issues which were litigated in the trial. The appellant intended (even in ignorance of the effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)) to use the version of the "complaint" given in evidence by the school teacher ("We did it") in order to demonstrate that the complainant had made a prior statement (within a very short time of the alleged events) which - depending upon its context (an issue to which I must return) - had inconsistently limited the sexual intercourse to one occasion and suggested that it had been consensual in nature. That was indeed the whole of his case. Even if the appellant wished to use that version in order merely to attack the credit of the complainant, the Crown would necessarily have been entitled to the grant of leave to adduce from the complainant, in re-examination, her own version of the "complaint" ("I've been raped") in accordance with [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html), which provides: "The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted; or it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion; and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement." 
It is par (a) of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) which is relevant to this second reason why there was no miscarriage of justice. It is not necessary under the Act, as it is under the common law rule of "recent invention", that the prior consistent statement was made either contemporaneously with the event in question or at a time sufficiently early to be inconsistent with the suggestion that the evidence given at the trial is a recent invention or reconstruction, and thus rationally tends to answer that suggestion.[22] However, the ability of the prior consistent statement to answer the suggestion must remain a matter to be considered in determining whether leave is to be granted.

In the present case, the complainant denied the version to be given by the teacher when it was put to her in cross-examination, and the prior consistent statement is her version of the same conversation. That is why leave would have had to be granted to the Crown to lead her version if the issue had been raised. The complainant's own version may well also have been admissible in re-examination pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html), which provides: "The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness." 
Leave is not required under subs (1) as it is under subs (3). It is, however, unnecessary to determine the admissibility pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) of the complainant's version of what she said to the teacher in the present appeal. What should be pointed out is that, once the evidence becomes admissible pursuant to any part of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) - which is a purpose other than proof of the truth of what was said - then [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) would appear to operate to make it evidence of that truth unless its use is limited by the judge pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html)[23] 
Thirdly, [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) provides yet another basis upon which the evidence of "complaint" would have been admissible in any event. This time it is par (b) of the sub-section which is relevant. The subsection was referred to in passing in this Court's decision in Regina versus Geoffrey Arthur Hall.24 Such is the difficulty which the whole legal profession is still having in understanding fully the interaction between the various provisions of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), the full extent of the operation of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) was neither argued nor perceived in that case. It certainly requires a patient search to elucidate the various ways in which those various provisions do operate.[25] [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) carries a sub-heading "Exception: re-establishing credibility". Subsection (1) expressly refers to evidence in re-examination. Subsection (2), however, does not refer to evidence in re-examination; it refers to evidence led to explain or contradict evidence which the other party has led attacking the credit of a person whose out of court statement has been admitted as "first hand" hearsay but who has not given evidence. It would not therefore usually be evidence given in the re-examination of a witness.[26] Nor does subs (3) expressly refer to re-examination. There is therefore no warrant for interpreting that subsection as relating only to the re-examination of a witness. To the extent that anything which was said in Regina versus Geoffrey Arthur Hall has been understood as suggesting the contrary, it is necessary to make it clear that any such suggestion is wrong.

The significant words in par (b) are "will be" in the phrase "if ... it is or will be suggested". Thus, if it is going to be suggested that the complainant has fabricated or deliberately or otherwise reconstructed her evidence of the sexual assault or that her evidence has been the result of suggestion, evidence of "complaint" which she made becomes admissible during her evidence in chief - subject only to the grant of leave.[27] The need to rely upon [s (3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) would arise only where the "complaint" was not already admissible pursuant to [s 66.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html)
The grant of leave may perhaps in some cases depend upon the extent to which the evidence had failed to meet the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html), but it should be unusual that leave would be refused.

Such is the importance of evidence of "complaint" in sexual assault cases (because of the powerful support which it gives to the complainant's credit), leave should in my opinion usually be granted unless the accused through his legal representative states expressly that no suggestion is to be made that the complainant's evidence has been the result of fabrication, reconstruction (deliberate or otherwise) or suggestion. Such an issue should be raised at a convenient time in the absence of the jury. Leave would have had to be granted to the Crown in the present case. Again, once the evidence is admitted pursuant to [s (3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html), [s 60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) would appear to make it evidence of the truth of what was said unless its use is limited pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) 
In my opinion, the first ground of appeal (that evidence of "complaint" was wrongly admitted) must inevitably fail, and that leave to rely upon it should therefore be refused.

The second and third grounds of appeal may be taken together - that the judge erred in the directions which he gave in relation to the use to which the out of court statements could be used. Whichever way the directions concerning the evidence of "complaint" may have been interpreted by the jury, there remains both a misdirection and a non-direction as to the use to which the jury could put the evidence of the prior inconsistent statements (including the "We did it" statement). Once more, however, leave is required and leave will be granted only if the appellant can show that the error led to a miscarriage of justice.

The appellant has argued that, whereas the Crown may well have received the benefit of an interpretation by the jury of the directions given that there was no limitation to which the "I've been raped" complaint could be put, he was expressly denied the benefit of a direction that the "We did it" complaint was also some evidence of the truth of what was said. That argument depended upon the latter version of the complaint being interpreted by the jury in the manner contended for by the appellant, as limiting the intercourse to one occasion and having been consensual in nature. As stated earlier, the complainant agreed in cross-examination that, if she had said "We did it" (although she denied that she had used that phrase when speaking to the teacher), she would have meant that both parties had agreed to have sexual intercourse. That concession was obtained from the complainant by looking at the phrase completely in isolation. The jury, however, had to look at its use in the context in which the teacher said that it had been used.

The teacher gave evidence that the complainant had telephoned her in a distressed state. She had initially refused to say why but, when pressed, the complainant had said "I've been raped". The teacher had then gone to meet the complainant. She was still in a distressed state, crying and shaking. When asked "Who did this to you?", she had identified the appellant. When asked what had happened, the complainant had said that, when watching television, the appellant had felt her breast and "We did it". The next night, after some friends had gone home, "He raped me". In cross-examination, she agreed that it was only in relation to the second occasion that the complainant had used the word "rape".

In my view, it was very much a jury question as to whether the allegation of rape initially made on the telephone should have been interpreted as also referring only to the second occasion. I am unable to say that the jury would or would not have so interpreted it. The appellant's argument that the "complaint" to the teacher supported his case that the sexual intercourse on the first occasion was consensual is not an unreasonable one, whatever problem it may produce for his case that there was no sexual intercourse at all on the second occasion. It was, as I said earlier, the whole of his case. If the jury had been directed in accordance with the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) that that evidence was evidence of the truth of what was said by the complainant to the teacher, there was at least a chance which was fairly open to the appellant of being acquitted. The error denying him that chance therefore led to a miscarriage of justice.

I recognise that there remains a distinction between the miscarriage of justice referred to in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) - to which the requirement in r 4 of leave is directed - and the substantial miscarriage of justice referred to in the proviso to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html),[28] so that - despite my acceptance of the appellant's argument that the error led to a miscarriage of justice - the Crown remains entitled to argue that the appeal should nevertheless be dismissed because there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice. For this submission to succeed, the
Crown would have to persuade this Court that, in the circumstances of this case, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably, would inevitably have convicted him. 29 
I am not persuaded by the Crown that that is so. Accordingly, I would uphold the second and third grounds of appeal. I propose that the following orders be made:
The appeal is allowed and the convictions are quashed.
There is to be a new trial.
 -------------- 
REGINA v. BD 
JUDGMENT 
SMART J: The appellant appeals against his conviction of aggravated sexual assault (penile penetration of the vagina) on the night of 23 August 1996 and of 2 counts of aggravated sexual assault (penile penetration of the anus followed by penile penetration of the vagina from the complainant's rear) on the night of 24 August 1996. 
The complainant, who was the appellant's niece lived with him and his 5 children in a workman's cottage on a station in one of the less populous rural areas of New South Wales. She had been living in the cottage since February
Her father had recently died at an early age, her mother had subsequently acquired a boyfriend and there had been some difficulties in the home. She was aged 16 and helped the appellant with the home and the children.
He was aged 35, had worked on the station for over 6 years, was separated from his wife and looked after the children.

To watch television the members of the family sat on a bed, probably the appellant's bed, sometimes doing so in their sleepwear. The children went to bed about 8 pm to 8.30 pm. The house and the water used by the household were warmed by a wood fire in the stove.

The complainant contended that after the children had gone to bed on 23 August the appellant had placed his hands upon her breasts, sought intercourse, undressed her against her resistance and raped her. He contended that everything started when she ran her hand along his thigh extending to the groin area. He accepted that he probably placed his hand on her breasts, and contended that matters developed and that they had consensual intercourse accompanied by the normal incidents of kissing, cuddling etc. There was a conflict in the evidence as to the clothing she was wearing at the time of the incident. After the incident she went to her bedroom. Given the isolation of the cottage and the young children in the cottage she was in a difficult situation. It seemed to be common ground that during the following day the appellant and the complainant did not see each other until late in the day.
The complainant stated that she kept out of his way.

On the evening of 24 August 1996 some family friends stayed from about 7.30 pm to about 11.00 pm at the cottage. The appellant did not succeed in her attempt to obtain, via the friends' daughter, an invitation to stay at the home of the friends. According to the complainant, after the family friends had left the appellant came into her room and sought intercourse. She declined but he persisted and without her consent had anal and vaginal penile intercourse. The appellant contended that the alleged incident did not occur and that her evidence was untrue. He contended that after they had consensual intercourse on the first night she regretted it and wanted to go back to her mother and for that reason had fabricated the events on the second occasion. This was how the judge left the appellant's case to the jury. The main issue at the trial was her creditibility.

The Crown case consisted of the following: 
Her evidence of the rapes; 
Her evidence that she complained on the morning of 25 August 1996 to a lady who lived on a neighbouring property who was a mother, and a school teacher; 
The evidence of the teacher, who appears to have been sensible and impressive, that the complainant telephoned her on the morning of 25 August in an apparently distressed condition, seeking that she come to her.
After being pressed to tell the teacher what was wrong, the complainant stated that she had been raped; 
The further evidence of the teacher that upon meeting with the complainant, she was crying and shaking a lot. That teacher pressed the complainant to state the name of the person who had raped her. Eventually the complainant told her it was the appellant. The lady elicited from the complainant that a couple of nights before while they had been watching television, the appellant had been feeling her breast and that "We did it."
The next night family friends had visited and after they had left she went to bed, he entered her room, sought intercourse and "He raped me." The lady took the complainant to the sexual assault counsellor at Tamworth; 
The complainant declined to be examined by a doctor or to report the matter to the police at Tamworth. She caught the 5 pm bus to Wagga to be with her mother; 
The evidence of the teacher that later on 25 August 1996, the appellant in answer to a question from her denied not only that he had raped the complainant but also that he had touched her; 
The evidence of a doctor at Wagga Base Hospital that on the morning of 26
August 1996, after taking a history, she had examined the complainant and found that she was tender around the perineal area, and the vaginal area.
There was also some discolouration. All this was consistent with the application of a degree of force. The opening in the anus and the walls of the rectum were abnormally tender. This was consistent with forcible entry into the anal region by a penis; 
The evidence of a bio-chemist, that the semen found on the complainant's panties could have come from the appellant. The DNA profile recovered from the panties is found in approximately one person in 3200 of the general population.

The appellant relied on the following: 
His evidence that the complainant instigated the sexual activity on 23
August 1996 by rubbing her hand on his thigh extending into the groin and that they had consensual intercourse that night, his denial of any incident or intercourse taking place on 24 August 1996 and his denial on 25 August 1996 and subsequently of any criminal responsibility; 
Her failure to raise the household or take any action during 24 August ;

The concession of the complainant that the words "We did it" means we agreed to do it; 
The differences in the complainant's account to the teacher as related by her and by the complainant. Significantly the teacher gave evidence of the complainant's use of "We did it" in relation to the first incident. There were other differences; 
The differences in the complainant's account to the doctor as related by her and by the complainant. Amongst other differences the doctor was told by the complainant that she was wearing a long shirt and panties (her sleepwear) when the first incident occurred. The complainant's evidence was that the appellant removed her top (a skivy) and bra and forced down her tracksuit trousers while she was trying to hold onto the elastic at the waist and keeping her legs closed. The complainant stated that she was not tender in the groin area.

She agreed that she had not wanted to complain but her mother insisted that she do so.

Apart from the appellant's evidence, there was material of substance on which to found an attack on the truthfulness of the complainant.

The Grounds of Appeal 
The appellant submitted that both in admitting the evidence of the complaints made by the complainant to the teacher and to the doctor and in his directions as to that evidence the judge had erred. He had not applied the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) . No-one at the trial appears to have directed their minds to the effect of that Act.
It was relatively new and is expressed in language which is not easy to follow. Some of the provisions are obscure and it is necessary to look at the
Law Reform Commission's report to catch a glimpse of what was contemplated. A good unscrambling kit is required.

Historically, evidence of a complaint was formerly admitted upon the basis that it went to the credibility of the prosecutrix. If she did not complain reasonably promptly it was often said that it cast doubt upon her allegations of rape or other sexual offences. A prompt complaint was regarded as consistent with her allegations. A prompt complaint by a lady who was distressed, was often useful evidence for the Crown.

The absence of or delay in complaint was sometimes used unfairly against the prosecutrix. She may, for example, have been fearful of the perpetrator, immature, not intelligent, anxious to avoid the trauma of police procedures and court hearings or reluctant to cause a family member to be gaoled especially if the perpetrator was supporting the family. The Legislature intervened by introducing <case> into the Crimes Act 1995 . That section required the judge to tell the jury that the absence of or delay in complaint did not necessarily mean that the allegation that the offence was committed was false and that there may be good reasons for such delay or absence. The [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) does not affect this position.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides that evidence that is relevant only to a witness' credibility is not admissible. Complaint evidence was relevant only to the prosecutrix' credibility. Where the complaint is accompanied by distress it is often not easy to separate the complaint and the distress and artificial to do so. The distress, while far from decisive, may point to the probability of the sexual assault occurring. That depends upon the circumstances. Where the complaint and the distress are closely inter-weaved I would not regard the complaint- distress evidence as relevant only to the witness' credibility.

In the case where there is only a complaint [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) renders it inadmissible and none of the exceptions to the credibility rule contained in [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s103.html)-107 make it admissible. However, the exceptions referred to in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) and (3) are relevant. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) provides that the credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re- examination of a witness. The use of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) depends upon the cross examination of the witness. That may make a complaint relevant.
 [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) provides: 
The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness had been admitted or it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.

The evidence of the teacher revealed both a prior inconsistent statement and a prior consistent statement by the prosecutrix. The evidence of the doctor did likewise. The effect of the evidence which the teacher and the doctor were likely to give was probably known prior to the trial starting. The jury had the prosecutrix' version of what she said and that of the teacher and the doctor. The cross examiner highlighted the inconsistencies.

In my opinion the statements of complaint, as detailed by the prosecutrix, the teacher and the doctor were admissible, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) (a).

The statements were also admissible under [s (3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) as the appellant's case was that the evidence of the prosecutrix as to the lack of consent on the first count and the happening of the incidents alleged in the second and third counts was fabricated. If any question arises as to the admissibility of a complaint during the evidence in chief of a Crown witness, it is desirable that the judge enquire whether it will be suggested that relevant portions of the witness' evidence have been fabricated, reconstructed or are the result of a suggestion.

The presence of the word `only' in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) is important. Often that evidence will be so linked with other evidence that bears upon the probabilities that it is admissible. The exceptions in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) are important.

There is a complimentary approach based on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). That renders admissible previous representations made by a person who is available to and gives evidence of the existence of the facts the subject of those representations. Also a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made may give evidence of the representation. There is an important proviso. The representation must have been made when the occurrence was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.

When the prosecutrix spoke to the teacher and the doctor the events of 23 and August 1997 were fresh in her mind. Thus her representations or statements of what occurred were admissible unless they should be excluded pursuant to one of the discretionary grounds. Her complaints coupled with her distressed condition were of substantial evidentiary value. They fitted in with the surrounding circumstances. In my opinion there is no discretionary ground upon which they should be excluded in the present case. I have paid particular regard to [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s90.html), [135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) and [137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) .

The effect of admitting statements of a prosecutrix under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) is that subject to any direction to the contrary the statements or representations are evidence of the facts stated, as distinct from being evidence that a statement or complaint was made in those terms. When dealing with the admissibility of previous representations under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) a judge should consider whether a direction should be given under <case> of the
Act limiting the use to be made of the statements made by the prosecutrix.

Section 136 provides: "The court may limit the use of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might: be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or be misleading or confusing" 
Even a prompt complaint may not add much of substance to her substantive evidence of rape. However, as there are cases where a prompt complaint may be useful evidence. Delay in or absence of complaint is often important and, comparatively, often has greater weight than the making of a prompt complaint.
Everything depends on the circumstances. Notwithstanding the warning which the judge gives under <case> that the hearsay evidence may be unreliable, it is my view that to admit complaint evidence as evidence of the fact contained in it is usually unfairly prejudicial to an accused as it allows a complainant to shore up the Crown case. Evidence of a complaint should not be elevated. At the very least there is a danger that the use of the statements in the complaint as evidence of the truth of the facts will be unfairly prejudicial.

The phrase "unfairly prejudicial" appears in ss 135 and 136 and the phrase "unfair prejudice" in <case>. Sections 135 and 137 govern the admission of evidence whereas in <case> the court is empowered to limit the use of the evidence. Sections 135 and 137 require the court to consider whether the probative value is "substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial" (s 135) or "outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice" (s 137). No such exercise is contemplated by <case>. The change in language from that used in ss 135 and 137 to that used in <case> is pointed. A condition for the operation of <case> is that there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to a party. If the court thinks that there is such a danger it has a discretion to limit the use of the evidence. In the exercise of that discretion the court would assess the risk of a jury misusing the evidence and the circumstances in which the complaint was made and its terms.

A mild dilemma may arise. If evidence of the complaint is admitted because it does not fall within the prohibition in <case> or because <case> applies that evidence would be admitted as evidence of the statements made and not as evidence of the truth of the facts in the statement. Assuming the same complaints are also admissible under <case>, then in the absence of a direction under <case>, the statements would be evidence of the facts which they assert.
In such a case the better course will usually be to admit the statements or representations and direct that they are to be used as evidence that such statements were made and not of truth of the facts asserted in the statements.

The circumstances in which complaints are made vary greatly. Given the power of the judge to limit the use of complaint evidence this will usually bear upon the exercise of the discretions to exclude evidence. Apart from noting that evidence of complaint or, perhaps more accurately, absence of or delay in complaint, is usually correctly regarded by juries as being of some importance it is not possible at this point, to give any further useful guidance as to the exercise of the exclusionary discretions.

If the accused wants to rely on part of the complaint as evidence of the truth of the facts stated, this would provide a substantial but not necessarily a decisive reason why, if the terms of the complaint are properly admissible under <case> they should all be admitted as evidence of the truth of the facts which they contain. That problem arises in the present case.

As to the evidence of complaint by the prosecutrix to the teacher the judge said: 
The Crown led that evidence, ladies and gentlemen, as evidence of a complaint made by [S] to somebody else. That evidence was led to assist you in deciding whether her conduct was consistent. In relation to that matter, the Crown says, this is conduct that you would expect from the complainant in the circumstances and the Crown says that it assists you because the Crown says that the complainant's conduct, that is [S'] conduct, was consistent with what she says happened and answers any argument that the absence of complaint which suggests that the offence did not take place." 
On the facts of this case this direction posed some problems. There were differences between the complainant and the teacher as to what the complainant said. The difference as to the first incident was important. If the teacher were correct and the words "We did it" were used as to the incident on 23
August 1996 by the complainant, substantial reasons existed why no offence was committed on that day. The judge and the Crown emphasised that regard had to be had to the context in which the words were used. I am not sure that this really helps given the meaning which the complainant attributed to the words.

The jury should have been told that if they thought the words attributed to the complainant by the teacher may have been or were used by the complainant and bore the meaning which she gave to them there was no true complaint as to the incident on 23 August 1996, the evidence pointing in the other direction.
The question by the teacher of the appellant, as to consensual intercourse not rape, suggests that the teacher may have been left with some doubts as to rape.

The direction did not tell the jury whether they could use what was said to the teacher, as evidence that the statement was made or as evidence of the truth of the facts contained in the statement.

Returning to the clothing she was wearing on the night of 23 August 1996 - skivy, bra, tracksuit pants and underpants or long T shirt and under pants - the judge, after drawing attention to this difference said: "... if you are satisfied that she said to Doctor Millard, `I was wearing the long T-shirt and the pants', you cannot take that as evidence of what she was in fact wearing on the night but you can take it into account when you come to assess her credit or her reliability as a witness. Now that was why the questions were asked. It was to demonstrate that her evidence was not consistent ..." 
Under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) the appellant was entitled to put that her statement to Dr Millard that she was wearing the long T shirt and underpants was evidence of the truth of that fact unless a direction was given under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html)
The appellant would be able to urge that she was in truth wearing what she told Dr Millard and that her story of the appellant forcing down her tracksuit trousers etc. was untrue. Her statement to Dr Millard was made before any statement to the police and her evidence in court.

Where, as here, there is material in a previous representation by the complainant favourable to an accused it would normally by admitted under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted and no direction under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) would be given. There are 2 exceptions which presently come to mind. First, the accused may not wish it and may prefer a limiting direction as to its use under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html)
Second, the statement made or previous representation may, as here, contain material which supports the Crown case and material which supports the defence case. As to both of these cases the favourable part may not be of much moment but the unfavourable part may be damaging. The accused's wishes are a consideration but not decisive. It would often be artificial and confusing to a jury to tell it that part of a statement or previous representation was evidence of the truth of the facts and part was evidence only that a statement had been made. There may be cases where it is correct to do so. Much would depend on the terms of what had been said and the other circumstances.

Important evidence was not dealt with in accordance with the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). The evidence of the teacher and of the doctor raises troubling issues as to the complainant's evidence. The judge canvassed the disputed factual issues at some length. His strong emphasis on the context in which the words were said had the effect of minimising the use of the words "We did it". That makes it all the more important that the jury be told correctly of the use to which her statements could be put.

Correct directions on evidentiary matters bearing upon the credibility of the complainant where that is a critical issue at the trial are necessary. The appellant has, as a result of the directions given and not given, lost a chance, which was fairly open to him, of being acquitted.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

REGINA versus B D 
JUDGMENT 
BRUCE J: I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J. I agree with the conclusion they reach and substantially with their reasons for so doing but there is one matter where they disagree where I should express my view. 
Evidence of complaint by the complainant was admitted in the course of the trial.

Historically evidence of complaint was only admissible in relation to the credit of the complainant but [s.66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) has effected a significant change to the law.
 [S.66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides: "(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: that person, or a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation." 
In this case the complainant gave evidence and evidence was given of complaints made by her on 25 and 26 August 1996 relating to events allegedly occurring on 23 and 24 August 1996.

The events in respect of which the complainant made the statements of which evidence was given must be taken to have been fresh in her mind at the time she made the statements and she was called to give evidence.

Accordingly the requirements of [s.66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) were satisfied in this case and evidence of complaint by the complainant was admissible as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted by her by virtue of the operation of the section.
Evidence of complaint is of considerable significance in sexual assault matters and should be admitted in the usual course.

The evidence, being admissible and having been admitted, the next question which arises is whether it was appropriate that the trial judge should have exercised his discretion pursuant to [s.136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) so as to limit the use to which the evidence could be made to the question of the credit of the complainant.
 [S.136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) provides: "The court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is danger that a particular use of the evidence might: be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or be misleading or confusing." 
The power to limit the use to be made of evidence only arises, so far as is relevant, if there is a danger that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused.

The expression "unfairly prejudicial" is used as the warrant for the exercise of the power. The same expression is used in [s.135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) which grants a general discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial.

In [s.137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) which relates to criminal proceedings there is a discretion to exclude evidence if the probative value is outweighed by the danger of "unfair prejudice" to the defendant. It may be that in certain extreme circumstances evidence of complaint should be excluded under this section but no such question arises in this case.

The expressions "unfairly prejudicial" and "unfair prejudice" must in my view have the same meaning in all three sections even though they operate in different areas namely civil and criminal law and the exclusion of evidence as opposed to the use to which evidence may be put.

In my view evidence may be unfairly prejudicial to a party if there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way.

Evidence of contemporaneous or near contemporaneous complaint would not ordinarily satisfy the requirements of [s.136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) but whether it does or does not is a question which must be determined in each case depending upon the individual circumstances. In my view, in the circumstances of this case there was no requirement to limit the use to which the evidence of complaint could be put. In my view the giving of evidence of complaint is not of itself, in the ordinary course, sufficient to justify the conclusion that there is a danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused.

The admission of evidence of complaint whether or not there had been a limitation imposed under [s.136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) may attract the application of [s.165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) which applies to hearsay evidence. That section provides, so far as is relevant: "(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it." 
In the ordinary course if requested to do so a trial judge should give an appropriate warning satisfying [s.165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) in relation to complaint evidence. There was no such request in this case.

I agree with the conclusions of Hunt CJ at CL in this aspect of the appeal. I also agree with the observations by his Honour as to the artificiality of admitting evidence pursuant to [s.66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) and then limiting its use to the question of the credit of the complainant to avoid the operation of [s.102](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) which excludes the admissibility of evidence relating only to credit.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.
 [1] The complainant is under eighteen years of age. The appellant is her uncle. The [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/), by <case>, prohibits the publication of any report of the proceedings which leads to the identification of any child to whom the proceedings relate or who is mentioned or otherwise involved in those proceedings. As the judgments of this Court are now published on the Internet, without editing, it is necessary to use pseudonyms so as to ensure that there will be no breach of <case>.
 [2] I have used the word "complaint" in its technical sense, meaning any prior statement consistent with the complainant's evidence that she had been sexual assaulted by the appellant, rather than in the more restricted ordinary sense of a statement of a grievance.
