FADY HOUDA versus STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES /98 November 1998 
David Kirby J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application under [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the [Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/) in which the plaintiff seeks an order granting him leave to commence proceedings against the State of New South Wales as the defendant. 
The plaintiff is a young man born on 2 January 1971. He was convicted of armed robbery, which is a felony, and therefore requires the leave of the court before he can commence proceedings.

He has been incarcerated for a number of years. In March of 1995 he underwent a test for, amongst other things, HIV, and was found to be negative.

Thereafter, one gathers at the Goulburn Gaol, he was involved in a fight with an inmate. In the course of the fight he struck the inmate in the mouth. There was blood. He at the time suffered a gash which has left a scar which is still evident on examination.

On 18 September 1996 he was again tested for infection, this time because there was thought to be the possibility of tuberculosis. The test, however, revealed that he was HIV positive.

An affidavit has been provided which includes a report from Associate
Professor Andrew Lloyd of the Prince Henry Hospital. He believes that the fight was the most likely occasion upon which Mr Houda became infected, since the person with whom he had the fight was a person who, at that time, was infected, and who, indeed, has since died as a result of HIV infection.

Mr Singh, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff, tells me that the circumstances in which the fight occurred arose out of a system which was then in operation at the Goulburn gaol. That system broadly, involved the following. Where a certain number of prisoners were having a shower a prison warder would remain with them to ensure that nothing untoward occurred, and no-one was in danger. However, because staff was short, when there were only a few prisoners showering, no guard would be provided. Rather the shower block would be locked, and the prisoners within that block left unsupervised.

The person whom Mr Houda fought in late 1995 was a person who had been convicted of a number of offences of rape, and who apparently was said to have a reputation for violence and rape within the gaol itself.

It will be the plaintiff's contention, were he permitted to commence this action, that the system of locking prisoners into the shower block, more especially with persons who have such a reputation, and history of violence and rape, was unsafe, and exposed Mr Houda to the very sort of risk as that which eventuated.

Secondly, it would be alleged that the shower block, itself, was not properly designed or constructed, so as to permit supervision even when a guard was not present, or that its design did not permit adequate protection to those who were within it.

Mr Singh acknowledges that the latter contention may involve difficulties. In such a matter he would be obliged to demonstrate that the particular default was, by its nature, operational rather than a planning matter. However, in terms of the test which I am obliged to apply under [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s5.html) of the [Felons (Civil Proceedings)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/), I am satisfied that the proceedings are not an abuse of process, and that there are prima facie grounds for the proceedings.

I therefore make an order that leave be granted to commence proceedings pursuant to [s4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the [Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/). I further order that a Statement of Claim be filed within 28 days, and that the costs of this application be costs in the cause.
