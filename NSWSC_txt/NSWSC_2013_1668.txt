JUDGMENT
I gave judgment in this matter on 17th October 2013 (Insurance Australia Limited t/as NRMA Insurance versus Banos <case> The effect of the orders I made on that occasion was to set aside a decision of the second defendant, a claims assessor of the Motor Accidents Claims Assessment and Resolution Service declining to grant a discretionary exemption on the application of the plaintiff insurer pursuant to s. 92(1)(b) [Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) (the Compensation Act), and to remit the matter to the Principal Claims Assessor to make arrangements for a different assessor to determine the question according to law. The first defendant, who I will refer to as the claimant, was ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of, and incidental, to the proceedings on the ordinary basis after they have been agreed or assessed.
The claimant makes an application for a certificate under the [Suitors Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) (the Act), s6(1). That section provides, relevantly, the following: 
If an appeal against the decision of a court: to the Supreme Court on a question of law or fact ...
 ...succeeds, the Supreme Court may, on application, grant to the respondent to the appeal or to any one or more of several respondents to the appeal an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal.
Two questions arise for determination. The first is whether the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service is "a court" for the purposes of the Act. The second is whether a successful claim for judicial review of an assessment made under that regime is "an appeal" for the purpose of the Act.
With respect to the first question, at first blush I confess to having had some doubt about the proposition that the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service, or a claims assessor operating under that regime, could constitute "a court" in the sense envisaged by the Act. However MA Campbell of counsel, who appeared for the claimant, in her written submissions directed the Court's attention to several decisions dealing with the question of applications under <case> of the Act in the context of judicial review of decisions of claims assessors. In Allianz versus Ward <case> at <case> Hidden J held that a claims assessor exercising jurisdiction under the Compensation Act constitutes a "court" for the purposes of <case> of the Act. In support of this proposition his Honour cited Australian Postal Commission versus Dao (No 2) [(1986) 6 NSWLR 497]; NSWLR 372 at 394 [108] pointed out that an administrative tribunal may be a court for one purpose even if not for another. By reference to DAO his Honour said: 
Thus, a number of State tribunals have been held to be "courts" for the purposes of the [Suitors' Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) [citations omitted].
Consistently with this approach, several decisions of this Court have held the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal to be a court for the purposes of the Act: Krslovic Homes versus Sparkes <case>; Rural and General Insurance versus Fair Trading Tribunal  <case>; Burringbar Real Estate Centre Pty Ltd versus Ryder  <case>
The present case, as I have said, was concerned with an application for a discretionary exemption from an assessment of damages by the claims assessor, but it is relevant to point out that in assessing damages payable for a claim, as the words in parentheses in s94(1)(b) of the Compensation Act make clear, the claims assessor is required to determine the amount a court would be likely to award by applying the common law of damages as modified by the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Compensation Act (see also ss122 and 123). And, if the conditions specified in s95(2) are satisfied, such an assessment provides a final resolution of the dispute as to damages. These considerations favour treating the Claims Assessment and Resolution Service as a court for the purpose of the Act.
This finality point is heavily qualified. The claimant can reject the assessment and apply for a hearing de novo in the District Court. That qualified finality might be a strong pointer to CARS not being a court for this purpose.
Notwithstanding my initial doubts about it, as I find the reasoning in the decisions of other Judges of the Common Law Division referred to at [4] persuasive, and also for reasons of judicial comity, I propose to take the same approach.
Turning now to the second question arising for consideration, I consider the following observations of McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) in Dao (No 2) from the passage referred to above to be apposite: 
Remedial legislation should be given a beneficial construction. In accord with that philosophy, the Supreme Court has given a liberal construction to the word "appeal" in the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/). Thus an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law in a court of petty sessions is an "appeal" for the purpose of the Act: Ex parte Parsons;
Re [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) [(1952) WN 380.] So is a case stated by a court of Quarter Sessions to the Court of Criminal Appeal on a question of law arising out of a conviction in a court of petty sessions (Ex parte Neville; Re Suitors' Fund Act -1960 (1966) 85 WN (Pt 1) 372) or a case stated by an arbitrator to the Supreme Court: Mir Bros Developments Pty Ltd versus Atlantic Constructions Pty
Ltd [(1985) 1 NSWLR 491.] Even a reference from the Prothonotary, exercising delegated jurisdiction, to a judge in chambers is an "appeal" for the purpose of the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/): Onions v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales [(1956) 73 WN .] The word "court" should likewise be given a liberal and beneficial construction to accord with the purpose and policy of the Act. The correct approach is for the Court to ask itself whether, bearing in mind the general purpose of the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/),
Parliament must be taken to have intended that the Tribunal should qualify as a court? I think that that question should be answered in the affirmative.
Whether the Tribunal is a "court" for purposes other than the Act is beside the point. What matters for the purpose of the [Suitors' Fund
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) is that a body which determines rights and is presided over by a judge of the District
Court has made an error of law which has been corrected on appeal to the
Supreme Court of New South Wales. To grant a certificate, at the request of the respondents, is to promote the purpose of the Act. To hold that the
Tribunal is a "court" for the purpose of the Act contradicts no express or implied provision of the Act. The Court should, therefore, declare that the respondents are entitled to a certificate under the Act.
By parity of reasoning, I consider that a beneficial construction of the Act favours the interpretation that the present proceedings are an appeal, as contended by the claimant. It is notable, as his Honour pointed out, that an application for a writ of prohibition to correct an error of law was regarded as an appeal in Ex parte Parsons; Re [Suitors' Fund Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/)  <case>: 
The function of an order in the nature of certiorari is to remove the legal consequences or purported legal consequences of an exercise or purported exercise of power.
These considerations in my view make the conclusion I have reached on this second question irresistible. In my judgment the present case is directly covered by what McHugh JA said in Dao (No 2). 
For these reasons, I amend the orders pronounced on 17th October 2013 to add the following order: 
I grant the first defendant a certificate under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/s6.html) of the [Suitors' Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) .
