BARRETT J  
THURSDAY, 13 OCTOBER 2005  /04 AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION versus ELM FINANCIAL SERVICES PTY LTD & 11 ORS  
JUDGMENT  On 11 October 2005, I made, by consent of the plaintiff (Australian
Securities and Investments Commission) and the defendants concerned, declarations of contravention and consequential orders against the ninth and twelfth defendants in these proceedings: Australian Securities and
Investments Commission versus Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd & Ors  <case> I am now asked by ASIC and the eleventh defendant (Robert John Kay) to make consent declarations and consequential orders in respect of that defendant.  ASIC and Mr Kay have tendered a statement of agreed facts (Exhibit K1). I have adopted the course outlined in my earlier judgment with a view to deciding whether, on the basis of the agreed facts, the court is satisfied that the statutory conditions for the making of declarations of contravention have been met.  The agreed facts establish that Mr Kay was, at material times, an "officer" of Elm Financial Services Pty Limited and a director of Elm Nominees Pty
Limited, Elm Management Pty Limited and Fletcher Securities Pty Limited. They also show that each of those companies contravened provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). In the case of Elm Financial Services and Elm Nominees together, there was one contravention of [s.727(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html), one contravention of [s.601ED(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ed.html) and (together with another company) one contravention of each of [ss.1041E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041e.html), [1041F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041f.html)(1)(a) and [1041H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041h.html)(1).
In the case of Elm Financial Services and Fletcher Securities together, there was one contravention of [s.727(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html)
Elm Financial Services alone committed one contravention of [s.601ED(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ed.html) and one contravention of [s.912A(1)(f).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s912a.html)  The agreed facts also show that Mr Kay, as a director or other officer, failed in every such case to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention and thereby himself contravened [ss.180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) and [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html)(1).
Mr Kay is thus seen to have failed in the proper discharge of the duties owed by him as a director or other officer and, in that way, to have contributed to situations in which persons invited to invest money were denied basic protections and safeguards that the law demands they be afforded.  The agreed facts cause the court to be satisfied that the statutory conditions for the making of the declarations of contravention of [ss.180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) and [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html)(1) by Mr Kay have been satisfied.  ASIC and Mr Kay have agreed a period of disqualification for Mr Kay (namely, five years), with the disqualification being imposed through orders under [ss.206C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206c.html), [206D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206d.html)(1) and [206E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206e.html)(1) so that [s.206A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206a.html) operates to impose criminal sanctions if prescribed activities are engaged in during the period of disqualification. The court is also invited to note and accept an undertaking by Mr Kay to comply with the terms of an undertaking given by him to ASIC under s.93AA of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act (a copy of that s.93AA undertaking being Exhibit
K2).  I need not repeat here what was said at paragraphs [9] and [10] of the earlier judgment about the function of the court in such cases. It is sufficient that I record the conclusion of the court that disqualification for five years is an appropriate sanction in the context of the contraventions established on the basis of the agreed facts.  In relation to Robert John Kay (the eleventh defendant), the court makes by consent the declarations and orders set out in the Schedule to these reasons and notes and accepts the undertaking set out in that Schedule. In addition, I direct that Exhibit K1 and Exhibit K2 be retained as part of the record of these proceedings.
