The Bathers Pavilion at Balmoral Beach stands on land owned by the Council and leased to the Second Respondent for use as a restaurant. Upon the introduction of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) the land became "community land". As such the Council was required to prepare a plan of management: [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s31.html) 
The current Plan of Management was adopted by the Council on 11 February 1997, declaring the council's intention to enter into contractual and leasing arrangements for the restoration and use of the Pavilion "for the purpose of public refreshment rooms and associated facilities". On 27 February 1997 the second respondent applied for development consent "for the conservation and adaptive reuse" of the Pavilion. On 29 April 1997 the Council approved the development application subject to conditions and offered the second respondent a 21 year lease.

The appellants challenged the validity of the Plan of Management and the development consent and sought to restrain the proposed lease through proceedings commenced in the Land and Environment Court. Cowdroy AJ held that the use of the land satisfied the requirements of the Plan and further that the Plan complied with [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s35.html) and [36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s36.html) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/). He dismissed the application.

Held dismissing the appeal: 
The authority of a council to grant a lease of community land empowers it to restrict the public right of access to it.

ORDER 
Appeal dismissed with costs 
SEATON & Ors versus MOSMAN MUNICIPAL COUNCIL and 
THE BATHERS PAVILION PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: The appellants object to the proposed development and lease of the Bathers Pavilion at Balmoral Beach. They seek to restrain the second respondent, the Bathers Pavilion Pty Ltd, from developing this site and taking a 21 year Lease from the first respondent, the Mosman Municipal Council. It is contended that aspects of the development are not in accordance with the current plan of management for the site, and that the proposed use is prohibited under the Mosman Local Environment Plan. 
BACKGROUND 
The Bathers Pavilion stands on land owned by the Council, being Lot 3,
Deposited Plan 831359. That lot is approximately 2042 square metres in area.
The Pavilion was built by Mosman Council in 1928 as changing sheds for beachgoers. It is subject to a permanent conservation order.

By 1967, the Pavilion's use by the public as changing facilities had declined and the Council called for tenders for alternative uses of the building. The chosen use was a restaurant, initially known as "Mischa's" and, since 1988 known as "The Bathers Pavilion". The premises are currently subject to a 20 year lease to the second respondent terminating on 30 June 1999.

Under the Mosman Local Environmental Plan No 1, Balmoral beach and its environs is zoned 6(a) Existing Recreation. Upon the introduction of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) ("the [1993 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/)") the subject land became "community land". As such the Council was required to prepare a plan of management: [s31(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s31.html)
The original plan of management was adopted on 4 April 1995. It was challenged in the Land and Environment Court in Seaton versus Mosman Council & Anor.
The Council conceded its invalidity and a declaration to that effect was made by Stein J on 28 March 1996.

A second plan of management was adopted by the Council on 29 August 1995. It survived challenge before Stein J, but was set aside by the Court of Appeal in : see Seaton versus Mosman Municipal Council & Anor [(1996) 93 LGERA .] 
On 11 February 1997 Council adopted the current plan of management ("the
Plan"). It is this plan that is challenged in the current proceedings. I shall return to its detail. For the moment it is sufficient to observe that the
Council declared its intention to enter into contractual and leasing arrangements for the restoration, rebuilding and use of the Pavilion "for the purpose of public refreshment rooms and associated facilities".

On 27 February 1997 the second respondent applied for development consent "for the conservation and adaptive reuse" of the Pavilion, including consent for different categories of dining areas capable of seating up to 250 people in total. On 29 April 1997 the Council approved the development application subject to conditions. The Council also resolved to offer the second respondent a 21 year lease, subject to the consent of the Minister. Such consent was required under [s47(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s47.html) of the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) in the light of objections to the proposal which had been received. The development was and remains controversial. The second respondent was formally notified of approval on 30 April 1997.

Proceedings challenging the validity of the Plan and the development consent and seeking to restrain the proposed lease were commenced on 9 May 1997, initially by the first appellant alone. At some stage the second and third appellants Mosman Parks and Bushland Association Inc and Balmoral Pavilion for the People Association Inc were joined as applicants. Cowdroy AJ dismissed the application on 26 September 1997.

In this appeal the second respondent has adopted a submitting stance.

LEASING COMMUNITY LAND: THE FUNCTION OF A PLAN OF MANAGEMENT 
The [1993 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) relevantly provides: Preparation of draft plans of management for community land 
A council must prepare a draft plan of management for community land.
 ....

A plan of management for community land must identify the following: the category of the land, the objectives and performance targets of the plan with respect to the land, the means by which the council proposes to achieve the plan's objectives and performance targets, the manner in which the council proposes to assess its performance with respect to the plan's objectives and performance targets, and may require the prior approval of the council to the carrying out of any specified activity on the land.

For the purposes of this section, land is to be categorised as one or more of the following: a natural area , a sportsground, a park, general community use.

Land that is categorised as a natural area is to be further categorised as one or more of the following: bushland, wetland, escarpment, watercourse, foreshore, a category prescribed by the regulations.
 What dealings can a council have in community land? 
A council may grant a lease or licence of community land, but only in accordance with [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s46.html) and (if relevant) [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s47.html) Leases and licences of community land-generally 
A council may grant a lease or licence of community land if: the grant of such a lease or licence is expressly authorised by a plan of management for the community land , and it does so in accordance with such provisions of the plan of management as apply to the granting of the lease or licence.

An authorisation in a plan of management for the granting of a lease or licence may be limited to the granting of a lease or licence for a public purpose or by reference to other matters.

A council must not grant a lease or licence for a period (including any period for which the lease or licence could be renewed by the exercise of an option) exceeding 21 years.

A council must not grant a lease or licence for a period (including any period for which the lease or licence could be renewed by the exercise of an option) exceeding 5 years unless it has also complied with [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s47.html) Leases and licences of community land for more than 5 years-additional requirements 
If a council proposes to grant a lease or licence of community land for a period (including any period for which the lease or licence could be renewed by the exercise of an option) exceeding 5 years, it must: give public notice of the proposal, and exhibit notice of the proposal on the land to which the proposal relates, and give notice of the proposal to such persons as appear to it to own or occupy the land adjoining the community land .

A notice of the proposal must include: [Details not reproduced] 
Any person may make a submission in writing to the council during the period specified for the purpose in the notice .

Before granting the lease or licence, the council must consider all submissions duly made to it.

If a person makes a submission by way of objection to the proposal, the council must not grant the lease or licence except with the Minister's consent.

If the council applies for the Minister's consent, it must forward with its application: [Details not reproduced] 
On receipt of the application, the Minister must request the Director of
Planning to furnish a report concerning the application within such period as the Minister specifies.

After considering the application and any report of the Director of
Planning, the Minister, if satisfied that subsections (1), (2) and (6) have been complied with, may consent to the granting of a lease or licence of the whole or part of the land to which the application relates subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister specifies.

The Minister's consent is conclusive evidence that the council has complied with subsections (1), (2) and (6).

In Friends of Pryor Park Inc versus Ryde City Council [(1996) 91 LGERA ]
the Court of Appeal discussed Chapter 6, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) [(ss25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s25.html)-[54](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s54.html)).
The Court rejected the argument that it was beyond the power of a council to grant a lease over all or part of community land. The legislative scheme was found to have displaced the earlier law represented by Randwick Municipal
Council versus Rutledge <case>; [(1959) 102 CLR 54]; Storey versus North Sydney Municipal Council <case>; [(1970) 123 CLR 574] and Waverley Municipal Council versus Attorney General [(1979) 40 LGRA 419.] These cases stood for the proposition that land used for public recreation and enjoyment must be open to the public generally as of right. In the lastmentioned case, Hope JA had said (at 428) that: "except in so far as the statute otherwise provides, the Council has no power to erect upon the park any buildings which are not for the purpose of the use of the land as a public park or for public recreation." 
Following this case, the Local Government Act 1919 was amended so as to permit the alienation of public reserves, subject to procedures for public notice, public objections and ministerial approval. Friends of Pryor Park held that the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) carried forward such a legislative scheme. Subject to compliance with its provisions, [ss36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s36.html) and [46](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s46.html) in particular, a council was held authorised to grant a lease of community land.
Such a transaction is necessarily capable of restricting the public right of access which had been previously stipulated as unfettered by the trilogy of cases to which reference has been made.

In the context of the present controversy, it is pertinent to note that in
Friends of Pryor Park Gleeson CJ (with whose reasons Mahoney P and
Meagher JA agreed) said (at 314): "We are not concerned with whether it was wise of the New South Wales
Parliament to enact a law giving councils such power, or whether it would be wise of the Ryde Council to use the power in the intended manner. Those are political, not legal, questions. The grant of a lease or licence over a public reserve, in a manner which excludes the general public, will often raise sensitive social and political issues. However, the legislation clearly contemplates that such a grant may be made, and the form of accountability which it provides is primarily political. Provided they are acting within the law, and in conformity with their legal obligations, it is for elected councillors, not judges, to make decisions about the use and management of community land, including public reserves." 
THE CHALLENGED ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT 
The appellants submit that the Plan does not authorise the following features of the development consent and proposed Lease: the lessee's right to exclude individual members of the public from the dining and bar areas of the proposed development; the contemplated access to the restaurants of diners who are not members of the Mosman "community"; and the use of portion of the upper level of the Pavilion as "offices" that are not ancillary to the other authorised uses.

It is necessary to consider whether these challenged features are in fact part of the development consent and proposed Lease, before considering whether the
Plan authorises them.

Will the lessee be entitled to exclude members of the public from the dining areas? 
In one sense (i) is common ground. Both active parties in the appeal agree that the Lease will confer upon the second respondent a right of exclusive possession, subject to its terms. That is the nature of a lease: Radaich v
Smith <case>; [(1959) 101 CLR 209] esp at 222. However, the appellants seek to advance an alternative contention which is said to be compatible with the propositions just established. It is argued that the particular development consent and proposed Lease are unauthorised by the Plan insofar as they do not stipulate that individual members of the public have the right to enter all dining and bar areas when open for business, subject to certain implied conditions concerning dress, behaviour and available space.

Formal notice of the conditional approval of the development application was given to the second respondent on 30 April 1997. Relevantly it stated that: the development application has been determined by granting of consent for:- 
Conservation and adaptive re-use of The Bathers' Pavilion; 
Including The Restaurant for a-la-carte dining, The Refreshment Room/The
Verandah for cafe/casual refreshments and all day meals, The Room With A View for private dining and meetings (total capacity of dining areas 250 seats), office and training areas, external screens for service areas; and 
New change rooms and toilets for the public subject to the conditions specified in this notice.

The conditions of the consent and the reasons therefor are:-
The development is to be carried out in accordance with the submitted plans, reference Nos.., prepared by Alex Popov Architects, excepting any variations required by conditions of this consent.
..
The hours of operation of the premises including the various dining areas and ancillary offices, etc, shall be limited to between 7am and to midnight, daily.
The maximum number of patrons to be seated in the building at any one time is 250 persons. This is on the following basis:- - The Restaurant (including the bar area) and the Room With A View - maximum combined seating, 152 persons; - The Verandah and Refreshment Room - maximum combined seating, 98 persons.
The areas known as The Verandah and the Refreshment Room are to be operated as a `cafe' as detailed in the information accompanying the application and in a manner which does not require prior reservation of tables, does not require food to be purchased and does not impose dress regulations.
The gallery area and access thereto is to be accessible to the general public during the approved operating hours, with no requirement for visitors to be a restaurant or cafe patron. Details to Council's satisfaction are then to be submitted with the Building Application, indicating the manner in which the gallery will assist in the interpretation of the heritage significance of the building and its surrounds....

On 5 September 1997 the second respondent, a guarantor of its liabilities, and the Council entered into a deed. The deed regulates the mutual obligations of the parties with respect to building work which has yet to take place. Subject to its terms, the deed commits the Council to grant to the second respondent a year lease commencing on 1 January 1999. It has not been suggested that the
Minister's consent has not been obtained.

The Lease is an annexure to the deed. It describes the property leased as being part of Lot 3, being the building erected at 4 The Esplanade, Balmoral known as The Balmoral
Bathers' Pavilion but excluding that part of the ground floor used as public toilets, showers and change rooms.

By clause 8.01 of the Lease the Lessee covenants not to use the premises otherwise than for the purposes stated below or as provided in the Lease. The purposes stated were: refreshment rooms and associated facilities and any purpose permitted for the
Premises under Plan of Management for Balmoral Bathers Pavilion and its
Surrounds adopted by the Lessor on 11 February 1997.

Many clauses are standard for a long term lease of commercial premises.
However, the Lessee is required to permit "the general public" to enter stipulated areas of the premises: see clauses 8.02(c), 9.01(a). These are the
Gallery on the first floor and the public toilets, showers and change rooms on the ground floor. The Lease also restricts the Lessee in relation to hours of opening (cl 8.05(h)) and numbers of paying patrons (250 persons: see cl .05(k)).

These clauses operate by way of covenant to restrict the Lessee as to the manner in which it can enjoy the right of exclusive possession granted by the
Lease. Nevertheless, the exceptional provisions touching public access to the
Gallery and the ground floor public toilets only reinforce the general right, conferred as an incident of the Lease itself, of the lessee to exclude particular members of the public. See also condition 6 of the development consent (supra). A restauranteur has that right, whether based on the behaviour or dress of the particular patron or the personal predilection of the restauranteur. Statutory inroads such as anti-discrimination laws may be put to one side: cf Borenstein versus Lynch [(1994) EOC |P92-597.] It follows that the appellants are correct in their submission that the Lease does not afford a right of entry into the main restaurant areas by the public in the sense discussed in the trilogy of cases starting with Rutledge.

Will the facilities be available to persons who are not members of the "local community"? 
A curious submission of the appellants was that the commercial and private areas of the Pavilion will not have a substantial connection with the local community. Complaint is made that the lessee will be entitled under the Lease to allow "the people of Sydney and beyond" to patronise the Pavilion. The nub of the complaint is not, I think, a peculiar form of Mosmanite xenophobia.
Rather, it is the concern of the appellants that the Pavilion will attract undue numbers of cars and buses to Balmoral Beach. The submission, which sits uneasily with the argument that "the public" was intended by the Plan to have access as of right to the main portions of the Pavilion, is a springboard for the contention that such use is antithetical to the "general community use" categorisation in the Plan.

It is clear that the lessee will be free to allow the Pavilion to be patronised by "the people of Sydney and beyond". Nothing in the development consent or the Lease precludes this. To the extent that the enhancement of the
Bathers Pavilion will attract Sydneysiders and tourists generally, that is an intended by-product of the consent and proposed Lease. That is the way in which the residents of Mosman have chosen, through their elected representatives, to defray the considerable cost of improving this facility without adding to the ratepayers' burden.

The "offices" on the first floor 
The approved Popov plans show three "offices" located in the western corner of the upper level of the refurbished Pavilion. The appellants submit that the development consent permits the second respondent to use these offices for purposes unconnected with the management of the enterprise. It was suggested that the second respondent could use the offices to allow outside organisations to conduct training seminars along the lines of a mini conference centre. Such use is not foreshadowed in the Plan.

However, nothing in the development consent or the proposed Lease gives any support to this contention. It is obvious that an enterprise involving several categories of dining facilities capable of sitting up to 250 guests, and the conduct of the Gallery, will require management facilities as well as space for training and administering the staff working in the premises. The development consent (incorporated into the Lease: cl 11.07) refers to "office and training areas", but not in any way that approves use in the manner feared by the appellants. Condition 3 (supra) refers to "various dining areas and auxiliary offices" (emphasis added). See also the document accompanying the development application (AB 171). Clause 8.01 of the Lease has already been mentioned. It restricts the Lessee's use of the premises by prohibiting use otherwise than for the purposes stated in Item 5 of the Reference Schedule or as provided in the Lease. The Lease itself is silent on the present matter, but Item 5 speaks of "refreshment rooms and associated facilities and any purpose permitted for the Premises under the Plan of Management" (emphasis added).

THE PLAN OF MANAGEMENT AND WHAT IT AUTHORISES 
The Plan of Management, Bathers Pavilion Balmoral and its Surrounds was adopted by the Council on 11 February 1997. It applies to the whole of Lot 3 in DP 831359.

The Plan describes the Pavilion and briefly recounts its history. The need to conserve the exterior of the building is noted: 
However, the poor condition of the interior of the building together with the original layout or design mean that the repair and restoration of the interior cannot be made compatible with the economic use of the building necessary to support and justify its survival.

It has therefore been concluded, after careful consideration of a detailed conservation study of the building, that its survival is dependent upon a commercially viable adaptive re-use of substantially the whole of the interior.

The Plan then addresses the matters stipulated in [s36(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s36.html) of the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/). So far as relevant, it states: 
Categorisation 
The land is categorised by this Plan of Management as `general community use' and `park'. So far as the building itself is concerned, `general community use' is considered to be the only appropriate categorisation available under [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s36.html) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) and that category is therefore applied to the building. The rest of the land, comprising the area between the building and The Esplanade, is proposed to be made available for public recreation as part of Balmoral Reserve and is therefore appropriately categorised as `park'.

Objectives Of This Plan With Respect To the Land 
The objectives of this Plan are:
To ensure the conservation of The Bathers' Pavilion so that it can continue to serve the public and contribute to the character and amenity of
Balmoral Reserve.
To provide for the adaptive and economic re-use of The Bathers' Pavilion for such purposes and in such a manner as to ensure that the building will be conserved and thereafter properly maintained.
To minimise the financial burden to the ratepayers of Mosman of the conservation, maintenance and adaptive re-use of The Bathers' Pavilion.
To improve and enhance the area of land between The Bathers' Pavilion and
The Esplanade and make that area available for public recreation.

Performance Targets Of This Plan With Respect To The Land 
The performance targets of this Plan are:
To carry out the conservation of The Bathers' Pavilion by restoring and rebuilding it in accordance with the plans prepared by Alexander Popov,
Architect numbered [Several plans were identified] (and/or any additions or amendments thereto which Council considers necessary and appropriate), and in so doing, to perform the work listed hereunder.
 [The building work was described]
To establish a suitable ongoing preventative maintenance program for The
Bathers' Pavilion when it has been conserved.
To landscape the area between The Bathers' Pavilion and The Esplanade so as to make it available to the public for passive recreation.
To rebuild and adapt the interior of the building so as to enable its re- use for the purpose of public refreshment rooms and associated facilities as well as public change rooms and toilets.

Means Of Achieving The Objectives And Performance Targets Of This Plan 
Council proposes to achieve the objectives and performance targets of the
Plan by:
Entering into contractual (including leasing) arrangements for the restoration, rebuilding and use of The Bathers' Pavilion (except for that part to be used as public toilets, showers and change rooms) for the purpose of public refreshment rooms and associated facilities (including occasional use for functions) which will - ...
 ensure that members of the public will have access to the building or appropriate parts thereof in a manner which facilitate their enjoyment of
Balmoral Beach and its environs and, in particular, by providing refreshment room facilities for their use and enjoyment as well as public toilets, showers and change rooms.
 i) permit Council to carry out work for the conservation and adaptive re- use of the building; ii) .... vii) ensure that members of the public resorting to Balmoral will have available to them a range of refreshment room facilities at different and affordable pricing levels including cafe/coffee shop style facilities, casual dining and a la carte restaurant service and seating a maximum of 250 persons at any one time.
Ensuring as far as is practicably possible that the contractual arrangements referred to in 1 exclude therefrom the area of land between The
Bathers' Pavilion and The Esplanade so that that area can be used for passive recreation and further exclude that part of the ground floor of the building to be used for the purposes of public toilets, showers and change rooms.
Regenerating and making available the area between The Bathers' Pavilion and The Esplanade for public recreation by the carrying out of the following works of demolition and landscaping.

Construct walls and entry stair leading from The Esplanade; 
Provide landscaping and paving generally in accordance with The Forecourt
Landscape Plan Dwg Nos 9514/03 and 9514/04 prepared by Robert A Moore Pty
Limited and Barbara van den Broek, Landscape Architect held by Council in the office of the Director of Executive Services.
Enable the use of the interior of the building for the purpose of refreshment rooms and associated facilities (including occasional use for functions) as well as public toilets, showers and change rooms by installation of internal walls, fittings and decorations necessary to provide kitchens, restaurants and cafe areas, and administration, access and service areas.

The grant of lease for a term not exceeding 21 years of so much of the land the subject of this plan as comprises the Bathers' Pavilion (but excluding therefrom that part of the ground floor of the building to be used as public toilets, showers and change rooms) and its surrounds which gives effect to, permits and/or makes provision for all or any of the foregoing matters is hereby expressly authorised.

The Manner In Which Council Proposes To Assess Its Performance With Respect
To The Plan's Objectives And Performance Targets
Council will consider whether and how promptly the contractual arrangement and any proposed lease are negotiated and executed.
....
Following completion of the conservation of The Bathers' Pavilion and the commencement of its use for the purpose of refreshment rooms, Council will monitor the use by members of the public of the facilities provided including the conducting of surveys of users of the facilities. Council will also see and consider comments of local residents and other users of Balmoral Reserve to ascertain the level of public acceptance of the building as conserved and the facilities provided therein.

A plan of management does not affect the zoning of community land in the sense of prescribing permissible uses: Friends of Pryor Park at 315. But (subject to zoning) it may authorise the use , leasing and licensing of such land despite its designation as community land - subject to the validity of the plan itself and compliance with [ss45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s45.html)-[47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s47.html) with respect to leases and licences. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s46.html) requires that any lease or licence of community land must be expressly authorised in the plan and that the council must act in accordance with such provisions of the plan as apply to the granting of the lease or licence.

It thus becomes vital to examine what this Plan purports to authorise. The appellants are entitled to complain if that which passed through the fire of public consultation and controversy does not authorise what the Council has approved in its development consent and deed and what it proposes in the
Lease.

THE APPELLANTS' SUBMISSIONS CONCERNING THE PLAN 
There is no suggestion that the procedures set out in [ss38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s38.html)-[44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s44.html) of the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) were departed from in the preparation of the Plan. Nor does the Plan suffer from the formal defects that led to the invalidity of its predecessor. However, the appellants contend that (a) the Plan does not authorise the uses to which the
Pavilion is now proposed to be put and (b) the Plan is invalid in that it is internally inconsistent because the uses authorised by the Plan are "manifestly inconsistent" with the "general community use" and "park" categorisations which it adopts.

The challenge to the scope of the Plan 
The respondents' argument is that the Plan contemplates a 21 year lease to the second respondent pursuant to which it will be entitled to use the Pavilion for various categories of cafes and restaurants, and ancillary purposes. Such use will include the right of the tenant to enjoy its exclusive possession of the Pavilion subject to the conditions of the development approval and the covenants of the proposed Lease.

Cowdroy AJ was correct in accepting these submissions.

From the Council's perspective, the "objectives" of the Plan involved the conservation of the Pavilion and its environs, the enhancement of its functioning, and savings to ratepayers. From the developer's perspective, the
Plan offered the opportunity of profit as the incentive for "adaptive and economic re-use" of the Pavilion. These objectives are disclosed in the Plan.

The "performance targets" identified in the Plan could not be clearer in their express terms. Relevant to the present dispute, they include the "restoring and rebuilding" of the Pavilion in accordance with identified plans proposed by Mr Popov, architect; and landscaping the area between the Pavilion and The
Esplanade. The verbal description of building work in para 1 of the "performance targets" is to be read with the plans. These make it pellucidly clear that the construction work will produce a rebuilt Pavilion that has the following features: The internal configuration of the existing two story building will be effectively reconstructed. The ground floor will include a restaurant with accompanying bar and a "refreshment room". Each will have associated kitchens, storerooms and toilets. The first floor will consist of the "Room with a View" which will have accompanying kitchen and toilet facilities, a historical gallery and three adjoining offices. There will be internal stairs and a lift for access to the first floor for persons with disabilities. "Public amenities" in the form of toilets and showers accessible directly by bathers are to be constructed on the western corner. The existing external walls are to be completely refurbished and provided with new windows and doors.

The landscaping work is detailed in the plans which are identified in para 3 of the "Means" section of the Plan. Those plans became Ex B. They show that two "services zones" will be constructed immediately to the east of the front external wall of the Pavilion. Each is to be accessible via a ramp and is to be shielded from passers-by looking at the Pavilion from The Esplanade by a screen wall. Mr Popov's ground floor plan No 058 AA.01D (which is one of the plans cited in para 1 of the performance targets) describes each service zone as a "recycling area". The same plan shows the location of a 1,000 litre grease arrester immediately adjacent to the southern service wall. This would appear to be intended to be located beneath the public pathway that passes the
Pavilion. The use of these facilities for their obvious function of waste disposal will therefore be in accordance with the Plan. The appellants accept that the service access way will be purely incidental to the use of the
Pavilion, but nevertheless they contend that such use would contravene the third of the performance targets disclosed in the Plan (ie "To landscape the area between the Bathers' Pavilion and The Esplanade so as to make it available to the public for passive recreation"). However, this misreads what is proposed, because the first performance target effectively defines "The
Bathers' Pavilion" as the structure to be restored and rebuilt in accordance with the Popov plans, and these plans clearly disclose the location of the waste disposal facilities. The remaining area of "park" will be landscaped and made available for "passive recreation".

Even without para 4 of the stated performance targets, there could be no doubt about the intended function of these building works revealed in the Plan and the documents which it incorporates. But para 4 makes explicit what would otherwise be implicit, because it states as a target of the Plan the rebuilding and adaptation of the interior of the Pavilion: so as to enable its re-use for the purpose of public refreshment rooms and associated facilities as well as public change rooms and toilets.

Turning to the "Means" proposed by the Plan, it is expressly disclosed that these include: leasing arrangements for the restoration, rebuilding and use of The Bathers'
Pavilion (except for that part to be used as public toilets, showers and change rooms) for the purpose of public refreshment rooms and associated facilities (including occasional use for functions).

The concluding portion of the "Means" section confers express authorisation to the grant of a 21 year lease "which gives effect to, permits and/or makes provision for all or any of the foregoing matters".

These features of the Plan combine to destroy the appellants' contention that the Plan does not authorise uses of the Pavilion for "public" and private dining functions for which a well-appointed Sydney restaurant is suited.

Counsel for the appellants submitted that the Plan only contemplates "public refreshment rooms", which he would interpret as meaning dining areas where members of the public may enter as of right, subject to reasonable regulation.
This argument is directed particularly at the "Room With a View" section of the first floor, which is clearly intended for private dining functions.
However, Mr Robertson accepted that the logic of his argument also applies to the a la carte restaurant section. The fact that these facilities will generally be open to all comers willing to pay, subject to bookings, would not satisfy the criterion of access as of right which represents the irreducible minimum in the appellants' argument. According to the submission, that criterion is to be tested by reference to the principles developed in the trilogy of cases starting with Rutledge, to which reference has been made. The concession concerning "reasonable regulation" acknowledges the restauranteur's right to exclude patrons at unsuitable hours (cf conditions 3 and 6 of the development consent) as well as those whose behaviour or dress is inappropriate.

In my view, this Plan is not so restricted. It uses "public refreshment room" and "refreshment room" interchangeably, and envisages that the "public" will resort to the restaurants in the normal manner and subject to the normal conditions of entry to such establishments. More importantly, the Plan serves as its own dictionary in that it authorises a lease for the purpose of "restaurant" facilities. The way in which such facilities are provided in
Australia clearly includes establishments in which the restauranteur's self- interest in making a profit operates as the spur to act reasonably, in the manner of exercising his or her right of exclusive occupancy. The right to exercise control over patrons, for the benefit of all concerned, operates through the private law of real property which determines the incidents of the restauranteur's occupancy. Those incidents entail the right to exclude individual patrons, whether for reasons of "reasonable regulation" or otherwise. Nothing in the Plan excludes such a standard and customary feature of restaurants in this city.

The categorisation of lot 3 as "general community use" and "park" is not incompatible with the restaurant use disclosed in the Plan. Indeed such categorisation does not purport to prescribe uses: Friends of Pryor Park at 315. A modern Sydney restaurant is not to be compared with a nineteenth century gentleman's dining club. The restauranteur who puts up the "Open" sign impliedly invites all and sundry to enter (bringing their credit cards with them), albeit that such invitation may be countermanded when an unwanted guest comes in. Fortunately, there is a vast variety of establishments which, in differing ways, thus provide "public refreshment". A fair reading of the "Means" section of the Plan discloses this intent. It contains reference to "occasional use for functions" (para 1) and "a la carte restaurant service" (para 1(c)(vii)). The context in which the Plan was formulated reinforces this, because the Pavilion destined for "adaptive use" was in fact being used at the time when the Plan was drafted for what was described in argument as a "smart restaurant".

It was obvious to all concerned that the Plan envisages the "adaptive and economic re-use" of the Pavilion in a manner that would "minimise the financial burden to ... ratepayers". Counsel for the appellants accepted that the provision of "fine food" will not in itself preclude "public" use of the restaurants. But that concession, properly made, undermines the essential case being advanced by the appellants in the light of the usual way in which "fine food" is provided through restaurants in this city. To suggest that the expensive work proposed in the Popov plans is intended to produce the equivalent of a swimming pool kiosk or a railway refreshment room is a proposition that I cannot accept.

There is no basis for incorporating into the Plan whatever meaning was attached to the expression "public refreshment room" in the repealed s250 of the Local Government Act 1919, as the appellants contended. That provision had been repealed long before the Plan was formulated. If resort to any external document were called for, the definition of "refreshment room" in the EPA
Model Provisions 1980 would assist the respondents, and not the appellants.
There the term "refreshment room" is defined to mean a restaurant, cafe, tea room, eating house or the like.

The intended use of the Pavilion was fairly described in the Plan.

The challenge to the validity of the Plan 
In Friends of Pryor Park there was an alternative ground of challenge to the proposed leasing of part of Pryor Park for uses that included scouts/guides groups and childcare/preschool organisations. It was submitted that a plan of management may not validly, for the purposes of s46(1), authorise the grant of a lease or licence which has the effect of altering the use of the land from the category designated under s36. Pryor Park had been categorised as a natural area (cf s36(4)(a) and further categorised as bushland and watercourse (cf s36(5)(a) and (d)). The appellant in Friends of Pryor Park argued that such categorisation precluded the Council from granting a lease or licence to use any part of the land otherwise than as bushland or as a watercourse or for a purpose which promoted or was ancillary to such use. This argument was rejected. However, Gleeson CJ adverted to an alternative proposition whereby a chosen categorisation might preclude dealings such as leases that are "manifestly inconsistent". He said (at -6): "I cannot accept the notion that to categorise land as a natural area, and then to categorise it further under s36(5), is to define the use to which the land may be put. It may well be that such a categorisation could produce, in a given case, the practical result that a proposal to authorise the grant of a particular kind of lease or licence is manifestly inconsistent with the categorisation. The possible legal consequences of such an inconsistency will be considered below.

The function of categorisation is related to the system of accountability involved in requiring councils to spell out in detail, and expose to the public, their plans for the use and management of community land. It is s36(3) which requires categorisation, and the context explains the nature of the exercise.

Another feature of the provisions about categorisation, which is related to the question just mentioned, is that the legislation does not spell out any legal consequences of adopting a particular categorisation. Suppose land is categorised as a sportsground. Could a plan of management which categorised the land in that fashion authorise the lease of the whole of the land, for a specified term, for use as a childcare centre? That appears to provide an example of a manifest inconsistency within the Plan of Management. It is easy to think of other examples where the suggested inconsistency may be arguable, but less obvious. To take up the formula used in the appellant's submissions, views may well differ upon what kinds of use are ancillary to a park, or general community use. Discriminating between uses which are ancillary to one of the categories set out in s36 and uses which are not ancillary would frequently be a task that is both difficult and subjective.

I see no warrant for reading down s46 as to produce the result that the power given to the section is controlled by s36 in the manner and to the extent contended for by the appellant.

That is not to say that a manifest inconsistency between the way in which a plan of management categorises community land and the use that will result from a proposed lease or licence would be without legal consequence. The principles relating to judicial review of administrative action may, in an appropriate case, call for a legal remedy.

In the present case, however, there is no such manifest inconsistency. Pryor
Park was categorised as natural area, bushland and watercourse, by a plan of management which acknowledged the presence of the scout hall. To permit the use, for a period, of part of the park, including the scout hall, for a
Montessori preschool, will not have such an effect on the remainder of the park as to destroy the appropriateness of the general categorisation as bushland (as defined in the Dictionary) and watercourse. The park will still satisfy the definition of bushland, and the development will have no effect on the watercourse." (emphasis added) 
The present appellants seek to apply these principles to the development consent and the lease proposed to be effected in compliance with it. Their argument focusses upon each categorisation adopted in the Plan. As regards the "general community use" category adopted for "the building itself", it is argued that the intended use of substantial parts of it for a la carte restaurants is manifestly incompatible because of the lessee's right to exclude particular patrons. And as regards the "park" category adopted for "the rest of the land", it is argued that the service or recycling areas and the grease arrestor disclosed in Ex B are located in the area designated "park", and that such use is manifestly inconsistent with such designation.

It is not easy to apply Gleeson CJ's reasoning about manifest inconsistency to land in the non-specific category of "general community use". After all,
Friends of Pryor Park establishes that a lease is not incompatible with such categorisation, even a lease to a person conducting a Montessori preschool, presumably for profit. A categorisation is not a land use definition: see at 315.

Whatever the connotation of "general community use", I see no inconsistency, let alone manifest inconsistency, in authorising portion of a heritage listed building in a scenic area to be used for categories of dining facilities, including a "smart restaurant" for up to 152 patrons. And I have already explained why the concept of "community" is not confined to the ratepayers of
Mosman whose representatives have chosen this method of defraying the considerable cost of enhancing and preserving a landmark in the area.

As to the waste removal facilities there is an initial issue of construction.
The appellants submit that the Plan describes the area designated "park" so that it represents the whole of lot 3 apart from the existing Pavilion.
This is debatable, but I shall proceed on the assumption that it is correct.
What is clear is that the waste disposal areas described in Ex B occupy a small part of the "park" area, and that they have been designed to screen unsightly but essential activities that must take place outside the external walls of the traditional structure from the gaze of those using the "park" for "passive recreation". The passages in Gleeson CJ's judgment that I have emphasised made it plain that use of part of a "park" will not necessarily destroy the appropriateness of the general categorisation. There is no manifest inconsistency.

THE CHALLENGE BASED ON THE MOSMAN LEP [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s35.html) of the [1993 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) provides that: 
Community land is required to be used and managed in accordance with the following: * the plan of management applying to the land * any law permitting the use of the land for a specified purpose or otherwise regulating the use of the land * this Division.

This provision seems to assume that it will be possible to use community land in accordance with each part of [s35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s35.html) without encountering conflicting mandates. Likewise, the submissions before us seem to have assumed that compliance with the Mosman LEP is a superadded obligation even if a particular "use" of land is authorised and controlled by a plan of management. Since the correctness of this assumption was not explored in argument, it is best that I should refrain from addressing the matter further unless it becomes necessary to do so.

The appellants' argument is that the Mosman LEP effectively prohibits the contemplated and commercial use of the site pursuant to a lease authorising restaurants approved by the Plan. That LEP was first issued in 1982 and it has been amended from time to time. The land use tables depict the subject land as "6. OPEN SPACE (a) Recreation Existing" (shown dark green in the map). Column
V prohibits development for any purpose other than those included Column III or IV. Column IV is irrelevant. Column III states: "Any purpose authorised by
Division 2 or 3 of [Part
XIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p13) of the Local Government Act, 1919; recreation areas".

Schedule 7 clause 4 of the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) relevantly provides: 
Except as provided by this clause, a reference in any instrument to ... a provision of [the Local Government Act 1919] is to be read as a reference to ... that provision of [the [1993
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/)] that, having regard to the reference and the context in which the reference occurs, most nearly corresponds to the ... provision of the [1919 Act].

In the earlier Seaton case, it had been argued that a 1995 development consent permitting use of the Pavilion for restaurant purposes was prohibited by the LEP. Stein J rejected this argument in the following terms: 
A literal construction of cl 4 sends one around in a complete circle - a reference to the Mosman LEP in the old Act is to be read as a reference to the
Mosman LEP. This is plainly absurd and unintended. Rather, the intent of the clause is that a reference to the old Act in a planning instrument is to be read as a reference to the provisions of the new Act which most nearly correspond to the old Act. This is reinforced by [s68(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/).
Accordingly, the reference in the LEP to Divisions 2 (Public Reserves, Parks etc) and 3 (Baths and Bathing) of [Part
XIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/index.html#p13) of the 1919 Act is to be read as a reference to Division 2, Part 2 of Chapter (Use and management of community land) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/).
According to the Note to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) public land intended to be kept for use for the general public should be classified as `community land'. The Note singles out `public park' as that type of land which would ordinarily be classified as community land.

The subject land is `community land' under the LEP. Such land is required to be used and managed in accordance with a Plan of Management [(s35).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s35.html)
Therefore, the proposed use is not prohibited if it is authorised by a valid
Plan of Management made under the Act. I do not understand the parties to dispute this proposition.

On the basis of my construction of the land use Table in the LEP there is no need to address the competing arguments as to whether the Council is providing, controlling and managing public refreshment rooms under s350(c) of the 1919 Act and whether the use was prohibited under the old Act." 
Cowdroy AJ followed this decision in the present case. The appellants submit that he was in error. They contend that the table of permissible uses in the (a) zone (especially when contrasted with 6(b) ("Recreation private")) disclose the essential feature of public access as of right that was found in the trilogy of cases commencing with Rutledge. It follows, so the argument goes, that the scope of the community land provisions found in the [1993 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) as expounded in Friends of Pryor Park must be read down accordingly in order to satisfy cl 4's requirement of corresponding "most nearly".

Clause 4 does not call for reading down. Rather it directs attention to the provisions in the new legislation which "most nearly correspond" with the ones in the old scheme. As the respondent's counsel submitted, the purpose of cl 4 is to provide transition between statutes, not to save the old law and import it unamended into the new Act. Changes are to be accommodated, not modified.
To "correspond" does not require identity: cf Samarkos versus Commissioner for
Corporate Affairs <case>; [(1988) 52 NTR 1] at 9-10.

Stein J was correct to hold that the most nearly corresponding provision in the [1993 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) is Division 2, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of Chapter 6. This brings one back to the argument based on the scope of the
Plan which has already been addressed.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs. In declining to depart from the general rule that costs follow the event I have not overlooked Oshlack v
Richmond River Council <case>
This case does not appear to raise questions of general principle and the appellants have not urged the same degree of disinterested motivation as was relied upon by Mr Oshlack. I also take into account the fact that this is an unsuccessful appeal by parties who lost at first instance, and that the zoning argument addressed in this appeal was one which it was conceded might have been raised by Mr Seaton when he appealed from Stein J's orders affecting the earlier plan of management.
