NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION versus MAN FAI DANY NG /97 June 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Application is made for an order under s.22 by way of an assets forfeiture order for the property of Ng Man Fai Dany, being various sums of money that have been the subject of restraining orders made in this court arising from the suspected drug-related serious criminal activity of one Van Ia Duong. 
Mr. Temby of Queen's Counsel, who appears for the State Crime Commission, the applicants, has provided me with written submissions, which I place on file.
In particular he has taken me to the affidavit of Patricia Anne Jacowski of 17
November 1997 confirming that a block of substance, the subject of a prosecution on 13 August 1993, was heroin; the affidavits of Paul Scott
Campbell and Anastasia Loughman concerning a transaction, which he has by that evidence established to my satisfaction, on the balance of probabilities, was a drug supply operation in which Duong participated either as the prime mover or at least as a co-conspirator or a co-supplier. This is, since the quantity of heroin involved is in excess of an indictable quantity, clearly such an activity to which the Act applies and, all other things being equal, an order must be made by the terms of the section.

There is no appearance for the defendant.

However, Mr. Temby has drawn my attention to the fact that there may be some difficulty as to service, service having been effected overseas in Hong Kong as is deposed to in the affidavit of Chan Kwok Hung Terri sworn 26 May 1998.
Mr. Temby has not filed the original of that affidavit, which I am informed is in transit but an undertaking is given to file it or a substitute in the event that it should go astray. Mr. Temby has sought that the affidavit be admitted under [s.48(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/s48.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/) as a copy.

That affidavit is in fact an affirmation and it affirms the personal service of the relevant documents at the Federal Investigations Narcotics Bureau
Office in Hong Kong on a person who identified himself as Ng Man Fai Dany who confirmed that he understood English. This service does not comply with Part of the Supreme Court Rules but Mr. Temby has drawn my attention to [s.65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s65.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) and the regulations entitled the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Regulations 1995 made under that section which provides by Regulation 4 and 5 for notice and all originating documents, to be given or served as prescribed by those regulations.

Alternatively, Mr. Temby was prepared to seek leave to proceed under Part 10.
It seems to me that the latter is not necessary and indeed, may not be available in respect of such matters where notice has appropriately been given under the Act by virtue of the means provided for by the regulations. I am satisfied that there has been sufficient service. I am satisfied that an order might be made.

I make orders in accordance with the short minutes, initialled by me and placed with the papers.
