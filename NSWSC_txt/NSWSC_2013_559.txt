JUDGMENT
Amina Raafat Metleg applies for a stay of an arrest warrant which I ordered be issued on 7 May 2013, the execution of which was deferred until today's date: Law Society of NSW versus Metleg <case>
Ms Metleg approached the Duty Registrar yesterday at 3.30 pm for a stay of the arrest warrant. She was referred to the Duty Judge who, following the conclusion of the hearing he was conducting in an unrelated matter at 4.50 pm, referred Ms Metleg's application to be heard by me at noon today.
Ms Metleg applies for a stay of the arrest warrant on the basis that she is prepared to attend Court in any event on 17 May 2013 when her examination pursuant to [s 639](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/s639.html) of the [Legal Profession Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/) is listed for hearing at 11 am before the Registrar. 
Mr Maltz, who appears on behalf of John Ernest Mitchell, a receiver appointed by the Court on the application of the Law Society of NSW, opposes the application for a stay and submits that Ms Metleg's past non-compliance with Court orders does not give one confidence that she will, unless a particular regime for enforcement is in place, appear for the purposes of the examination on 17 May 2013. 
Accordingly, Mr Maltz has proposed, by a document headed "Short Minutes of Order version 1", a series of orders which are designed to ensure that Ms Metleg attends for her examination on Friday 17 May 2013, without the need for the arrest warrant to be executed. If, however, there is non-compliance which indicates that she might not be present at the examination, the arrest warrant will be executed. 
The draft orders which are proposed have been the subject of some debate in Court, following which draft orders 2 and 7 have been amended. Ms Metleg, when asked to make submissions in relation to the amended draft orders, has indicated she does not oppose the draft orders. I consider the draft orders, as amended, to be appropriate.

Orders
The orders I make are:
The Motion by Ms Metleg provided to the Duty Judge on 13 May 2013 is dismissed.
