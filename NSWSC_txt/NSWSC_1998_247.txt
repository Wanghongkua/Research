MALCOLM CARLISLE TANSWELL versus VINCENT DERECK KEARNEY and THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS /98 June 1998 
Hidden J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Malcolm Carlisle Tanswell, is awaiting committal proceedings at the Downing Centre Local Court in respect of a charge of murder and two charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The second defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions, conducts the prosecution of those proceedings and, on 19 September 1997, the plaintiff was served with a notice pursuant to [s
D(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48d.html) of the [Justices Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), setting out a list of persons who had provided written statements to the investigating police, together with copies of those statements.

On 12 March 1998, the Director wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors listing the persons upon whose statements the prosecution intended to rely at the committal proceedings. Some of the persons in the earlier notification were omitted from that list.

On 26 and 27 March 1998, the first defendant, a magistrate, heard an application by the plaintiff under [s
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) of the Act for a direction that some of the people who had provided statements be required to attend the proceedings to give oral evidence. That application extended to some of the persons upon whose statements the prosecution no longer relied. As to those persons, the learned magistrate held that he had no jurisdiction to make an order for their attendance. That decision is challenged before me. As to the persons upon whose statements the prosecution did rely, the learned magistrate made orders for the attendance of some of them, but declined to make such an order in respect of others on the basis that no substantial reasons had been shown to direct their attendance: [s
E(2)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html)
His Worship's decision that those persons should not be required to attend is also challenged before me.

As to both decisions, the plaintiff contends that the magistrate applied the wrong test so as constructively to have failed to exercise his jurisdiction:
Saffron versus Director of Public Prosecutions [(1989) 16 NSWLR 397] per
Priestley JA p 418. He seeks an order under <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) that his
Worship be directed to consider the relevant applications according to law.
Different considerations arise depending upon whether the order under challenge relates to persons upon whose statements the prosecution did, or did not, rely.

Statements Not Relied Upon.

The question whether his Worship had power to order the attendance of persons whose statements were not to be relied upon requires a consideration of the terms of [s
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), and its context within Subdivision 7A of that Act.

The purpose of that Subdivision is to facilitate the dispatch of committal proceedings by ensuring that prosecution evidence is led in the form of written statements [(ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48a.html) and [48AA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48aa.html)), except insofar as the interests of justice require that the maker of the statement give evidence orally and be subject to cross-examination [(s
E).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html)
To be admissible, the statement must comply with certain formal requirements [(s
C)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48c.html), and must have been served upon the defendant prior to the hearing [(s
B).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48b.html) [Section
D(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48d.html), referred to earlier, provides: "A written statement is not admissible as evidence under [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48a.html) in any committal proceedings if the informant has not served, or caused to be served, before the expiry of such period as the Justice or Justices may direct, on the defendant a notice in or to the effect of the prescribed form explaining the effect of this Subdivision and the rights of the defendant in relation thereto." 
The original notification to the plaintiff of 19 September 1997 was in compliance with this sub-section. I shall turn in a moment to an examination of the prescribed form referred to.

The vital provision for the purposes of the application before me is [s
E.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html)
It is sufficient to set out the first two sub-sections: "(1) For the purposes of committal proceedings, the Justices may give a direction requiring the attendance at the proceedings of a person who has made a written statement for the purposes of this Subdivision. The direction may be given on the application of the defendant or informant or on the motion of the
Justice or Justices.

The Justice or Justices may give the direction only if: in the case of a witness in proceedings that relate to an offence involving violence who is the alleged victim of the offence - the Justice or
Justices are of the opinion that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence, or in any other case - the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence." 
From the opening words of [s
E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html), it will be seen that a magistrate has the power to require the attendance at the committal proceedings of "a person who has made a written statement for the purposes of this Subdivision." Counsel for the Director submitted that a statement was made "for the purposes of" the Subdivision only if the prosecution proposed to tender it in the proceedings. The Subdivision, he argued, is concerned with the presentation of prosecution evidence at committal proceedings, and does not apply to statements taken by investigating police unless the prosecution chooses to rely upon them as evidence (even though they might have been prepared and served in accordance with the procedural requirements of the Subdivision). Counsel called in aid the use of the term "witness" in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48.html), which was said to demonstrate that the section as a whole is concerned only with persons upon whose statements the prosecution intends to rely as evidence.

This interpretation would cause no prejudice to the defendant, the argument continued. It would not be a licence to the prosecution unfairly to limit the presentation of its evidence, as there is no doubt that the duty of a prosecutor at general law to produce all material evidence extends to committal proceedings: The Queen versus Harry: Ex Parte Eastway [(1985) 39 SASR ], per King CJ at pp 209-11 [(20 A Crim R 63] at pp 69-71).
Further, should the prosecution disclosure provide material which the defendant wants to elicit, he or she can do so in the defence case: [s (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s41.html) of the Act. In that event, the defendant would also be assisted by the expansive power of cross-examination, subject to the leave of the Court, conferred by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Senior counsel for the plaintiff also relied upon the opening words of s
E(1) to submit that the section applies to any person whose statement has been made in accordance with the Subdivision, whether or not the prosecution elects in due course to use the statement as evidence. A statement is made "for the purposes of this Subdivision", he argued, if it is prepared in the form required by <case>, whereby its maker attests to its truth in anticipation that it may be tendered in evidence and in the knowledge that he or she might be required to give oral evidence in accordance with it. I was informed from the Bar table that all but one of the statements, the subject of this aspect of the application, were prepared in that form. The one exception is in the form of a police record of interview but counsel for the Director took no point arising from that. On occasions, records of interview are tendered in evidence under cover of a statement in the form required by <case> attesting to the truth of what was said during the interview.

Accordingly, it was submitted, the critical time for the purpose of the opening words of <case> is the time at which the statement was made.
However, counsel relied also upon the fact that these statements were served in accordance with the Subdivision and drew my attention to the form prescribed for the purpose of <case>. That is Form 1 in Schedule 2 to the
Justices (General) Regulation 1993, prescribed by Clause 10 in Part 4 of that
Regulation. That document informs the defendant of the names of witnesses whose statements have been taken, together with copies of those statements and of documentary exhibits. It makes provision for arrangements to inspect exhibits other than documents. It goes on to summarise relevant provisions of the Subdivision, including the right to apply under <case> for direction that persons attend the proceedings to give oral evidence. It explains that the defendant must give notice to the prosecution if such an application is to be made: <case>. (I notice that the Form served on the plaintiff appears to be one prescribed prior to the introduction of <case> in its present form but, for present purposes, nothing turns on this.) 
In the result, submitted counsel for the plaintiff, the fact that the statements with which I am concerned were prepared (and served) in accordance with the Subdivision is sufficient to subject those persons to the jurisdiction of a magistrate under <case>. The fact that the prosecution decided later not to rely on them is not to the point. The use of the word "witness" in <case> merely recognises that any person who has made a statement under the Subdivision is a potential witness, either through the tender of that statement or as a result of a direction to attend the proceedings. It was common ground that the meaning of the word is not confined to persons who have attended at the hearing to give oral evidence, or whose statements have been tendered at the hearing, because the normal practice is for applications under <case> to be made prior to the day appointed for the hearing. (The decision of Yeldham J in Karpik versus Seberry (unreported, 11
April 1986) was concerned with <case> in its original form, and is no longer applicable.) 
The matter is by no means easy to resolve. However, whilst acknowledging the force of the arguments advanced on behalf of the Director, I am persuaded by the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff. That interpretation accords with the plain words of <case>. I agree that the use of the word "witness" in sub-s (2) is no more than a recognition that anyone who has made a statement in accordance with the Subdivision may acquire that status. So much is clear from the formal requirements imposed by <case>, to which I have referred. In any event, the purpose of sub-s (2) is to set out the bases upon which a person who has made a statement might be required to attend the proceedings, so as necessarily to become a witness.

Further, I consider that the interpretation urged on behalf of the plaintiff is consistent with the nature and purpose of committal proceedings.
Notwithstanding the reforms to the procedure at committals over a period of years leading to Subdivision 7A in its present form, it remains a legitimate part of that purpose that the defendant have an opportunity to explore the prosecution case and to test it. Quite apart from the question whether a defendant should be required to face a trial, the proceedings have "the objective of facilitating a fair trial in the event that the person charged is committed and later stands trial": Hanna versus Kearney & Anor (Studdert J, unreported, 28 May 1998) at p 12 of the judgment.

Counsel for the Director acknowledged as much, but submitted that that end could not be achieved by the questioning of witnesses upon whom the prosecution did not rely. I do not agree. Presumably, all the statements originally served upon the plaintiff were seen to have some relevance to the issues at hand. Even though the prosecution has since decided not to tender some of them, it may be that questioning of their makers will elicit further relevant material and help to expose the strength and weaknesses of the prosecution case.

True it is, as counsel for the Director observed, that committals are not a procedure to allow general discovery. However, no such result would flow from this interpretation. There remains the requirement to demonstrate substantial reasons, within the meaning of <case>(b), why any such person should be required to attend as a witness, and the question whether there are substantial reasons must be considered in the light of the proper functions of committal proceedings.

Accordingly, I am satisfied that the learned magistrate fell into error when he held that he had no jurisdiction to entertain an application under <case> in respect of the authors of statements made and served pursuant to Subdivision
A, but upon which the prosecution did not intend to rely. If, upon reconsideration, his Worship determined that any of those persons should be directed to attend the proceedings, I consider it appropriate that the prosecution should call that person, if only to make him or her available for cross-examination on behalf of the plaintiff.

Statements Relied Upon.

As already observed, in relation to a number of people upon whose statements the prosecution did rely, the learned magistrate directed the attendance of some of them, but declined to do so in respect of others. As to those others, his Worship observed in his reasons that the application had been "based primarily upon cross-examination of those persons to highlight perceived inconsistency between their statements and the statements of others ..."
Earlier in his reasons, when dealing with the principles governing applications of this kind, his Worship referred to cross-examination which might substantially undermine the credit of a significant witness and added: "It will always be a matter of dispute as to when the credit of a witness will be substantially undermined. In this respect, it is arguable that substantial reasons will not exist where the sole reason advanced for the cross- examination of (a) prosecution witness is the advantage of obtaining relevant material to the witness' credit. Questions of credit can never been (sic) regarded as other than collateral to the proceedings and cross-examination with respect to such an issue should not found the basis for a successful application under the section, except in the case of informers, indemnified witnesses, co-accused in which circumstances it can be anticipated that cross- examination could quite readily undermine the credit of such a witness in such a substantial manner and in such circumstances it may be anticipated that such an application would have a favourable outcome so far as the defence is concerned." 
Insofar as that passage suggests that cross-examination as to credit would not provide substantial reasons for requiring the attendance of a witness unless that witness fell into certain categories, I cannot agree. Whether cross- examination on credit could meet the requirements of <case> is a matter which would need to be determined in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.

More importantly for present purposes, his Worship approached the application in respect of those persons in a global way, without considering the differing bases upon which the application was pressed in respect of each of them. In so doing, his Worship fell into the error identified by Studdert J in Hanna . In that case, his Honour said (at p 9): "It seems to me that a consideration of the various applications made under s
E warranted discrete consideration of the content of each statement sought to be introduced by the prosecution. This is because the evidence to be found in the statements addressed different issues and prompted different reasons for the requirements advanced for cross-examination." 
Counsel for the Director very properly acknowledged this deficiency in his
Worship's approach and conceded that, for this reason only, the plaintiff was entitled to the relief he sought.

Conclusion.

Accordingly, the matter must be remitted to the magistrate to be dealt with in the light of the principles which I have stated. Pursuant to <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), I direct the first defendant to hear and determine the application under [s
E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) of the Act for the attendance of witnesses at the committal proceedings according to law.
