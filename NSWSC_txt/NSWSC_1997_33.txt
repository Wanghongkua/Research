Smith versus Yusen Daly Smith International P/L [1997] NSWSC 33 (14 February )
 `SMITH versus YUSEN DALY SMITH INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD` `4058/94` `FRIDAY 14 FEBRUARY 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is a notice of motion taken out by a liquidator in a matter which was dealt with in a practical way by me on 13 March 1995. There I had before me a fairly serious dispute between a Mr Smith and a large Japanese corporation, who had entered in a co-venture, which co-venture was carried out by the first defendant company as the corporate vehicle.` ` Various serious differences arose between Mr Smith and the Japanese corporation and on 7 October 1994 Mr Smith issued a summons for the winding up of the corporate vehicle, either pursuant to <case> of the Corporations Law or, alternatively, <case> or <case>, E, F, G or K.` ` An immense amount of work went into the preparation of the case and it came on for hearing before me on 13 March 1995. It was abundantly clear that the company had to be wound up. Indeed, no one really opposed that. It was also abundantly clear that someone had to decide the disputes that existed between
Mr Smith and the Japanese corporation. The court could have spent weeks dealing with the matter. However, as a liquidator had to be appointed, and as the liquidator had available to him a far cheaper and informal procedure of dealing with the disputed questions in his statutory duty to work out what were the assets and liabilities of the corporate vehicle, I suggested to the parties that it would be sensible to leave the liquidator to deal with those matters. My memory is that there was general agreement to this. It was obvious that in making those decisions the liquidator would have to make use of a considerable amount of the material which was presented to the court by the parties.` ` The question of costs was raised and again, as a practical commercial matter, the problems that everyone realised were going to exist were dealt with in a practical and commercial manner, that is an order was made that the plaintiff's costs be paid out of the assets and then the order went on to say:` `"The plaintiff's solicitor is to provide a detailed bill and the liquidator should consult the solicitor for the defendant before allowing the bill in full. With liberty to apply."` `` ` The schema obviously was that the matter would be dealt with in the practical commercial way of practical and commercial people, by the real litigants, Smith and the Japanese corporation, being able to consult with the liquidator as to which items they considered were not within the schema I have outlined.` ` However, we owe to Sir Williams James LJ the classic description of the culture that exists in these sorts of matters in the legal profession. He said in Hall versus Eve [(1876) 4 Ch D 341] at 344 that in equity:` `"The importance of questions was in this ratio: first, costs; second, pleadings; and third, very far behind, the merits of the case."` `` ` This, of course, was picked up by the Full Court in Solicitor-General v
Wylde <case>; [(1945) 46 SR 83](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=%281945%29%2046%20SR%20%28NSW%29%2083 "View LawCiteRecord" ),90.` ` So: instead of the parties and the liquidator working out what material was useful to them to solve the real dispute; instead of someone trying to make a list of the differences between the parties in that material: instead of there being a mediation under <case> of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), there have been notices of motion, such as today's, for me to construe my previous order and adjust it under the slip rule.` ` The matter was placed in the list today to deal with this motion. I asked for written submissions from both sides so that I could deal with the matter in the limited time I had available. Those written submissions turned on the technical, but completely unmeritorious, points as to whether the court was functus, and the scope of the words "liberty to apply".` ` When the motion came on before me today, none of that material was relied on, as its technical nature was really irrelevant to any issue between the parties.` ` I was asked to construe the order that I had made. It is competent for a court in the suit in which an order was produced to construe the order it made because otherwise there is only contempt proceedings to resolve the issue, which is unsatisfactory; see Cawood versus Green, Court of Appeal, 26.6.1974 unreported.` `` However, a construction which Mr Phillip Taylor of counsel for the liquidator puts on my order is one which is completely contrary to the plain wording of the order. He seeks a declaration as to this construction. I am not prepared to do that. I can see of no utility in doing it and no one seeks a negative declaration of any other meaning.

I was also asked to amend the order under the slip rule. I cannot see anything within the slip rule which needs to be attended to in the form of order that was made.

The evidence that I was asked to consider was an affidavit consisting of the transcript, the Associate's notes and a copy of my judgment. Under the costs rules affidavits cost the client about $100 a page and the court is no longer prepared to tolerate material which is already on the court file being charged to clients by its regurgitation. Accordingly I decline to allow any costs for the affidavit filed in March 1996.

A further affidavit was prepared for today's proceedings, but no one took the trouble to serve it or give it to the court prior to the hearing. This is despite the procedure adopted at the time when the matter was set down that the court would pre-read the material: accordingly, no costs will be allowed for that affidavit either.

The present motion has really just been a waste of everybody's time. It has come from the culture of dealing with these matters in some strictly legal and technical and clever way, rather than getting to the real merits of the dispute. It is not the way in which liquidators or their solicitors are to conduct their business before this court.

The notice of motion is dismissed. The court orders the liquidator to pay the costs of the motion.
