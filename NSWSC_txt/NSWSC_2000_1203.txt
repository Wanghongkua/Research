COMMON LAW DIVISION 
KIRBY J 
Thursday 14 December 2000 /99 - ELVIERA JONES versus EAGLE FORD PTY LTD t/as THOMSON AUTOMOTIVE 
JUDGMENT [No 3] (Slip-Rule) HIS HONOUR: In this matter, in paragraph 103 of the judgment handed down on 29 November 2000, there was a calculation for future economic loss. That calculation contains an error.
 The parties have re-calculated that item and agreed that the proposed figure is $276,387.18. That sum should be substituted for the amount which appears in the judgment.
 The verdict should be altered to reflect that sum, so that the verdict, after making allowance for workers' compensation and other aspects referred to in the judgment of 29 November 2000, will be $1,298,951.58. I enter judgment for the plaintiff in that amount, plus costs.
