CAMPBELL J  
FRIDAY 21 MAY 2004  /03 IN THE MATTER OF EUROSTAR PTY LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) (RECEIVERS AND MANAGERS APPOINTED) & ORS  
JUDGMENT - Ex Tempore (Revised 26 May 2004)  HIS HONOUR: This matter has come to me as duty judge on a reference from the Registrar. The Registrar is today conducting public examinations under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597.html) [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) concerning the affairs of the companies in the Eurostar Group. Those companies are ones which were connected with the King brothers of Port Macquarie, who ran a bus business. The companies have collapsed, with large deficiencies.
Today, Mrs Suzanne King is being examined under [section
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s596b.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). She is the wife of Mr Anthony King, who had been a director of various of the companies in the group.  The examination is being conducted by counsel instructed by the receiver of companies in the Eurostar Group. That receiver is an eligible applicant within the meaning of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s9.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), being a person authorised in writing by ASIC to make the application for examination.  The application arises from the fact that since the collapse of the Eurostar group of companies, the family of Mr Anthony King has moved to Perth. There,
Mrs King and their three children have adopted a different surname. The children concerned are possibly aged about eleven and a half, nine and a half and a little over two.  Today, counsel for Mrs King made an application to the Registrar under [section
F(1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s596f.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), seeking a direction prohibiting the mass media from publishing the surname by which
Mrs King and the children are currently known in Perth. That order is one to which the receiver was prepared to consent. The Registrar, however, declined to make such an order save for a very short period of time to enable the matter to be considered by a judge.  Mrs King was employed by the companies in the group over the period from to late 2001, performing duties of a general secretarial nature, including the payment of invoices and the preparation of the returns for a
Government Schools Student Transport Scheme. She took no part in the preparation of the financial accounts of the companies and was not a director.
She has never been an officer or director of the companies.  Mr Wallach, counsel for Mrs King informs me that the present application is made so that the privacy of the children can be preserved.  Mrs King was called to give oral evidence intended to lay the factual basis for the order sought. She has given evidence that when the collapse of the group of companies occurred, she and the children simply stayed in their home unit with the children not attending school for some days, so as to keep them from potential publicity. She was asked whether before the collapse of the companies there had been any attempts on the part of the media to go to the children's school to photograph them; she could not recall any such events happening. She was not able to recall any events of harassment of the children at the school because of what happened in their father's business. She recalls that on occasions the children had some difficulties at school arising from their father being involved in running the local bus line, when children would ask them, for example, why their father could not put an air-conditioned bus on to a particular run, but none of that seems to arise from the circumstances of the collapse of the group.  Mrs King says that she has sought to protect the children, so they have only a limited knowledge even to this day of what has happened concerning the family's business. She says that the approach she has taken is one of prevention rather than cure and that she wishes that situation to continue.  [Section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) states:  "An examination is to be held in public, except to such extent (if any) as the
Court considers that, by reason of special circumstances, it is desirable to hold the examination in private."  What is now sought is not to hold the examination in private but, as I have earlier said, a limitation on the publicity which can be given to one aspect of the proceedings.  Even so, the "special circumstances" test set out in [section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597.html) is one which seems to me to be appropriate to take into account in deciding whether to give a direction of the type now sought. A limitation on publicity has, to some extent, effects of the same type as if the examination were held in private. Further, [section
F(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s596f.html) says:  "Subject to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597.html), the Court may at any time give one or more of the following:  ...  a direction prohibiting publication or communication of information about the examination (including questions asked, and answers given, at the examination".  When the power to give a direction under [section
F(1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s596f.html) is expressly made subject to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597.html), that is a clear indication that the purpose underlying [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s597.html) can be taken into account in making a decision whether to give a direction under [section
F(1)(f).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s596f.html)
However, the decision whether to give a direction under [section
F(1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s596f.html) depends on all the circumstances, of which the existence or otherwise of "special circumstances" is just one.  Part of the purpose of conducting examinations in public is that there is a public interest in all aspects of the circumstances which led to a corporate collapse being available to all those who might be interested. Incorporation is a privilege which is made available because there is seen to be public benefit in it, but there is a public interest in that privilege not being abused. The privilege of incorporation is given on terms that, if the company collapses, its affairs can be examined, and that examination will ordinarily be in public. In at least some instances, publicity of information given in examinations can cause information which was otherwise not available to be brought to the attention of those investigating the circumstances of the corporate collapse. There needs to be a good reason before full openness to public scrutiny of what is said in such examinations should be removed.  I am not persuaded that there is sufficient reason in the present case to make the order which is sought. While I accept that Mrs King is fearful that there might be some media interference with her children, there has been no practical example in the past of such interference occurring. Even if there had been, that might not have been enough to justify the order sought.  Also, it is fairly common for people who are being examined in public examinations under the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to be people who have children. It is a perfectly predictable consequence of
Parliament's decision that examinations should ordinarily be conducted in public that the identity of people involved in corporate collapses might become known, as a result of publicity given to the examination, to people who know their children. It is also an ordinary consequence of Parliament's decision that such people might identify those children as the children of someone who has been involved in a corporate collapse. There is nothing in the situation of Mrs King or her children which takes them outside the ambit of what Parliament must have intended as an ordinary consequence of requiring examinations to be held in public. For these reasons, I decline to make an order of the kind which is sought.  The order which the Registrar made on an interim basis was that there be no publication in the mass media of the other surname that Mrs King used until pm on 24 May 2004 or until the question of suppression has been considered by a judge. Now that the time has come where that question has been considered by a judge, I revoke the Registrar's interim order.
