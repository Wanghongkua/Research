JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW LIST  
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE HARRISON  
MONDAY, 13 AUGUST 2007  /2007 - ANWAR ELABBAS versus CONSUMER TRADER AND TENANCY TRIBUNAL & ANOR  
JUDGMENT (Appeal decision of CTTT - service of  notice of termination)  HER HONOUR: By further amended summons filed 2 August 2007, the plaintiff seeks, firstly, that the orders made by the Consumer Trader and
Tenancy Tribunal (CTTT) on 20 December 2006 in the CTTT file number RT /43886 be set aside pursuant to <case>(b) and <case>(b) of the Consumer
Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act 2001 (the CTTT Act); secondly, in the alternative, an order that the matter be remitted to the CTTT to be reheard and redetermined in accordance with law and in accordance with this
Court's decision; thirdly, a declaration that the determination of the CTTT was vitiated by reasons of errors of law; fourthly, a declaration that the orders of the CTTT were made in circumstances which amounted to a denial of procedural fairness; and fifthly, an order in the nature of certiorari ordering removal of the record of the proceedings before the CTTT to this
Court and quashing the orders made.  The plaintiff is Anwar Elabbas. The first defendant is the CTTT, who has filed a submitting appearance. The second defendant is New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation (Housing Corporation). The plaintiff relied the affidavit of Louise Butt affirmed 24 July 2007. The parties handed up an agreed bundle of documents (Ex A).  
Extension of time to appeal  On 8 February 2007, the plaintiff approached this Court with a handwritten summons seeking to appeal the decision of the CTTT. The extempore reasons of the Tribunal Member Jeffrey Smith were provided on 20 December 2006. The appeal should have been lodged by 18 January 2007. It was lodged three weeks late. The plaintiff explained that he told the advocate who appeared for him at the Tribunal hearing that he wanted to appeal. She advised him to seek a review in the CTTT. He says that he did and it was unsuccessful. On 7 February , the Sheriff appeared at his front door. He telephoned some solicitors and received advice that the appeal was to this Court. The defendant did not submit that it suffered prejudice. I accept the plaintiff's explanation for delay and grant an extension of time to file this appeal.  
The relevant statutory provisions  Section 65(1) of the CTTT Act provides:  "(1) Except as provided by this section, a court has no jurisdiction to grant relief or a remedy by way of:  a judgment or order in the nature of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari or other relief, or  a declaratory judgment or order, or  an injunction,  in respect of any matter that has been heard and determined (or is to be heard or determined) by the Tribunal in accordance with this Act or in respect of any ruling, order or other proceeding relating to such a matter."  Section 65(3) however provides:  "(3) A court is not prevented from granting relief or a remedy of a kind referred to in subsection (1) in relation to a matter in respect of which the
Tribunal has made an order if the ground on which the relief or remedy is sought is that:  the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the order, or  in relation to the hearing or determination of the matter, a party had been denied procedural fairness."  Section 67 of the Act allows for an appeal to be made to this court on a question with respect to a matter of law. A reference to a matter of law includes a reference to a matter relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (s 67(8)). The onus lies on the plaintiff to demonstrate that there has been an error with respect to a matter of law.  Section 67(3) of the Act provides that, after deciding the question of the subject of an appeal, the court may affirm the decision of the Tribunal, or it may make an order in relation to the proceedings in which the question arose as, in its opinion, should have been made by the Tribunal, or it may remit its decision on the question to the Tribunal and order a rehearing of the proceedings before the Tribunal.  The width of <case> was discussed in Chapman versus Taylor; Vero Insurance Ltd v
Taylor <case>
Hodgson JA (with whom Beazley and Tobias JJA agreed) stated succinctly at [33]:  "... in my opinion, to establish an error of law by the Senior Member, it was necessary to show that he applied a wrong principle of law. That could be shown either from what he said, or because the ultimate result, associated with the facts that he expressly or impliedly found, indicates that he must have applied the wrong principle of law".  See also Kalokerinos versus HIA Insurance Services P/L <case> at paragraphs [39], [40], [41], [47] and [59].  
The Tribunal generally  At the outset, it is helpful to set out some of the provisions of the Act.
The functions of the Tribunal are to adjudicate disputes between consumers and commercial disputes between landlords and tenants. The Tribunal is not constrained by the rigour of the courtroom. Its objects are to ensure that the
Tribunal is accessible, its proceedings are efficient and effective, its decisions are fair and to enable proceedings before the Tribunal to be determined in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive manner. The Tribunal is to act with as little formality as the circumstances of the case permit and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities or legal forms (s 28).  Evidence must be given on oath or statutory declaration (s 39(1)) but the
Tribunal is not bound by the rules or practice of evidence and the Tribunal may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it considers appropriate (s (2)). The Tribunal must conform to the rules of natural justice, but broadly speaking, has control of and responsibility for its own procedures (s 28(1) and (2)). Its business is conducted in public (s 33). Section 35 provides that the Tribunal must ensure that each party in any proceedings is given a reasonable opportunity to call or give evidence and otherwise present the party's case (whether at a hearing or otherwise); and to make submissions in relation to the issues in the proceedings. Normally, a party to the proceedings has carriage of his or her own case and is not entitled to be legally represented (s 36(1)). The Tribunal has the power to award costs (s ), but usually each party bears its own costs. Pursuant to <case> of the Act, the Tribunal is obliged to use its best endeavours to bring the parties to a settlement before making an order. The Tribunal has a power to correct its decision (s 50) and the Registrar can issue a certificate, which operates as a judgment to recover amounts ordered to be paid (s 51).  
Grounds of appeal  The plaintiff appeals the whole of the decision of the CTTT dated 20
December 2006 on the following grounds, firstly, the Tribunal Member erred in law in finding that the notice of termination had been validly served; secondly, the Tribunal Member erred in law in failing to provide sufficient reasons so as to expose a logical reasoning process; thirdly, the Tribunal
Member denied procedural fairness to the plaintiff in that he descended into the arena and became a protagonist in the proceedings; fourthly, the Tribunal
Member denied procedural fairness to the plaintiff in that he failed to invite the plaintiff's law advocate to cross examine the second defendant's witness; fifthly, the Tribunal Member erred in law and denied procedural fairness to the plaintiff in permitting the second defendant to rely upon documents that were not tendered; sixthly, the Tribunal Member erred in law and denied procedural fairness to the plaintiff in that he cross examined the plaintiff's advocate as to the documents in the Tribunal file which were not tendered nor relied upon by either party; seventhly, the Tribunal Member erred in law and denied procedural fairness to the plaintiff in that he relied upon tendency evidence adduced by the second defendant of which no prior notice had been given to the plaintiff; eighthly, the Tribunal Member erred in law in failing to recognise that he had a discretion as to whether or not an order should be made, or alternatively failed to properly exercise that discretion and give adequate reasons, ninthly, the Tribunal Member denied procedural fairness to the plaintiff in calculating and making a money order without taking into account the plaintiff's legitimate expectations that the second defendant would follow its own policies of providing rent reductions to persons in gaol and subsidising the rent of persons on law income; and tenthly, the Tribunal
Member erred in law in finding that there was no prospect that the plaintiff could pay off the rental arrears within a reasonable period in circumstances where there was no evidence to support that conclusion.  The grounds of appeal fall into three main categories, (i) was the notice of termination properly served, (ii) did the Tribunal Member correctly calculate the arrears of rent and (iii) was there a denial of procedural fairness.  
Background  On 8 July 2005, the plaintiff and Housing Corporation entered into a residential tenancy agreement in respect of premises at Riverwood. There is a page at the end of the agreement that contains notes. Note 3 refers to what has to appear in the notice of termination. There is no dispute about the content of the notice of termination.  Note 4 refers to service and relevantly states:  "(1) A notice of termination given to a tenant may be:  posted to the tenant's home; or  given to the tenant personally; or  given to a person aged 16 years and over who normally pays the rent; or  given to a person aged 16 years and over at the premises to pass on to the tenant.  ..."  The notice of termination was posted to the address of the premises referred to in the tenancy agreement. However, Note 4 differs from Clause 25 of the [Residential Tenancies (Residential Premises)
Regulation](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/rtpr1995499/) , which was in force at the relevant time I shall refer to it in more detail shortly. The Note and Regulation 25 are inconsistent so it is the
Regulation that applies.  
The proceeding in the Tribunal  On 31 August 2006, the defendant brought proceedings in the CTTT seeking an order ending the tenancy agreement and taking possession of the premised due to rent arrears. The reasons for seeking that order were because the tenant had failed to comply with the tenancy agreement by not paying rent on time, and the rent account exceeded 14 days in arrears when notice of termination was issued. The Department of Housing requested the tenancy to be terminated and possession given to the Department. The Department sought a daily occupation fee until possession was taken by the Department.  On 31 July 2006, the notice of termination was issued by the defendant and was served by post to the address of the property stipulated in the agreement.
The notice, signed by the Senior Client Service Officer, contained an endorsement "I certify that this Notice of Termination was posted by me using pre-paid post at the local post office on 31 July 2006".  On 26 September 2006, Mr Elabbas wrote a letter "To Whom It May Concern" which was before the Tribunal Member. It stated that he, "a tenant of [he property] give authorisation to Shannon Attard who is my fiancee and wife to be in the near future, after all this mistake that has occurred to me, so in the mean time until this mistake is solved I wish my fiancee, Shannon Attard to act as my full representative in the matters relating to [the property].
Shannon Attard has and still a resident at [the property] since the /5/2006."  Section 130(4) of the [Residential Tenancies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) 1987 provides that "A notice of termination given under this Act may be given in such manner as may be prescribed for the purposes of this section."  Clause 25 of the [Residential Tenancies (Residential Premises)
Regulation](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/rtpr1995499/) which was in force at the time (and has since been repealed) is relevant.
It is identical to Clause 29 of the Residential Tenancies Regulation . This regulation is set out in the Tribunal Member's reasons. Clause (1)(c) read "by sending it by post to the residential premises occupied by the tenant."  
The Tribunal Member's reasons  The Tribunal Member in his written reasons dated 9 May 2007 made the following relevant findings at [1]-[4] and [6] - [7]:  "1. I am satisfied that the parties entered into a residential tenancy agreement as defined under the [Residential Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), [s.3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s3.html) and accordingly that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear this application. 
I am satisfied the applicant has served a valid notice of termination on the respondent in accordance with the provisions of the [Residential
Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s57.html) and that the notice is in the form specified in [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s63.html). 
That notice was served by posting it, on 31 July 2007, to the residential premises occupied by the respondent. The Residential Tenancies Regulations cl 29(1)(c) relevantly provides:  "29 Service of notices of termination  
For the purposes of section 130 (4) of the Act, a notice of termination given under the Act to a tenant may be given:  by delivering it personally to the tenant or a person apparently of or above the age of 16 years by whom the rent payable by the tenant is ordinarily paid, or  by delivering it to the residential premises occupied by the tenant and by leaving it there with some person apparently of or above the age of 16 years for the tenant, or  by sending it by post to the residential premises occupied by the tenant."  
The notice was, pursuant to the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s76.html) deemed to be received on 4 August 2006. The tenant was already 75 days in arrears of rent as at the date of service. 
I am further satisfied the respondent has not given up possession of the residential premises in accordance with that notice.  ... 
I am satisfied the applicant has established the grounds relied on in the notice of termination...." 
I have considered all the relevant circumstances put to the Tribunal and am satisfied pursuant to s.[64(2)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s64.html) that the breach, in the circumstances of the case, is such as to justify termination of the tenancy. The tenant did not, as claimed by his representative, have a blameless record in regard to rent arrears. In fact he was already some ten days in arrears as at the date of his arrest (26 May ). His tenancy had previously been terminated by order of the Tribunal for rent arrears. In all the time he was incarcerated, from 26 May 2006 to 7
November 2006, not one rent payment was made and no contact was made with the applicant's representatives directly by the respondent or on his behalf by his fiancee who was living at the premises."  
Service of the Notice of Termination  It is common ground that the plaintiff was in gaol for the period 25 May to 7 November 2006. The plaintiff submitted that during that period the residential premises were not occupied by him. On 31 July 2006, when the notice of termination was issued, the plaintiff was in gaol.  The second defendant submitted that as this point was not raised before the
Tribunal Member it should not be permitted to be pursued for the first time in these appeal proceedings. The plaintiff, in reply, submitted that the question of service is a jurisdictional fact and unless the notice of termination was served in accordance with the Act the Tribunal is precluded from making an order for possession.  The plaintiff submitted that the provisions of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) 1987 should not have been relied on by the Tribunal Member in circumstances where the parties accepted that the plaintiff was in gaol and not in occupation of the premises to which the notice of termination was posted at the time of purported service. The plaintiff further submitted that if the
Court were to adopt some strained interpretation of the meaning of "occupied" so as to find that the notice of termination had been sent to premises "occupied" by the plaintiff, then the plaintiff's sworn uncontested evidence that he did not receive the notice should displace the presumption of service which was otherwise available pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s76.html) of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/).  The defendant submitted that the natural and ordinary meaning of the relevant requirement (cl 25(1)(c) [Residential Tenancies (Residential
Premises)
Regulation](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/rtpr1995499/), ) for service by post of a Notice of Termination requires that service be effected at the demised premises. According to the second defendant, it does not required that the tenant must be physically present or in occupation and a construction that requires this of a landlord is not merely too broad but impracticable and unworkable.  The second defendant referred to <case> of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) which reads:  "In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or statutory rule or, in the case of a statutory rule, in the Act under which the rule was made) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote the purpose or object. "  According to the second defendant, the plaintiff contends for a wide and onerous interpretation of clause 25. Clause 25 is not expressed in terms that a tenant be "in occupation" at the time of service and that such a construction does not promote, but in fact hinders, the purpose or the object of the [Residential Tenancies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/).  According to the second defendant, if the plaintiff's construction is to be preferred to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words (couched as it is in passive language, "occupied by") a landlord in the second defendant's position would be restrained from ever being considered to have effectively served tenants who, for whatever reason, are absent from the premises.  The second defendant further submitted that if the plaintiff's construction is preferred, situations would invariably arise where, as was the case here, a landlord without notice of the absence of a tenant for protracted periods could never effect valid service of a notice of termination. Where a landlord is unaware, and kept unaware, of the tenant's absence but the obligation to pay rent on time (or obligations as to maintaining the property) is otherwise met (by the tenant, or by a third party on his/her behalf), a landlord could conceivably never effect service of a notice of termination on the construction that the tenant was not at the time of receipt by post of the notice, "in occupation " of the premises.  According to the second defendant, the case is of particular significance for the defendant, a social housing provider with obligations under the [Housing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ha2001107/) 2001 , and under gazetted Commonwealth-State funding agreements to provide low cost housing to eligible persons wait-listed for such accommodation, landlords with tenants convicted of serious offences which attract long periods of full time incarceration could, on the plaintiff's contention, never effect valid service in circumstances where the Housing Corporation was not notified of the imprisonment or was deliberately misled as to a tenant's whereabouts.  The second defendant did not know that the plaintiff was in gaol when it served its notice of termination. The Tribunal Member made a finding that in all the time that the plaintiff was incarcerated, from 26 May 2006 until 7
November 2006, no contact was made with the second defendant's representatives either directly by Mr Elabbas or on his behalf by his fiancee who was living at the premises. At the date that the notice of termination was served, the plaintiff had not notified the second defendant that he was not occupying the premises. The Macquarie Dictionary defines "occupied" as "to be resident or established in (a place) as its tenant; to tenant. It is my view that Mr
Elabbas, as the tenant, had not taken any steps to notify the second defendant of any change to the tenancy, and therefore he still occupied the premises.
Hence, service of the notice of termination complied with [Regulation .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ha2001107/s25.html)  
Calculation of arrears  As at the date of the hearing in the CTTT, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff owed $5,581.88 in rental arrears. The plaintiff submitted that as at the date of hearing, the amount of rental arrears was actually about $2,063, comprising of 10 days in arrears as at 22 May 2006, totalling approximately $70. $5 per week for 13 weeks = $65. $155 per week for 10.5 weeks = $1,627.50.
 days from 7 November 2006 @ $7 per day = $301.  According to the plaintiff, he was incarcerated for 23.5 weeks so was liable to pay $5 per week for the first three months, that is, $65. He was liable to pay $155 per week for the balance of his imprisonment 10.5 weeks x $155 = $1,627.50. In respect of the 43 days from the date of release, 7
November 2006, until the date of hearing, 20 December 2006, the plaintiff was entitled to a rental subsidy which would have reduced his rent to approximately $49 per week. The plaintiff says that from the date of hearing, he continued to be entitled to a rental subsidy reducing his rent to approximately $49 per week, rather than the occupation fee ordered by the CTTT of $31.43 per day. These submissions were not made to the Tribunal Member.  The plaintiff referred to the second defendant's policy concerning a tenant who was serving a period of imprisonment. The plaintiff could have sought to obtain the benefit of a policy in relation to prisoner's rental obligations ($5.00 per week) for a period of three months. He did not do so. If he had done so, it was a discretionary decision of the second defendant as to whether or not he received this benefit.  On 24 July 2006, the second defendant forwarded a letter by post to the plaintiff informing him that the rent was to increase to $225 per week as from October 2006. The plaintiff contended that this notice was not properly served and relied upon the same arguments as those raised in relation to the notice of termination. For the reasons given earlier, the notice was properly served upon Mr Elabbas.  In related to the rent arrears, the Tribunal Member stated:  "...Indeed it was not disputed at any time by the respondent's representative that the rent arrears are now in excess of $5,000. It is noted that a substantial part of that arrears figure (approximately $2,300) arose as a result of the decision by the applicant to cancel the rent subsidy in November effective from 11 May 2006. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to look behind a decision of the applicant to cancel a rent subsidy provided that the actual rent charged is not in excess of the market rent provided for in the tenancy agreement." (at [6])  There is no error in the approach by the Tribunal Member in relation to the calculations of rental arrears. There is no error of law.  
Procedural fairness  The plaintiff's Counsel referred to Glenn Nicholson versus New South Wales
Land and Housing Corporation also known as the Department of Housing, NSWSC, unreported, 24 December 1991 per Badgery-Parker J and Swain versus Residential
Tenancies Tribunal of New South Wales, NSWSC, unreported, 22 March 1995, per
Rolfe J.  In Nicholson, Badgery-Parker J stated:  "It seems to me to be abundantly clear in the present case that, by virtue of the public policy underlying the institution of public housing pursuant to the
Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement, the statement in s4(a) of the Housing
Act 1985 of the objects of that legislation, the policy statement of the
Minister at the time of the introduction of that legislation into the
Legislative Assembly, and the statement in the pamphlet Exhibit A, each with its particular emphasis upon accommodation which should be "secure" - which in the respective contexts clearly refer not to security from unauthorized entry but security of tenure - the plaintiff had as a public tenant a legitimate expectation of security of tenure except in the event of breach by him of the conditions of his lease. Accordingly, (a) if the decision of the defendant to exercise its right under the lease to give notice of termination pursuant to [s58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s58.html) of the [Residential Tenancies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) was a decision of a kind apt to attract the rules of procedural fairness and (b) unless there is to be found any clear statutory indication to the contrary, the plaintiff was entitled to entertain a legitimate expectation of procedural fairness in respect of any decision made by the defendant which would have the effect of depriving him of his tenancy. It matters not how it be expressed.
Either, he had a legitimate expectation of security of tenure, and was therefore entitled to procedural fairness in respect of a decision to deprive him of it; or, he in fact enjoyed the benefit of tenancy, and had a legitimate expectation of procedural fairness in respect of any decision which would adversely affect that benefit.  ...  
The position appears to me to be stronger in respect of a decision to take steps to terminate a tenancy. The position of a Housing Department tenant as compared with a private tenant is a matter of considerable value, because of the benefits of reduced or subsidised rent. To be deprived of it is to put the tenant back into the private housing market, a market which, by definition, he is incapable of competing in. To deprive him of his tenancy is therefore to deprive him of a very substantial benefit indeed. There is no question as to the right of the Department as a matter of contract to terminate the tenancy, but the decision to do so is an administrative decision which carries the capacity to deprive the tenant of substantial benefits, namely the availability of accommodation at a subsidised rent, and of security of tenure which, if not his right, was his reasonable expectation. In my opinion, on the authority of the cases which I have briefly referred to above, the relationship between the parties and the plaintiff's reasonable expectation of security of tenure apart from breach created a situation where the rules of natural justice bound the defendant not to take an adverse decision against him on the basis of adverse material known to it but not to him, without giving him an opportunity to comment on and if possible rebut such materials.
In the present case the defendant did not afford the plaintiff that right, and by that omission, deprived him of what natural justice entitled him to."  In Swain, Rolfe J stated:  "On the other hand the evidence seems to indicate that no clear line was drawn between the negotiation proceedings and the "formal" hearing of the application. This would not be a matter of particular concern to me, although it would perhaps be desirable for a distinction to be drawn. Of more concern is the unchallenged evidence as to the way in which evidentiary material was presented to the Tribunal. I leave aside whether witnesses were sworn to give evidence or not for, on one view, that is a matter entirely for the Tribunal.
The matter which troubles me is that there seems to have been no formality introduced requiring a witness to furnish evidence from the witness box, or a place equivalent thereto, and, having done so, to be questioned by way of cross-examination by the plaintiffs. Rather there seems to have been an interchange of dialogue between the Tribunal, representatives of RTA and the plaintiffs without any structured furnishing of evidence, which would have allowed the plaintiffs to have concentrated upon the cross-examination of the particular witness giving the evidence. I understand the Tribunal is able to handle matters in the way provided by the Act but, in a case such as this, which Mr Cochrane recognised as one involving some degree of sensitivity, I think it may have been appropriate for a more formal approach to have been taken."  Section 28 of the CTTT Act reads:  "28 Procedure of Tribunal generally  
The Tribunal may, subject to this Act, determine its own procedure.  
The Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence and may inquire into and inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit, subject to the rules of procedural fairness.  
The Tribunal is to act with as little formality as the circumstances of the case permit and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case without regard to technicalities or legal forms.  
The Tribunal is to take such measures as are reasonably practicable to ensure that the parties in any proceedings understand:  the nature of the assertions made in the proceedings and the legal implications of those assertions, and  the procedure of the Tribunal and any decision or ruling made by the
Tribunal that relates to the proceedings."  Section 35 of the Act reads:  "Opportunity for parties to present case  
The Tribunal must ensure that each party in any proceedings is given a reasonable opportunity:  to call or give evidence and otherwise present the party's case (whether at a hearing or otherwise), and  to make submissions in relation to the issues in the proceedings."  Section 35 provides that the CTTT "must ensure" that each party is given "a reasonable opportunity" to present its case. There are provisions which allow the CTTT a significant degree of flexibility in adapting its procedures to the exigencies of the case in determining the manner in which the proceedings will be conducted. Nevertheless, those provisions should not be construed so as to derogate from other provisions cast in obligatory language which constitute core elements of procedural fairness - see Italiano versus Carbone & Ors <case> at <case> and [106].  The plaintiff appeared at the Tribunal on the day that the hearing took place. Ms Wilkinson appeared for him. The Tribunal Member outlined the procedure to be followed when he stated:  "Mr Lavdeos, as the applicant, has the opportunity to give his evidence first and he has the burden of proof. So he will explain his side. He [can] produce documentary evidence that he's relying on. Ms Wilkinson, I'll ask you to listen without comment or interruption. If you wish to you can take notes and when Mr Lavdeos is finished you'll be given an opportunity to reply and to produce any documentary evidence that you're relying on. At the end of that process I will make a decision. My decision is final and binding. There's no avenue of appeal except to the Supreme Court.  
Do you understand the procedure?"  Mr Lavdeos replied "Yes". The Tribunal Member asked if the parties were ready to proceed with the matter. Both parties said that they were.  While Ms Wilkinson chose not to call Mr Elabbas as a witness, he took the oath in case he later decided to give evidence. When he was asked if he wanted to say anything extra, he said:  "All I could say is that I never received anything through the goal. No letters, no anything, your honour. I just had to go on Shannon's word that she was paying the rent and that everything was fine."  The facts of this case are unlike that of Nicholson. In Nicholson, the Housing Commission made an adverse decision against the tenant on the basis of adverse material known to it but not to tenant without giving him the opportunity to comment on and rebut such material. This is not the case here.
The Tribunal Member outlined the procedure to be followed and ensured that the parties were given a reasonable opportunity to give evidence and make submissions in relation to the issues in the proceedings.  Finally, the plaintiff submitted that the Tribunal member failed to exercise his discretion when deciding whether or not to terminate the tenancy.
Section 64(2)(b)(ii) of the [Residential Tenancies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) states:  
The Tribunal, on application by a landlord under this section, is to make an order terminating the agreement if it is satisfied:  in the case of a notice given by a landlord on the ground referred to in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s57.html), relating to a breach of the agreement:  that the landlord has established the ground, and  that the breach, in the circumstances of the case, is such as to justify termination of the agreement, ..."  The Tribunal Member took into account firstly, the arrears; secondly, that a previous order for termination for rent arrears had been made and that not one payment of rent had been made. Further, the Tribunal Member took into consideration that neither the plaintiff nor his representatives contacted the second defendant while he was incarcerated. The Tribunal Member exercised his discretion in accordance with [s (2)(b)(ii).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html)
The appeal fails as does the claim for relief.  In supplementary submissions, the plaintiff sought once again to have the affidavit of Shannon Attard dated 29 March 2007 admitted into evidence. This affidavit was not in evidence before the Tribunal, and as a result I disallowed it for the purposes of these proceedings. I adhere to this decision.  The appeal is dismissed. The orders of the Tribunal Member Jeffrey Smith dated 20 December 2006 are affirmed. The further amended summons filed 2
August 2007 is dismissed.  Costs are discretionary. Costs normally follow the event. The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs as agreed or assessed.  
The Court orders that:  
The appeal is dismissed.  
The orders of the Tribunal Member Jeffrey Smith dated 20 December 2006 are affirmed.  
The further amended summons filed 2 August 2007 is dismissed.  
The plaintiff is to pay the defendants' costs as agreed or assessed.
