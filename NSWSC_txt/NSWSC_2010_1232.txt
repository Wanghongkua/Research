Date of Hearing: 22 October 2010 
Date of Judgment: 22 October 2010  /288038 Sarah Margaret Burns versus Alan Michael Grevler (No. 2) 
JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE) REIN J: In this matter, the plaintiff has obtained judgment against the defendant and, being entitled to an order for costs in her favour, makes an application for costs on an indemnity basis. The plaintiff, through her solicitors, made an offer of compromise to the defendant, through his solicitors, dated 22 April 2010: see Exhibit B. There is no issue about the form of the offer of compromise. The result of the case is that the plaintiff has obtained judgment well in excess of the amount that was offered. Although it is strictly not necessary to have regard to this, the offer was a reasonable offer to try to compromise the matter for an amount significantly less than the amount for which the plaintiff ultimately has been successful.  Mr A Lo Surdo, of counsel, who appears for the defendant, opposes the making of the order on the basis that since the case involved issues of credit, it was reasonable for his client to resist the claim. Even were that true and even though it would be relevant to an offer in a Calderbank letter, it has nothing to do, in my view, with the situation where an offer for compromise has been made, as it has in this case, in accordance with [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p42) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) .
Mr Lo Surdo concedes that there is authority for the proposition that even where it was objectively reasonable for an offeror to test the other party's claim, that is not a sufficient reason to preclude the order being made: see
NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation versus Reeves [(1993) 42 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2042%20NSWLR%20100 "View LawCiteRecord" )  [Rule .14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s42.14.html), by the phrase "Unless the Court orders otherwise", makes it clear that there is room for discretion, but that discretion is required to be exercised on proper grounds. In my view, no ground has been advanced that would preclude the plaintiff from recovering her costs on an indemnity basis.
 I have previously entered judgment for the principal amount. I will now deal with the balance of the matters that need to be determined. Short Minutes of
Order have been prepared by the plaintiff. I make orders in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of those Short Minutes of Order, which I initial and date with today's date. Exhibits are to be returned on the expiry of 28 days from today's date in the absence of an appeal.
