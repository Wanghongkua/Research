Application of Perpetual Trustee Company Limited [1997] NSWSC 152 (21
April 1997) `APPLICATION OF PERPETUAL TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED` `3276/96` `Monday 21 April 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) for judicial advice by a trustee.` ` The plaintiff is the trustee of a trust known as the "Geoffrey Harold Arnott
Trust" constituted pursuant to a declaration of trust dated 4 August 1983 ("the Deed"). It is also, together with Eleanor Dartnall, the trustee of the trusts of the will of Helen Annie Arnott ("the Will"). ` ` The Deed provided, inter alia, for trusts to attach to 1,000 shares of $2 each fully paid in the capital of Gleniston Pty Limited which were transferred to the trustees. As at the date of hearing, there were 16,000 issued shares in that company, 1,000 were held by the plaintiff as trustee of the trust, a further 4,000 by the plaintiff and Eleanor Dartnall as trustees of the Will, and the remaining 11,000 by Ronald Geoffrey Arnott. ` ` Ronald Geoffrey Arnott and Suzanne Ethel Arnott are the children of Geoffrey
Harold Arnott and Helen Annie Arnott. Neither of these children have any issue. The estate of Helen Annie Arnott is fully administered.` ` Clause 3 of the Deed provides that the trustees are to hold the Gleniston shares in the events which have happened on trust for Suzanne Ethel Arnott for life, and thereafter to such of the named grandchildren as are then living and have attained 25 years. The Deed names certain grandchildren. Mr Hallen of counsel has appeared for them on this summons. Clause 9(c) of the Deed provides that:` ` "The Trustees shall not sell any of the Gleniston` ` shares during the life of Suzanne Arnott without` ` the prior written consent of Suzanne Arnott."` ` The will makes exactly similar provisions for the shares held by Mrs Arnott in Gleniston. ` ` Ronald Geoffrey Arnott has proposed that Gleniston be placed in voluntary liquidation. The plaintiff has no objection to this, but is concerned that its ability to consent is limited because of clause 9(c) of the Deed and the corresponding provision in the Will. It accordingly sought the advice of the
Court on the following questions:-` `(i) Does clause 9(c) of the Geoffrey Harold Arnott` ` Trust and/or clause 3(a) of the will of Helen` ` Annie Arnott preclude the plaintiff voting in` ` favour of a voluntary liquidation of Gleniston` ` without the prior written consent of Suzanne` ` Ethel Arnott?` `(ii) Otherwise, do the terms of the Geoffrey Harold` ` Arnott Trust and/or the will of Helen Annie Arnott` ` preclude the plaintiff from voting in favour of` ` the voluntary liquidation of Gleniston?` `(iii) Whether those assets of Gleniston as distributed` ` to the plaintiff (whether in specie or in cash)` ` consequent upon a voluntary liquidation of` ` Gleniston are to be held on the same trusts as` ` the Gleniston shares held in the Geoffrey` ` Harold Arnott Trust and the trusts of the will` ` of Helen Annie Arnott?` `(iv) If the answer to question (iii) is no, how are` ` those assets of Gleniston as distributed to the` ` plaintiff (whether in specie or in cash)` ` consequent upon a voluntary liquidation of ` ` Gleniston to be held by the plaintiff?` ` The matter was argued before me on 20 February 1997 by Mr T K Tobin QC and
Mr Willmott for the trustee. I suggested that interested persons should be notified and that further submissions should be put to me and adjourned the matter until 7 April. On that date, Mr Hallen appeared for the named grandchildren and it was made plain to me that a solicitor was in court on behalf of Suzanne Arnott. Neither Mr Hallen nor the solicitor sought to be heard, nor did they either consent to or oppose what the trustee was seeking.` ` At the end of the oral argument I answered the questions "No", "No", "Yes" and "Does not arise" and said that I would give my reasons in due course.
These reasons are now supplied.` ` The first point that troubled me was whether a voluntary liquidation involved a sale. The answer to that enquiry is that a sale is involved in a voluntary liquidation, but not a sale of the shares. Rather there is a sale of the assets by the company to its shareholders.` ` One usually commences an examination of what is a sale with reference to
Benjamin's classic definition which now appears in para 26 of the 2nd ed of
Benjamin's Sale of Goods, viz:` ` "A transfer of the absolute or general property in a` ` thing for a price in money."` `This definition was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Henry; Re
Commissioner of Stamp Duties [(1962) 63 SR 298], `
 ` Counsel and I examined various authorities. In Great Western Railway Co v
Commissioners of Inland Revenue [[1894] 1 QB 507], two small railways were merged with the Great Western Railway and in exchange for their shares the shareholders in the smaller railways were to receive stock and debentures of the Great Western Railway Company. The English Court of Appeal held that the transaction was in substance a transfer on sale. There was virtually a sale of the shares of the smaller companies to the Great Western
Railway Company to be paid for in stock and debentures. ` ` Mr Tobin QC and Mr Willmott said that this case was distinguishable as we are here dealing with a voluntary liquidation, not an amalgamation. I believe this submission is correct.` ` However, nearer the core of the problem is Archibald Howie Pty Ltd v
Commissioner of Stamp Duties <case>; [(1948) 77 CLR 143.] That case involved a reduction of capital where the company returned assets in specie and the capital was reduced from $2 per share to 5 cents per share. Dixon, J at 154 said that the proper analysis of the transaction was that the shareholder "in satisfaction of his proportionate 'interest' in the assets, an interest consisting of a congeries of rights in personam, takes an aliquot part of the assets." Williams, J said at p 159 that the payment for a share in a company is "full consideration for the right to receive any distributions of money or assets which the shareholder subsequently receives from the company." ` ` In Ord Forrest Pty Ltd versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1974) 130 CLR 124], 142, Barwick, CJ, who was in the statutory minority said, "A company in allotting a share in its capital does not sell or transfer the share. ... The company does not part with any property, though by the allotment it diminishes its capacity to continue to allot shares ... ".` ` Article 146 of Gleniston's Articles of Association provides that, on a winding up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of the appropriate resolution, divide the assets of the company in specie among its shareholders.
I am informed that the probabilities will be that if there is a voluntary winding up, the assets of Gleniston, which are wholly shares in Arnotts
Limited, will be so distributed. If this occurs there may well be technically a sale of the Arnotts' shares, but not the shares in Gleniston Pty Limited which will disappear.` ` Mr Tobin QC also argues that one must look at the word "sale" in the context of the Deed and the Will. He put that when one does this, one can see that the word "sell" was used in other parts of the Will in a very technical way in contradistinction to "agree to sell" or "appropriate ... any part of the trust fund in specie". Accordingly, no matter what might be the situation for revenue law purposes, the settlor and the testatrix had used the word "sell" in the traditional sense of giving up an asset in exchange for money. Such a sale is not involved in a voluntary liquidation even if there is a distribution of assets. I again see the force of that argument and accept it.` ` Accordingly, the involvement of the trustee in the voluntary winding up of
Gleniston Pty Limited does not involve a sale of the shares in Gleniston Pty
Limited within the meaning of the Will or the Deed and accordingly it is not necessary for the trustee to obtain the written consent of Suzanne Arnott.` ` Of course, whether the consent is legally necessary or not, a wise and prudent trustee would seek the view of the beneficiary. The beneficiary has been served and has been given an opportunity to say what she feels about the transaction but has declined to take that opportunity. There may be very good reasons for her taking this stance, but the trustee has complied with its moral obligation to seek her view.` ` Accordingly questions 1 and 2 were answered "No".` ` Question 3 raises a different matter. The question virtually is upon what trusts will the cash or assets distributed in specie as a result of
Gleniston's liquidation be held by the trustee?` ` Counsel referred me to the cases discussed in Jacobs, Law of Trusts in
Australia 6th ed (Butterworths 1997) paras [1923] and [1924]. These are to the effect that if the trust property is resumed and there are interests in succession, the life tenant is entitled to have her income made up from the income from the original property. The learned authors cite Askew versus Woodhead <case>; [(1906) 6 SR 360.]
However, when one looks at the cases, they were both decided on specific provisions of Acts of Parliament. In the case of Askew, <case> of the
English Land Clauses Act 1845, and in the case of Quigley, <case> of the NSW
Public Works Act 1900. Neither give guidance as to what happens under the general law where there is a transmogrification of the trust property. Indeed, the presence of such provisions and other statutory provisions such as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/calopa1898334/s64.html) of the [Conveyancing and Law of Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/calopa1898334/) give the feeling that without such statutory provisions some other result might appertain. ` ` The problem does not seem to have been thoroughly considered before 1949 when Romer, J dealt with Re Scholfield's Wills Trusts [[1949] Ch .] War damage was caused to the real and leasehold property belonging to the trust and compensation money was received from the War Damage Commission. The trustees sought advice as to what part of the compensation moneys should be treated as capital. His Lordship found that none of the statutes such as the
Settled Land Act dealt with the point before him, but he should, by analogy, follow what happened in Askew versus Woodhead. He said at 346, "The fact that money has, through wholly fortuitous circumstances, been substituted for an interest in property affords, in my judgment, no ground for effecting, in addition, a substitution of beneficial interests." The same result seems to have been reached by Neville, J in Re Lingard [1908] WN (Eng) 107, 108, though the report is so abbreviated it is hard to say this for certain. See also Perpetual Trustee Co versus Holt <case>; [(1894) 15 LR (Eq) 18]; Clayton versus Montgomery <case>; [(1897) 18 LR (Eq) 171], 177 and Underhill and Hayton, Law of Trusts and Trustees (Butterworths London) 15th Ed 1995, p 519. ` ` The proceeds of the liquidation are thus to be held on the same trusts as the Gleniston shares. As it is unlikely that the quantum of income will markedly differ from what is paid at present, there is no need to consider whether surplus income should be capitalized or there be a resort to capital to supplement income.` ` Accordingly, I gave the answer "Yes" to question 3.` `` * * *
