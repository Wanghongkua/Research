REGINA versus Geza VASTAG 
JUDGMENT 
SMART J: Geza Vastag has applied for leave to appeal out of time against the sentence of three years periodic detention imposed by Judge Gibson on 11 November 1994 on a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely, methylamphetamine, about 83 grams, and taking into account another charge of supplying 7 grams. The charge relating to the 83 grams was a deemed supply charge based on the applicant's possession of the quantity. 
At the time the sentence was imposed it was a lenient one and could not have been successfully challenged on appeal. The applicant contends that this is one of those exceptional cases where leave to appeal should be given by reason of what has happened following the original sentencing amounting to a miscarriage. Such a principle was applied by this Court in R versus Sommerville [(1995) 36 NSWLR 184] and Wilson versus The Department of Corrective Services (CCA, 12
February 1997, unreported).

On 11 May 1995 Vastag was arrested and charged with two counts of supplying a prohibited drug. The first charge related to the supply of a quantity of ecstacy tablets, and the second to amphetamine powder. After a trial he was found guilty of both counts on 3 May 1996 and sentenced by Judge Kinchington on 14
June on the first count to a minimum term of two years three months to commence on 3 May 1996 and to expire on 2 August 1998, and an additional period of 15 months to commence on that date; and on the second count to a fixed term of 12 months to date from 3 May 1996. The judge took into account some other offences and that the applicant had spent some nine or 10 months in custody on these charges.

As to the periodic detention order made by Judge Gibson, Judge Kinchington said: "I cancel that present order pursuant to the provisions of the relevant legislation and direct that you serve the balance of that period by way of a full-time custodial sentence...I direct that that sentence be a fixed-term sentence of three years from 11 November 1994." 
Judge Kinchington thought that it would be inappropriate to fix a minimum and an additional term in respect of that three years as it would unduly complicate matters.

When the judge came to endorse and sign the indictment he wrote: "As to the periodic detention presently subject to, direct order for periodic detention be cancelled as from 3/5/96 and balance of period to be served by way of full-time custodial sentence from that date." 
That sentence would expire on 10 November 1997 and involved the applicant serving 18 months 8 days by way of full-time custody for the offence the subject of the periodic detention order.

The order endorsed on the Indictment complies with section 27(2) of the
Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act (1981) which provides that if an order for periodic detention is cancelled under section 24(1) because of a subsequent conviction, the person in respect of whom the order was made must serve any unexpired portion of the sentence to which the order applied by way of full-time imprisonment, subject to any parole order made under subs 4, and concurrently with the term of imprisonment to which the person is sentenced for that subsequent conviction.

On 20 May 1997 this Court allowed Mr Vastag's appeal against his convictions before Judge Kinchington, quashed them and the sentences and ordered a new trial. On 25 June 1997 Mr Vastag was released on bail pending his new trial.
He resumed serving his periodic detention, attending the Malabar Periodic
Detention Centre on 27 June, 4 and 11 July 1997. On 13 August 1997 he was granted bail pending the hearing of this application.

It seems that the applicant served his periodic detention from 17 November until his arrest on 11 May 1995. He remained in full-time custody until he was able to enter bail about 13 February 1996. He was returned to full-time custody on 3 May 1996 and remained there until 25 June 1997.

I interpolate that on 1 August 1995 the applicant was sentenced to one month's imprisonment for possessing a prohibited drug to date from that date. This did not lead to cancellation of the periodic detention order.

The decision of the High Court of Australia in Commissioner For Railways v
Cavanough <case>; [53
CLR 220] establishes that the effect of quashing a conviction is to avoid it ab initio.
The accused cannot be considered ever to have been convicted (224 and 225).
The accused is restored to all things which by reason of the judgment he has lost, so far as this is possible (per Starke J at 227 and 228).

In Sommerville (supra) at 189 Gleeson CJ pointed out that the cancellation of an order does not quash or expunge the original sentence which itself remains subject to appeal or potential appeal in the ordinary way.

As the convictions were avoided ab initio, the basis of cancelling the periodic detention order is gone. The order cancelling the periodic detention order is also avoided ab initio. It follows that the cancellation order being avoided, the sentence of full-time custody for the balance of the periodic detention period is also avoided. Further, this Court expressly quashed the sentences.

It is clear that the applicant was in custody as follows: May 95 - 13 Feb 96 275 days May 96 - 25 June 97 417 days -------- days 
Deduct sentence of Aug 95 of 1 month 31 days --------- 
Total period in custody 661 days 
When the periodic detention served is added to the full-time custody the period served becomes even longer. Three years periodic detention amounts to days. After satisfactory service of a substantial portion of the periodic detention, overnight incarceration usually ceases.

The Commissioner for Corrective Services did not oppose the applicant's application that leave to appeal out of time should be granted, the appeal allowed and a fresh sentence imposed. This was because, on the Commissioner's calculations, the applicant had already served substantial periods by way of periodic detention and, as a result of the cancellation of the periodic detention order, 57 weeks and five days full-time custody. That was a more severe sentence than contemplated by Judge Gibson.

In his written submissions the Commissioner submitted that the Court should set aside the order of Judge Gibson and impose a fresh sentence, that that sentence should be by way of a fixed term of 57 weeks and five days penal servitude commencing on the date of the cancellation of the periodic detention order on 14 June 1996. That suggested sentence is not appropriate where the conviction on which the cancellation order was made is avoided ab initio. The sentence suggested also represents a significant increase on that of three years periodic detention. That would be an impermissible result on an appeal by the appellant against the sentence, especially where the miscarriage occurs by reason of events subsequent to the imposition of the periodic detention order. There are difficulties in drawing the appropriate orders in the present case.

After a helpful discussion and review of the calculations with counsel for the
Commissioner he did not wish to put anything against the orders which I propose be made. The Crown and the applicant also did not wish to put any submissions against the order proposed.

There is no ideal solution as to the orders which should be made consequent upon the miscarriage which has occurred by reason of events subsequent to the imposition of the sentence of 11 November 1994. It is important to adhere to the order of Judge Gibson prescribing periodic detention. An acceptable way to approach the matter is to take the periodic detention served to 3 May 1996, namely 152 days, and to take into account the six days of periodic detention served after 25 June 1997 and such part of the full-time custody served between 11 May 1995 and 13 February 1996 as is sufficient to cut out the balance of the three years or 312 days of periodic detention.

My calculations are as follows: 
Periodic detention to 3 May 1996 152 days.

Periodic detention served after 25 June 1997 6 days.

Part of period in custody 11 May 1995 to 154 days February 1996; --------- 
Total 312 days 
I add this explanation as to item (iii), 154 days. It is 278 days from 11 May to 13 February 1996. From that figure 80 days have to be deducted for periodic detention. That leaves a balance of 198 days available to be taken into account. It is only appropriate to take 154 days into account. This leaves 44 days to be taken into account if there should be another trial, conviction and sentence on the matters before Judge Kinchington.

I propose the following orders and declaration:
Leave to appeal out of time against the sentence of three years periodic detention imposed by Judge Gibson on 11 November 1994 granted. Quash that sentence.
In lieu of the sentence imposed by Judge Gibson and, taking into account six days periodic detention served after 25 June 1997 and 154 days of full- time custody served between 11 May 1995 and 13 February 1996, order that Geza
Vastag be sentenced to periodic detention commencing on 11 November 1994 and ending on 3 May 1996.
Declare that Geza Vastag has completed all of his obligations under the order of periodic detention and order that he be released from periodic detention forthwith.

If there be a new trial on the charges heard by Judge Kinchington, a conviction and sentence, the judge will need to take into account the 44 days in custody up to 13 February 1996 and the custody from 3 May 1996 to 25 June
I am not making any comment as to whether there should or should not be such a new trial.

NEWMAN J: I agree with the reasons given and the orders proposed by the learned presiding judge. 
IRELAND J: I also agree. 
SMART J: Those will be the orders of the Court. * * *
