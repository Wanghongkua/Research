PATRICK STEVEDORES NO. 1 LIMITED T/AS PATRICK THE AUSTRALIAN STEVEDORES v
GARY DIVERS 
CA 40230/97 April 1998 
Handley JA, Cole JA, Stein JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an appeal by Patrick Stevedores No. 1 Limited in the interest of QBE Workers Compensation (New South Wales) Limited from awards made by Burke CCJ in favour of the worker. The only grounds of appeal sought to be pursued are grounds relating to the apportionment of the appellant's liability to the worker against earlier insurers or employers. However these earlier insurers and employers, whoever they may be, have not been joined in the proceedings and are not parties to this appeal. 
Section 22(7) of the Workers Compensation Act makes it plain that apportionment under that section is not a matter which is to directly affect compensation payable to the worker. This view is reinforced by the provisions of ss 22A(4) and (5) which relate to the working out of apportionment orders among various employers and insurers.

Since the only party before the Court as a respondent cannot be affected directly by an order of apportionment at this stage of the proceedings, and since the other parties who might be affected by such an order, if it were to be made, were not joined in the Compensation Court and are not parties to the appeal, this Court simply cannot consider the apportionment issues which this appellant seeks to raise.

In those circumstances I am of the view that the appeal fails for want of necessary parties and should be dismissed with costs.

COLE JA: I agree. 
STEIN JA: I also agree. 
HANDLEY JA: The order of the Court is appeal dismissed with costs. * * *
