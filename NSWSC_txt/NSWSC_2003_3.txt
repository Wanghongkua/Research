DOUGLAS KNAGGS versus COMMONWEALTH DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS  
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: By information and summons dated 10 April 2002, the plaintiff, Mr Douglas Knaggs, was charged with twenty offences under [s8C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8c.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (the
Administration Act). That section, so far as is relevant, provides -  "Failure to comply with requirements under taxation law 
A person who refuses or fails, when and as required under or pursuant to a taxation law to do so:  to furnish an approved form or any information to the Commissioner or another person; ...  is guilty of an offence." [Emphasis added.]  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s162.html) of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (the
Assessment Act) provides -  "162. A person must, if required by the Commissioner, whether before or after the end of year of income, give the Commissioner, within the time required and in the approved form:  
A return or a further or fuller return for the year of income or a specified period, whether or not the person has given the Commissioner a return for the same period; or  any information, statement or document about the person's financial affairs." [Emphasis added.]  The plaintiff, having received a notice from the Deputy Commissioner of
Taxation (the Commissioner) on 6 February 2002 requiring him to furnish the specified returns "in the approved form", failed to furnish any returns by 3
April 2002. The information was in the following terms -  "Details of the information laid against you:  
Twenty prescribed taxation offences where, pursuant to [section
ZL](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8zl.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/), it is averred that:-  on or about 4 April 2002 at Woolloomooloo in New South Wales pursuant to paragraph 8C(1)(a) of the [Taxation Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/), 1953 you failed to furnish a return to the Commissioner of Taxation when and as required pursuant to a taxation law, namely [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s162.html) of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) and it is further averred that:-  you were required by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Hurstville in
New South Wales by notice in writing dated 6 February 2002 to furnish to him by 3 April 2002 a return in writing on the appropriate form duly signed setting forth a complete statement of all income derived by you from all sources in Australia and elsewhere during the year ended 30 June 1982;  at all material times the Commissioner of Taxation had delegated his powers and functions in respect of the issue and contents of the notice to the
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation;  the delegation has not been revoked;  the notice was duly served on you by posting it on 6 February 2001 by pre-paid letter post to you at your address for service namely 141 Brougham
Street, Woolloomooloo, NSW, 2011;  you failed to furnish a return in compliance with the notice to the extent that you were capable of doing so;  the period of time provided by the notice to furnish the return was reasonable."  The other nineteen counts are in identical terms except each alleges a failure to furnish returns in respect of each of the years ended 30 June 1983 to 30 June 2001. Following his conviction, the plaintiff was fined a total of $5,000 in respect of all twenty offences, ordered to pay costs and, pursuant to section 8G of the Act, required to lodge returns for the years ended 30
June 1991 to 30 June 1995 inclusive on or before a certain date.  The plaintiff appealed against his conviction to the District Court. When the appeal came on for hearing on 27 November 2002, the transcript and exhibits of the earlier proceedings were tendered in accordance with the appropriate procedure. The plaintiff, who was unrepresented, contended that the information was void because it did not comply with [s57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s57.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), as it contained more than one offence and that, as to the merits, the period of time provided by the notice to furnish the returns was unreasonably short. The latter question, for obvious reasons, was not agitated in this Court. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s57.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) states -  "Every information shall be for one offence only, and not for two or more offences. Every such complaint shall be for one matter only and not for two or more matters."  The prosecution, however, relied on [s4K(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s4k.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (C'th) which states -  "Charges against the same person for any number of offences against the same provision of a law of the Commonwealth may be joined in the same information, complaint or summons if those charges are founded on the same facts, or form, or part of, a series of offences of the same or a similar character."  
It is argued by the prosecution that, as there was one requirement for the production of twenty returns, and the foundation for the charges was that no returns had been supplied, the charges are "founded on the same facts", having "a common factual origin": R versus Barrell & Wilson [(1979) Cr App R ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281979%29%20Cr%20App%20R%20250 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 253. In the alternative, the charges form part of a "series of offences of the same or a similar character". The plaintiff submits, however, that although it is true that the notice required the production of twenty returns, and the plaintiff was charged in relation to his failure to provide each return, the substance of the charge is the failure to obey the statutory requirement of s162 of the Assessment Act; the notice requiring production comprised a single document but there were, in substance, twenty demands; each demand arose out of the failure to supply the return applicable to the particular year. Accordingly, it is submitted, it cannot be said that the charges "are founded on the same facts". As to the prosecution's alternative argument, the plaintiff submitted that, as the failure to furnish the required returns occurred at the same time, there was no "series" of offences: they occurred simultaneously.  
In Collins [(1994) 76 A Crim R 204], the Queensland Court of Appeal considered whether it was proper to join counts of arson of a building, breaking entering and stealing in the same building and, as an alternative to this count, receiving property stolen from the building. McPherson JA and Lee J said (at 208) -  "Section 567(1) sets up a general prohibition in relation to the joinder of multiple counts in the one indictment. Section 567(2), however, sets up an exception. Relevantly, it provides that multiple counts may be joined on the one indictment if they: 'are founded on the same facts or are, or form part, of a series of offences of the same or similar character or a series of offences committed in the prosecution of a single purpose.'  
It has long been accepted that the basic criteria for the joinder of counts under subs (2) is the existence of some connection or nexus between them, each limb of the subsection being illustrative of the circumstances giving rise to that nexus: Ludlow versus Metropolitan Police Commissioner [[1971] AC 29] at 39; [(1970) 54
Cr App R 233] at 242; Kray [[1970] 1 QB 125] at 130-131; Cr App R 569 at 573-575; Clayton-Wright [[1948] 2 All ER ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1948%5d%202%20All%20ER%20763 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 765; Cranston [[1988] 1 Qd R 159] at 164.
In defining in broad terms what connection is sufficient for this purpose, an examination of the cases demonstrates that an appropriately liberal reading be given to the text of the section, consistent with its underlying policy. That policy, it was stated in Kray at 131; 575, is to enable the joinder of charges which may be "properly and conveniently" dealt with together; see also
Ludlow at 38; 241. It is obviously desirable both in the interests of the due and expedient administration of criminal justice and in the interests of finality of litigation in relation to the particular accused, that there be a single and final inquiry into matters which arise out of or which essentially involve common issues of fact or law. Any injustice which such a course has the potential to produce is adequately catered for by the discretion to sever provided for in <case>. If nothing else, consistency in decision making would dictate that the one tribunal resolve such questions, little being gained from a fragmented approach. The simple means which the legislature has provided for giving effect to this policy is to allow the joinder of multiple counts in the one indictment in an appropriate case "so that the whole of the facts can be adjudicated upon by one jury": Bellman [[1989] AC 836] at 850; [(1989) Cr App R 252] at 260. Indeed so extensively has this policy been recognised, that the courts have laid down the general rule that matters which can be joined without prejudice to the accused ought generally to be:
Connelly versus DPP [[1964] AC 1254]; [(1964) 48 Cr App R 183];
Bargenquast [(1981) 5 A Crim R 126.]  
The counts in the present indictment plainly display the requisite nexus. If nothing else, all of the offences charged had their genesis in the events of June 1993 and in that sense attract the operation of the first limb of the subsection. For offences to be "founded on the same facts" they must have a "common factual origin": Barrell and Wilson [(1979) 69 Cr App R 250];
Bellman at 850; 260; Cranston at 162. But that is a phrase which is not to be narrowly construed. In particular, it is not necessary for the offences to have arisen contemporaneously or to involve precisely the same facts. All that is necessary is for them to be traceable, either in time, place or circumstance, to common events."  In my view, the common events here are the nature of the notice, the omission by the plaintiff to furnish any returns in the years specified and his failure to provide the returns required by 3 April 2002. I am therefore of the view that the first criterion in the subsection for joinder is satisfied.  The Oxford English Dictionary divides the meaning of series into two major categories, one of which reflects successive occurrences of things of one kind, whether temporarily or spatially contiguous and the other category comprising a set of particular objects or terms that are related in some way to each other. All except one of the cases to which I have been referred considered only whether the alleged successive events or occurrences were sufficiently similar to justify joinder. However, In Re Prescott [(1979) 70
Cr App R 244], the English Court of Appeal rejected an argument that offences of obstructing a police officer and causing criminal damage to his uniform were part of a series for the purpose of the English equivalent of the provision currently under consideration. Omerod J said (at 246) -  "Here we have two offences of an entirely different kind which occurred simultaneously and so do not follow one another in temporal succession."  In my view, the acts alleged here, namely the failure to provide twenty returns by a particular time, do comprise a series in the sense that there was a set of failures of the same kind, namely a set of twenty failures to provide returns of income for successive years. Having regard to the purpose of [s4K(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s4k.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (Cth), as stated in the passage in Collins, which I have set out above (and which I respectfully adopt), I think that the distinction relied on by the plaintiff imposes an unreal and unnecessary limitation on the procedural reform designed to be effected by the subsection. The Court has ample power to deal with any unfair prejudice that might be caused to a defendant by joinder under this provision. Absent any such prejudice, it is indeed difficult to see why an information which fairly meets the statutory description should not be permitted and the subsection should not be approached in a technically narrow way. At all events, the language of the provision does not lend itself to such a narrow approach. As Brennan J said (Sutton versus The Queen (1983- <case>; [1884) 152 CLR 528] at 540) -  "If the offences are similar in character, they may constitute a series.
'Series' does not import a clear criterion for determining what charges may be joined in the same information. Perhaps little more can be said about its meaning than Dixon J said in Packett versus The King <case>; [(1937) 58 CLR 190] at 207, namely, that 'It connotes some connection between the crimes'.  In my opinion, much the same approach was expressed by Lord Pearson in R v
Ludlow [[1971] AC 30] at 39, where his Lordship considered that the essential requirement imported by the need for a "series of offences of a similar character" (vide the Indictment Act 1915, Schedule 1, Rule 3) was that "there has to be some nexus between the offences", noting that such a nexus "is a feature of similarity which in all the circumstances of the case enables the offences to be described as a series". The point, as it seems to me, is that series is a reference to the connection between the alleged offences whilst similarity refers to their nature or type. This appears to me to reflect the approach expressed by McCrossan J in R versus Cranston [(1988) 1 Qd R ]
at 164 where his Honour (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said -  "[Following a discussion of Ludlow versus Metropolitan Police Commissioner [[1971] AC 29](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1971%5d%20AC%2029 "View LawCiteRecord" ), it] seems clear that the requirement that nexus should exist is an additional requirement upon the requirement of 'similar character' and however precise they may be, these words call for the administration of a test in which time, place and the other circumstances of the offences as well as their legal character or category are all factors which are considered for the purpose of seeing whether the necessary features of similarity and connection are present. How, then, are the courts to deal with the inevitable problem which is involved in the application of so imprecise a test and the consequence that different minds may be disposed to come to different conclusions in judging whether the test has been satisfied? The courts may find that an appropriately liberal exercise of discretion to sever is called for in doubtful cases."  Accordingly, I am of the opinion that joinder of the twenty charges in the same information was permissible.  The plaintiff also submits that the information is defective in that it does not sufficiently state an essential ingredient of the offences. Section of the Assessment Act obliges obedience to a requirement by the
Commissioner. The requested return, information, statement or document must be in "the approved form". It is an offence under s8C(1)(a) to refuse or fail to furnish an "approved form" when required to do so. Section 388-50 of the
Administration Act provides -  "(1) a return...under a taxation law is in the approved form if, and only if -  it is in the form approved in writing by the Commissioner for that kind of return..."  The information does not refer to the failure to provide an approved form but to a failure to provide an "appropriate form". The phrase "approved form" nowhere appears. It is not controversial that, in respect of a statutory offence, it must "accurately state the acts necessary to constitute all the ingredients of that offence": Ex Parte Lovell re Buckley <case>; [1938 38 SR 153] per Jordan CJ at 173. If a necessary ingredient is omitted from the information, the mere fact that evidence of that ingredient is given in the trial will not overcome the difficulty and the information must be amended, failing which the defect is fatal. An error of this kind is undoubtedly jurisdictional and the conviction is void. The strictness of the rule is demonstrated by Ex Parte Burnett; Re Wicks & Anor [[1968] 2 NSWR .]
In that case an information and summons alleged that the defendant, being the driver of a specified motor vehicle in the State of New South Wales, drove the same negligently. However, there was no allegation that the vehicle was being driven on a public street. The defendant was convicted of the charge of negligent driving and applied for statutory prohibition. The omission of the allegation that the vehicle was negligently driven on a public street was not one of the grounds upon which the rule nisi was sought but, at the hearing of the substantive application, the defect was brought to the attention of the court. Isaacs J held that the information disclosed no offence and it was too late to amend it. In Clayton versus John L Pty Ltd [[1984] 1 NSWLR 344] the information alleged an offence under New South Wales consumer protection laws, the substance of which was that the defendant published a statement which was to his knowledge false or misleading in a material particular and setting out the advertisement in question. However, the information did not identify the "material particular" in which the advertisement was alleged to be false or misleading. The prosecution came on for hearing in the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Yeldham J held that the failure to identify the "material particular" in which the alleged statement was false or misleading invalidated the information, refused to grant leave to amend and dismissed it. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed an appeal. An appeal to the
High Court of Australia was allowed and the orders of Yeldham J restored: <case>; [(1987) 163 CLR 508.] Mason CJ,
Deane & Dawson JJ said (at 519-520) -  "The traditional function of an information was to found jurisdiction to deal with an alleged offence. Disregarding the effect of statutory provisions curing or precluding reliance upon a defect, the old authorities established that an information should be quashed as insufficient in law and invalid if it failed to inform the justices before whom it was laid of the nature of the offence and the manner in which it had been committed. The rationale of that requirement has, in more recent times, commonly been seen as lying both in the necessity of informing the court of the identity of the offence with which it is required to deal and in providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he is called upon to meet: 'an accused person could not be required to defend the charge if the information did not supply the particulars necessary to enable him to prepare his defence' (Ex parte Lovell;
Re Buckley <case>; [(1938) 38 SR 153], at p 166). The nineteenth century United Kingdom legislation which was enacted to render summary proceedings before justices less open to technical objection (see, in particular, Jervis' Act 1848 11 & 12 Vict. c.43, ss.1 and 3 and the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879 42 & 43 Vict. c.49, s.39) was substantially adopted in New South Wales (see the discussion in Ex parte
Lovell; Re Buckley, at pp 167-174 and, in particular, [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) , [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s65.html) and [145A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s145a.html)).
One can point to statements of authority which lend support for the view that that legislation did not go so far as to abrogate the requirement that a valid information must at least identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence (see, e.g., Smith v. Moody [(1903) 1 KB 56], at p 60;
Johnson v. Miller <case>; [(1937) 59 CLR 467], at pp 486-487, 501; Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling [(1968) 88
WN 270], at p 280). It is, however, unnecessary to pursue that particular question here since, putting to one side s.6 of the Summary
Jurisdiction Act to which detailed reference is subsequently made, it is not suggested that Yeldham J. was in error in holding that such of those legislative provisions which might have operated to cure the defect in the information in the present case were not applicable in respect of an information laid before, or to proceedings in, the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction. That being so, the common law requirement remains that an information must at the least condescend to identifying the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence."  
Their Honours went on to analyse the information in question, holding that the information failed to specify the manner of the appellant's acts or omissions or to provide fair information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence charged. The information was accordingly defective and insufficient to found the proceedings against the appellant.  In Ex parte Ryan; re Johnson <case>; [1943 44 SR 12] Jordan CJ said (at 16) -  "The person accused is entitled to sufficient particulars of the matter charged against him to enable him to meet the charge. Hence, in earlier times, it was repeatedly held that to follow the words of the statute in alleging the offence in the information was not necessarily sufficient. 'Where a particular act constitutes the offence, it may be enough to describe it in the words of the Legislature; but where the Legislature speaks in general terms, the information must state what act in particular was done by the party offending to enable him to meet the charge': R versus James (1784) Caldecott 458 at 461. In many cases it was open to doubt whether it was necessary to add particulars to the language of the statute in framing the information...and this led to its being expressly enacted that 'the description of any offence in the words of the act...shall be sufficient in law.' ([Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), [s145A(1)...](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s145a.html)"  
It will be seen that, although the information adverted to breach of paragraph
C(1)(a) of the Administration Act by failure to furnish a return required under s162 of the Assessment Act, the information is not in the words of the statute, which refers specifically to an approved form. The defendant, therefore, cannot call in aid [s11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s11.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) (which replaces [s145A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s145a.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/)).  The plaintiff submits that it was essential that the prosecution should allege that he had failed to furnish an approved form and prove that the
Commissioner had approved in writing the taxation return forms which he was required to furnish. The defendant submits that the only form required to be furnished is an approved form and, consequently, the phrase "you failed to furnish a return...as required pursuant to...section 162 of the [Income Tax
Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/)" is the effective equivalent in meaning of "failed to furnish an approved form". The notice itself required the plaintiff to furnish returns in the "approved form", although the particular in the information stated that he had been required "to furnish...a return...on the appropriate form" (emphasis added), the plaintiff pointing out, however, that although the form was appropriate, it also needed to be approved. The defendant's riposte is that the only possible meaning of "appropriate" in the context was "approved", since the form could not be appropriate if it had not been approved. Moreover, the allegation of failure in the particulars was: "(v) you failed to furnish a return in compliance with the notice to the extent that you were capable of doing so". It is submitted that this made it perfectly clear that the failure was to furnish the approved form, since this was the form required in terms by the notice. As the passage quoted above from John L (supra) says, the information "must identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence". In the present circumstances the plaintiff's alleged failure to provide the returns in the approved form was such an essential factual ingredient. This was not expressly alleged but was it "identified" by reference to s162 of the Assessment Act and para 8C(1)(a) of the
Administration Act. In John L, no reference to the offence provision could have given the necessary information. Although I have found the matter difficult to determine, in the end I have concluded that it was permissible to identify the critical element of failing to furnish an approved form by reference to the sections that unmistakeably stated this requirement.  It will be seen that these arguments do not deal with the connected and, in some ways, more fundamental problem identified by the plaintiff. In order to show a failure to comply with the requirement, it was necessary to prove that the relevant forms had, indeed, been approved by the Commissioner. Indeed, it was not argued before me on behalf of the Commissioner that it was not necessary to do so. The fact of such approval was, in my opinion, an essential ingredient of the charge. Although it seems likely that the person who drafted the information did not advert to the problem, the language of particular (v), which states the omission giving rise to the offence, implicitly does so in its concluding words. In my opinion, the information would not have been sufficient even if the word "approved" had appeared to describe the required return: it was necessary also to allege the Commissioner's approval of the requisite form in accordance with the statutory requirement set out in s388-50 of the Administration Act.  It follows that I consider that the information was void as failing to contain an essential ingredient of the offences. I point out that it seems obvious that no attention whatever was given in the conduct of the case to the requirement to prove the Commissioner's approval of the demanded returns. This highlights, to my mind, that it was necessary that the information should explicitly refer to this element.  In the event that the information was not defective, the plaintiff submits that no evidence was adduced as to the existence of any approved forms as defined by the Administration Act and that the convictions, accordingly, cannot stand. Certainly there was no explicit evidence of any approval.
Counsel for the Commissioner points to a number of matters which, in his submission, amount to some evidence of the existence of the relevant approved form. First, there is the final notice to the plaintiff which was itself tendered. That document, after noting that there was no record of lodgement by the plaintiff of income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 1982 to 30
June 2001 inclusive, required the plaintiff to furnish the "income tax returns" for those years by 3 April 2002 and specifying that the returns must "be in the approved form signed by you". The purpose of tendering the final notice was, of course, to prove the communication of the Commissioner's requirement under s162 of the Assessment Act. Although it may be that evidence tendered for one purpose may be used for all purposes in the case, I do not think that the specification of a requirement that a return must be in the approved form is evidence that such a form was in fact approved as required.
Secondly, reference was also made to the averment that the plaintiff "failed to furnish a tax return...as required pursuant to...s162" of the Assessment
Act and it was submitted that this implicitly averred the existence of the relevant approved form. Section 8ZL of the Administration Act, provides that (subject to irrelevant exceptions) an averment constitutes prima facie evidence of the fact averred. In my opinion, averments capable of being regarded as constituting prima facie evidence of any fact under s8ZL of the
Administration Act must expressly do so; an implicit averment is a contradiction in terms. Thirdly, counsel for the Commissioner referred to a number of statements by the plaintiff and his accountant in the proceedings that accepted the obligation to provide taxation returns as required. It was submitted that these statements amounted to implicit admissions of the existence of an approved form. Certainly, they amount to implicit admissions of a belief that the returns were an approved form, but I do not think that this, in the circumstances here, is equivalent in any relevant sense to an admission that, indeed, such forms were approved. Lastly, it is pointed out that no issue was ever raised as to whether the forms had been approved.
However, I do not see how this can overcome the failure of proof of an essential ingredient of the charge. Accordingly, I accept the submission that there was no evidence adduced that approved forms existed, still less that the forms required by the Commissioner were approved forms.  The defendant sought to deflect the significance of this conclusion by submitting that mere lack of evidence of an element of an offence was an error made within jurisdiction and accordingly, was not an error of which this Court could take cognisance by virtue of [s146](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), which provides -  "No conviction or order of a Justice...or adjudication upon appeal of the
District Court shall be removed by any order into the Supreme Court."  In DPP versus Cassell [(1995) 80 A Crim R 160] the prosecutor appealed to the Court of Appeal from the refusal of a District
Court judge to state a case following an unsuccessful appeal from a magistrate to the District Court. The question arose whether the judge's error (as error it was) was outside the court's jurisdiction. Kirby P (with whom on this point
Priestley and Powell JJA agreed) said [(80 A Crim R 160] at 167) -  "[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) provides:  'No certiorari 
No conviction or order of a Justice...or adjudication upon appeal of the
District Court shall be removed by any order into the Supreme Court.'  
The general object of this section is to prohibit the grant of relief in the nature of the prerogative writs directed by this Court to the District Court.
However, it has long been established that an order made without jurisdiction, or in excess of jurisdiction, does not fall within the prohibition stated in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html)
See Ex parte Blackwell; Re Hateley (1965) 83 WN [(Pt )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s1.html) [109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s109.html);
A-G versus Dawes [[1976] 1 NSWLR 242] at 245. A distinction has been drawn in the cases between those circumstances where the judicial officer has wrongly exercised jurisdiction and where there is, in substance, a failure, or refusal, to exercise jurisdiction. In respect of the former, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s146.html) operates to prohibit relief from this Court. But not in respect of the latter."  In Craig versus South Australia <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 163], the Court said (at 177-178) -  "An inferior court falls into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises that jurisdiction does exist. Such jurisdictional error can infect either a positive act or a refusal or failure to act. Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of the writ where it makes an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise, jurisdiction) which is based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits of jurisdiction.  
Jurisdictional error is at its most obvious where the inferior court purports to act wholly or partly outside the general area of its jurisdiction in the sense of entertaining a matter or making a decision or order of a kind which wholly or partly lies outside the theoretical limits of its functions and powers. An inferior court would, for example, act wholly outside the general area of its jurisdiction in that sense if, having jurisdiction strictly limited to civil matters, it purported to hear and determine a criminal charge. Such a court would act partly outside the general area of its jurisdiction if, in a matter coming within the categories of civil cases which it had authority to hear and determine, it purported to make an order of a kind which it lacked power to make, such as an order for specific performance of a contract when its remedial powers were strictly limited to awarding damages for breach. Less obviously, an inferior court can, while acting wholly within the general area of its jurisdiction, fall into jurisdictional error by doing something which it lacks authority to do. If, for example, it is an essential condition of the existence of jurisdiction with respect to a particular matter that a certain event or requirement has in fact occurred or been satisfied, as distinct from the inferior court's own conclusion that it has, there will be jurisdictional error if the court or tribunal purports to act in circumstances where that event has not in fact occurred or that requirement has not in fact been satisfied even though the matter is the kind of matter which the court has jurisdiction to entertain. Similarly, jurisdictional error will occur where an inferior court disregards or takes account of some matter in circumstances where the statute or other instrument establishing it and conferring its jurisdiction requires that that particular matter be taken into account or ignored as a pre-condition of the existence of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of the particular case. [Emphasis added.] Again, an inferior court will exceed its authority and fall into jurisdictional error if it misconstrues that statute or other instrument and thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case. In the last-mentioned category of case, the line between jurisdictional error and mere error in the exercise of jurisdiction may be particularly difficult to discern (See, eg, R versus Dunphy;
Ex parte Maynes <case>; [(1978) 139 CLR 482]; R versus Gray; Ex parte Marsh <case>; [(1985) 157 CLR 351] at 371; Public Service Association (SA) versus Federated Clerks'
Union <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 132.)]  ...  [at 179-180] In contrast [with administrative tribunals or authorities], the ordinary jurisdiction of a court of law encompasses authority to decide questions of law, as well as questions of fact, involved in matters which it has jurisdiction to determine. The identification of relevant issues, the formulation of relevant questions and the determination of what is and what is not relevant evidence are all routine steps in the discharge of that ordinary jurisdiction. Demonstrable mistake in the identification of such issues or the formulation of such questions will commonly involve error of law which may, if an appeal is available and is pursued, be corrected by an appellate court and, depending on the circumstances, found an order setting aside the order or decision of the inferior court. Such a mistake on the part of an inferior court entrusted with authority to identify, formulate and determine such issues and questions will not, however, ordinarily constitute jurisdictional error. Similarly, a failure by an inferior court to take into account some matter which it was, as a matter of law, required to take into account in determining a question within jurisdiction or reliance by such a court upon some irrelevant matter upon which it was, as a matter of law, not entitled to rely in determining such a question will not ordinarily involve jurisdictional error."  Of course, a court cannot convict a defendant unless satisfied to the appropriate standard of his or her guilt but the question whether the evidence justified such a conclusion is, as it seems to me, within the court's jurisdiction to determine and certiorari will not lie even if inadmissible evidence is taken into account or an inference drawn which is prohibited by law: see also Yisrael versus District Court of NSW [(1996) 87 A Crim R 63.]
However, the absence of any evidence as to an element of an offence seems to me to be an altogether different matter. I consider that, although sufficiency of evidence to convict is within the jurisdiction of the District Court to determine and, even if it is mistaken about this, certiorari will not lie, there is no jurisdiction to convict in the absence of any evidence of a necessary ingredient of an offence. Applying the tests set out in the italicised passages above from Craig, I consider that it is crucial to a conviction under s8C(1)(a) of the Administration Act that in fact the taxation returns required have been approved in writing by the Commissioner. It seems to me indisputable that the learned District Court judge did not consider, let alone determine, this question, obviously because the parties did not litigate the issue before him. However, the matter was an essential element to be proved, else the plaintiff was under no obligation to satisfy the notice specifying the Commissioner's requirement. I readily appreciate the extremely technical nature of the requirement but I cannot see how a line can be drawn between those cases where there was no evidence of one "technical" element of an offence and those where there was no evidence of any element of an offence.  Accordingly, I conclude that the failure by the prosecution to adduce any evidence of the existence of an approved form means not only that the conviction of the plaintiff was not warranted in law but that the District
Court had no jurisdiction to convict him in that event.  I should mention, because it might become relevant in the event of a further prosecution of the plaintiff, that - contrary to his submission - I consider that each failure to provide the particular approved return as required constitutes a separate offence.  The plaintiff's convictions must therefore be quashed.
