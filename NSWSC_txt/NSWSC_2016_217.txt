JUDGMENT
These are proceedings for a restraining order under [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth). That section provides that a Court must order that property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with if the requirements of the section are satisfied.
The first requirement is that the application be made by a proceeds of crime authority. The application in the present case is made by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and that entity is a proceeds of crime authority. The second requirement is that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or are an instrument of a serious offence. The section provides, as an associated requirement that, the application for the restraining order must be supported by an affidavit of the authorised officer stating that officer suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence or, if the offence is a serious offence, the property is an instrument of the offence. That affidavit must include the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion and the Court must be satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.
I have read the affidavit of Anthony Hall affirmed 17 December 2015. Mr Hall is an authorised officer of the Australian Federal Police within the meaning of [s 338.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s338.html) I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence under [s 19(1)(d)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the Act or an instrument of a serious offence under [s 19(1)(d)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the Act. The offence concerned is an offence under <case>.9(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), being an offence of dealing with money that is reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime and, at the time of dealing, the value of the money is $AUD100,000 or more. That offence is both an indictable offence and a serious offence for the purposes of the Act. I am satisfied from the information that is set out in Mr Hall's affidavit and the documents which form exhibit AH1 to that document that the suspicion held by Mr Hall is a reasonable one.
Section 26 requires the giving of written notice to the owner of the property or to other persons whom the Commissioner reasonably believes may have an interest in the property. The three interested persons in this matter are Muhammad Kamran, Abdul Rehman and Brent Pickavance. I am satisfied from the affidavit evidence that notice has been given to those three persons.
Mr Pickavance has appeared this morning. He has sought an adjournment in the matter for one week. His solicitor requested him to do so so that consent orders could be prepared in the matter. There does not appear to be any opposition from any person to the making of the restraining orders.
No purpose would be achieved by adjourning the proceedings for one week so that a consent order could be made which, in any event, will concern one only of the interested persons. It will still be necessary for the Court to satisfy itself under <case>, at least, in respect of the other interested persons. For that reason, I decline to adjourn the proceedings.
I am satisfied that the requirements of <case> have been established. I note that the usual undertaking as to damages is given on behalf of the applicant I make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the short minutes of order. I stand the proceedings over before the Registrar to 16 June at 9.00am, liberty to restore on three days' notice and I direct the orders be entered forthwith.
