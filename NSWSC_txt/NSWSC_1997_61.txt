REGINA versus Geoffrey Arthur HALL /96 February 1997 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
HUNT CJ at CL, STUDDERT J, SIMPSON J 
CATCHWORDS: Criminal law and procedure - Complaint in sexual cases - admissibility of evidence of complaint pursuant to the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) - [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html), [102](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) - Regina versus David Christopher Skuse (CCA, 24 October 1996, unreported).

RESULT: Appeal allowed and judgment of acquittal entered 
The appellant was charged with a number of sexual assaults upon a young girl aged at the time between three and a half and five and a half years. She was seven and a half years old at the time of trial. She had been living with her mother and the appellant (who was not her father) at the time when the offences were alleged to have been committed, but she said that her mother was not at home when they occurred.

The complainant was unable to identify even the year in which each offence was alleged to have been committed. Her account of each offence was of the most basic nature, without any detail. She had given different versions to different people which were inconsistent with her evidence on important issues. She gave no reason for the delay in making any complaint in relation to the alleged offences. Her evidence was uncorroborated. The complainant had been the subject of an acrimonious custody dispute between her parents. The appellant gave evidence on oath denying each of the offences. There were no apparent inconsistencies or unsatisfactory features in his evidence.

Held (1) The verdicts of guilty were unsafe and unsatisfactory.

Discussion of the basis upon which evidence of complaint is admissible in accordance with the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Regina versus David Christopher Skuse (CCA, 25 October 1996, unreported) referred to 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ at CL: I agree with the reasons given by Studdert J for the orders made by this Court at the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, when the convictions were quashed and a judgment of acquittal was entered.

One of the grounds of appeal which was argued was that evidence of the complaint made by the complainant was inadmissible. The submissions in relation to the admissibility under the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) of complaint in a sexual assault case were extensive - more extensive than had previously been made to me - and it has become apparent to me that previous statements made by me on this topic require some revision.

The common law did not permit the admission of out of court statements made by a witness in order to prove the truth of what was said unless it was part of the res gestae (and thus an exception to the hearsay rule).[1] The boundaries of that exception were stretched slightly by the advice of the
Privy Council in Ratten versus The Queen,2 and a little further by the decision of the House of Lords in The Queen versus Andrews.3 But the common law always recognized the admissibility of such statements where they were not tendered in order to prove the truth of what was said and where the relevance was merely the fact that the statement had been made.[4] An example is the admissibility of previous statements in order to rebut the suggestion of recent invention,[5] but even then the out of court statement was not evidence of the truth of the facts stated.[6] 
Evidence of complaint in a sexual assault case was also admissible, but the historical origins of the rule permitting such evidence to be given was not the same.[7] It, too, was not admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said; rather, it was admitted as evidence going to the complainant's credit as a witness.[8] Such evidence was seen as strengthening that credit,[9] upon the basis that such a complaint made at the earliest reasonable opportunity is conduct which might be expected of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted.[10] That such evidence was relevant only to the complainant's credit and not to a fact in issue was emphasized by the decision of the High
Court in Ugle versus The Queen[11] that evidence of complaint was not admissible unless the complainant herself was called as a witness.

The requirement that the complaint be made at the earliest reasonable opportunity was interpreted with some flexibility. The conduct of the victim of a sexual assault cannot be viewed from some purely objective standard if her credit is to be considered by reference to that conduct. For example, it was not expected of a truthful child victim that a complaint would be made about something which, by reason of her youth, the victim did not know was such as to give her cause for grievance, so that a complaint made only when the victim became aware of the wrongfulness of what had been done to her was (subject to discretionary considerations) still admissible.[12] 
This Court has recently had to deal with the effect of evidence of complaint, once admitted, under the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). In Regina v David Christopher Skuse,13 the appellant argued that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury that such evidence did not establish the truth of the complaint. McInerney J, with whose reasons for judgment I agreed, held that, although the evidence was admitted (without objection) in order to show the consistency of the victim's conduct (and thus her credit), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) operated to make it evidence of the truth of what was said,[14] so that the absence of such a direction at the trial had not been an error. That ruling assumed that the evidence of complaint was still admissible for the same purpose as it was under the common law. It had not been suggested otherwise either at the trial or in argument on the appeal.

In Regina versus Brian John Welsh,15 there was a detailed examination as to the operation of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) That case concerned the effect of evidence of the history given to a doctor. In my judgment, I said that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) refers to evidence of a statement made out of court which is admissible not in order to prove the truth of what was said but only to prove the fact that the statement was made, and that the effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) is that, once the evidence is admitted for that other purpose, it now becomes evidence which does establish the truth of what was said, subject to the power of the trial judge pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) to limit its use in that way where there is a danger that such use might be unfairly prejudicial to a party or misleading or confusing, or to exclude it completely pursuant to either [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) or [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html)[16]
In order to illustrate such an operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html), I pointed out that, contrary to the common law,[17] a prior inconsistent statement now becomes evidence of the truth of what was said, and I went on to hold that the history given to a doctor upon which the doctor's expert opinion is based is now, contrary (with some exceptions) to the common law,[18] evidence of the truth of that history. What is of present concern, however, is that another example which I gave of the operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) was evidence of complaint in sexual cases, citing as authority the earlier decision in Regina versus David Christopher Skuse.

As I say, those statements proceeded upon the assumption (by all concerned) that evidence of complaint remained admissible under the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) only upon the issue of the consistency of the victim's conduct (and thus her credit).
The submissions in the present case have satisfied me that that assumption was wrong. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) of the Act provides that evidence which is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible. [Part .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the Act provides a number of exceptions to the credibility rule, as it is known,[19] but none of those exceptions would permit evidence of complaint to be given in the way it was previously given. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s108.html) (3) would permit the prior consistent statement to be given in re-examination in order to rebut any suggestion of fabrication or reconstruction.[20] Otherwise, evidence of complaint is no longer admissible upon the basis that it goes only to the credit of the complainant. It may, however, be admissible as "first hand" hearsay pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) and thus directly as evidence of the truth of what was said.

The framework of the Act is that evidence which is relevant in a proceeding is admissible unless otherwise provided in the Act.[21] It is relevant where, if accepted, it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.[22] That expression is very much wider than the common law distinction between evidence which is relevant to a fact in issue and that which is relevant only to credit. It includes both common law categories.[23] No distinction is drawn for the purposes of such assessment between hearsay and direct evidence. Hearsay is defined as evidence of a previous representation made by a person (otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceedings in which evidence of that representation is sought to be adduced), and the "hearsay rule" is stated as being that hearsay is not admissible in order to prove the existence of a fact which that person intended to assert by the representation.[24] Various sections, including [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html), go on to provide exceptions to the hearsay rule. The effect is that, once such hearsay evidence is admitted, it may establish the truth of what was said - subject to the power of the trial judge either to exclude it[25] or to limit its use.[26] [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation - where it was made by a person who has been, or is to be, called to give evidence - as to what that person saw or otherwise perceived if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in that person's memory. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s62.html) provides that the representation must have been made by someone who had personal knowledge of the fact asserted - for example, by having seen or otherwise perceived what is asserted to have happened.

The phrase "fresh in the memory" used in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) is used also in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s64.html), which deals with the admissibility of "first hand" hearsay in civil proceedings where the maker of the representation is available to give evidence in a similar (but not identical) way as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) does in relation to criminal proceedings, and in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s32.html), which deals with a witness reviving his or her memory from a document in which the witness had recorded the relevant events when they were fresh in his or her memory. Freshness was one test stated at common law in relation to a witness refreshing his or her memory from a statement made.[27] It is a flexible test and, as the cases make it clear, it does not require strict contemporaneity. What it requires is that the witness's memory was fresh at the time when the statement was made.

Mr Odgers, in his text book "Uniform Evidence Law" (1995), and on the basis of research recorded by the Law Reform Commission,[28] has suggested that an event cannot be "fresh" in the memory more than twentyfour hours after it occurs.[29] I have read the results of that research with interest. I accept that memory of such things as the precise words used in conversations, and of the sequence of a number of events, becomes the more unreliable the longer that time passes. That is (with respect) a matter of common sense and common experience. But, as that research acknowledges,[30] the rate at which memory is lost varies according to the nature of what it is which is sought to be remembered. A memory of a single event is unlikely to become unreliable after twentyfour hours if it took place in circumstances which impressed it into the witness's memory. The test is, in my view (and with respect), somewhat more flexible in application than Mr Odgers has suggested. It is unnecessary in the present case to explore just how flexible it is, because a judgment of acquittal has been entered in favour of the appellant so that there will be no new trial. What is important to emphasize is that the test is different to that which was applied at common law in relation to evidence of complaint.

Once the evidence of complaint is admissible pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html), it therefore becomes evidence of the truth of what was said, subject to the power of the trial judge to limit its use. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) has no operation, because the credibility rule applies solely where the evidence is relevant only to the witness's credibility,[31] and the evidence of complaint now becomes relevant also to prove the truth of what was said.

I should refer to part of an argument put by the Crown, if only in order to prevent it being repeated. It was submitted that the effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) has been to enlarge the concept of a fact in issue to include facts relevant only to credit. The section is in the following terms: "55. (1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to: the credibility of a witness; or the admissibility of other evidence; or a failure to adduce evidence." 
I repeat that the section does not adopt the common law distinction between facts relevant to a fact in issue and facts relevant to credit. The words "the assessment of the probability of the existence of" are important. They include facts relevant only to credit (which are relevant because they affect the weight of the evidence given), and this was deliberate.[32] The Crown had put this argument as one step in its submission that evidence of complaint is still admissible as at common law as being relevant only to the complainant's credit, without the restrictions imposed by [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) It follows that that submission must be rejected.

It remains necessary only to say that this revision of my views concerning evidence of complaint under the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) has no effect upon the decisions reached by this Court in either Skuse or
Welsh. In the former case, no objection had been taken to the admissibility of the complaint, it complied with the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html), and the conclusion that the evidence of that complaint was evidence of the truth of that complaint is the same whether [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) or [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) applies. In the latter case, the statement was only one of the examples given of the operation of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) It had no bearing upon the effect of the evidence of the history given to the doctor.

STUDDERT J: The appeal in this matter was fully argued on 19 December 1996 and on that date the appeal was allowed, the appellant's conviction on each count was quashed and in lieu thereof a judgment of acquittal was entered.

The Court reached this decision on the ground that the verdict of the jury on each count was unsafe and unsatisfactory for reasons to be stated in due course.

I now express my reasons for that decision.

The appellant stood trial in the District Court charged with three sexual offences allegedly committed on a young girl who was born on 9 November 1988.
The indictment as originally presented alleged the commission of offences between 9 November 1993 and 1 July 1994 but an amendment was allowed at the trial to extend the period from 1 June 1992 to 1 July 1994. So it was that the offences charged allegedly took place when the complainant was aged between three years six months and five years six months.

The first count charged the appellant with an offence under <case> of the
Crimes Act, namely of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years. The second count charged the appellant with an offence under <case> of the statute, namely an offence of attempted sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years. The third count charged the appellant with an offence under <case> of the Crimes Act, namely of an assault with act of indecency upon a child then under the age of sixteen years.

The jury at the conclusion of the trial on 29 May 1996 found the appellant guilty on all three charges. On 1 August 1996 the appellant was sentenced on the first and second counts to concurrent sentences of four years comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of one year with the minimum term to commence on the date of sentence. On the third count the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of two years penal servitude commencing on the date of sentence.

The appellant appealed against his convictions and sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.

It is appropriate to outline the case for the prosecution.

The complainant's mother lived in the same house as the appellant, between 10
June 1992 and August 1994, having earlier separated from the complainant's father. Following that separation the complainant's father had custody until the mother was successful in obtaining custody in proceedings in the Family
Court. As a result of those proceedings the complainant lived with her mother and the appellant on a full time basis from May 1993 but the complainant's father had access from time to time. It is to be observed that the period during which the offences were allegedly committed corresponds with the period that the complainant's mother lived with the appellant.

The prosecution case depended heavily upon the evidence of the complainant.
Indeed her evidence was uncorroborated. According to her, each of the offences was committed at a time when she was alone with the appellant in his house. In relation to the first count, the Crown relied upon evidence the complainant gave of an act of cunnilingus committed on her by the appellant. In relation to the second count, the Crown relied upon evidence the complainant gave that the appellant endeavoured to make her suck his penis. In relation to the third count, the complainant gave evidence that the appellant placed his penis near her vagina.

The complainant was not able to say when any of these offences was committed.
Not even a year was specified.

The appellant gave evidence denying each of the offences charged.

A number of grounds of appeal were argued, but the earlier grounds of appeal if successful would only have called for an order for a new trial, and in these circumstances I do not propose to address these earlier grounds, except for ground 1. Otherwise I propose to limit these reasons to consideration of the ground that the verdict on each count was unsafe and unsatisfactory.

Ground 1 was that the trial judge erred when he admitted evidence of complaint made to the father of the complainant. Since the admission of such evidence only added to the material rendering the convictions unsafe and unsatisfactory, it is unnecessary to determine whether the trial judge here erred in admitting the evidence of complaint. However Hunt CJ at CL in his judgment, which I have had the opportunity of reading, has considered the provisions of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) as they bear upon admissibility of evidence of complaint. I wish to express my respectful agreement with the conclusions his Honour has reached as to the means by which evidence of complaint may now be admissible, and as to its evidentiary effect once admitted.

I now move to the ground that the convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory.

The principles upon which the Court must act in considering this ground are well settled: see M versus The Queen [(1994) 181 CLR 487] and R v
McKnoulty [(1994) 77 A Crim R 333.] 
It is, of course, for the appellant to persuade this Court that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to his guilt. In
McKnoulty it was stated (at p 338) that: "(1) In most cases, a (reasonable) doubt experienced by an appellate court, after making its own independent assessment of both the sufficiency and the quality of the evidence, will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.

It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving such a doubt experienced by that appellate court that it may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred - that is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, the reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced.

If, from the record itself, the evidence contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the appellate court to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence." 
In considering the evidence of the complainant I assess it as being vague, and confused, and as containing many inconsistencies.

In the complainant's evidence in chief she was not able to say when any of these offences were committed; nor was she able to recall any conversation at the time of any one of the offences; nor did she give any description as to the circumstances in which any of the offences was committed; she was unable to give the sequence in which the offences were committed; and she was unable to say whether any of these offences was committed whilst she was going to school. The complainant could not say when it was that she told her father about them in relation to the dates of the occurrences. She was unable to say whether the offences occurred in the day time or at night. She was unable to relate the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences. For instance, in relation to the first offence charged, that is the cunnilingus, she was unable to say what she was wearing and whether she had underclothing on and if so what, if anything, the appellant did with it. In relation to the second count, her evidence shifted between the appellant inserting his penis in her mouth, and her keeping her mouth closed to prevent entry.

In relation to the first count the complainant gave the following evidence in chief: "Q. Now you said that you're here to tell us about something or someone did something wrong to you. Can you tell us what it was that was wrong? What happened? 
A. He licked my wee-wee.
 
Q. Who licked your wee-wee? 
A. [The appellant].
 
Q. What do you use your wee-wee for [complainant]? 
A. To go to the toilet.
 ...
 
Q. What room were you in when he licked your wee-wee? 
A. My room." 
Later: "Q. Can you remember what you were wearing when he licked you on the wee- wee? 
A. No.
 
Q. Did you have clothes on? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did he touch your clothes? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did you have underpants on on that day he licked your wee-wee? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did he do anything with your underpants? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did you have them on when he licked you on the wee-wee? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Do you know whether or not he moved them at all? 
A. I don't know." 
Then in cross examination: "Q. When he licked your wee wee in your bedroom whereabouts were you in your bedroom? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Do you remember what part of the bedroom you were in? 
A. No.
 
Q. Your bedroom has got a bed in it? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Where you anywhere near the bed? 
A. I beg your pardon? 
Q. Were you anywhere near the bed [complainant]? 
A. I don't know." 
In relation to the second count, the complainant gave the following evidence in chief: "Q. Did he do anything else that you can remember today? 
A. Suck his penis.
 
Q. I want you to tell us what happened about that [complainant]? (No verbal reply) 
Q. What did he do? 
A. He made me suck his penis.
 
Q. And did you suck it? 
A. He just forced me.
 
Q. And how did he force you? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did he touch you when he forced you? 
A. I don't understand you.
 
Q. Well you've said he forced you to suck his penis. Is that right? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did he touch you when he forced you to suck his penis? 
A. No.
 
Q. Did you suck his penis? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Do you understand my question? 
A. No.
 
Q. What room were you in when he tried - when he forced you to suck his penis [complainant]? 
A. The kitchen." 
And later: "Q. Did he touch your mouth with his penis? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Now you understand I'm still talking about the time in the kitchen. Do you understand that? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. What did he do with his penis in the kitchen that time? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did you see his penis on that time? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. What was he doing with it when you saw it? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did he say anything to you on that time in the kitchen? 
A. I don't know." 
The complainant was asked further questions about this incident and gave further answers as follows: "Q. What about the time I think you said he forced you to suck his penis, can you remember how long that went on for? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did he put his penis in your mouth on that time [complainant]? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. I think you said that happened in the kitchen? 
A. Mm.
 
Q. What were you doing when he did that? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Did you have your mouth open or closed? 
A. Closed.
 
Q. Did you keep it closed? 
A. Yes." 
In cross examination: "Q. Whereabouts in the kitchen were you [complainant] when that happened? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Where you sitting down somewhere? 
A. No.
 
Q. Whereabouts were you? 
A. I don't know.
 ...
 
Q. When you were telling us about the time in the kitchen when he forced you to suck his penis. When you were first asked the question about that [complainant] you told us that you didn't know whether or not you actually sucked his penis. Do you remember saying that? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Well did you suck his penis or didn't you suck his penis? 
A. He forced me.
 
Q. You did suck his penis then? (No verbal reply) 
Q. You didn't suck, you didn't? (No verbal reply) 
Q. You told us that he put his penis in your mouth [complainant]. Did that happen or not? 
A. I don't understand you.
 
Q. Did [appellant] put his penis into your mouth when you were in the kitchen? 
A. I don't know.
 
In relation to the third count, the complainant gave evidence as follows: "Q. And I think you said before he "touched" your rude part. Is that right? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Tell us what you remember about that please [complainant]? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. What did he touch it with? 
A. With his doodle.
 ...
 
Q. Where did that happen? 
A. Brenan Street.
 
Q. Can you remember what room of the house at Brenan Street? 
A. No." 
In cross examination: "Q. You said to us that your rude part is your wee wee? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Did he put his penis on the outside of your rude part? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. Are you sure he put his penis near your rude part? 
A. I don't know.
 
Q. So you're not sure if he touched your wee wee with his penis or not is that right? 
A. Yes.
 ...
 
Q. Did he put his penis near your wee wee or not [complainant]? 
A. I don't remember.
 
Q. Why did you tell us before that he did. Do you know why you told us before that he did? 
A. No." 
The complainant also gave evidence of other impropriety, being a second occasion when the appellant "licked my wee wee again" this time "behind the shop", an occasion when he wiped her vaginal area with a wet washer and an occasion when he gave her a "sloppy" kiss.

Not only was the complainant's evidence unsatisfactory in the ways I earlier indicated, and as illustrated by the above extracts from her evidence, but, according to other witnesses called, the complainant gave inconsistent descriptions of the appellant's sexual misbehaviour to those to whom she spoke about it. The descriptions which the witnesses recounted differed from the complainant's evidence at the trial and, moreover, the accounts that the complainant gave to those witnesses also differed significantly from witness to witness. Cross examination of the complainant disclosed no satisfactory explanation for those various inconsistencies. The witnesses in point were the complainant's father, Constable Hall, Mrs Griffiths and Detective Grosvenor.

The complaint by the complainant to her father 
According to her father the complainant identified three acts of sexual misconduct when she spoke to him on 3 July 1994: attempted cunnilingus; an attempt to force an act of fellatio; the use of a washer on her vagina.

The complaint to Constable Hall 
The complainant's father took his daughter to the police station on the evening of 3 July 1994, his daughter having informed him of the misconduct complained of earlier that day. To Constable Hall the complainant complained of an act of cunnilingus, as opposed to an attempt to perform such an act, and she also complained of an attempt by the appellant to force an act of fellatio. She complained to that officer of no other sexual misconduct.

The complaint to Mrs Griffiths 
Mrs Griffiths was the district officer with the Department of Community
Services and she interviewed the complainant on 11 July 1994. According to the district officer, the complainant told her that the appellant had performed an act of cunnilingus but whilst the complainant had spoken of that episode occurring in her bedroom in her sworn evidence, the district officer was informed by the complainant that this offence occurred when the complainant was sitting on a bean bag which the evidence located as being in the loungeroom. The district officer gave no evidence of any other complaints of sexual misconduct being made; indeed her evidence was that she asked the complainant whether the appellant had touched her at any other time, and the response was in the negative.

The complaint to Detective Grosvenor 
Having interviewed the complainant in September 1994, Det Senior Constable
Grosvenor then interviewed the appellant and alerted him to the following allegations by that time made by the complainant: an attempt to make her perform an act of fellatio; cunnilingus; touching her on the bottom; placing his penis between her buttocks.

In addition to the above variations in the substance of the complaints made by the complainant, it is to be noted that: whilst the complainant said that she complained to her father about all the matters about which she gave evidence, the father's evidence was otherwise; further, according to the father's evidence, the complainant told him that she informed her mother about the appellant's misconduct and her mother reacted by punching the appellant on the face. Yet the complainant in her evidence said that she did not tell her mother about what had been done to her, and her mother gave no evidence at the trial that her daughter had complained of the appellant's behaviour; 
Constable Hall also said that the complainant told her she had informed her mother as to what had happened; the complainant said in evidence that she had told Mrs Griffiths about four incidents of misconduct, contrary to the evidence of Mrs Griffiths as reviewed above.

The Crown submitted that when assessing the complainant's evidence, allowance should be made for her age and the difficulties of expression that must inevitably accompany her tender years. It was further submitted that inconsistencies and lack of detail in her evidence were understandable.
However, as was emphasised in McKnoulty (supra) this Court is obliged to make its own assessment of "both the sufficiency and the quality" of the evidence in the case. Having made this assessment I entertain doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.

There are other features to which I should refer. It is obvious from a reading of the transcript that the complainant had been the subject of an acrimonious custody dispute, and that allegations of misconduct by her father towards the complainant had been made by the complainant's mother. Because of the perception entertained at the trial as to the effect of <case> of the Crimes
Act, in my view erroneously entertained, the detail of such allegations was not further explored and the jury was left with a less than adequate picture of this important background feature in the case. Nevertheless the existence of the background dispute cannot be ignored when assessing the evidence of a child so young.

Moreover, although the complainant was vague about when the events complained of occurred, she did give evidence that she waited a long time before she told anyone what had happened to her, and when asked to do so, gave no explanation for the delay. The complainant explained her failure to complain to Mrs
Griffiths before she told her father on the basis that she was "too scared", but the complainant apparently did not tell her mother either, even though living with her continually from May 1993. No satisfactory reason for this emerges from the evidence.

As <case> of the Crimes Act recognises, there may be good reasons for delay in making complaint in cases involving sexual offences, particularly where the victim is a young child living under the same roof as the offender. The delay may be explained, for instance, by a fear of the consequences of the complaint, or a lack of appreciation of the wrongfulness of the conduct of the offender. Nevertheless whilst recognising that good reason may exist for delay, in the circumstances of the present case and having regard to the evidence before the court, delay in complaint is to my mind a troublesome feature here.

The appellant denied the offences when he was interviewed by the police and he denied them under oath at the trial. There are no apparent inconsistencies or other unsatisfactory features in his evidence that emerge from a reading of the transcript of the account he gave to the jury.

This Court must recognise the obvious advantage enjoyed by the jury in having seen and heard the witnesses as they gave their evidence, an advantage not enjoyed on appeal. However, making due allowance for this, the inadequacies and inconsistencies in the evidence upon which the Crown case depended were such that in my opinion the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.

It is for the above reasons that I concluded that the convictions must be quashed and a judgment of acquittal substituted.
