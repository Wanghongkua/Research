IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
PRIESTLEY JA, MEAGHER JA, SIMOS AJA 
CATCHWORDS: [Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 1983](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) - s.31, [36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) - joinder of parties to dispute - Supreme Court Rule Part 8 rule 8(1) - appealable grounds from decision of Minister - Australian Conservation Foundation Inc versus Commonwealth of Australia (1980) 146 CLR 493; Onus versus Alcoa of Australia Limited <case>; [(1981) 149 CLR 27] 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED RESERVED 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED DISMISSED 
FACTS: 
The appellant council appealed two inter-related applications from Bignold J in the Land and Environment Court. In proceedings brought under the [Aboriginal Land Rights Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) the
Tweed Byron Aboriginal Land Council appealed under [s.36(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) of the Act directly to the Land and Environment Court from decisions of the
Minister made in 1993 refusing claims under the Act. The appellant claimed standing under Australian Conservation Foundation Inc versus Commonwealth of
Australia (1980) 146 CLR 493 and Onus versus Alcoa of Australia Limited <case>; [(1981) 149 CLR 27] and made applications to: (1) join the proceedings in the
Land and Environment Court; and (2) seek declarations that the claimed lands were not "claimable Crown lands". They lost on both grounds and appealed, relying on Supreme Court Rule Part 8 rule 8(1).

HELD: 
By Meagher JA: 
Whilst there is a general rule that all interested parties should be joined in proceedings, that is not the universal rule. The [Aboriginal Land
Rights Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) decides there are only two parties to a claim, the claiming land Rights
Council and the Minister. Consequently, Supreme Court Rule Part 8 rule 8(1) is ousted by the [Aboriginal Land Rights Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/).

The appellant's application to join the proceedings also fails because the appellant: has no proprietary right; is not subject to any order against it; any intervention it may make is not necessary to obtain a result in the proceedings; and there is no suggestion that any non-proprietary right of the appellant would be affected, nor the presence of any disadvantage to the appellant. In these circumstances, there is no justification for allowing the appellant to join the proceedings.

The appellant's application for a declaration that the subject lands were not "claimable Crown Lands" fails because the determination of the Minister can only be set aside for jurisdictional error, mistake or error of law or unreasonableness, none of which were argued by the appellant.

ORDERS 
Appeal dismissed with costs.
 
JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with the reasons of Meagher JA and the observations of Simos AJA.

In my opinion the proceedings before the court should be dismissed with costs.
 
MEAGHER JA: These are two inter-related applications for leave to appeal from the judgement of Bignold J in the Land and Environment Court.

The second respondent is the Tweed Byron Local Aboriginal Land Council, which had made claims under the [Aboriginal Land Rights Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) at various times between 4 January 1988 and 27 March 1992 in respect of various parcels of land having an aggregated area of some 300 hectares situate on the coast line at Fingal in the Shire of Tweed near the New South Wales-Queensland border.

The Minister, who is first respondent here, determined the said claims between January and 1 February 1993 by refusing them. The refusal in each case was either on the ground that the land was currently being lawfully used or occupied on 9 May 1989 within the meaning of [s.36(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) of the Act, or on the ground that they were needed or likely to be needed for an essential public purpose within the meaning of that Act, or on both grounds.

The second respondent thereupon exercised its statutory right to appeal to the
Land and Environment Court under s.36(6) of the Land Rights Act. The appeals were set down for hearing on 23 October 1995, but on 6 October 1995 the Court was informed that the parties had agreed to settle the litigation on terms, inter alia, that the appeal be allowed.

This turn of events did not please the appellant Council when it came to hear of it, although it is not easy to see why. The lands are all within the Tweed
Shire Council, some parcels are "public reserves" within the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/), the Council manages yet other parcels, and it claimed (although this was disputed by the respondents) to be a trustee of yet other parcels. Two things seem clear: one is that the appellant does not claim to have any proprietary rights in any of the parcels; the other is that it is difficult to perceive any practical interest in the Council in any of the parcels, in the sense that the Council would not seem to be richer or poorer whether the appeals under [s.36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/s36.html) were allowed or not.

Nonetheless, learned counsel did concede that the appellant had, within the principles of Australian Conservation Foundation Inc versus Commonwealth of
Australia (1980) 146 CLR 493 and Onus versus Alcoa of Australia Limited <case>; [(1981) 149 CLR 27], sufficient standing for certain purposes. I am prepared to deal with the matter on that basis, although superficially at least the concession seems to me a mite generous.

When the parties to the appeals announced their intention to seek consent orders disposing of the appeals, (which were, of course, Class 3 proceedings), the appellant council sought to be joined in these appeals with a view to opposing the making of any consent orders in these appeals, and concurrently commenced Class 4 proceedings seeking declarations that the lands were not "claimable Crown Lands" within s.36(1) of the Land Rights Act. The second respondent, the Aboriginal Land Council, sought to strike out the appellant's application to be joined in the Class 3 proceedings and the appellant's Class proceedings.

The appellant lost on both questions. Hence this appeal. I should say at once that in my view his Honour was correct on both issues.

The starting point is the appellant's application to join the class 3 proceedings. His Honour Bignold J held that the [Aboriginal Land Rights
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) precluded the interference of any other party than the Aboriginal Land Council and the Minister. The Land Council makes the claim, and it is considered by the Minister (and no-one else). He grants it or refuses it. If he refuses it, the Land Council may take him on appeal to the Land and Environment Court. If the Minister (on whom the onus lies) cannot justify his refusal the Court must give the land claimed to the Land Council which claims it. The statutory scheme contained in [s.36(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html), (6) and (7) - which I have endeavoured to summarise - envisages a gladiatorial combat between two contestants, the Land Council and the
Minister, nobody else. On the appeal it is the duty of the Minister to justify his refusal: it is difficult to see any person discharging this duty other than the Minister himself. The appellant, whilst apparently accepting that it could not be, as it were one of the principal contestants, none the less could be made a party under Supreme Court Rules Part 8. rule 8(1).

That sub-rule reads as follows: "[8.8] Addition of parties "8 (1) Where a person who is not a party - ought to have been joined as a party; or is a person whose joinder as a party is necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceedings may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon, the Court, on application by him or by any party or of its own motion, may order that he be added as a party and make orders for the further conduct of the proceedings." 
There are many reasons, in my opinion, why this sub-rule does not apply in the present case. The primary one is that if, as I think, the statute provides that there are only two parties to an appeal under the Land Rights Act, the statute itself makes the sub-rule inapplicable. Whilst there is a general rule that all interested parties should be joined in proceedings: Montegomery v
Foy, Morgan & Co [[1895] 2 QB 321] at 324, John
Cooke & Co Pty Limited versus Commonwealth <case>; [(1922) 31 CLR 394] at 411, that is not a universal rule. Otherwise the rule in
Tasker versus Small (1837) 3 My and Cr 63 <case>; , [40
ER 848], would not exist. In the present case, not only is the sub-rule ousted by an Act of
Parliament, but also the appellant has no proprietary right which could be affected, no order is sought against it, its intervention could not be said to be "necessary" in order to obtain a result, and no suggestion has been made that any non-proprietary right of the appellant would be affected, or that it would suffer any disadvantage if it were not joined.

I might add that there is nothing eccentric about a party having an Onus v
Alcoa status but no right to be a party. This Court has held that a media organization has sufficient Onus versus Alcoa status to challenge a judicial order forbidding the reporting of court proceedings, but has no right to be joined as a party in the court proceedings: See John Fairfax (Group) Pty
Limited (receiver and manager appointed) versus Local Court of New South Wales [(1991) 26 NSWLR 131.] 
It follows in my view that his Honour was perfectly correct to dismiss the present appellant's attempt to be joined in the Class 3 Proceedings.

Having reached that conclusion, the appellant's failure in the Class 4 proceedings is also assured. In those proceedings it sought declarations that the parcels of land in question were not "claimable Crown lands" because they were lawfully used or occupied at the relevant date and/or were needed or were likely to be needed for an essential public purpose. But, as his Honour pointed out, these were the very questions which the Act put in the exclusive province of the first respondent to decide. Having its Onus versus Alcoa standing, the appellant could seek relief in the nature of prerogative relief if it were minded to do so, if it alleged that the Minister's (or the Court's) decision was made without justification, or was made mala fide, or was patently unreasonable, or was based on some fundamental mistake of fact or error of law. However, it was minded to do none of these things. It wished, for its own undisclosed reasons, to attack the decision by a procedure not permitted by the Act, or otherwise. Its efforts to do this should be dismissed.

In my view, therefore, each summons should be dismissed with costs.

SIMOS AJA: I agree with Meagher JA.

I note for completeness that, [section (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) of the [Aboriginal Land Rights Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/) does not provide that the Court shall transfer the relevant lands if the Minister fails to satisfy it of the relevant facts but provides, rather, that, in that event, the Court may, in the sense of "shall", order that the lands "be transferred", presumably, by the Governor or the Minister on behalf of Her
Majesty in whom the relevant lands would be vested (see the definition of "claimable Crown lands" in [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/alra1983201/s36.html) of the Act which provides that "claimable Crown lands" means "lands vested in
Her Majesty" and which otherwise satisfy the requirements of the definition).

I would only add that, as observed by both Meagher JA and the learned trial judge, the dismissal of these applications does not leave the appellant without legal remedy of the kind referred to by them provided, of course, that there are facts which would justify the grant of such a remedy.
