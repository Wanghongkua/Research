THURSDAY 3 FEBRUARY 2005  /04 APPLICATION OF B & P: CHILD H  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application under the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) by an Australian husband and wife for adoption of a Korean child. The child was born on 29 May 2003 and was placed in the care of a Korean adoption agency, from which the applicants received him, and he has been living with them since October 2003.  The application complies with the requirements of the Act and I have no hesitation in making the adoption order, but there is one issue that needs to be addressed. The applicants seek an order approving three names as the forenames of the child. The first two names are Korean names, shown on the child's Korean birth certificate. The third name is a Western or Anglo-Saxon name. The child will have the applicants' surname and there is no issue about that. The question is whether the Court should make an order approving forenames for the child, as sought by the applicants.  [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s101.html) of the Act says that the Court must not approve a change in the given name or names of a child who is more than one year old, or a non-citizen child, unless there are special reasons, related to the best interests of the child, to do so. The applicants have provided a brief affidavit of special reasons, in response to an invitation by the Court. In this case, unlike some others (for example, Re H and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) <case> CJ in Eq)), the Delegate of the Director-General of the
Department of Community Services has not opposed the application for this order.  I find it unnecessary to decide, in this case, whether an application for an order which adds a Western middle name, without seeking to remove the forenames in the Korean birth certificate or relegate them to middle status, is a "change" in the given names for the purposes of [s (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s101.html); nor whether, for the purposes of subsection, the forenames on the Korean birth certificate are the child's "given names" (a question considered by Young CJ in Eq in Re H and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)). Assuming that [s (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s101.html) applies in the present case, there is an affidavit which puts forward some plausible (though not overwhelmingly strong) special reasons, the proposed order is not opposed by the Delegate, and the order will merely insert a
Western middle name, and in these circumstances I find that "special reasons" are present.  I shall make the orders as sought.
