Judgment 
Following judgment given on 5 April 2011, the parties were afforded an opportunity to address on costs. 
Costs against the first defendant 
The principled approach to the plaintiff's application for costs against the first defendant is: 
To make order 1 as set out in the first defendant's proposed judgment order; and 
Make order 2 in the plaintiff's proposed judgment order as against the first defendant.
The plaintiff is entitled to costs in the cause, but interest should only run from the date the plaintiff made a demand for repayment, not from the date the mistaken payment was made. 
Costs against the third defendant 
The principled approach to the plaintiff's application for costs against the third defendant is: 
To make orders 1 and 2 as set out in the plaintiff's proposed judgment order as against the third defendant, except order 1 should be varied so that interest calculated with respect to the judgment amount in order 1 should only be calculated from the date the plaintiff made a demand for repayment, not from the date the mistaken payment was made.
This is for reasons identical to that of the first defendant. 
Costs against the plaintiff with respect to the second defendant 
The principled approach to the second defendant's entitlement to costs from the plaintiff is: 
To make orders 1 and 2 of the plaintiff's proposed judgment order with respect to the second defendant.
The second defendant has not satisfied the Court that the plaintiff's case was manifestly hopeless so as to warrant an indemnity costs order for the period preceding the second defendant's offer of compromise. There remained a serious question to be tried. 
Common grounds advanced by the first and third defendants 
The first and third defendants advanced two common arguments, which they submitted should reduce any costs payable by them to the plaintiff. These were: 
The Supreme Court was an inappropriate forum for this hearing and as such under [Rule .34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s42.34.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), the
Court should not make a costs order against the defendants; and 
The joining of three defendants into one hearing unnecessarily increased each defendant's expenses.
On both of these matters, it is my view that the course taken by the plaintiff was appropriate. The Supreme Court was the appropriate forum given the equitable nature of some of the plaintiff's causes of action and the limits imposed on these causes of action by the District Court. 
In relation to the joining of the three parties, given the substantial factual overlap, this approach was in the overall interests of a just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in dispute. Accordingly, no adverse cost consequences should flow from it.
