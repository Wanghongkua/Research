IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW LIST 
Johnson J September 2008 /08 ID, PF and DV versus Director General, Department of Juvenile Justice and Anor 
JUDGMENT JOHNSON J: By Amended Summons filed 27 August 2008, the Plaintiffs, ID,
PF and DV, seek relief in the nature of prerogative and declaratory relief under ss.69 and 75 [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) with respect to decisions of the First Defendant, the Director General, Department of Juvenile Justice, ordering their transfer under [s.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s28.html) [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/) ("CDC
Act") from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre.
 At the hearing of the Amended Summons, Mr Haesler SC and Ms Graycar appeared for the Plaintiffs. Mr Leeming SC and Mr Barrett appeared for the First
Defendant. A submitting appearance was filed on behalf of the Second
Defendant, the Commissioner for Corrective Services.

The Grounds for Relief The grounds for relief contained in the Amended Summons contend that the
First Defendant: failed to accord the Plaintiffs procedural fairness prior to making the decision to transfer each Plaintiff from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre; took into account irrelevant considerations; failed to take into account relevant considerations; made the decision by the inflexible application of policy.

Procedural Background The present proceedings were commenced on 12 May 2008 by the filing of a
Summons in which six Plaintiffs were nominated - the current Plaintiffs, together with UT, AM and KT. In addition, five Plaintiffs sought relief in separate proceedings (JM and Ors versus Director General, Department of Juvenile
Justice and Anor - 30055/08).
 On 21 May 2008, McCallum J made orders pursuant to s.72 [Civil Procedure
Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) that the Plaintiffs, including ID, PF and DV, be referred to in these proceedings by their initials. I observe, in any event, that [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s11.html) [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) ("CCP
Act") applies to prohibit publication of the names of the Plaintiffs.
 On 26 June 2008, Kirby J granted the Plaintiffs leave to continue with the proceedings under s.4 [Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/).
 By the time the Amended Summons was called on for hearing on 27 August 2008, the only Plaintiffs pressing a claim for relief were ID, PF and DV.

The Judicial Discretion to Make an Order Under [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s19.html) CCP Act  As will be seen, ID, PF and DV, were each sentenced to terms of imprisonment by different Judges of the District Court on various dates between 25 January and 30 August 2007. In each case, the sentencing Judge made an order under s.19(1) CCP Act, directing that the term of the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender. In each case, the sentencing Judge was satisfied there were "special circumstances" justifying the detention of the
Plaintiff as a juvenile offender after the age of 18 years (s.19(3)(a)) by reference to matters referred to in s.19(4) CCP Act.
 At the times when ID, PF and DV were sentenced, s.19 CCP Act was in the following terms: "19 Court may direct imprisonment to be served as a juvenile offender 
If a court sentences a person under 21 years of age to whom this
Division applies to imprisonment in respect of an indictable offence, the court may, subject to this section, make an order directing that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender. 
Note. The effect of such an order is that the person to whom the order relates will be committed to a detention centre (see subsection (6)). There he or she will be detained as specified in the order. In certain circumstances, he or she may subsequently be transferred to a correctional centre pursuant to an order under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s28.html) of the [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/).

A person is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 21 years, unless: in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set - the non-parole period will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age, or in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has not been set - the term of the sentence of imprisonment will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age.

A person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children's indictable offence is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of years, unless: the sentencing court is satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying detention of the person as a juvenile offender after that age, or in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has been set - the non-parole period will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age, or in the case of a sentence for which a non-parole period has not been set - the term of the sentence of imprisonment will end within 6 months after the person has attained that age.

This subsection is subject to subsection (2).

In determining whether there are special circumstances for the purposes of subsection (3), the court may have regard to the following matters: the degree of vulnerability of the person, the availability of appropriate services or programs at the place the person will serve the sentence of imprisonment, any other matter that the court thinks fit.

A person who is subject to an order under this section that ceases or ceased to apply on the person attaining the age of 18 years may apply to the sentencing court for a further order under this section. Any such application requires the leave of the court.
 
The warrant of commitment that is issued under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/s62.html) of the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/) in relation to a sentence of imprisonment the subject of an order under this section: must indicate that the sentence is the subject of such an order, and must specify how much of the sentence is to be served as a juvenile offender, and must, despite the provisions of that section, commit the person to whom it relates to a detention centre.

Nothing in this section, or in any order under this section, limits the operation of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s28.html) of the [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/)." A body of jurisprudence has built up with respect to [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s19.html)
CCP Act in the sentencing context. In these cases, Courts have considered and applied the range of statutory and common law principles which are to be considered when sentencing a person who has committed crimes when under 18 years of age. Regard would be had to the principles in s.6 CCP Act. Regard would be had to the principles in cases such as R versus GDP [(1991) 53 A Crim R ] at 115-116 and KT versus R  <case> at <case>- <case> where it was observed that considerations of punishment and general deterrence have less significance in cases involving young offenders than in cases involving adult offenders and that individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation is of greater significance with such offenders than with adult offenders. Of course, this principle may have less application where the offending behaviour has demonstrated that the young offender has conducted himself in a way that an adult does: R versus Tran  <case> at <case>;
KT versus R at [25]-[26].
 It has been observed that the reconciliation of the principles relevant where a very serious offence is committed by a child creates difficulties in passing sentence: CM versus R  <case> at <case>.
These difficulties include those of balancing the need for deterrence on the one hand and the fact that general deterrence is a matter of less significance when sentencing a juvenile offender: CM versus R at [32].
 Before a sentence of imprisonment can be passed on a juvenile offender, the
Court must have considered a background report prepared by Department of
Juvenile Justice ("DJJ") officers for the purposes of s.25(2)(a) CCP Act: CTM v R <case>; <case>.
A background report must deal, at least, with such of the following matters as are relevant to the circumstances of the offence - the offender's family background, employment, education, friends and associates, the nature and extent of his or her participation in the life of the community, disabilities and antecedents: cl. 6 [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/cpr2005352/). Such a report was considered by the sentencing Judge concerning each of the
Plaintiffs in these proceedings.
 Having determined the appropriate sentence of imprisonment in each case, the Court comes to the question whether a [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/cpr2005352/s19.html) order ought be made where the offender is over 18 years old at the time of sentence. Before a [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/cpr2005352/s19.html) order can be made, the Court must find "special circumstances" under [s.
(3)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/cpr2005352/s19.html) by reference to the matters in [s.19(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/cpr2005352/s19.html)
Reasons for such findings include: physical and emotional vulnerability as well as better prospects of rehabilitation if the person remains in a juvenile detention centre: R versus CK  <case> at <case>; vulnerability of the offender personally and in relation to his rehabilitation, together with the fact that the person's rehabilitation will be substantially enhanced by his continued detention in a juvenile detention centre and would be positively handicapped by transfer to an adult gaol, particularly having regard to the relative lack of rehabilitative programs available in adult gaols when compared to those available in a juvenile detention centre: R versus DN  <case> at <case>; vulnerability in the adult prison system, the person not being a threat to staff or detainees in a juvenile detention centre, the person's rehabilitation being substantially enhanced by continued detention in a juvenile detention centre and the need to maintain relationships with DJJ staff and others involved in his rehabilitation in the juvenile detention centre: R versus KT  <case> at <case>;
KT versus R, above; R versus PB  <case> at <case>- <case>.
 It has been accepted that service of a sentence within a juvenile detention centre has significant benefits for an offender as against serving a sentence within the adult prison system: R versus MD <case>; <case>.
 Findings of the general type referred to at [13] were made by the sentencing Judge concerning each Plaintiff. A finding of "special circumstances" was made and an order under [s.19(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/cpr2005352/s19.html) was pronounced.
 Section 19 CCP Act provides for this course to be taken by way of judicial order as part of the sentence. It is not a recommendation, but an order of the
Court pronounced as part of the sentence. Of course, a sentencing Judge is required by law to give reasons for passing sentence and this was done here, including the delivery of reasons for making a s.19 order in each case.
 No appeal was brought to the Court of Criminal Appeal by the Crown or the offender concerning the sentences and orders of the District Court in each of the Plaintiffs' cases.

The Administrative Discretion to Make an Order Under s.28 CDC Act On various dates between 29 March and 23 April 2008, the Acting Director-
General, DJJ, made orders under s.28 CDC Act directing the transfer of ID, PF and DV from juvenile detention centres to adult correctional centres. In this judgment, I will refer to these as decisions of the First Defendant, although it was the Acting Director-General who was the actual decision maker. At the time when these orders were made, s.28 CDC Act was in the following terms: "28 Transfer of older detainees from detention centres to correctional centres 
The Director-General may, by order in writing made with the consent of the Commissioner of Corrective Services, direct the transfer of an older detainee from a detention centre to a correctional centre.

An order may be made under subsection (1) not only in relation to a detainee who is currently detained in a detention centre but also in relation to: a detainee who is absent from a detention centre, whether pursuant to leave of absence or otherwise, or a detainee who is being returned to a detention centre following revocation of his or her parole under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/index.html#p7) of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/) (as applied by [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s29.html) of this Act), whether pursuant to a warrant in force under section 181 of that
Act or otherwise.

In the case of a detainee who is under the age of 18 years, an order may not be made under subsection (1) unless: he or she is a person on remand or a person subject to control by reason of an order in force under section 10, or he or she is a person on remand in relation to a serious children's indictable offence within the meaning of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) , or he or she is a person subject to control by reason of an order in force under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s19.html) of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) , or the Director-General is satisfied that the detainee's behaviour is or has been such as warrants the making of such an order.

In the case of a detainee who is of or above the age of 18 years, but under the age of 21 years, an order may not be made under subsection (1) unless: the Children's Court makes an order authorising the making of such an order, or the detainee applies to the Director-General in writing for the detainee's transfer to a correctional centre, or one or more of the circumstances referred to in subsection (2) applies in relation to the detainee.

An order under subsection (1) with respect to a detainee who is under the age of 18 years may only be made for the purpose of transferring the detainee to a juvenile correctional centre.

When a detainee is transferred from a detention centre to a correctional centre pursuant to an order under this section: he or she ceases to be a detainee and becomes an inmate, and in the case of a detainee who, having been a person subject to control, becomes a convicted inmate within the meaning of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/) , the period for which he or she was required, under this Act, to be detained in a detention centre when the order was made is taken to be the unexpired portion of a sentence of imprisonment to which he or she is subject." The exercise of the administrative discretionary power of the First
Defendant to order a transfer under s.28 CDC Act of an "older detainee" (defined as a detainee aged over 16 years) from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre has not been the subject of previous challenge by way of judicial review giving rise to a judgment of this Court.
 That it is open to the First Defendant to order the transfer of a detainee, despite the existence of an order under s.19 CCP Act is clear: s.19(7) and note after s.19(1) CCP Act. A s.28 transfer order may not be made in the case of a detainee aged between 18 and 21 years unless one of the requirements in s.28(2A) is met. Section 28(2A)(c) merely refers the reader back to s.28(2).
Accordingly, a s.28(1) order may be made with respect to a detainee aged between 18 and 21 years if: the Children's Court makes an order authorising the making of such an order: s.28(2A)(a); the detainee applies to the First Defendant in writing for the detainee's transfer to an adult correctional centre: s.28(2A)(b); the detainee is on remand in one or other of the circumstances identified in s.28(2)(a) or (b): s.28(2A)(c) applying s.28(2)(a), (b); the detainee is a person subject to control by reason of an order in force under s.19 CCP Act: s.28(2A)(c) applying s.28(2)(c); the First Defendant is satisfied that the detainee's behaviour is or has been such as warrants the making of such an order: s.28(2A)(c) applying s.28(2)(d).
 The present Plaintiffs do not fall into any category listed in the preceding paragraph apart from (d). The Plaintiffs did not apply for transfer but opposed it. The First Defendant did not purport to order transfer because of the Plaintiffs' behaviour. I construe the word "behaviour" in s.28(2)(d) as meaning bad behaviour. It is difficult to see that s.28(2)(d) could operate to permit transfer to an adult correctional centre of a detainee who was well behaved. In any event, the evidence in this case reveals that each Plaintiff was well behaved and was making very substantial progress with respect to rehabilitation, education, training and counselling and had been doing so for some months prior to transfer.
 The only statutory class which exposed the Plaintiffs to consideration for transfer to an adult correctional centre was the fact that each was subject to a s.19 order of a Court.
 The Court of Criminal Appeal has referred to the s.28 transfer process in the context of appeals before that Court. In CM versus R, above, Blanch J (McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) at [31] observed that it might be expected that, in considering the exercise of the s.28 power to transfer to an adult prison, regard would be had to the continuing education of the detainee. In the same case, Grove J at [6] observed that the existence of the s.28 transfer power was irrelevant to the performance of judicial function in assessing sentence, determining a non-parole period and whether or not to make a s.19 order.
 The powers under s.19 CCP Act and s.28 CDC Act were touched on in R versus PB, above. The Crown appealed against the adequacy of sentence imposed in the
District Court. The sentencing Judge had made an order under s.19 CCP Act that the sentence be served as a juvenile offender. By the time the Crown appeal came on for hearing, the offender had been transferred under s.28 to an adult prison. The evidence established (at [43]) that the substantial educational and rehabilitative resources available to, and utilised by, the offender in juvenile detention were not available in adult prison. Bell JA (McCallum J and myself agreeing) said at [47]-[48]: "47 The Crown made inquiries of the inmate classification section of the Department of Corrective Services concerning the reasons for the decision (despite the order made by the Judge) to transfer the respondent to an adult institution. Mr Stephens, State Co-ordinator of the Young Adult Offender
Program, advised that the respondent had been transferred pursuant to an order made under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s28.html) of the [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/). Notable in Mr Stephens' response to the request made by the Director of Public
Prosecutions is the absence of an explanation of the reasons why the order was made.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s28.html) empowers the Director General by order in writing, made with the consent of the Commissioner of Corrective Services, to direct the transfer of an older detainee from a detention centre to a correctional centre. The respondent is an older detainee. There is no suggestion either that the respondent applied to the Director General seeking a transfer to a correctional centre or that his behaviour had been such as to warrant the making of an order transferring him. It may be that the order was one made under [s (2A)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s28.html), a provision which appears to confer a broad power to make such an order in respect of a person who is subject to control by reason of an order in force under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s19.html) of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/)."  In allowing the Crown appeal and increasing the sentence, the Court determined (at [58]-[59]) that, despite the fact a [s.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s28.html) transfer had occurred, an order ought be made under [s.19(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s19.html) that the offender serve the sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender until his 21st birthday. "Special circumstances" were found by reference to the availability of services and programs to assist the offender in juvenile detention and the capacity to complete educational studies and to maintain contact with DJJ officers whose guidance was an important feature of his rehabilitation.
 None of the cases referred to so far deal directly with the issues which I must decide in this case. However, they provide some understanding of the practical operation of [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s19.html)
CCP Act and, to a lesser extent, s.28 CDC Act.
 The First Defendant has an undoubted power under s.28 to order involuntary transfer of a well-behaved detainee from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre. However, s.28 says very little about the circumstances in which the statutory discretion may be exercised.

Evidence Adduced in the Proceedings I now turn to the evidence adduced at the hearing. It will be necessary to make findings of fact as part of the resolution of the legal and factual questions falling for determination.
 There were a number of objections to evidence tendered by the Plaintiffs which required determination at the hearing.
 The evidence admitted in the Plaintiffs' case was as follows: a tender bundle comprising a range of documents concerning the
Plaintiffs, including DJJ documents relating to their sentencing, detention and transfer from juvenile detention centres to adult correctional centres (Exhibit A); an affidavit of ID affirmed 13 August 2008 (excluding paragraphs -38); an affidavit of DV affirmed 7 August 2008 (excluding paragraphs 32-38); an affidavit of PF affirmed 7 August 2008 (excluding paragraphs 43-50); an affidavit of Rebecca Cowper sworn 9 May 2008 (paragraphs 1, 2 and 18 only); a further affidavit of Rebecca Cowper sworn 9 May 2008 (seven pages in length); a third affidavit of Rebecca Cowper sworn 9 May 2008 (paragraphs 1-2, and 15 and Annexures G and H only) admitted in the Plaintiffs' case in reply.
 I observe that the parts of the affidavits of ID, PF and DV which I excluded concerned events which had occurred after their transfer to adult correctional centres. I took the view that this evidence was not relevant to the issues to be determined in claims for prerogative and declaratory relief.
 However, as indicated to counsel during the hearing (T67-69), I will approach the resolution of the present proceedings upon the basis that the statutory framework in the CDC Act and the CCP Act (in particular, s.19) reflects the reality that juvenile detention is likely to be more suitable for vulnerable persons, and that a wider range of educational and other facilities, which may serve to foster rehabilitation, are more likely to be available in a detention centre than an adult prison. This approach is supported by statements in the authorities referred to at [13]-[14] and [24]-[25] above.
 This accords with the commonsense reality that the environment, conditions, facilities and population of an adult prison are different to that of a juvenile detention centre, irrespective of efforts which might be made by the relevant authorities in this regard. I indicated to Mr Leeming SC that, if he was to submit to the contrary, I would reconsider my decision to reject the evidence of ID, PF and DV concerning their post-transfer experiences. Mr
Leeming SC indicated that he did not advance such a submission, so it was unnecessary for me to reconsider the admissibility of the Plaintiffs' post- transfer experiences in adult prisons. If the First Defendant had not adopted this stance, then the evidence of post-transfer events would have been admissible, not in the sense that those matters should have been taken into consideration, but rather as showing that the probability of the subsequent events happening was one that could be taken into consideration: Surinakova v
Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs <case>; [(1991) 33 FCR 87] at 93-94. The likely detriment to a person transferred from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre bears upon several issues in these proceedings and, in particular, the procedural fairness question.
 None of the deponents of the affidavits listed at [30] above, were required by the First Defendant for cross-examination.
 The Plaintiffs also sought to read, over objection, an affidavit of Timothy
Shaun Keogh sworn 19 August 2008. Dr Keogh is a clinical and forensic psychologist. He was retained by the solicitor for the Plaintiffs in August to provide a report for the purpose of these proceedings. He had not examined the Plaintiffs for that purpose. Rather, he had perused a range of documents provided to him and provided a report dated 19 August 2008. It was submitted for the Plaintiffs that Dr Keogh's report was admissible in these proceedings even though it had been brought into existence after the decisions under challenge were made. It was submitted that Dr Keogh's report was relevant to the issues to be determined. The First Defendant submitted that Dr
Keogh's affidavit ought not be admitted as it was not relevant to any issue to be determined in these proceedings.
 I determined that Dr Keogh's evidence ought be admitted provisionally under s.57 [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) with a determination to be made on its admissibility in the final judgment. Although it did not seem to me that Dr Keogh's evidence could satisfy the test of relevance in [s.55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), there were, at least, arguments in support of its admission by reference to the ground based upon alleged failure to have regard to relevant factors. Further,
Mr Leeming SC wished to cross-examine Dr Keogh on one issue and Dr Keogh's availability was limited. Having admitted provisionally Dr Keogh's evidence, he gave oral evidence and was cross-examined (T48-55).
 Having had an opportunity to reflect on the submissions made with respect to the admissibility of Dr Keogh's evidence, I am ultimately not persuaded that it ought be admitted into evidence. The present proceedings involve a claim for relief in the nature of prerogative and declaratory relief. They do not involve an appeal whether by hearing de novo or in the strict sense. The function which I am performing in these proceedings is not, of course, a sentencing function (at which psychological evidence may be admitted) nor a merits review of the First Defendant's decisions which might permit Dr Keogh's report to be relied upon. The grounds for relief are set out at [3] above.
 Dr Keogh's affidavit is a type of commentary on the documents provided to him which included documents which were before the First Defendant and other documents.
 In the result, I am not persuaded that Dr Keogh's evidence is relevant and admissible in the present proceedings. I will decide the Amended Summons without reference to Dr Keogh's affidavit. If relief is granted and the transfer decisions set aside, the First Defendant might again consider whether [s.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s28.html) transfers ought be ordered. In that case, Dr Keogh's affidavit may be relevant to that process. However, that is not the function which I am discharging in these proceedings.
 The First Defendant relied upon the affidavit of Valda Rusis affirmed 26
August 2008 and Ms Rusis gave oral evidence and was cross-examined (T56-72).
Mr Rusis is the Acting Deputy Director General (Operations) of DJJ.

Factual Matters At one level, there is little factual controversy in these proceedings.
Although the First Defendant objected to parts of affidavits (some parts were excluded, but the bulk was admitted), only Dr Keogh was required for cross- examination and even then, on one aspect only. Ms Rusis was cross-examined, but she had played no part in the decision-making process concerning ID, PF and DV and could speak in general terms only concerning a number of issues in the proceedings.
 Accordingly, what follows constitutes a recital of largely undisputed facts. It may be taken that this recital constitutes my findings of fact.
Where there are areas of controversy requiring resolution of factual disputes,
I will indicate that and make necessary findings. At times, this will involve the drawing of inferences from documentary evidence.
 Of course, the Plaintiffs bear the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, facts grounding an entitlement to relief in the nature of prerogative or declaratory relief: Roos versus Director of Public Prosecutions [(1994) 34 NSWLR 254] at 259.

General Evidence Concerning Consideration by the DJJ and DCS of Transfer of [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s19.html) Detainees in 2008 The DJJ operates nine Juvenile Justice Centres located throughout the
State. Juvenile Justice Centres accommodate both remand and sentenced detainees. The present collective operational bed capacity of Juvenile Justice
Centres is about 416. There is a much higher staff-to-detainee ratio in juvenile facilities than in the adult correctional system, it being acknowledged that providing such support will decrease a detainee's likelihood of re-offending (Exhibit A, page 68a).
 The DCS conducts 31 Correctional Centres throughout the State, including one juvenile correctional centre.
 During 2008, there has been increased demand for juvenile detainee beds.
This has resulted in Juvenile Justice Centres being over capacity in terms of the numbers of detainees in them, notwithstanding that the collective operational bed capacity has been increased from around 338 to 416 over a -month period to June 2008. In January 2008, the number of young persons in
DJJ capacity increased from about 370 to about 410.

Emails Between January and March 2008 On 16 January 2008, a list of 26 detainees was compiled within the DJJ showing detainees held under [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s19.html)
CCP Act orders who were over 18 years old with at least 12 months to serve on their sentence (Exhibit A, pages 1-3). ID, PF and DV were included in this list. On 8 February 2008, a more refined list was prepared inside DJJ, still containing 26 detainees, but with a focus on those with earliest release dates in 2009 (Exhibit A, pages 4-6).
 On 25 February 2008, an email was sent from Kevin Harris, Director
Transport, Placements and Drug Intelligence Branch, DJJ to Ana-Marija Ciko and
Peter Reberger, both DJJ officers who will be mentioned later in this judgment, concerning "Transfer of Older Detainees to Adult Corrections". The email commenced "Please note that the Department is transferring certain older detainees to adult corrections". Reference was made to certain detainees, including ID, who were "to be interviewed by a [DCS]
Classification officer to ascertain if there are any factors from the detainees perspective as to why they should not be transferred to prison" (Exhibit A, page 9).  On 1 March 2008, Ms Ciko sent an email concerning changes to occur in the s.28 process. For detainees who resisted transfer, each detainee was to complete a form and the Centre and Primary Worker had to provide a classification report that "only need to be brief, but cover all the information to Corrections so they can make an informed decision". It was said that "none of the forms as they stand will do" and that reports, including that for ID, "will need to be redone". Ms Ciko said "I have been informed so long as we keep them going to CS, even if one at a time, that will be fine! This is only the beginning and we will have to be doing these for the next few weeks by the look of it at least!" (Exhibit A, page 17).
 Other emails shed light upon the nature of the process as between DCS and
DJJ in March 2008. On 13 March 2008, Michael Stephens, a senior DCS officer, sent the following email to Jenni Byers, a DJJ officer (Exhibit A, page 28):  "Sorry about this but in [ID's] report the counsellor Ann Harwood states that she strongly supports the detainees concerns about moving into the adult system and supports his request to remain in DJJ.

If at all possible can the wording of these reports be modified as not to present the the [sic] staffs personal view. If they have a gripe with DJJ about these moves I suggest they should be in writing to the DG and not to
DCS. As a suggestion they could write that the DJJ has nominated detainee [ID] to be transferred to DCS under a section 28 order (older detainees).

I am just trying to make this process as smooth as possible." 
Given that it was the First Defendant who was the lawful decision maker under s.28 CDC Act, it is not at all clear why a DCS officer should be dictating the content of DJJ reports. The Plaintiffs contend that this provides considerable insight into the true nature of the decision-making process.
 On 16 March 2008, Ms Ciko sent an email to DJJ personnel concerning the contents of s.28 reports (Exhibit A, page 29). The email included the following: "Information should assist Corrective Services with classification and provide a treatment provider with information needed to assess and make an informed decision about services that need to be provided.

If there are any issues/concerns with the transfer, these need to be raised within your professional area of expertise and based on relevant assessments, treatment provided, psychometric testing carried out, or literature (appropriately document). Personal opinions, legal opinion or statements/comments about the Department are both inappropriate and beyond your roles and responsibilities.

If the young person has stated they would like to remain in DJJ and you support their position this needs to be done appropriately as per above.

Staff are reminded that their reports are there for both Corrective
Services and the DG to make an informed decision. A number of staff have placed their personal opinions in reports and this does not assist the process and are inappropriate.

If you have concerns or unsure, please contact your clinical supervisor or myself, who would be happy to assist you. Please note reports need to be provided in a timely fashion so that they can be proofread and any changes made as needed. Staff have been providing reports at the last minute and this only delays the process.

Staff are further reminded that you are not permitted to send copies of any reports outside the Centre without the approval of myself and the Centre
Manager, even if the detainee signs a release of information." Further insight into the role of DCS is found in an email from Mr Stephens to Ms Byers on 4 March 2008 (Exhibit A, page 18). Mr Stephens said with respect to another detainee, KT: "Just to let you know that NSW Legal Aid forwarded a request for [KT] in regards to staying in DJJ. I called the Solicitor and informed her of what the process has been and that he will be going regardless of that request." 
According to the evidence, it was not until 6 May 2008 that KT was transferred to an adult correctional centre (Exhibit A, page 68).

The Evidence of Ms Rusis Ms Rusis was the only witness called by the First Defendant. Prior to her employment with DJJ, she worked with DCS for 25 years, her last position with
DCS being as Regional Director of Metropolitan Region. It must be said that I derived limited assistance from the evidence of Ms Rusis. She played no part in the transfer process of ID, PF and DV and had read very few documents relating to their transfer (T70-72). She said she was "happy to speak in generalities" (T70.47) about the matter, however, evidence of that type from a witness who played no part in the transfer process would not be of real assistance.
 Ms Rusis denied that there was a policy whereby s.19 detainees who were over 18 years were generally transferred to the DCS unless there was a serious incapacity or the DCS did not consent to transfer (T56-57). As her cross- examination proceeded, it became apparent that Ms Rusis was saying there was no such written policy and, ultimately, she said that she was unable to say whether or not there was such a policy (T61).
 Ms Rusis said that the DJJ provides funding for the Legal Aid Commission's
Children's Legal Service to provide free legal advice and assistance to detainees, including access to a Hotline.

Comments by DJJ Officers to Ms Cowper in March and April 2008 I admitted into evidence in the Plaintiffs' case, over objection, parts of an affidavit of Rebecca Cowper sworn 9 May 2008, which included conversations which Ms Cowper had with various DJJ employees. Ms Cowper is an employed solicitor of the Children's Legal Service of the Legal Aid Commission of NSW.
 I allowed that evidence upon the basis that the matters stated were admissions under s.87 [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (T34-35).
Evidence admitted on this basis included what follows at [58]-[62]. Ms Cowper was not cross-examined and I accept that her affidavit truthfully and accurately states what was said to her by DJJ officers.
 Ms Cowper had a discussion at the Frank Baxter Juvenile Justice Centre ("Baxter") on 3 March 2008 with two DJJ officers, Ms Pat Palmer and another officer about their understanding of present policy concerning [s.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s28.html) transfers. During this discussion, Ms Palmer and/or the other officer said words to the following effect to Ms Cowper: "The boys are being transferred because Juvenile Justice needs beds".
 "It is not a [Baxter] centre decision. Centre staff have been directed by head office as to who was going".
 "Only boys who will go to adult gaol anyway were to be transferred.
That is, those who are on section 19s but whose sentences extend more than six months beyond their 21st birthday".
 On about 7 April 2008, Ms Cowper spoke to Mr Svante Forsberg, a DJJ officer in the Admissions Section of Baxter. Mr Forsberg said words to the effect, "Admissions staff don't get told until the day before or sometimes the actual day of the transfer ... State-wide the Centres are 40 over maximum capacity.
Baxter is five over right now and they have young people sleeping two to a single room and in holding cells ... I don't understand why good kids are going".
 Following her discussion with Mr Forsberg, Ms Cowper had a discussion on 7
April 2008 at Baxter with Ms Ciko, Assistant Manager, Client Services to the following effect: "Ms Ciko: I have no control over who goes. They [Head Office] give me a list and tell me to process these boys for transfer ... 'Process' means prepare reports, not recommendations, more progress reports. We can raise issues like mental health or intellectual disability but we're not allowed to put recommendations in the reports. 
Ms Cowper: Can you tell me you sic] told you that? 
Ms Ciko: I can't tell you who said this, we're not allowed." During Ms Cowper's discussion with Ms Ciko described in the preceding paragraph, Ms Ciko also said words to the following effect: "These are our best boys ... My guess, and it's only a guess, is they're sending the boys who won't make a fuss in Corrections".
 "All day leave has been cancelled ... They have advice from Crown
Solicitors that what they're doing is legal".
 On about 18 April 2008, Ms Cowper had a telephone discussion with Ms Ann
Harwood, psychologist/counsellor at Baxter. During this conversation, Ms
Harwood said words to the following effect: "I don't understand the way they [Head Office] are choosing which boys to send to gaol. The counsellors and psychologists as a team are concerned that there is no explanation or opportunity to assess who should go.
We don't know what they're basing it on apart from being a [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s19.html)" "The process is that we get told, 'A boy is going to be told tomorrow that he is going to gaol'. We are to write a report with no recommendations, but provide only enough information so that Corrections [Department of
Corrective Services] can process them and classify them. By the time the boys get told, the decision to send them has already been made. Some boys are told they can fill out a form saying they don't want to go, but they go anyway, and by the time they are told and given the opportunity to fill out the form, the decision has already been made." "We were told in a general meeting, by Ana-Marija Ciko, who said she was directed by Head Office, that when we write reports, we are not to include personal recommendations of whether a boy should be transferred, nor are we allowed to refer to the remarks of the sentencing judge." "Some reports have been changed to remove references to the remarks of the sentencing Judge, or to remove recommendations that a boy not be transferred." "The reasons so many boys are going is because of the bed issue. We are so short of beds that we needed to get as many through as possible".
 From the evidence referred to so far, an inference is available that DJJ had identified a group of [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s19.html) detainees who were to be transferred to adult correctional centres unless DCS decided to the contrary. In a submission to be referred to later in this judgment (at [278]), Mr Leeming SC pointed to two detainees who were not transferred and contended that their cases demonstrated that the policy alleged by the Plaintiffs had not been established. As will be seen, I have concluded that those two cases fortify the Plaintiffs' submission rather than undermine it. I am satisfied that such a policy was applied by DJJ and DCS officers.
 It is now appropriate to examine the substantial body of affidavit and documentary evidence concerning each Plaintiff. It will be apparent that unlike Ms Rusis, Ms Ciko and Ms Harwood (amongst others) were directly involved in the process concerning the Plaintiffs. The First Defendant did not call any witness other than Ms Rusis to give evidence in the proceedings.

The Case of ID ID was born on 15 May 1988. On 6 March 2005, when ID was 16 years old, he committed a number of serious criminal offences. On 25 January 2007, he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment by his Honour Judge Nicholson SC for those offences. ID pleaded guilty to: robbery in company whilst armed with an offensive weapon and then breaking out of premises; at a time when he was in the company of a co-offender, having sexual intercourse (fellatio) with the victim without her consent knowing that she was not consenting and immediately before that sexual intercourse, threatening to inflict actual bodily harm upon her and her son by means of an offensive weapon; whilst in company of a co-offender, having sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent knowing that she was not consenting.
 In lengthy remarks on sentence delivered on 25 January 2007 (confirmed in brief further reasons given on 16 February 2007), his Honour Judge Nicholson
SC sentenced ID to a total effective sentence of imprisonment of nine years and 11 months to date from 16 May 2005 with a non-parole period of four years to date from 16 May 2005 and to expire on 15 May 2009. At the time of sentence, ID was aged 18 years and seven months. As required by law, a background report concerning ID was in evidence before the sentencing Judge for the purposes of s.25 CCP Act. At the time of sentence, there was evidence before the Court demonstrating substantial steps on ID's part by way of education and other rehabilitative steps. Pursuant to s.19 CCP Act, his Honour found "special circumstances" and directed that the non-parole period of
ID's sentence be served as a juvenile offender. ID had no prior criminal history.
 Neither the Crown nor ID appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning sentence.
 ID stated in his affidavit that, as a result of the order and sentencing remarks of his Honour Judge Nicholson SC, he expected that he would serve his entire non-parole period in juvenile detention and not be transferred to an adult correctional centre unless he misbehaved, requested a transfer or felt he no longer needed the services offered by the DJJ (paragraph 10, affidavit of ID, 13 August 2008).
 ID was transferred to Baxter on or about 18 December 2006. Thereafter, he undertook Higher School Certificate studies through the Sydney Distance
Education High School. At the end of 2007, he successfully completed Year 11, with subjects including mathematics, English, geography, environmental science and sports, life style and recreation. In 2008, ID began a two-year program of
Year 12 studies. He completed TAFE courses in hygiene and food procedure at
Baxter. In March 2008, ID was chosen to represent Baxter in the soccer competition against visiting teams.
 ID participated in counselling at Baxter and was undertaking specialist programs, including the Sex Offender Program and the Improving Family
Relationships Program. He stated that he had a close relationship with his
Juvenile Justice Officer and that he felt he required services offered by the
DJJ, in particular, counselling in the Sex Offender Program. ID received weekly visits form his mother, brother and sisters in Baxter. His father had died in 2006.

Events Leading to Transfer of ID On about 3 March 2008, ID's unit manager at Baxter informed him that transfer to an adult gaol was under consideration and that "for you to have a better chance at staying, I suggest you fill in this form I'm going to hand out to you ... You should put a case as to why you should stay in Baxter" (paragraph 24). ID completed a document on that day providing reasons why he did not wish to be transferred to an adult correctional facility. ID said: "I do not want to go to gaol as since I have been at Baxter I have a good team of workers, teachers and counsellors who are helping me. I completed my
Year 11 last year in Baxter and now I am doing my Year 12 in English, geography and environmental science studies. I will do business studies and sports lifestyle and recreation Year 12 subjects next year. I especially have two teachers who are giving me extra help so I can get through Baxter is my best chance of completing my HSC. I would be too stressed in gaol to do well in my studies. I hope to work in the fitness or environmental employment in the future. Doing well is very important for me as my father died recently and it's up to me to take care of my family. I have behaved really well in Baxter and have always been in the top section. I am also eligible for outings and getting involved in community activities before I get out will help me do well in the community. I do not want to go to gaol because I am afraid I would be picked for fights because of my charges. I would be always worrying about what might happen and then I wouldn't be able to study. I am also scared for my safety about my co-offender who is already in gaol. I worry he might target me. I do not want to be around him. Staying at Baxter is my best chance of studying and finishing my Year 12. I would also be safer and not at risk because of my co-offender and charges." On 20 March 2008, a Case Management Committee meeting was held at Baxter concerning ID. Present at the meeting were Fiona Ruscheinsky, Acting Assistant
Manager at Baxter and two DCS officers - Mr Stephens, State Co-Ordinator,
Young Adult Offenders Program and Deputy Manager of Classification and
Placement, and Peter Townsend, Manager, Classification and Placement,
Indigenous Offenders. ID attended the meeting. His family members were not present at the meeting. During the course of the meeting, ID was told by one of the DCS officers that, as he had been behaving well in juvenile detention, he would most likely be given a security classification of "C1" in the adult gaol system. ID was told that, because of his age, he could have gone to John
Morony to do the Young Adult Offenders Program, but "because of the nature of your charges and length of time left to serve, parole would want you to do the
CUBIT Sex Offenders Program which is only offered in Long Bay" and that "CUBIT has a waiting list of about one year". According to ID's unchallenged evidence, he was told that "the bus will be here to pick you up next week to take you to adult gaol".
 It is ID's evidence that he did not have, nor was he given the opportunity to have, legal representation at the Case Management Committee meeting on 20
March 2008. After the meeting, Ms Harwood, a counsellor at Baxter suggested that he might want to ring the Legal Aid Hotline to get some legal advice. As March 2008 was Good Friday, ID was unable to get through to a solicitor at
Legal Aid.
 On Tuesday, 25 March 2008, a briefing note was prepared for the Acting
Director-General of DJJ concerning the proposed transfer of ID to an adult correctional centre under s.28 CDC Act (Exhibit A, Tab 30). The briefing note was prepared by Sharon Murphy, Operations Assistant Transport Placement and
Drug Intelligence Branch within DJJ. The briefing note stated that ID "was identified earlier this year as a detainee who potentially meets the criteria for transfer to a correctional centre".
 I infer that the "criteria" here referred to are criteria mentioned in an email dated 25 February 2008 (Exhibit A, page 9). This was Mr Harris' email referred to at [48] above. That email stated: "Transfers of old detainees for management reasons will be selected against some or all of the following criteria; * Over 18 years of age.
 * Sentenced pursuant to sect 19.
 * With DJJ on a sect 10 order.
 * Part of the sentence will be served in adult corrections.
 * Length of time to serve.
 * Behaviour.
 * Response to programs.
 * Other factors to be considered are intellectual disability and/or vulnerability of being placed in the adult system." The briefing note recited that a Case Management Committee meeting had been held with ID on 20 March 2008 to discuss "the potential transfer". It was noted that ID was almost 20 years of age, and was currently detained at
Baxter. The briefing note included the following: "* The department is currently experiencing high numbers in custody and a limited number of beds are available, * given the nature of the offences that detainee [ID] has been charged with and his age, should detainee [ID] remain in juvenile detention there are some potential risks to the safety and well being of other detainees and potential OHS risks for staff in managing the high number of detainees.
 * These potential risks should be balanced against the circumstances of the particular detainee and his demonstrated behaviour in the detention centre." The briefing note had earlier recited the nature of the offences for which
ID had been sentenced by his Honour Judge Nicholson SC together with the sentences imposed. Under the heading "Comment", the briefing note stated: "* [ID] has been sentenced to imprisonment in relation to indictable offences of a serious nature. * [ID] has requested that he not be transferred to an adult correctional centre as he believes his safety will be compromised due to his offences.
 * [ID] is currently undertaking his HSC over a two-year period. He believes his ability to complete his current Year 12 studies will suffer due to being stressed in an adult correctional centre. He states that it is important to do well in his HSC as his father is recently deceased and it is up to him to take care of his family.
 * [ID] will be C1 Classification ... His pathway is the Metropolitan
Regional Remand Centre at Silverwater for initial assessment, then the Sex
Offender Program at Long Bay Correctional Centre.
 * If the detainee has to wait for a bed at Long Bay he will go to the
Young Offender Program at John Morony. Both John Morony and Long Bay have face-to-face teaching where his HSC can be completed. The HSC is also delivered via correspondence.
 * In the detention centre [ID] is generally well-behaved and making positive progress towards his rehabilitation." The briefing note recommended that "for the reasons set out in this briefing ... if the A/Director General is satisfied that [ID] is a person not suitable for detention in a Juvenile Justice Centre" then the Acting
Director-General should order the transfer of ID to a Correctional Centre pursuant to s.28 CDC Act with the consent of the Commissioner for Corrective
Services.
 Attached to the briefing note, together with a number of formal draft documents, were the following: 
ID's letter dated 3 March 2008 requesting not to be transferred (see [71] above); a record of the Case Management Committee meeting held on 20 March ;
 a committal summary together with the report of Ms Harwood, counsellor, dated 5 March 2008 and a report of Ms Ruscheinsky, the Baxter Centre psychologist and Peter Reberger, the Baxter Acting Centre Manager, dated 18
March 2008; the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Nicholson SC dated 25
January 2007 and 16 February 2007.
 The briefing note, together with the documents identified in the preceding paragraph, constituted the material before the Acting Director-General, Peter
Muir, for the purpose of the s.28 decision concerning ID. Mr Muir signed the briefing note on Wednesday, 26 March 2008. I infer that, at this time, he had decided in principle to transfer ID to an adult correctional centre. The consent of the Second Defendant was obtained to this course on Saturday, 29
March 2008 and, on that day, Mr Muir directed that ID be transferred to an adult correctional centre pursuant to s.28(1) CDC Act.
 No reasons were provided by the First Defendant for ordering the transfer of ID to an adult correctional centre.
 On 1 April 2008, ID was transferred from Baxter to an adult correctional centre, the MRRC at the Silverwater Correctional Complex. On 7 April 2008, he was transferred from the MRRC to another adult correctional centre, the
Metropolitan Special Programs Centre at the Long Bay Correctional Complex where he currently remains in custody.
 It is ID's evidence that, prior to his transfer to an adult prison: he was not personally interviewed or assessed by an officer of DJJ as to his suitability for transfer to an adult correctional centre; there were no meetings between himself, his family and DJJ staff such as his juvenile justice officer to discuss his case plan, security classification and placement; he was not given the opportunity of having any legal representation to assist him to provide submissions or with the decision to transfer him generally.

Documents Provided to First Defendant It is appropriate to record the contents of some of the documents provided to the Acting Director-General as attachments to the briefing note.
 The record of the Case Management Committee meeting of 20 March 2008 included the following (Exhibit A, page 83): "Background 
Detainee [ID] was transferred to Baxter Juvenile Detention Centre on the 18.12.2006.

Details in the submissions provided by the Department of Juvenile Justice state the behaviour of detainee [ID] has been of a level where he has been placed into a privileged unit. Detainee [ID] has received strong support from his family through weekly visits and telephone contact. There is no history of drug use whilst [ID] has been housed at Baxter Juvenile
Detention Centre and he is classified as a B1 detainee.

Due to being on a section 19 order and over 18 years of age the DJJ has determined that detainee [ID] is now required to be transferred to the
Department of Corrective Services on a section 28 (2) order as requested by the Director General (DJJ), and approved by the Commissioner, Department of
Corrective Services." (my emphasis) After reciting ID's sentencing details, the record continued (Exhibit A, page 84): "Current DJJ Alerts 
Single room due to nature of offence.

Decision of Committee 
Prior to being moved to his gaol of placement detainee [ID] must be transferred to the Metropolitan Remand Facilities, Department of Corrective
Services, to undergo the screening, reception, induction and classification process. Due to the length of time remaining on his sentence it is recommended that detainee [ID] be classified as a C1 inmate upon his transfer to the
Department of Corrective Services 
Due to the seriousness of his offence [ID] will be required to complete the Sex Offender Program (SOP) within the Department of Corrective Services.
It is recommended that he be assessed at the MRRC for placement into the SOP prior to placement to another correctional centre. It is also recommended that [ID] be considered for placement into the Specialised Program for Young
Adult Offenders if unable to initially be transferred into the SOP at Long
Bay.

The co-offender of this inmate is [ON] who is currently housed at
Lithgow Correctional Centre.

Upon transfer to the Department of Corrective Services Inmate [ID] will be identified as a Public Interest Inmate due to the nature of his offences and sentence length. Inmate [ID] will be managed by the departments Pre- release Leave Committee (PRLC) when applying for any external leave programs." The committal summary (Exhibit A, pages 85-91) outlined, amongst other things, ID's custodial history before his transfer to Baxter on 18 December and provided a generally favourable report concerning ID's participation in programs at Baxter and his family support. It noted that ID "has attended regular counselling with his sex offender counsellor prior to her change in employment" and had been seeing Ms Harwood for support.
 Ms Harwood's report of 5 March 2008 was attached to the briefing note (Exhibit A, page 92). The report was favourable to ID noting, amongst other things, that "there are no concerns re his management or level of involvements with centre programs and he is making full use of what is available". Ms Harwood concluded her report as follows: "ID does not present as a confident or mature 19 year old. He is very anxious re the possibility of being transferred to the adult system; especially due to his charges being of a sexual nature and the fact his adult co-offender is in the adult system. ID has concerns his co-offender and other inmates will target him and make completing his Year 12 difficult.

ID believes his schooling, opportunities for community integration through outings and leave and, eventual rehabilitation will be far better achieved through maintaining his positive progress in the juvenile detention environment. The author strongly supports ID's concerns and request to remain in the juvenile justice system." I infer that this is the report about which Mr Stephens complained in his email of 13 March 2008 as containing a "personal view" (see [50] above). At this point, I should note other evidence admitted concerning Ms Harwood and her report concerning ID. I referred earlier at [62] to Ms Cowper's evidence of general comments made by Ms Harwood on about 18 April 2008 concerning DJJ processes for transfer of s.19 detainees. I admitted into evidence in the
Plaintiffs' case, paragraph 18 of a further affidavit of Rebecca Cowper also sworn 9 May 2008. On 18 April 2008, Ms Cowper was informed by Ms Harwood that she (Ms Harwood) was instructed by her superiors at DJJ as follows: she was required to prepare a report on ID prior to his transfer to an adult correctional centre; she included in this report a recommendation that ID not be transferred to an adult correctional centre, supported by excerpts from the sentencing decision of his Honour Judge Nicholson SC; and she was instructed by her superiors to change this report to delete all quotes from the sentencing decision and all other recommendations as to ID's unsuitability for transfer.
 I accept that Ms Cowper has set out a truthful and accurate account of what
Ms Harwood told her on 18 April 2008.
 As mentioned earlier, a joint report of Ms Ruscheinsky and Mr Reberger dated 18 March 2008 accompanied the briefing note to the Acting Director-
General concerning ID (Exhibit A, pages 93-94). That report observed that ID had "made considerable progress with his rehabilitation" and had "engaged in counselling to address offending related issues and committed himself to pursuing his education by undertaking Year 12 studies". The authors stated that ID was "a mature, compliant and well-behaved detainee who consistently achieves the highest level of the Centre's incentive system" and was housed in the most privileged of the Centre's units "where detainees are afforded more independence and personal responsibility". It was observed that, according to his primary worker (I infer this is a reference to Ms Harwood),
ID had responded well to counselling and "was committed to addressing his offending behaviour". It was observed that ID had "expressed some anxiety about transferring to the adult correctional system which relates to the nature of his offence and the possibility of being housed with his co- offender". The report made no recommendation concerning possible transfer.
 A further joint report from Ms Ruscheinsky and Mr Reberger dated 19 March (Exhibit A, page 96) provided information concerning ID's involvement in specific sex offender counselling at Baxter. It spoke in positive terms of
ID's engagement in regular counselling and noted that he was awaiting reallocation to a new sex offender counsellor as the position was currently vacant.
 The lengthy sentencing remarks of his Honour Judge Nicholson SC dated 25
January 2007, comprising 212 paragraphs over 76 pages (concerning ID and his co-offender, ON) were provided to the First Defendant, together with his
Honour's short additional remarks on sentence of 16 February 2007 wherein an adjustment was made to provide that the non-parole period would expire on 15
May 2009.

Findings Concerning the ID Transfer Process It is noteworthy that the committal summary prepared by Troy Davis, youth officer, Ms Ciko and Mr Reberger (Exhibit A, pages 85-91) is addressed to the
Convenor, Gaol Classification Committee, DCS and is described as a submission to the DCS. The report of Ms Harwood (Exhibit A, page 92) and the reports of
Ms Ruscheinsky and Mr Reberger dated 18 March 2008 (Exhibit A, pages 93-94) and 19 March 2008 (Exhibit A, page 96) are all addressed to the Convenor,
Classification Office, DCS.
 The First Defendant is the decision maker under s.28, with the consent of the Second Defendant being a precondition to transfer only. Of course, it is understandable that the process of consideration of s.28 transfers involves participation, to some extent, of DCS personnel. The First Defendant needs to be informed of resources and facilities available within the DCS which may bear upon the transfer decision in a particular case. A proposal concerning a particular detainee, and what is expected to happen if transfer takes place, is obviously relevant.
 That said, the process leading to and following the Case Management
Committee meeting on 20 March 2008 indicates that DCS personnel are playing a decisive role in the s.28 process. The inference is clearly available, and ought be drawn, that DJJ personnel are offering detainees for transfer and that transfer will occur unless the DCS refuses to take them. Such a process does not accord with the statutory scheme. I am reinforced in this conclusion by the emails dated 25 February 2008, 1 March 2008, 13 March 2008 and 16 March referred to at [48] to [51] above.
 The manner in which these documents are addressed, together with their contents, the emails and the statements made by various DJJ personnel to Ms
Cowper referred to earlier in this judgment, fortifies a conclusion that the
First Defendant was being presented with a fait accompli.
 The First Defendant has not adduced evidence in the proceedings, apart from that of Ms Rusis who made quite clear that she can speak in general terms only and had no part in the decision making concerning the Plaintiffs.
 I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that DJJ officers selected
ID for consideration of transfer with the only impediment to potential transfer being refusal by DCS to accept him. Once DCS officers determined to accept him, it was inevitable that a s.28 transfer order would be made.
 There is further evidence that bears upon the question of legal advice. On May 2008, Ms Harwood sent an email to Ms Ciko to the following effect (Exhibit A, page 64): "on 20th March, after the Corrective Services had spoken to the detainees effected by the section 28 transfers, advise [sic] was given to counselling staff if any of the boys wish to speak to Legal Aid/their solicitors regarding the transfers it should be arranged for them. I was asked to follow up with [ID] as his counsellor had resigned, the other boys counsellors were also not available - (Maree) had to leave the Centre that day, Karen wasn't working that day and Fiona was acting up in your position. I cannot recall who the four or five boys were as they were not my clients. I arranged for the boys who wanted to speak to Legal Aid to do it as a group, putting their names down with the Hotline to discuss the matter with a solicitor when available. As it was the thursday before Easter the boys were advised Legal Aid would call back after the long weekend. Legal Aid rang me back to ask what was happening and what were the boys concerns, I explained what was happening re transfers to gaol.

I did not release any information of files etc, I was asked for copies of information for [ID] but advised I could not do that." This evidence supports a conclusion that Ms Harwood suggested ID contact
Legal Aid and that he attempted to do so. Further, and importantly, although
Ms Harwood provided some information over the telephone as to what was happening, information from DJJ files was refused, despite the solicitor's request for such information.  
The Case of PF PF was born on 19 December 1989. On 30 August 2007, he was sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge CJ Armitage for an offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s.33 [Crimes
Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The offence was committed on 11 January 2007 when PF was 17 years old. He was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years to commence on 12 January 2007 and to expire on 11 January 2009 with a balance of term of two years to date from 12 January 2009 and to expire on 11 January
His Honour found special circumstances for the purpose of s.19 CCP Act and ordered that the entirety of the sentence be served as a juvenile offender.
 Neither the Crown nor PF appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning sentence.
 On 13 January 2007, PF was admitted into Cobham Juvenile Justice Centre and, on 6 September 2007, he was transferred to Baxter.
 It is the unchallenged evidence of PF (paragraphs 14-28 of his affidavit of 7 August 2007) that he has progressed well at Baxter, including areas of education, training, counselling and therapeutic treatment. He had regular and strong support from his family with his mother and two sisters visiting weekly and his father and cousins visiting fortnightly. In addition, PF had health issues in that he was born with a leaky heart valve and has a rheumatic heart disease which was closely monitored at Baxter or, when necessary, at an outside hospital. In addition, he sustained an eye injury whilst in custody.

Events Leading to Transfer of PF PF states that, on about 19 March 2008, Ms Ciko approached him and some other detainees of Pacific Islander origin. She had a conversation with him to the following effect (paragraph 29 of his affidavit): "Ms Ciko: You are on the list to go to adult gaol. You probably wont be going for another month. Do you want to go to gaol or do you want to stay? 
PF: Does it make a difference if I say I don't want to go? 
Ms Ciko: It doesn't make a difference but we need to know anyway." This was the first time that PF became aware that he would be transferred to an adult gaol.
 On about 21 March 2008, PF had a conversation with Mr Buxton, the Unit
Manager at Baxter, to the following effect: "Mr Buxton: There's a form in the office for you to fill. 
PF: What is it? 
Mr Baxton: It's the gaol form to give your reasons why you don't want to stay [sic].

PF: Give it to someone else who's going to use it." In his affidavit (paragraph 31), PF explained that he did not fill in the form offered by Mr Buxton because: he had made it clear to Baxter staff members that he did not consent to or request a transfer to an adult correctional centre; he had seen other detainees complete the form who had still been transferred to an adult gaol; he had the impression that management at DJJ had decided they were going to transfer him to an adult gaol anyway based on his conversation with
Ms Ciko.
 On or about Monday, 7 April 2008, Ms Ciko approached PF and the following conversation ensued: "Ms Ciko: You are going to have your interview with Corrections this
Friday. Do you want to have a family member there? 
PF: Yes, I want my Aunty [xxx] there." In a process similar to ID, a Case Management Committee meeting concerning
PF took place on Thursday, 10 April 2008. The Committee comprised Ms Ciko, Mr
Stephens and Mr Townsend (Exhibit A, pages 101-103). PF was in attendance together with Ms Hilton, psychologist. PF did not have any family members at the meeting as he had requested, nor did he have a legal representative with him at the meeting.
 It is PF's unchallenged evidence that a number of things were said during the Case Management Committee meeting (paragraphs 34-38, PF affidavit). PF was informed that medical transfers for his heart condition and eye injury would take place in the same way as in juvenile detention. A DCS officer explained to PF what would happen in adult gaol in the following way: "Officer: You will probably be classified as C1 and go to Silverwater for three or four days, then to Long Bay because parole will probably want to see that you have done CUBIT, the sex offenders' program.

PF: I didn't come in for this and should be working alcohol and other drugs and anger management. Why should I go to Long Bay when I'm not in here for a sex offence?" According to PF, the officer did not respond to this query. I interpolate here that it was the fact that PF had been released on two years' probation by the Children's Court on 16 April 2007 for two offences of committing an act of indecency with a person under 16 years, upon condition that he be of good behaviour and accept DJJ supervision and, in particular, counselling to address sex offending behaviour, alcohol and other drugs and associated issues (Exhibit A, page 128).
 As PF was not serving a sentence of imprisonment for that offence as at 10
April 2008 (or at all), it is difficult to see how those offences (dealt with by way of a probation order) could give rise to an obligation to undertake
CUBIT in an adult prison, in particular where that process might prolong his period in custody for other offences.
 Again, according to PF's unchallenged evidence, during this meeting he asked the DCS officer about his parole: "PF: I don't have long to go, will I get my parole? 
Officer: You might have to finish CUBIT before you get parole which could take about 18 months." There is support for PF's account on this issue in an email, dated 15
April 2008, from Ms Ciko to Ms Byers (Exhibit A, page 39). Ms Ciko stated that "if [PF] has to do the VOP [Violent Offenders Program] and SOP [Sex
Offenders Program] programmes in Corrective Services prior to discharge this could potentially extend his time in custody, as the SOP program is could [sic] be up to 18 months, depending on their assessments".
 PF raised his leave entitlements with the DCS officer at the meeting: "PF: I'm coming up for leave soon. Will I be able to get that in adult gaol? 
Officer: No, you can only get day leave or work release if you are classified as C3." During the meeting, PF was asked where he had been born and he replied "New Zealand". At no time during the meeting was there any discussion concerning his citizenship.
 On 24 April 2008, PF was transferred from Baxter to the MRRC at
Silverwater Correctional Complex. On 14 May 2008, he was transferred from MRRC to Parramatta Correctional Centre. On 19 May 2008, he was transferred from
Parramatta Correctional Centre to the John Morony Correctional Centre where he currently remains.
 PF states that, prior to his transfer to an adult prison: he was not personally interviewed or assessed by an officer of DJJ as to his suitability for transfer to an adult correctional centre; there were no meetings between PF, his family and DJJ staff such as his case workers and juvenile justice officer to discuss his case plan, immigration status, classification and placement; he was not given the opportunity to have legal representation to assist him to provide submissions or with the decision to transfer him generally.
 An email from Ms Ciko dated 15 April 2008 (Exhibit A, page 39) stated that "All boys [including PF] were offered to get legal advice when they were told about the meeting last Monday 7 April. All the Islander boys saw a Legal
Aide [sic] that Monday afternoon. All boys were asked if they did want to go to Corrective Services on Monday and at interview - all boys stated they did not want to go to Corrective Services and requested to stay at Frank Baxter
JJC". Thus, the contemporaneous documentary evidence indicates that PF did obtain some legal advice concerning the potential s.28 transfer prior to the meeting on 10 April 2008.

Documents Provided to First Defendant In the same way as with ID, a briefing note dated 18 April 2008 was prepared by Ms Murphy concerning the proposed transfer of PF under s.28 (Exhibit A, pages 104-106). Apart from the warrant of commitment and other draft documents, the following documents were attached to the briefing note: a submission to the DCS and committal summary prepared by Mr Davis, Ms
Ciko and Steve Wilson, the Baxter Centre Manager (Exhibit A, pages 111-119); a psychological report co-signed by Maree Hilton, psychologist, Ms Ciko and Mr Wilson (Exhibit A, pages 120-124); the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge CJ Armitage dated 30 August (Exhibit A, page 133).
 The briefing note concerning PF had a similar format to that used for ID.
Under the heading "Background", it was stated that PF had been identified earlier in 2008 as a detainee "who potentially meets the criteria for transfer to a correctional centre". It was noted that PF had not been legally represented at the Case Management Committee meeting but stated that "having been advised that he was being considered for transfer to a Correctional
Centre, he did meet with the Children's Legal Services solicitor in the week prior to the meeting of 10 April 2008".  The briefing note included details of PF's convictions and sentences.
Under the heading "Comment", the following appeared (Exhibit A, page 105): "* Detainee [PF] has been sentenced to imprisonment in relation to indictable offences of a serious nature, which involves grievous bodily harm to an individual.
 * The department is currently experiencing high numbers in custody and a limited number of beds are available. The bed shortage poses potential risks to the safety and wellbeing of other detainees and may pose OH&S risks for staff in managing the high number of detainees.
 * These potential risks should be balanced against the circumstances of the particular detainee, the nature of his offending and his demonstrated behaviour in the detention centre.
 * Detainee [PF] verbally stated that he does not wish to be transferred but has elected not to complete a detainee statement letter regarding being transferred to the Department of Corrective Services.
 * Detainee [PF] has cardiac condition and an eye injury that requires ongoing monitoring by Justice Health. If detainee [PF] is transferred to an adult correctional centre, Justice Health will be able to provide that ongoing monitoring.
 * Detainee [PF] is generally well behaved at Frank Baxter JJC and is currently undertaking an Air Brushing course though the centre school.
 * DCS State Coordinator advises that if detainee [PF] is transferred to an adult correctional centre his pathway is the Metropolitan Regional Remand
Centre (MRRC) at Silverwater for initial assessment. Due to the probation order for the act of indecency, he may be required to be assessed for the Sex
Offender Program at Long Bay. He could eventually go to the Young Offender
Program at John Moroney 1 or Oberon Correctional Centre.
 * Detainee [PF] has completed a basic module of an Air Brushing course while at Baxter JJC. He will be able to pursue a vocational pathway but will not be able to complete the Air Brushing course while in adult custody.
 * After an initial period of being unsettled in custody, detainee [PF] is generally well behaved and making positive progress towards his rehabilitation."  The authors of the briefing note recommended, for the reasons given in the briefing note, that the First Defendant make a transfer order under s.28 with respect to PF. Mr Muir, the Acting Director-General, signed the briefing note on 21 April 2008. On 23 April 2008, the Second Defendant consented to the transfer of PF and, on the same date, Mr Muir directed that PF be transferred under s.28 to an adult correctional centre (Exhibit A, page 108). In a letter to the Second Defendant dated 21 April 2008, Mr Muir stated that he was "satisfied that it is appropriate that I make an order" under s.28 transferring PF to an adult correctional centre (Exhibit A, page 107). No further reasons were provided by the First Defendant for the decision.
 The submission to the DCS and committal summary stated that there were behavioural difficulties with PF at Cobham Juvenile Justice Centre, but there was an improvement in his behaviour since his transfer to Baxter on 6
September 2007. Due to improvement in his conduct, PF was transferred on 12
February 2008 to one of the more privileged units in Baxter where he remained up to his transfer to a prison. With respect to program participation, all reports from the school had indicated that PF "displays a mature and positive attitude towards his programs". PF had been approved to participate in all high-risk programs within the Centre environment and he was said to display "a high level of sportsmanship" and was considered by unit staff to be "a mature individual who was polite and co-operative and demonstrates a commitment to improve his skills and knowledge whilst in custody". It was said that PF experienced support from his immediate and extended family whilst in custody through visits and regular telephone contact.
 Mention was made of PF's "ongoing cardiac condition" and treatment which had been provided to him. It was said that PF had "participated in regular counselling as required" and had been engaged in counselling with Ms Hilton, the Baxter psychologist, since 2007. The submission concluded with a summary noting that PF had improved his behaviour since his transfer to Baxter and that he would "benefit from attending the Young Offenders Programme and
Sexual Offenders Programme should he be transferred". It was noted that PF had stated that he wished to stay in the care of DJJ and had elected not to complete a detainee statement in regards to transfer to the DCS.
 The psychological report by Ms Hilton (Exhibit A, pages 120-124) referred to PF's family background and behaviour in custody, it being noted that PF "responded well to counselling interventions to address the behaviours described above and a general improvement has been noted". He had made rapid progress through the Baxter units and was then resident in a unit which is second only in privileges to those of the top unit. Staff had reported that he was a "quiet detainee who was compliant with Centre rules and procedures".
His behaviour at school had been "very good".
 Ms Hilton referred to PF's offending history and medical history, alcohol and drug issues and counselling. It was said that PF "appears highly motivated to change his offending behaviour". Ms Hilton said that PF had responded to cognitive behavioural interventions to manage his aggression and had learned about the link between his experience of family violence, and his own violence and that some of his aggression was peer driven and that he was developing greater awareness of this. At that time, PF was in week four of an eight-week anger management group in which he had participated well and was "a positive role model for the younger detainees in the group". It was said that PF had the "ability to use positive coping strategies" and that his progress in counselling had been "excellent", but was incomplete. Ms Hilton said that he would benefit by ongoing counselling for his substance abuse, trauma and peer relationships.
 Ms Hilton said that PF was a young man who had been significantly affected by his experience of family violence and the constant disruptions to his family life. During his time at Baxter, PF had shown "that he is motivated to change his offending behaviour" with this being demonstrated by his "positive behaviour, his commitment to his counselling program and his involvement in Centre programs and activities". He had "responded well to all aspects of his custodial sentence" at Baxter. He was assessed as being at low risk of violence and he appeared "highly motivated to change and has strengths that will increase his chances of successful rehabilitation".
 The report concluded that, should he be transferred to DCS, PF would benefit from being involved in vocational studies to enhance his opportunities for employment on discharge and that the gains that he had made in his counselling program should be reinforced with a focus on his substance abuse issues, family issues and trauma and peer relationships.
 The report of the Case Management Committee meeting on 10 April 2008 concerning PF included the following under the heading "Background" (Exhibit
A, page 101): "Detainee [PF] has participated in programs and all reports indicates that he displays a positive and mature attitude towards learning.

Due to being on a section 19 order and over 18 years of age the DJJ has determined that detainee [PF] should be transferred to the Department of
Corrective Services on a section 28 (2) order as requested by the Director
General of (DJJ). This section 28 (2) order must be approved by the
Commissioner, Department of Corrective Services." (my emphasis) The recommendations of the Case Management Committee were as follows (Exhibit A, page 102): "Prior to being moved to his gaol of placement detainee [PF] is to be transferred to Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre to undertake the DCS screening, reception, induction and classification process. Due to his length of sentence and his earliest possible release date of 28/02/2010 we are recommending that he be classified as a C1 inmate upon transfer to the
Department of Corrective Services. It is recommended that he be assessed for the Sex Offenders Program at Long Bay Correctional Complex due to the offences of committing an act of indecency with a person under 16 years of age on two occasions. Following this assessment and if time permits we recommend his placement in the Specialised Program for young adult male offenders at John
Morony [sic] 1 or Oberon correctional centre.

In regards to other program participation it is recommended that detainee [PF] continue with Drug and Alcohol intervention upon transfer to the
Department of Corrective Services and also whilst on parole." 
Findings Concerning the PF Transfer Process As with ID, the documents attached to the briefing note to the First
Defendant were all themselves addressed to the DCS. Having examined the documents, I infer that there was an air of inevitability concerning the outcome of the s.28 determination. It was a fait accompli before it reached the First Defendant.
 It is the case that much favourable material concerning PF was included in the documents provided to the First Defendant. However, it was desired to free up space at Baxter. The inference to be drawn is that a s.28 transfer was inevitable unless there were strong factors demonstrating that transfer should not happen, with DCS officers being the effective decision makers in this respect.

The Case of DV DV was born on 19 April 1989. On 24 April 2007, he was sentenced in the
District Court by his Honour Judge Ellis for a number of offences of armed robbery committed in January 2006. The total effective sentence of imprisonment passed by his Honour comprised a non-parole period of three years and three months to date from 25 January 2006 and to expire on 24 April 2009, with an additional term of three years to date from 25 April 2009 and to expire on 24 April 2012. His Honour found special circumstances and gave a direction under s.19 CPP Act that the sentences be served in a DJJ institution.
 Neither the Crown nor DV appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning sentence.
 According to DV's affidavit (paragraph 9), he relied on the sentencing comments of his Honour Judge Ellis relating to the s.19 order, and expected that he would serve the whole of his non-parole period in juvenile detention and not be transferred unless he misbehaved, requested a transfer or felt he no longer needed the services offered by DJJ.
 DV was placed in DJJ custody for the first time for these offences on about 25 January 2006. He was transferred to Baxter on about 6 November 2006.
 DV's affidavit contains unchallenged material concerning his very substantial progress in juvenile detention since November 2006, including community involvement, education, participation in rehabilitative programs and family support (paragraphs 11-21).

Events Leading to Transfer of DV On or about 19 March 2008, DV's psychologist, Karen Clarke, and Ashley
Hardes, Unit Manager at Baxter, came to see DV. Ms Clarke informed DV that he was "on the list of boys who are going to be transferred to adult gaol". Mr
Hardes handed DV a form entitled "Detainee Does Not Request Transfer to
Department of Corrective Services" and the following conversation ensued: "DV: Is it going to make a difference to the decision to transfer me whether I fill in the form or not? 
Mr Hardes: To be honest, no, not really." DV states that, based on his conversation with Mr Hardes and having seen other detainees being transferred to adult prison after filling in this form, he was not sure what to write. In the end, he simply wrote "legal advice" on the form. On the same document, Mr Hardes noted that DV "does not wish to make comment".
 On 10 April 2008, a Case Management Committee meeting took place concerning DV (Exhibit A, pages 137-139). Ms Ciko, Mr Stephens and Mr Townsend were present. DV was present but states that he did not have any family members present, nor did he have a legal representative in attendance at the meeting (paragraph 24).
 DV stated in his affidavit at paragraph 23, by reference to the form upon which he wrote the words "legal advice", "I had still not seen any lawyers about the form at that stage".
 DV states that, during the meeting on 10 April 2008, he was informed by a
DCS officer that he would be going to Silverwater and then on to John Morony for a few months, and then on to Oberon where he could take part in the Young
Adult Offender Program. During the meeting, DV asked what was to happen to his education as he was doing Year 11 through the Sydney Distance Education High
School at that time. The DCS officer replied "You should be all right, John
Morony has a school. You should be able to continue your education".
 The DCS officer asked DV whether he was an Australian citizen, to which he responded he was a resident, but was born in New Zealand.

Documents Provided to First Defendant In accordance with the practice adopted with ID and PF, a briefing note was prepared by Ms Murphy on 18 April 2008 concerning the transfer of DV (Exhibit A, pages 140-142). The Acting Director-General, Mr Muir, signed the briefing note on 18 April 2008. Attached to the briefing note were the following: 
DV's form dated 19 March 2008 bearing the words "legal advice" (Exhibit A, page 144); submission to the DCS and committal summary prepared by Mr Hardes, Ms
Ciko and Mr Wilson dated 27 March 2008 (Exhibit A, pages 145-151); remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Ellis dated 24 April 2007 (Exhibit A, page 171); psychological report concerning DV prepared by Ms Clarke, psychologist, dated 26 March 2008 (Exhibit A, pages 152-158).
 Once again, the briefing note observed that DV "was identified earlier this year as a detainee who potentially meets the criteria for transfer to a correctional centre". After mention of the Case Management Committee meeting with DV on 10 April 2008, it was observed (Exhibit A, page 140): "[DV] was not legally represented at the Case Management Committee.
However, having been advised that he was being considered for transfer to a
Correctional Centre, he did meet with the Children's Legal Services solicitor in the week prior to the meeting of 10 April 2008." The briefing note contained the following: "COMMENT: * Detainee [DV] has been sentenced to imprisonment in relation to indictable offences of a serious nature.
 * The department is currently experiencing high numbers in custody and a limited number of beds are available. The bed shortage poses potential risks to the safety and wellbeing of other detainees and may pose OH&S risks for staff in managing the high number of detainees.
 * These potential risks should be balanced against the circumstances of the particular detainee and his demonstrated behaviour in the detention centre.
 * Detainee [DV] is currently undertaking Year 11 studies through OTEN with the view to completing his HSC next year.
 * DCS State Coordinator advises that if detainee [DV] is transferred to an adult correctional centre his pathway is the Metropolitan Regional Remand
Centre (MRRC) at Silverwater for initial assessment, then he will go to The
Young Offender Program at John Moroney 1 and then possibly Oberon
Correctional Centre.
 * Detainee [DV] will be able to continue his Year 11 Studies through
OTEN with DCS and then undertake his Year 12 through TAFE on release. It will also be recommended that detainee [DV] attend the AOD counselling.
 * Detainee [DV] has elected not to complete a detainee statement letter regarding a transfer to the Department of Corrective Services. He has written 'Legal advice' on the form provided.
 * Detainee [DV] is generally well behaved at Baxter JJC and making positive progress towards his rehabilitation." The briefing note recommended that "for the reasons given in this briefing note" the Acting Director-General should make an order under s.28 for the transfer of DV to an adult correctional centre (Exhibit A, page 142).
Mr Muir signed and dated the briefing note that day and, on the same day, wrote to the Second Defendant observing that he was "satisfied" that DV warrants an order under s.28 and seeking the Second Defendant's consent to the transfer before making the order (Exhibit A, page 143). No reasons were provided by the First Defendant for the decision.
 The submission to the DCS and committal summary observed that, whilst at
Baxter, DV had "proven he is able to maintain very good consistent behaviour over a significant period, although he has been the subject of three minor misbehaviour reports" (Exhibit A, page 147). His behaviour had enabled him to participate in community service outings and various community-based sporting activities. With respect to program participation, it stated that DV was currently enrolled in Year 11 studies and that "reports from teachers have always been positive about his behaviour, and his commitment and application to his work" and that he completed Year 10 studies in 2007 (Exhibit A, page ).
 It was stated that DV had participated in community service programs and outings including mowing lawns and maintaining gardens at cemeteries, fire stations and public sporting centres and that DV had taken "an active role in programs that help children with disabilities and provide a voluntary service to the community such as surf life saving and maintaining a national park" (Exhibit A, page 149). All reports had indicated that DV "displays a high level of sportsmanship and maturity whilst on outings" and is "reported to be highly proficient at all sports" and that "staff and peers have considered [DV] to be a great role model for other detainees". DV had participated in 30 outings without incident (Exhibit A, page 149).
 It was noted that DV received strong support from his family who were able to visit on a fortnightly basis and that he kept in regular contact by mail and telephone.
 The authors of the submission concluded with the following summary (Exhibit A, page 150): "[DV] has been able to demonstrate that he has the ability and willingness to participate and benefit from the educational opportunities offered by Girrakool School. He has partaken in many community service outings and community sporting outings. [DV] has progressed to the most privileged unit at Frank Baxter JJC through the Centre based incentive program. His overall behaviour and ability to comfortably partake in the programs offered at Baxter JJC has rewarded him with B2 classification." The psychological report of Ms Clarke outlined DV's background and his functioning at Baxter, following transfer there on 16 November 2006. The report outlined favourably his education efforts and good family support (Exhibit A, page 155). Ms Clarke observed that DV was a "likable young man" who appeared to have been compromised during his formative years and early adolescence as a result of a number of factors, including family discord, domestic violence, difficulties assimilating to a new country and cultural and financial hardship (Exhibit A, page 155).
 Ms Clarke provided the following analysis concerning development issues and the impact of incarceration, before moving to recommendations concerning
DV (Exhibit A, pages 156-158): "Adolescence is a difficult period, requiring a lot of adjustment and learning, however many have inbuilt protective factors to assist in this process. It appears [DV] did not have significant protective factors however he had many risk factors. Risk factors can be broken down into five categories and it would appear that [DV] had a number of factors from each of the categories. Categories include child factors, family factors, school context, life events and community and cultural factors.

When a young person is incarcerated, their ability to move through their developmental stages is significantly compromised. [DV] was incarcerated during his middle adolescence development. Now in the late adolescent phase he has been expected to move through both phases whilst incarcerated.

During the latter stage of development it is expected that a person display the following: In terms of movement towards independence the characteristics of this is a firmer identity, ability to delay gratification, ability to think ideas through, ability to express feelings in words, more developed sense of humour, stable interests, greater emotional stability, ability to make independent decisions, ability to compromise, pride in one's work, self reliance and a greater concern for others. There is evidence that over time [DV] has developed and displayed many of these characteristics, however, there is also evidence that he has not achieved proficiency in all the areas. It is worth noting that proficiency in all these areas is not achievable whilst in a custodial environment.

In terms of adolescent sexual development, it appears that he has achieved the appropriate levels for his age. He appears clear about his sexual identity, and relationships and all that encompasses.

Characteristics that should be noticeable during this period if [DV's] development in terms of ethics' and direction include; capable of useful insight, stress on personal dignity and self esteem, ability to set goals and follow through, acceptance of social institutions and cultural traditions and self-regulation of self-esteem. [DV] has demonstrated many of these characteristics, and is still developing them.

In summary, [DV] is very self-focused in his efforts to achieve desirable outcomes. He appears to be able most of the time to delay gratification and compromise and use insight as a way of learning from past experiences. He appears to have achieved movement through many of the tasks mentioned. Overall, though he does appear to be moving through his developmental pathway at a rate that would be described as appropriate given his circumstances. Young people vary slightly from the above descriptions.

In conclusion, [DV] is a young man, who experienced some trauma and dysfunction in his life, is incarcerated for serious violent offences and is attempting to capitalize on opportunities that are available in custody such as pursuing education, appropriate qualifications/certificates, counselling and therapeutic programs.

Recommendations [DV] has utilised the programs available at Baxter Juvenile Justice
Centre. He is realistic, yet anxious about transferring to the adult system.
He is currently maximising the benefits including access to individual counselling available for him here. However, [DV] would benefit from an ongoing consistent therapeutic relationship to continue the positive progress he has made to date. Specifically areas to address include further development of his attitudes and behaviour - both covert and overt around violence, his substance abuse, self-worth, taking responsibility for his actions awareness of negative peer associations, victim empathy as well as communication skills." On 23 April 2008, DV was transferred from Baxter to the MRRC at the
Silverwater Correctional Complex. On 2 May 2008, he was transferred from the
MRRC to John Morony Correctional Centre where he presently remains.
 DV states that, prior to his transfer to adult prison: he was not personally interviewed or assessed by an officer of DJJ as to his suitability for transfer to an adult correctional centre; there were no meetings between himself, his family and DJJ staff such as case workers and his juvenile justice officer to discuss his case plan, immigration status, classification and placement; he was not given the opportunity to have legal representation to assist him to provide submissions or the decision to transfer generally.

Findings Concerning the DV Transfer Process As with ID and PF, the documents attached to the briefing note to the
First Defendant were all themselves addressed to the DCS. From reading the documents, I infer there was an air of inevitability concerning the outcome of the s.28 decision. It was, as with ID and PF, a fait accompli.
 There was a substantial body of material favourable to DV before the First
Defendant. However, it was desired to free up space at Baxter. I infer that
DV, from the outset, was destined for transfer unless the DCS did not want him.

Important Findings of Fact  I will draw together a number of findings of fact at this point before moving to the particular grounds for relief.
 I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, of the following factual matters: 
ID, PF and DV were sentenced to terms of imprisonment by District
Court Judges, each of whom made an order under s.19 CCP Act that the sentence of imprisonment be served as a juvenile offender; in each case, the sentencing Judge made a s.19 order after careful consideration of evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing, including a mandatory background report prepared by DJJ officers for the purposes of s.25
CCP Act; 
ID, PF and DV each responded in very positive terms to the education, training, counselling, therapy and other rehabilitative resources and facilities at Baxter; in early 2008, it became apparent that there were accommodation pressures within DJJ facilities due to increased numbers of detainees - as a result, a view was taken that s.19 detainees over the age of 18 years would be transferred to adult correctional centres unless the DCS determined that transfer should not occur; a number of detainees, including ID, PF and DV, were listed for intended transfer subject to DCS assessment; a process was put in place where material would be gathered, but with a general instruction that recommendations that detainees be retained in DJJ facilities ought not be included in DJJ reports; submissions and other documents were prepared addressed to the DCS, and a Case Management Committee meeting took place with respect to each of ID, PF and DV, with the Committee comprising two DCS officers and one DJJ officer - the purpose of this meeting, in each case, was not to make an objective assessment of whether the detainee ought be recommended for transfer - rather, the purpose of the meeting was for DCS officers to determine whether there was any good reason why transfer should not take place; 
ID, PF and DV had some notice (of variable lengths) that a Case
Management Committee meeting was to take place; no effective steps were taken by DJJ officers to have family members of ID, PF or DV present at the meeting; although DJJ officers provided some opportunity for ID, PF and DV to obtain legal advice prior to transfer from the Children's Legal Service (that
Service being partly funded by DJJ), no opportunity was given to each
Plaintiff to have a solicitor present at the meeting; to the extent that there was any contact between Children's Legal
Service solicitors and DJJ officers before transfer of ID, PF and DV, DJJ officers declined to provide relevant documents to solicitors; although there was some opportunity for the Plaintiffs to seek advice from the Children's Legal Service, that opportunity did not involve any access to relevant DJJ documents which would assist the provision of advice or the preparation of meaningful submissions which could be made on behalf of the
Plaintiffs; a briefing note, accompanied by other documents, was prepared for the
First Defendant for a formal s.28 process - in each case, a strong body of material was available pointing to the progress made by ID, PF and DV in juvenile detention and, inferentially, the substantial merit in continuation of those persons in juvenile detention - in each case, however, the First
Defendant accepted the recommendation for a s.28 transfer arising from a process which was effectively controlled by DCS officers; it was open to DJJ to furnish the documents referred to at (m) to ID,
PF and DV and their solicitors before any decision was made, and there was no good reason why that could not be done; no reasons were given by the First Defendant for the s.28 order concerning each of ID, PF and DV - it ought be inferred that the reason for transfer, in each case, was a desire to reduce detainee numbers in juvenile detention and an acceptance that no good reason had been demonstrated to DCS why transfer of ID, PF and DV to an adult correctional facility ought not take place; at the time of the transfer of ID, PF and DV, it was the case that each of them had taken substantial steps towards rehabilitation and that each would maintain a course towards rehabilitation if permitted to have continuing use of resources and facilities at Baxter; the transfer of each of ID, PF and DV to an adult prison had, at the very least, a strong likelihood of actual detriment to their prospects of rehabilitation given the lesser facilities available in adult prisons in the area of education, training and other rehabilitative measures, and the cessation of rehabilitative programs and relationships that each Plaintiff had at Baxter; in addition, there was a likely additional detriment applicable to ID and PF given a DCS requirement to undertake the CUBIT program in adult prison (although PF was not serving a sentence for a sex offence) and the expected delay before a vacancy would arise in the CUBIT program, together with a potentially more restrictive approach to parole which might be taken by the
State Parole Authority under the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/) ("CAS
Act") as opposed to the Children's Court, which administers parole to juvenile detainees.
 It is necessary to turn to the grounds for relief advanced by the
Plaintiffs.  
Is There an Obligation to Accord Procedural Fairness to the Plaintiffs? Mr Haesler SC submits that ID, PF and DV were each entitled to be accorded procedural fairness by the First Defendant before any decision was made directing the transfer of each of them under s.28 from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre. Mr Leeming SC submits that there was no obligation to accord procedural fairness in this case. It is convenient to first outline the submissions of the First Defendant concerning this issue.

Submissions of First Defendant Mr Leeming SC accepted that, since Kioa versus West <case>; [(1985) 159 CLR 550], the common law generally imports an obligation of procedural fairness whenever an individual's rights are affected: see, for example,
Vanmeld Pty Limited versus Fairfield City Council <case>; [(1999) 46 NSWLR 78] at 91-92; Jarratt versus Commissioner of Police for NSW <case>; [[2005] 224 CLR 44] at 55-57 <case>- <case>. He submitted, however, that there has long been established an exception relating to the administration and management of prisons. Reference was made to Smith v Commissioner for Corrective Services [(1979) 1 NSWLR 317] at 329, where Hutley JA (Moffitt P and Glass JA agreeing) said that the Prisons Act and Prisons Regulations 1968, insofar as they dealt with reclassification of prisoners, did not give rise to private rights enforceable in the ordinary courts. In expressing this view, Hutley JA (at 328) applied the following statement of Dixon J in Flynn versus The King <case>; [(1949) 79 CLR 1] at 8: "It is pointed out in the case of Horwitz versus Connor <case>; [(1908) 6 CLR 38] that if prisoners could resort to legal remedies to enforce gaol regulations responsibility for the discipline and control of prisoners in gaol would be in some measure transferred to the courts administering justice.
For if statutes dealing with this subject matter were construed as intending to confer the fixed legal rights upon prisoners it would result in applications to the courts by prisoners for legal remedies addressed either to the Crown or to the gaolers in whose custody they remain." Reference was made by Mr Leeming SC to the decision of Dunford J in
Modica versus Commissioner for Corrective Services [(1994) 77 A Crim R .] There, his Honour considered an administrative law challenge to a decision to transfer a plaintiff from the Special Purposes Centre, Long
Bay, to another prison upon the basis that he no longer met the criteria for remaining at the Centre. Dunford J said at 87-88: "Generally the court will be reluctant to interfere in the discipline, administration or management of prisoners: Smith versus Commissioner for
Corrective Services [(1978) 1 NSWLR 317] at 328 citing Flynn versus The King [(1979) CLR 1] at 7. The court refused to intervene in relation to the hours of confinement of prisoners in
Vezitis versus McGeechan [(1974) 1 NSWLR 718] or in
Bromley versus Dawes [(1983) 34 SASR 73] (transfer within a prison) but there is authority that the decisions relating to individual prisoners are subject to judicial review if made in bad faith or for improper purposes: McEvoy versus Lobban [[1990] 2 Qd R 235] at 240 per Thomas J, although relief was refused in that particular case. See also
Re Walker [[1993] 2 Qd R 345] (transfer to another prison) where the court also refused to interfere, but not on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to do so in an appropriate case.
 
In England, administrative law relief has been granted in non-disciplinary cases relating to prisoners including R versus Secretary of State for the Home
Department; ex parte Herbage (No 2) [[1987] 1 QB 1077] and Re
Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison; ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58." Mr Leeming SC referred to the decision of Hulme J in Panayotov v
Commissioner of Corrective Services (10 November 1999, unreported) as the most recent authority applying, inter alia, Smith versus Commissioner for
Corrective Services and Vezitis versus McGeechan [(1974) 1 NSWLR 718.] In the context of an administrative law challenge to a change in prisoner classification, Hulme J observed (at page 5) that there was nothing in the
Correctional Centres Act 1952 or the Correctional Centres (General)
Regulation 1995 which expressly excluded the principles of natural justice in the context of a prisoner reclassification decision. Hulme J referred to
McEvoy versus Lobban [[1990] 2 Qd R 235] and Re
Walker [[1993] 2 Qd R 345] with respect to the making of managerial decisions inside a prison. His Honour then observed (at pages 6-7): "It must be acknowledged that the remarks in both of those cases are not completely apposite here. One might legitimately argue that the classification of prisoners is not precisely described as a managerial decision. On the other hand when one has regard to the difference in criteria between the various classifications, there is certainly some parallel. The prison authorities have the responsibility of keeping offenders committed to their care and custody and the fact that they may at different times take different views as to the restrictions which need to be imposed on individual prisoners is not obviously a situation to which the dictates of natural justice should apply.

One may ask rhetorically: Is the Commissioner required in the case of every prisoner when first committed to his care to embark upon an appropriate enquiry with notification to the prisoner of what should, in terms of classification, occur to him? It does not seem to me, when one looks at the functions of classification and the differences between the categories, that the situation is one to which the doctrines of natural justice apply. By necessary implication I would infer they do not." Hulme J concluded (page 8): "The conclusion at which I have arrived is that on the question of classification the plaintiff was not entitled to have exercised or complain about the non-exercise of the principles of natural justice. Had I reached a different view on that matter the question would have arisen whether I should have, in the exercise of the court's discretion, made the declaration sought.
The reclassification back to C1 which last occurred argues that any such declaration would be a futility. On the other hand, the plaintiff hopes for parole. He has now served some 11 years of a 17 year and four month sentence imposed upon him, the minimum term of that sentence having been nine years.
One might reasonably infer that his history in prison, including his classification there, are matters to which the Parole Board would have regard.
He would thus, it seems to me, have a legitimate interest in having this court correct the classification which should not have been made if otherwise he was entitled to it." The First Defendant acknowledges that the management decisions in those cases were different in their details from the decision under s.28 CDC Act and were made under different statutes, but contends, nevertheless, that there is no basis in principle for distinguishing them. In each case, Mr Leeming SC submits that there were demonstrable losses of rights following upon the exercise of the administrative power. In this case, he submits that the transfer of the Plaintiffs to an adult correctional centre meant that a different regime now applies to them.
 Mr Leeming SC referred to the decision of Studdert J in JMR versus Department of Juvenile Justice  <case>, where an administrative law challenge was made to a decision to move a juvenile detainee from one Juvenile Justice Centre to another. In that case, there appears to have been an acceptance that the duty to accord procedural fairness applied (see [49]-[51]) although his Honour found that no denial of procedural fairness had been established. The First Defendant submits that this decision does not undermine his primary submission (that procedural fairness is not owed to the Plaintiffs) because the point was not argued in
JMR versus Department of Juvenile Justice.
 Mr Leeming SC submits that no legitimate expectation can flow from orders made by sentencing Judges under s.19 CCP Act. He submits that s.19(7), and the note to s.19(1), make it quite plain that s.28 CDC Act overrides s.19 CCP Act.
Further, the High Court has said that the notion of legitimate expectation is of limited utility: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and
Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [[2003] 214 CLR 1] at 27-28 [81]-[82], 36-38 [116]-[121] and 45-48 [140]-[148]; Applicant NAFF of 2002 v
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs <case>; [[2004] 221 CLR 1] at 22-23 <case>.
 The First Defendant contrasts the presence of a specific requirement to comply with the rules of natural justice in s.20(3) CDC Act with the absence of such a requirement in s.28 as a further textual indicator that procedural fairness is not required.
 Mr Leeming SC argues that the Plaintiffs' submission based upon a change of status of the Plaintiffs and their age, does not constitute a sound basis for distinguishing the line of cases culminating in Panayotov versus Commissioner of Corrective Services. Accordingly, the First Defendant submits that there was no obligation to accord the Plaintiffs procedural fairness in this case.

Submissions of the Plaintiffs Mr Haesler SC submits that each of the Plaintiffs was entitled to be accorded procedural fairness in this case.
 The Plaintiffs submit that it is well established that an administrative decision that affects an individual's rights, interests or legitimate expectations will attract a common law duty to accord procedural fairness, unless the rules of natural justice are excluded by plain words or necessary intendment: Annetts versus McCann <case>; [(1990) 170 CLR 596] at 598. From a number of decision of the High Court including
Kioa versus West, Annetts versus McCann and Ainsworth versus Criminal Justice Commission <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 564], the
Plaintiffs submit that it is now settled that the rules of procedural fairness apply generally to governmental executive decision making. They submitted that it is no longer necessary to clarify the decision as one that fits into some set of defined circumstances before a decision maker will be subject to the rules of natural justice. Reference was made to the statement of Basten JA in
Commissioner of Police versus Ryan  <case> at <case> that "the principle that procedural fairness conditions the exercise of a statutory power where the exercise of the power has the capacity to interfere with rights, interests or 'legitimate expectations' of an individual, is now beyond debate".
 Mr Haesler SC submits that the decisions to transfer the Plaintiffs to adult prisons were decisions that potentially destroyed or impaired some right, interest or legitimate expectation of the Plaintiffs. He submits that it is not the nature of the interest that is critical in determining whether the presumption in favour of a fair hearing applies, but rather "the manner in which it is apt to be affected" (Brennan J in Kioa versus West at 619) or, more particularly, whether "the relevant government power or authority was being exercised to [the Plaintiffs'] individual disadvantage" (Deane J in
South Australia versus O'Shea <case>; [(1987) 163 CLR 378] at 417).
 He submits that it is clear that each of the Plaintiffs was potentially seriously disadvantaged by the use of the power under s.28 to move them to an adult correctional centre. In each case, the Plaintiff might well have expected, from the terms of the sentencing order made by the Judge in his case, that he would serve his entire non-parole period in juvenile detention.
 He submits that the Plaintiffs were also entitled to expect that, at a minimum, before any s.28 transfer was made, the First Defendant would comply strictly with the procedures set out in the Minister's Second Reading Speech in the Legislative Assembly, when the legislation under which these decisions were made was introduced. In the Second Reading Speech for the [Children (Detention Centres) Amendment Bill ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/bill/ccab2006350/), Mr McLeay,
Parliamentary Secretary, said (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 23 May 2006, page 166): "Currently, all detainees transferring to the Department of Corrective
Services on a section 19 order are interviewed at least once by the Department of Corrective Services State Co-ordinator, Young Adult Offender Programs, while still placed at a juvenile detention centre. Family and significant others are invited to participate in these meetings, along with juvenile justice program staff. The detainee's case plan, security classification and placement are discussed and confirmed, and an opportunity is provided for the detainee to ask any questions. Details about the adult correctional system and details about the particular correctional centre in which the detainee will be accommodated are also explained." Finally, and critically, Mr Haesler SC submits that the Plaintiffs would have expected that any transfer decision would take into account the statutory objects set out in s.4 CDC Act: "4 Objects of Act 
The objects of this Act are to ensure that: persons on remand or subject to control take their places in the community as soon as possible as persons who will observe the law, in the administration of this Act, sufficient resources are available to enable the object referred to in paragraph (a) to be achieved, and satisfactory relationships are preserved or developed between persons on remand or subject to control and their families.

In the administration of this Act: the welfare and interests of persons on remand or subject to control shall be given paramount consideration, and it shall be recognised that the punishment for an offence imposed by a court is the only punishment for that offence."  With respect to ID, Mr Haesler SC submits that foreseeable detriment included the following: as a result of remarks of the sentencing Judge, ID had a clear expectation that he would not be moved from juvenile detention unless he did something to warrant that move, yet his status has now changed to that of "inmate" within the meaning of the CAS Act, and decisions about matters including parole would fall to be determined under that Act; the Judge's remarks on sentence would, at the very least, have given ID an assurance or expectation that he would not be moved without being afforded procedural fairness: Attorney-General versus Quin <case>; [(1989-1990) 170 CLR 1] at 20; prior to making the decision to move ID to an adult correctional centre, it would have been apparent from a perusal of his DJJ file that he would be affected negatively by a move to an adult prison in relation to matters such as education, psychological health and concerns about personal safety in prison; accordingly, ID was potentially subject to a detriment so that, before a decision to impose that detriment was made, he was entitled to be afforded procedural fairness and to have taken into account his concerns and arguments about why he believed that the decision should not be made.
 With respect to foreseeable detriment to PF, Mr Haesler SC submits: the sentencing Judge made a s.19 order following a finding of special circumstances based, amongst other things, on PF's vulnerability in an adult prison population because of his health and other factors; prior to making the decision to move PF to an adult prison, it would have been apparent from a perusal of his DJJ file that he would be affected negatively by a move to an adult prison, such detriment including interruption to his education and training, potential decline in psychological health, lack of access to treatment for his heart condition and eye injury, fears for his personal safety and limits on his access to program and services that would assist his rehabilitation which may affect release date; 
PF's earliest date for parole is 18 January 2009 - however, it was clearly anticipated by DJJ that a transfer to an adult correctional centre might extend his period of time in custody because of a requirement of DCS that he perform certain programs in their facility.
 With respect to foreseeable detriment to DV, Mr Haesler SC submits: the sentencing Judge made a s.19 order following a finding that DV had good prospects of rehabilitation having regard to his progress in juvenile custody; 
DV would have been entitled to expect that, in accordance with the sentencing Judge's order, he would serve his sentence until the end of his non-parole period in juvenile detention unless his own conduct led to transfer and certainly that he would have a fair opportunity to be heard before a s.28 order was made; it would have been apparent from a perusal of his DJJ file that he would be affected negatively by a move to an adult prison, such detriment including an interruption to his education and training (he was undertaking his Higher
School Certificate), loss of access to counselling and loss of his ability to participate in community activities; under the terms of his sentence, DV was eligible for release on parole on April 2009 - however, as his ability to continue to undertake courses, often seen as a precondition to parole, was jeopardised, he was detrimentally affected as to his prospects to obtain parole which may operate to lengthen his sentence.
 Mr Haesler SC submits that the CDC Act does not manifest a clear intention to exclude the operation of the rules of procedural fairness. He submits that the broad statutory power under s.28 CDC Act to transfer a s.19 CCP Act detainee, without reference to any statutory criteria, does not manifest a legislative intention to exclude the operation of the rules of procedural fairness. He refers to Jarratt versus Commissioner of Police for NSW at 56, -70, 89 and 96 where the High Court held that a broad statutory power to remove a Deputy Commissioner of Police was nevertheless subject to the rules of procedural fairness.
 Mr Haesler SC submits that the objects provision in s.4 CDC Act militates against exclusion of the operation of the rules of procedural fairness.
Section 19(7) CCP Act cannot, he submits, be construed as an exclusion of procedural fairness obligations. Section 4 requires the rehabilitation needs of detainees to be considered together with the development and preservation of satisfactory relationships between detainees and their families: s.4(1)(a), . Moreover, he submits that s.4(2)(a) requires the First Defendant, in the administration of the CDC Act, to give paramount consideration to the welfare and interests of detainees. All of this, he submits, is inconsistent with an exclusion of the principles of procedural fairness when a s.28 transfer is under consideration.
 With respect to the line of authority relied upon by Mr Leeming SC concerning prison management decisions, Mr Haesler SC points to authority where a duty to accord procedural fairness has been applied in the prison setting: Renton versus Bradbury  <case>
In any event, he submits that the decisions under challenge in this case involve a fundamental change in legal status for each individual and are distinguishable. Each Plaintiff changed from a "detainee" under the CDC Act to an "inmate" under the CAS Act with a corresponding change in parole regime. He submits that the prison cases relied upon by the First Defendant did not involve juvenile offenders.
 Finally, the Plaintiffs submit that the fact that the decision in question may be seen as having policy and financial implications does not provide any basis for excluding the requirements of procedural fairness: South Australia v O'Shea at 388-389.

Determination In broad terms, I accept the submissions of the Plaintiffs on this question. I am satisfied that the First Defendant was required to accord procedural fairness to each Plaintiff before deciding whether transfer should take place under s.28 CDC Act.
 Section 19(7) CCP Act makes clear that it is open to the First Defendant to undo the effect of a judicial order made under s.19(1). However, nothing within the statutory scheme indicates that the administrative decision maker can undo the judicial order without according procedural fairness to the detainees.
 There is an entirely different statutory framework in the CCP Act and the
CDC Act which, in my view, places a s.28 decision apart from the line of authority relied upon by Mr Leeming SC. Here there is an elaborate and different statutory scheme. The starting point here is a judicial order made, as part of the sentencing process, at which the Judge is required by law to have regard to a background report under s.25 CCP Act prepared by DJJ offices.
Having considered that report together with evidence and submissions in the sentencing hearing, a s.19 order still cannot be made with respect to an offender then aged 18 years or more unless "special circumstances" are found. In these cases, a finding of "special circumstances" was made. No appeal was brought challenging that finding or the sentence imposed.
 In my view, as a result of this judicial order, a legitimate expectation arose for each Plaintiff that, as long as he behaved appropriately and made substantial progress by way of rehabilitation in juvenile detention, he would not be subject to involuntary transfer to an adult correctional centre under s.28 CDC Act without being accorded procedural fairness by the First
Defendant.
 The statutory scheme underpinning s.19 CCP Act recognises that a more beneficial and positive custodial setting is available in juvenile detention, including resources for rehabilitation, education and training consistent with the objects laid down in s.4 CDC Act. So much has been recognised in the cases referred to at [13]-[14] and [24]-[25] above. There are obvious and identifiable detriments which can apply if a juvenile offender is transferred to the adult prison system. I accept the submissions of Mr Haesler SC in this respect in connection with the identifiable detriments which could befall ID,
PF and DV.
 The s.28 transfer power is not to be compared with a change from one classification to another of an adult prisoner in the adult prison system. Nor is it to be equated with transfer from one Juvenile Justice Centre to another, as in JRM versus Department of Juvenile Justice. A s.28 transfer order is not a prison management decision. Rather, it involves a fundamental change in the nature and quality of detention to which the detainee will be subject, with the likelihood, in the case of ID and PF, that a longer period in custody will result.
 Nor do I see that the rationale for the line of authority relied upon by
Mr Leeming SC has application in this case. As the evidence reveals, there are a limited number of s.19 detainees aged more than 18 years to whom procedural fairness is to be accorded. This is to be contrasted with the adult prison system where hundreds, if not thousands, of classification decisions are made concerning prisoners each year.
 In any event, cases within the prison management line of authority have observed that decisions have not been uniform and that the approach of Courts has become more interventionist: Kelleher versus Commissioner, Department of
Corrective Services  <case> at <case> ff. A jurisdiction to review exists, but Courts would be reluctant to exercise it in relation to prison management decisions: Masters versus Chief Executive,
Department of Corrective Services <case>; <case>.
 The learned authors of Aronson, Dyer and Groves, "Judicial Review of
Administrative Action" 3rd ed, 2004, have observed (at 385, 435, 464) that it is not easy to reconcile the prison cases with the High Court's approach to the threshold question concerning procedural fairness in Kioa versus West. They observe that these decisions suggest that some courts may be reluctant to apply the principles in Kioa versus West for fear that imposition of procedural fairness will unduly impair the exercise of important statutory powers.
Considerations of that type do not apply in this case. A small group of detainees is involved and they are in a special and different position as a result of the s.19 CCP Act judicial order made with respect to each of them.
Aronson, Dyer and Groves observe (at 464) that the High Court has expressly discarded the reluctance of Courts to apply general principles of natural justice in some cases and opine that "it must now be viewed with suspicion in other areas" except to the extent that it can be explained in terms of general principles. For reasons already expressed, I consider that the general principles requiring procedural fairness do apply in this case.
 Accordingly, both the judicial nature of the s.19 order which placed the
Plaintiffs into juvenile detention, and the palpable detriments which may flow from a change in status from "detainee" to "inmate", in my view, dictate the need to accord procedural fairness before any s.28 transfer decision is made.
 I am not assisted, with respect to s.28, by the presence in s.20(3) CDC
Act of an express requirement to provide natural justice. Section 20 involves a different subject matter and its contents do not assist resolution of the present controversy.
 My conclusion concerning procedural fairness is reinforced by the objects clause in s.4 CDC Act. In the administration of the Act (by the First
Defendant), the welfare and interests of detainees shall be given paramount consideration: s.4(2)(a). The suggestion that there is no requirement to accord procedural fairness to a detainee, before a s.28 transfer order is made, is entirely inconsistent with this object. I will return to the objects clause later in this judgment (at [254]-[263]).
 In this case, each Plaintiff states, without challenge, that following the s.19 order made in the sentencing process, he expected to remain in juvenile detention as long as he behaved and made full and positive use of the rehabilitation, training, educational and counselling measures and resources available in that detention. Each Plaintiff did, in fact, behave and make substantial use of these resources in a manner that strongly supported the view that they were in the process of rehabilitation, a process which he was entitled to expect would be allowed to continue without interruption in juvenile detention without, at the very least, a proper opportunity to be heard before any change in status was made.
 Accordingly, I am satisfied that each Plaintiff was entitled to procedural fairness from the First Defendant before any decision was made for transfer to an adult correctional centre under s.28 CDC Act.

What Was Required to Ensure Procedural Fairness to Each Plaintiff in the Circumstances of this Case? 
Submissions of the Plaintiffs Mr Haesler SC acknowledges that it is not possible to articulate definitively what is required by way of ensuring that procedural fairness has been provided, as this will depend upon the circumstances of the case and other factors, such as the subject matter that is being dealt with: Mobil Oil
Australia versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1963) 113 CLR 475] at 504. The requirement of "fairness" has been described by
Gleeson CJ as "essentially practical" and being directed at avoiding "practical injustice": Ex parte Lam at 14 [37]. It is necessary to consider the context in which the decision is to take place, the impact of the decision on the person affected and any factors that might affect the content, such as the need to act urgently: Kioa versus West at 586.
 The Plaintiffs submit that some assistance in determining the content of the requirement to accord procedural fairness may be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Johns versus Release on Licence Board [(1987) 9 NSWLR ]
where it was held, with respect to potential revocation of the grant of a licence, that the Release on Licence Board must accord procedural fairness to the prisoner on licence by: notifying the prisoner of its intention to consider the possible revocation of the licence; notifying the prisoner of any material to be considered by it in its consideration save for any material which may be lawfully withheld; permitting the prisoner to make relevant written submissions; and affording the prisoner an opportunity to be heard orally.
 Mr Haesler SC points to the Minister's Second Reading Speech with respect to the 2006 Bill, extracted at [178] above. While Mr Haesler SC submits that a process as outlined in Parliament would not fully meet the need to accord procedural fairness to the Plaintiffs, he contends that none of the Plaintiffs were dealt with in the manner described by the Minister.
 The Plaintiffs submit that it is clearly established that the more detrimental the potential effect of the decision, the fairer a decision-making process must be: Attorney-General versus Quin at 20; Chen versus Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <case>; [(1994) 48 FCR 591.] It is submitted that, in this case, the effects could hardly have been more detrimental. Despite the enormous consequences for each of the
Plaintiffs (including the potential extension of the time to be served in custody, and the physical and psychological effects of the move), none of the three had family present at the Case Management Committee meeting and none was legally represented at the meeting.
 In particular, Mr Haesler SC pointed to the Plaintiffs' potential entitlement to parole. Prior to the transfer decision, each of the Plaintiffs could have expected to become eligible for parole. If each participated effectively in the necessary programs, he may have sought release at the end of his non-parole period in 2009. Applications for parole by juvenile offenders are heard by the Children's Court, by specialist Magistrates, in accordance with s.29 CDC Act and Clause 68 [Children (Detention Centres)
Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/ccr2005351/). Apart from the fact that parole decisions for juvenile detainees are made by a
Children's Court Magistrate and not the State Parole Authority, parole decisions are governed by the CDC Act, one of the key objects of which is to ensure that detainees "take their places in the community as soon as possible as persons who will observe the law": s.4(1)(a) CDC Act.
 By contrast, the Plaintiffs points to the statutory objects in s.2A CAS
Act. This provision was inserted in the CAS Act on 20 May 2008 and was not in operation at the time when ID, PF and DV were transferred. The Plaintiffs contrast the objects clause in s.2A CAS Act with that in s.4 CDC Act.  Mr Haesler SC submits that the decision to move each Plaintiff to an adult correctional centre has, in effect, the same consequences as a decision to deny an offender parole. This is because the potential effect of the move on each of the Plaintiffs is to delay the time from which he will be able to apply for parole. This follows from the lesser availability of courses and programs in adult prisons and the waiting lists for them (such as CUBIT) that are, in effect, preconditions to applying for parole: R versus Rymer  <case> at <case>- <case>.
 Mr Haesler SC submits that, when a decision is made to deny a person parole, that decision is made by an independent body, according to clear statutory criteria and in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness:
Baba versus Parole Board [(1986) 5 NSWLR 338.] An applicant for parole, whether adult or juvenile, is afforded a full hearing and is entitled to be legally represented.
 However, the decisions under review, which have a real potential for the same impact on the Plaintiffs as a denial of parole, were not subject to those procedural safeguards. Mr Haesler SC submits that none of the Plaintiffs was represented by a lawyer, nor was adequate legal advice afforded to them. Ms
Cowper and other Legal Aid lawyers were not informed by DJJ staff of the decisions that were being made, even when enquiries were attempted to be made, and were not invited to participate and assist the Plaintiffs at their Case
Management Committee meetings with DCS or in preparing submissions.
 Mr Haesler SC submits that procedural fairness, in this case, required the following process: the First Defendant to inform the juvenile detainee and the Children's
Legal Service, in writing, that the particular detainee is being considered for a transfer to an adult correctional centre, and to provide a statement of the reasons for the proposed transfer to the detainee and his legal representatives; 
DJJ psychologists and/or counselling staff firstly involved in the rehabilitation of the detainee to provide a written professional assessment of the suitability or otherwise of the detainee for transfer to an adult correctional centre (and their reasons); the juvenile detainee's legal representative to be provided with all and any documents that the First Defendant intends to rely on in considering a s.28 transfer order, and any material adverse to the juvenile detainee and, in addition, the legal representative be provided with full access to the detainee's file including, but not limited to, any briefing for the First
Defendant prepared by DJJ officers, psychological reports, submissions prepared by DJJ officers for the DCS Classification Committee and Vocational
Training Unit reports; the First Defendant to provide an opportunity to the juvenile detainee's legal representative to respond and comment by way of submission and, if necessary, to obtain and provide independent expert reports (including independent psychological reports); if there is any material adverse to the detainee that may influence the decision to move him, notice of reliance on that material should be advised to the detainee and his or her legal representatives ought be provided an opportunity to respond specifically to that adverse material.
 The Plaintiffs submit that the decision to move each of them to adult correctional centres was made in breach of the rules of procedural fairness.
The process that was followed failed to provide them with a fair hearing, by failing to take account of the individual circumstances of each of the detainees, and by failing to give them an opportunity to be represented and to put a case as to why the power to move them should not be exercised.
 In these circumstances, Mr Haesler SC submits that the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought in the Amended Summons.

Submissions of First Defendant In the event that the Court accepts that the Plaintiffs were entitled to procedural fairness, Mr Leeming SC submits that it was extended to them in this case.
 He submits that each Plaintiff was afforded the opportunity to make a written submission in respect of the decision by way of an invitation extended to them by a DJJ officer. Further, each Plaintiff participated in an oral hearing in respect of the decision by way of their attendance at, and participation in, the Case Management Committee meeting. Further, two of the
Plaintiffs, PF and DV, sought and presumably obtained legal advice (paid for by the State through Legal Aid) and the third, ID, had an opportunity to do so.
 In the case of PF and DV, Mr Leeming SC points to a contemporaneous note dated 7 April 2008 that "all the Islander boys saw Legal Aide [sic] that afternoon" (Exhibit A, page 39; see also Exhibit A, pages 104, 140). The
First Defendant submits that this is not disputed by the affidavits of the
Plaintiffs. There was no reason why DV could not, some time between 19 March and 10 April 2008, contact a lawyer and the position is said to be the same with PF.
 In the case of ID, Mr Leeming SC acknowledges that he had a difficulty on
Good Friday. But there is no explanation, the First Defendant submits, why ID did not have an opportunity between 3 March 2008 and Good Friday to obtain legal advice.
 Mr Leeming SC submits that there is no reason to think that the opportunities for legal advice contained in the brochure about which Ms Rusis gave evidence are not real.
 The First Defendant submits that, on no view does the content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness extend beyond what in fact occurred in this case. To hold otherwise would conflict with the decision in JMR v
Department of Juvenile Justice where, at [51], consultation was held to suffice. The First Defendant submits that the proposition that procedural fairness extends to the provision of legal representation, in an administrative context, was rejected by the High Court in New South Wales v
Canellis <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 309] at 330-331.
 Mr Leeming SC submits that the Plaintiffs' submission concerning the requirements of procedural fairness in this case (at [210] above) is "lawyer- centric", involves more mandatory content to the hearing rule than any other administrative decision (including, for example, protection visa decisions) and is inconsistent with JMR versus Department of Juvenile Justice at [51]. The
First Defendant submits that what the Plaintiffs seek is unsupported by any authority.
 The First Defendant submits that each of the Plaintiffs was given an opportunity to consult a lawyer prior to the relevant decision being made with the timeframe between notification of the possibility of the decision and transfer being four weeks in the case of ID, and five weeks in the case of DV and PF.
 Mr Leeming SC observed that it is common ground that the ultimate question is whether the process avoids "practical injustice". He submits that in this case, there were written submissions, an oral hearing, examination by psychologists and an opportunity to obtain the benefit of legal advice. The
First Defendant submits that no practical injustice is demonstrated by the
Plaintiffs.

Determination Both the Plaintiffs and the First Defendant accept that, if a duty to accord procedural fairness is owed to the Plaintiffs, then the question is what is required to avoid "practical injustice". I have determined that each
Plaintiff was entitled to be accorded procedural fairness by the First
Defendant.  The evidence reveals the following steps being taken by DJJ officers before the s.28 transfer decisions were made: each Plaintiff was informed orally that he was liable to be transferred to an adult prison with the expression of this information being accompanied (in the case of PF and DV) by comments suggesting that transfer was, in truth, inevitable; each Plaintiff was given the opportunity to complete a form giving reasons why the detainee did not wish to be transferred to an adult prison -
ID completed the form, DV wrote "legal advice" on it and PF saw no real point in completing the document; at no point prior to the s.28 transfer decisions was each Plaintiff, or a solicitor for each Plaintiff, offered documentation which was to be placed before the First Defendant as part of the decision-making process; the Plaintiffs were given the opportunity to seek some legal advice and
DV and PF obtained some advice, although without the benefit of any DJJ documents which might bear upon the transfer decision; a request by the Children's Legal Service for DJJ documents was declined; despite the Plaintiffs being informed that relatives might be able to attend the Case Management Committee meeting, no active steps appear to have been taken, on the evidence, to assist the Plaintiffs in this respect; each Plaintiff attended a Case Management Committee meeting which enabled a discussion with DCS officers and a DJJ officer to take place - however, each Plaintiff did not have documentation available to them, and the evidence establishes that the tenor of the discussion was what would happen after transfer to an adult prison, not a discussion involving an objective consideration as to whether such a transfer should take place at all; thereafter, documents were provided to the First Defendant with the formal s.28 order being made forthwith with respect to each Plaintiff, without any further consultation or hearing at which the Plaintiff, his solicitor or family members might participate; the documents provided to the First Defendant, before the s.28 transfer orders were made, were not offered to each Plaintiff or his solicitor, there being no lawful reason why the documents ought be withheld from them.
 It is pertinent to observe that the provision of legal assistance through the Children's Legal Service was partly funded by DJJ. The principles emerging from State of New South Wales versus Canellis must be understood against this background. There was a readily available system of legal aid which could be availed of by each Plaintiff. The evidence does not indicate that there was any practical impediment to arranging contact between a potential transferee and the Children's Legal Service, with the provision of relevant DJJ documents to the solicitor so that informed advice could be given to the detainee, including the prospect of attendance by the solicitor at the Case Management
Committee meeting or before the First Defendant.
 At the very least, informed legal advice could have been provided to each
Plaintiff which may have permitted the preparation of meaningful written submissions on behalf of each Plaintiff resisting transfer. In reality, each
Plaintiff had no real opportunity to do more than express their resistance to the prospect of transfer, without any proper opportunity to be heard in any more detailed or informed manner.
 In my view, what occurred in these cases did not meet the requirements of procedural fairness. It did not avoid practical injustice.
 However, I do not accept the submission for the Plaintiffs recorded at [210] as to the minimum steps which the law requires to accord procedural fairness in these circumstances. Although that submission may reflect a desirable practice, the obligation which I must discharge is to identify the minimum requirements which the law demands to accord procedural fairness.
 In my view, the answer to the question as to what practical justice requires in the circumstances of this case, may be found in the procedures required by the Court of Appeal in Johns versus Release on Licence Board. I have set out at [202] above the steps which the Court determined were required to satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness in that case. With appropriate modifications, I am satisfied that these steps are what is required by law to provide procedural fairness in the present circumstances. The nature of the s.28 decision had such substantial consequences upon the legal status of the
Plaintiffs, and the conditions and length of their detention, that the steps identified in that case constitute the minimum requirements of the law to accord procedural fairness to each Plaintiff. I will refer to the four steps identified in Johns versus Release on Licence Board and measure what happened here to determine whether procedural fairness was afforded to each Plaintiff.
 Firstly, it is the case that the First Defendant did notify each
Plaintiff orally of an intention to consider possible transfer under s.28 CDC
Act. However, there was no formal notification as to when the decision might be made, the process which was to be followed and the extent to which each
Plaintiff would have an opportunity to participate in the process. Rather, each Plaintiff was invited to complete, in handwriting, a form setting out what he wished to say with respect to the prospect of transfer. Although the process adopted was less than satisfactory, and was accompanied by comments from DJJ officers which did not instil confidence in the process to follow, it cannot be said that each Plaintiff did not have notice that he was at risk of transfer.
 Secondly, the First Defendant did not notify each Plaintiff of any material to be considered in relation to possible transfer. It was not submitted at the hearing before me that any of the material placed before the
First Defendant was of a type which might be withheld lawfully from the
Plaintiff to whom the information related. In my view, this is a critical aspect of the process with respect to which the First Defendant has failed to comply.
 The provision to each Plaintiff (and his solicitor) of the material which was to be placed before the decision maker would have enabled an informed assessment by each Plaintiff (and his solicitor) of submissions which might be advanced in opposition to transfer. I note, once again, that the DJJ is dealing with a limited number of persons who are subject to s.19 orders and are to be considered for s.28 transfer. It was not suggested at the hearing before me that there was any practical impediment, or any other reason based on resources or policy, which would stand in the way of documentary material being provided to each Plaintiff, and his solicitor. As I have observed above, solicitors from the Children's Legal Service were available, assisted by DJJ funding, so that little more was required of the DJJ beyond provision of the documents to the Plaintiffs and their solicitors. In my view, this aspect is critical to the denial of procedural fairness which I am satisfied has occurred in this case.
 Given the arrangements whereby DJJ provided funding for the Legal Aid
Commission's Children's Legal Service to provide free legal advice and assistance to detainees in Juvenile Justice Centres, it seems to me that it is a short step to facilitate a process where the documentation was available to each Plaintiff and his legal adviser so that the legal adviser may attend the meeting. There is no reason to think that this could not be arranged at relatively short notice if there was said to be an urgent need to consider possible transfer. None of this happened in this case.
 Thirdly, it is the case that each Plaintiff was permitted to make a type of written submission by way of the form which each had an opportunity to complete. However, it seems to me that written submissions, in this context, means meaningful written submissions prepared by reference to a body of written material which is provided to the person who is liable to suffer substantial detriment as a result of transfer. This did not happen in this case. There was no opportunity to make written submissions in a manner which,
I am satisfied, was required by law.
 Fourthly, it is true that each Plaintiff had an opportunity to be heard orally at the Case Management Committee meeting. However, the Plaintiffs did not have the written material which was available to the Committee members.
Importantly, they had no opportunity to seek legal advice by reference to that material nor legal representation at the Committee meeting. Further, I am satisfied that the purpose of the Committee meeting was to permit DCS officers to decide whether transfer should not take place. The Plaintiffs were not afforded a real opportunity to be heard orally on the real question - whether each of them should be transferred to an adult correctional centre at all.
 I am satisfied that each Plaintiff has made good the claim for relief based upon a denial of procedural fairness.

The Plaintiffs' Claim Based Upon Failure to Take Account of Relevant Considerations 
Submissions of the Plaintiffs Mr Haesler SC submits that the First Defendant failed to take account of a number of relevant considerations, with the effect that the decisions were made contrary to law and should be set aside. He submits that the applicable principles are as follows: the ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration can only be made out if a decision maker fails to take into account a consideration which he is bound to take into account in making that decision:
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs versus Peko-Wallsend Limited <case>; [(1986) 162 CLR 24] at 39 ("Peko-Wallsend"); Saville versus Health Care Complaints
Commission  <case> at <case>; what factors a decision maker is bound to consider in making the decision will be determined by construction of the statute - if the relevant factors are not expressly set out, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: Peko-Wallsend at 39-40;
Ex parte 2HD Pty Limited <case>; [(1979) 144 CLR 45] at 49-50; even where a decision maker fails to take into account a factor he is bound to consider, the Court will not set a decision aside if the factor is so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision: Peko-Wallsend at 40; the Court's role is to set limits on the exercise of discretion, not to substitute its own view of the merits of a decision; in the absence of any indication of the weight to be given to a particular fact, generally it will be for the decision maker to determine appropriate weight, though in some circumstances, a Court will set aside an administrative decision where inadequate weight has been given to a relevant factor: Peko-Wallsend at -41.
 In order to determine what factors the First Defendant was bound to take into account before deciding to transfer the Plaintiffs, Mr Haesler SC submits that it is necessary to have regard to the relevant statutory context in determining the subject matter, scope and purpose of the CDC Act. The considerations that are, or are not, relevant to a decision maker's task are to be identified by reference to the Act, rather than the particular facts of the case: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte
Abebe <case>; [[1999] 197 CLR 510] at 579;
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs versus Yusuf [2001] 206 CLR at 347.
 It is generally for the decision maker, in the light of matters placed before him by the parties, to determine which matters are relevant and the comparative weight to be accorded to them, "though a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance": Peko-Wallsend at 41; Sean Investments Pty Limited v MacKellar <case>; [(1981) 38 ALR 363] at 375. It has also been held that submissions made by a party can constitute a relevant consideration, though there is of course a considerable overlap with the ground of denial of procedural fairness: Peko-
Wallsend at 45.
 Mr Haesler SC acknowledges that, where decisions are made by Ministers of the Crown, "due allowance may ... be made for the taking into account of broader policy considerations which may be relevant to the exercise of ministerial discretion": Peko-Wallsend at 42. Generally, while government policy may constitute a relevant consideration that a decision maker is bound to take into account, if a policy contravenes the relevant legislation by having the effect of disregarding a factor that the statute requires to be taken into account, this constitutes a failure to take account of a relevant consideration: Croft versus Minister for Health <case>; [(1983) 45 ALR 449] at 464-466.
 The Plaintiffs submit that the application of a policy that prevented a decision maker from taking into account an express statutory object constituted a failure to take into account a relevant consideration: PW Adams
Pty Limited versus Australian Fisheries Management Authority [(1995) 60 FCR ]
at 402, affirmed on appeal in Australian Fisheries Management Authority versus PW
Adams Pty Limited [(1995) 61 FCR 314.] Mr Haesler SC notes that s.28 CDC Act, taken alone, appears to give the
First Defendant power to move a detainee solely by reason of the person being subject to an order in force under s.19 CCP Act. He submits, however, that s.28 must be construed in its broad statutory context. In order to determine what criteria the First Defendant is bound to take into account in making his decision, it is necessary to have regard, not only to s.28, but to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act. He submits that the clearest statement of this is set out in the objects provision in s.4 CDC Act (see [179] above).
 These objects include the need to ensure that detainees take their places in the community as soon as possible as persons who will observe the law: s.4(1)(a). He submits, in effect, that this requires DJJ to provide detainees with services and resources, such as education and other related services, which will assist in their rehabilitation and meeting their parole. Section (1)(b) also requires DJJ to ensure that, in giving effect to this object, sufficient resources are available, and that the detainees are assisted in maintaining contact with their families.
 Mr Haesler SC submits that the objects of the legislation are factors that the First Defendant was bound to take into account when exercising the s.28 power. He relies upon the decision of Sackville J in PW Adams versus Australian
Fisheries Management Authority at 402 where his Honour held that the relevant decision was vitiated by the Minister's failure to take account of one of the objectives specified in the objects clause of the Act, where both the
Minister, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review, had been guided by a policy that failed to take that statutory objective into account.
 Mr Haesler SC submits that, in this case, it follows that before the First
Defendant made the decision to move each of the Plaintiffs, he was required to have regard to the factors set out in s.4 CDC Act. In particular, he submits that the First Defendant was required to consider: ensuring that the Plaintiffs return to the community as soon as possible as persons who will observe the law (that is, persons who are rehabilitated): s.4(1)(a); ensuring that sufficient resources were available to achieve that object: s.4(1)(b); ensuring that satisfactory relationships were preserved or developed between the detainees and their families: s.4(1)(c); that the welfare and interests of detainees (including the Plaintiffs) shall be given paramount consideration: s.4(2)(a); that punishment for offences imposed by a court is the only punishment for the offences: s.4(2)(b).
 With respect to this ground of relief generally, Mr Haesler SC submits that the CDC Act requires a decision maker, when considering whether to exercise the power under s.28, to have regard to the statutory objects of that legislation. He submits that it is clear that the First Defendant failed to have regard to each of those statutory objects, both generally, and in relation to each of the Plaintiffs. Moreover, he submits that it could not be said that any such failure would have made no difference to the decision to be made: Peko-Wallsend at 40.
 For these reasons, Mr Haesler SC submits that the Plaintiffs have made good their claim for relief on this ground.

Submissions of First Defendant Mr Leeming SC submits that it is plain on the face of the documents that many of the matters raised by the Plaintiffs were before the decision maker.
He submits, however, that this ground fails at its threshold as it is necessary for the Plaintiffs to establish that the decision maker is bound to take into account those matters before the ground can be made out: Peko-
Wallsend at 39. He submits that there is nothing express in the CDC Act, nor anything to be implied from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act to produce that result.
 Insofar as the submissions of the Plaintiffs on this ground are based upon the objects clause in s.4 of the Act, Mr Leeming SC submits that such a provision is precisely the sort of clause which does not render mandatory some factor or factors. Rather, he submits it is a general guide to the purpose of the legislation.
 He submits that the objects clause in s.4 is a modern-day variant of a preamble to a statute: Pearce and Geddes, "Statutory Interpretation in
Australia", 6th edn, 2006 at [4-42]; Bennion, "Statutory Interpretation", th ed, 2002, page 625. In drawing this analogy with a preamble, Mr Leeming SC relies upon Wacando versus Commonwealth of Australia <case>; [[1981] 148 CLR 1] at 15-16, 23 where it was said that if the words of the section are plain and unambiguous, their meaning cannot be cut down by reference to a preamble.
 The First Defendant submits that the objects clause in s.4 does not impliedly add considerations which the decision maker is bound to take into account in exercising the s.28 power.
 In any event, Mr Leeming SC submits that it has not been demonstrated that the decision maker failed to take into account any of the matters asserted by the Plaintiffs.

Determination It is the fact that the materials placed before the First Defendant with respect to each of ID, PF and DV did contain a powerful body of material pointing to substantial steps towards rehabilitation, education and training by each of these persons whilst in juvenile detention. So much is apparent from the summary of these materials set out earlier in this judgment.
 It is certainly the case that nowhere in the written materials presented to the First Defendant was reference made to the objects clause in s.4 CDC Act and the way in which those objects may apply to each Plaintiff.
 I do not accept the First Defendant's submission which seeks to minimise the operation of the objects clause in s.4 CDC Act.  Objects clauses are becoming more frequent in modern statutes. The work which an objects clause performs includes operating as a source for identifying the purpose or object of legislation to assist statutory construction: s.33 [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/). However, the work of an objects clause is not confined to that. In Russo versus Aiello <case>; <case>, Gleeson
CJ observed that [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p5) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) was "replete with legislative declarations of its objects" and that this was "not an exercise in apologetics". Rather, it gave "practical content" to an understanding of certain terms in the Act. The significance of an objects clause to both the construction and operation of a statute has been emphasised in other cases: Tickner versus Bropho <case>; [(1993) 114 ALR 409] at 434-435; Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning v
Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd <case>; [(1996) 91 LGERA 31] at 38, 72, 75; Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd versus Minister for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs [(1996) 69 FCR 565] at 568;
Pearce and Geddes, "Statutory Interpretation in Australia", 6th ed, 2006, at [4.42].
 In some cases, the statutory objects may have particular importance. For example, it has been observed that the content of a planning scheme may be required to conform to the objects of a statute, and the procedural steps, insofar as they have an object or policy content, may be controlled by the objects of the Act in the sense that if the steps are taken for a purpose foreign to the objects of the Act, the procedural step in truth may not be one within the statutory power: Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning v
Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at 75 (per Cole JA).
 In Re Yanner <case>; [(2000) 100 FCR 551] at 586-587 <case>- <case>,
Dowsett J observed that, in construing any provision in the Act under consideration, the Court should have regard to the preamble and the objects clause. Reference was made to the statement of Mason J in Wacando v
Commonwealth of Australia at 23 that the particular section must be seen in its context, the statute must be read as a whole and recourse to the preamble may throw light on the statutory purpose or object.
 The objects identified in s.4 CDC Act had particular and peculiar application to juvenile detainees. Where the decision under consideration is a transfer of persons from juvenile detention (being a statutory scheme to which the CDC Act applies) to a tougher custodial setting (where the CDC Act does not apply), it seems to me that the decision maker ought have regard expressly to the objects contained in s.4 CDC Act. This is a practical decision under the CDC Act with potential far-reaching adverse consequences for a detainee transferred to an adult prison.
 The First Defendant has control and management of all detention centres: s.6 CDC Act. The First Defendant exercises various functions under s.14 CDC
Act. A significant and potentially far-reaching discretion is vested in the
First Defendant under s.28 CDC Act. The statutory scheme is such that the objects contained in s.4(1) and the factors to be taken into account in the administration of the Act in s.4(2), ought be at the forefront of discretionary determinations made by the First Defendant and, in particular, the transfer power in s.28 CDC Act.
 This is not to say that s.4 factors must govern the result every time so that s.28 transfer is refused. The objects in s.4 apply to all detainees and not just the Plaintiffs. However, there ought be some objective evidence that the decision maker has turned his mind, in a proper fashion, to those considerations. Nowhere in the substantial body of documentary material concerning ID, PF and DV is there an indication that the First Defendant (or anyone else involved in the process) had express regard to these objects.
 Adopting the words of Gleeson CJ in Russo versus Aiello, s.4 CDC Act "is not an exercise in apologetics". Section 4 gives "practical content" to decisions to be made under the Act and, in particular, the large step of ordering the involuntary transfer under s.28 of a well-behaved detainee from a juvenile detention centre to an adult prison.
 Given the statutory scheme of the CDC Act, I am satisfied that the decision maker was bound to have regard to the objects in s.4 CDC Act, and the practical matters, concerning each Plaintiff which arose for consideration once proper regard was had to the objects clause.
 It might be said that the First Defendant would necessarily be conscious, and have regard to, the objects clause in legislation which governed the jurisdiction which he administered on a daily basis. In circumstances where there is no sign of these objects being taken into account expressly, and where the decisions themselves do not demonstrate that these objects were taken into account, I am persuaded that the Plaintiffs have made good their claim for relief on this ground as well.

The Claim for Relief Based Upon Having Regard to Irrelevant Factors 
Submissions of the Plaintiff Mr Haesler SC confined the claim for relief under this heading to the case of ID. He submitted that the documentation demonstrated that the First
Defendant had regard to the nature of ID's offences, and that this was an entirely extraneous factor. This was demonstrated by the suggestion in the briefing note provided to the First Defendant on 26 March 2008, that the nature of ID's offences would, in some way, present potential risk to the safety and well being of other detainees and potential OH&S issues for staff in managing a high number of detainees. On any view of it, Mr Haesler SC submitted that ID's offences could have no such effect.
 Mr Haesler SC did not contend that the First Defendant could not take into account overcrowding at juvenile detention centres. He submitted, however, that a fair understanding of what occurred with respect to these three
Plaintiffs had seen the overcrowding issue dictate the outcome, subject to DCS veto, with respect to each s.28 transfer decision. He developed this argument with respect to the next ground, based upon the suggested inflexible application of policy.

Submissions of the First Defendant Mr Leeming SC submits that it could not be said that ID's offences were irrelevant considerations in the administrative law sense so that this ground could not be made out.

Determination The claim for relief under this heading was confined to ID with respect to one consideration only. I am not persuaded that it has been demonstrated that an irrelevant factor was taken into account, in the administrative law sense, by having regard to ID's offences.
 That said, I observe that there is something of a disconnect between the nature of ID's offences and a suggested concern for the safety of other detainees and OH&S issues with respect to staff. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that this ground for relief has been established.

The Plaintiffs' Claim for Relief Based Upon an Inflexible Application of a Rule or Policy 
Submissions of the Plaintiffs Mr Haesler SC submits that the First Defendant exercised the power to transfer the Plaintiffs under s.28 by inflexibly applying a rule or policy whereby s.19 detainees over 18 years of age were to be transferred to the DCS unless there was a serious incapacity or the DCS did not consent to the transfer.
 He submits that a discretionary power "must be exercised on each occasion in the light of the circumstances at that time": R versus Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Venables <case>; [[1998] AC ] at -497. While it is clearly not impermissible for a decision maker to develop criteria for the exercise of a discretionary statutory power and to take account of policy in doing so (Drake versus Minister for Immigration and Ethnic
Affairs [(1979) 24 ALR 577]), he submits that a failure to consider the circumstances of an individual case will constitute an error of law: Green v
Daniels <case>; [(1977) 13 ALR 1.] He submits, in this respect, that a clear illustration is provided by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Rendell versus Release on Licence Board [(1987) 10 NSWLR 499] at 503. There, the Court held that a decision in which it was made clear that the Board had followed a policy to the effect that persons convicted of murder would not be released until they had served a minimum of years of gaol was made contrary to law. The Court said, at 503, that the
Board had failed to carry out its statutory function by making the decision "without regard to the applicability [of the policy] to the particular circumstances of the claimant".
 In this case, Mr Haesler SC submits that there is evidence that DJJ, in order to respond to the problem of overcrowding in Baxter, simply decided to move all detainees in accordance with this policy unless DCS determined not to take them. That this was the policy, he submits, emerges, inter alia, from documents in evidence and from the concern expressed that the DJJ computer system was not picking up each of the detainees who were over 18 (Exhibit A, page 10).
 Mr Haesler SC acknowledges that a government department, such as DJJ, is entitled to develop policies to assist it to resolve a problem such as overcrowding in detention centres. He submits, however, that it is necessary to keep in mind s.4(1)(b), which provides that the objects of the Act are to ensure that, in the administration of the Act, sufficient resources are available to enable the rehabilitative objects in s.4(1)(a) to be achieved.
 He submits that if DJJ decides to ease overcrowding by use of s.28 transfers, it must ensure that the discretionary power is exercised by giving individual consideration to individual cases. Whilst it has been held that it is not impermissible to take account of political considerations in making decisions, those decision makers were Ministers rather than departmental officers: Hot Holdings versus Creasy <case>; <case>.
 Mr Haesler SC notes that it has been held that in areas of high-volume decision making, it may be permissible (and sometimes necessary) to develop policies or guidelines for the exercise of discretionary powers. In
Surinakova versus Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs at 98, Hill J held that policies can "ensure consistency of administrative decision making", but a "decision maker must take care to ensure that he does not slavishly follow a policy and disregard the particular circumstances of a case". Hill J also cited with approval the decision Khan versus Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Federal Court of Australia, 11 December 1987,
BC8702232)  <case> where Gummow said at [25]: "... what was required of the decision maker, in respect of each of the applications, was that in considering all relevant material placed before him, he give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the case and be ready in a proper case to depart from any applicable policy.: In this case, Mr Haesler SC submits that there was no question of "high volume decision making". At the most, some 20 detainees were identified as being potentially liable for transfer, and there is therefore no basis for departing from the need to consider each of the cases individually. He submits that each of the decisions concerning the Plaintiffs is vitiated by the failure to consider the individual circumstances of their cases and impermissibly applying a policy.

Submissions of the First Defendant Mr Leeming SC submits that the Plaintiffs have not established that such a policy was inflexibly applied by the First Defendant. He submits that no such policy can be inferred from the documents in Exhibit A, and points to the evidence of Ms Rusis that any such policy would be written and that she would be aware of it.
 Mr Leeming SC submits that the best test of whether there was such a policy is to consider what actually happened. He points to the case of two detainees (whom he referred to as Case Study 1 and Case Study 2) in the documents in Exhibit A (at pages 50-51) who were not ultimately transferred pursuant to s.28 orders. He submits that what in fact occurred with respect to these two detainees falsifies the proposition that there was a policy.
 The First Defendant submits that the Court has direct evidence from Ms
Rusis, together with actual cases negating the existence of such a policy. He contends that the Plaintiffs have confused the process of identifying potential candidates for transfer with the decision to select some, but not all, of those potential candidates for transfer. He submits that this confusion is understandable because the documents are not entirely clear on their face, but what is clear is that there is no evidentiary basis for relief as sought in the fourth ground.

Determination It will be apparent from my findings of fact at [162] that I am satisfied that an approach was adopted within DJJ that s.19 detainees who had turned 18 with release dates in 2009 would be identified for s.28 transfers. The documentary evidence demonstrates, in my view, that the approach adopted was that these persons would be made the subject of s.28 transfer orders unless the DCS determined that transfer should not take place.  It is the case, as Mr Leeming SC submits, that the two detainees to whom he refers were not transferred. One had been previously remanded to Kariong
Juvenile Correctional Centre, a DCS facility, where he alleged that he had been assaulted and he claimed he was subject to differential treatment by certain prison officers. A complaint was made to the Ombudsman and a fact- finding investigation was carried out by DCS. It was considered that the complaint may have some merit and legal action was pending. It was for these reasons that this detainee was not recommended for transfer to an adult correctional centre (Exhibit A, page 50). The second detainee who was not transferred had been assessed by a psychiatrist as not being currently competent to fully comprehend and evaluate a transfer decision. Following the
Case Management Committee meeting concerning this detainee, Mr Stephens of the
DCS indicated that he would recommend that the DCS not consent to transfer based on the detainee's low-level functioning and resultant vulnerability (Exhibit A, pages 50-51).
 I do not consider that the differential approach concerning these two detainees assists the First Defendant. To the contrary, in my view, it fortifies the Plaintiff's contention on this ground. Further, I do not consider that the evidence of Ms Rusis is of any real assistance on this issue for reasons expressed at [53] to [55] above.
 I accept that the First Defendant may have regard to overcrowding in
Juvenile Justice Centres in considering a possible s.28 transfer of a detainee. Of course, this consideration must be considered against the background of the statutory object of ensuring that resources are available to administer the CDC Act: s.4. I have expressed the view earlier in this judgment that the evidence establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that decisions had been made to transfer ID, PF and DV by the time of the Case
Management Committee meetings and before the First Defendant came to consider the documents presented to him.
 I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that the decision-making process with respect to these three Plaintiffs involved the application of a policy that they would be transferred to adult correctional centres unless DCS indicated that such transfer should not take place. Consideration was not given to the individual circumstances of the three Plaintiffs and, in particular, the powerful body of material pointing to rehabilitative action, education and training which was highly pertinent before taking the large step of directing their transfer to adult prisons. Each Plaintiff was bound for transfer to an adult correctional centre once DCS officers had expressed their willingness to accept him.
 I am satisfied that it was DCS officers who made the effective decision to transfer ID, PF and DV. Decisions which ought to have been based on the exercise of independent judgment by the First Defendant were dictated by persons not entrusted with the power to decide. In effect, the DJJ was acting under the dictation of another body or person, the DCS: Aboriginal Legal
Service Ltd versus Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs at .
 I am satisfied that the policy applied in these cases was not consistent with the CDC Act. It served a purpose which was foreign to the purpose for which the discretionary power was created: Re Drake and Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (No. 2) <case>; [(1979) 2 ALD 634] at 640.
 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs have made good this ground for relief.

Conclusions and Relief The duty and jurisdiction of the Court to review administrative action does not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the relevant power: Attorney-General v Quin at 35-36.
 I am satisfied that that the Plaintiffs were entitled to procedural fairness before any decision was made to transfer each of them to an adult correctional centre. I am satisfied that each Plaintiff was denied procedural fairness in the process adopted by the First Defendant.
 I am satisfied that, in making the transfer decisions concerning each
Plaintiff, the First Defendant failed to have regard to relevant factors which he was bound to take into account before making such a decision. I am also satisfied that the decision-making process involved application of an inflexible policy which did not have regard to the individual circumstances of each Plaintiff.
 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the decision to transfer each Plaintiff under s.28 CDC Act was not made according to law. The consequences of this finding is that it nullifies the impugned decisions: Bignell versus New South
Wales Casino Control Authority <case>; [(2000) 48 NSWLR 462] at 480.
 As the s.28 transfer order with respect to each Plaintiff will be set aside, the operative order with respect to each of ID, PF and DV will be the judicial order under s.19 CCP Act. The First and Second Defendants must comply with those orders unless and until a lawful and valid s.28 CDC Act order is made.
 I propose to make a declaration and orders in accordance with the Amended
Summons.
 I make the following declaration and orders: a declaration that the First Defendant failed to accord each of the
Plaintiffs, ID, PF and DV, procedural fairness prior to directing his transfer under s.28 [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/) from a juvenile detention centre to an adult correctional centre; an order that the direction of the First Defendant that each of the
Plaintiffs, ID, PF and DV, be transferred from a juvenile detention centre, to an adult correctional centre, be set aside; an order that, unless and until a lawful and valid determination is made under [s.28](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/s28.html) [Children (Detention Centres) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1987260/) directing his transfer to an adult correctional centre, each of the
Plaintiffs, ID, PF and DV, is to be returned to the Juvenile Justice Centre from which he has been moved; an order the First Defendant to pay the costs of the Plaintiffs, ID, PF and DV.
 I will hear the parties concerning any order for costs with respect to the
Plaintiffs, UT, AM and KT.
