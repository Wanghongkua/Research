EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the admission of voice identification evidence from two witnesses, Mr Costin and Mr Ryan. In the latter case it is not entirely clear whether the witness, according to his statement, is engaged in voice identification or, in truth, an assumption as to what he has heard.
In a nutshell, the two witnesses were outside when it is alleged that the accused fatally assaulted the deceased inside a residential flat. The facts in issue therefore are whether the accused assaulted the deceased, thereby causing his death, with one of the two necessary mental elements of intention for the crime of murder: see the judgment of Simpson J in Burton versus R  <case> commencing at [148]. 
It seems that there is no dispute on the part of defence counsel with regard to the first two elements. Rather, there is a question as to whether the mental elements of murder can be established by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. It seems that the jury may well need to be directed about the question of intoxication, and also manslaughter by way of an unlawful and dangerous act. It also seems likely that self-defence, at least in its excessive form, will need to be left to the jury. 
According to his statements, voir dire exhibits B and C, Mr Costin heard a male voice from inside the flats say, amongst other things, "I'm going to fucking kill you" and "Do you want to go again do you". Later, when the accused was arrested and being taken by police to a caged truck, Mr Costin heard the accused speak to police and "positively recognised" the voice of the accused as being the voice that he had heard from inside the apartment. 
According to Mr Ryan's statement, voir dire exhibit D, he saw a man outside the units, and as I understand it there is no dispute that that man was the accused. In [5] Mr Ryan describes hearing that man use "slurred speech" and "talking loudly". Later, he heard a voice from inside the apartments say, amongst other things, "I'm going to kill you" and "Do you want to do this again". One can infer from his statement - although it is true that the position is not entirely clear - that he identified the voice from the apartment as the voice he had previously heard emanating from the person of the accused. 
In accordance with the authorities, the objection of defence counsel is not founded on any common law preconditions with regard to the admissibility of voice identification evidence: see R versus Adler <case>; [52 NSWLR 451], and the most recent case to which I was referred, Burton versus R), it is now soundly established that questions of credibility, reliability, and weight are not for me at this stage in my approach to [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). Rather, he submitted, I should undertake the well-known balancing exercise called for by that section on the assumption that the evidence is accepted. In other words, he submitted that I should not assess the weight of the evidence in order to determine whether it may be accepted by the jury, and thereby determine its probative value. Rather I should assume that it will be accepted, and thereafter assess its probative value in light of all of the foreshadowed evidence in the trial, along with the facts in issue that I have identified. 
Defence counsel submitted that it must be the case that a trial judge should make some assessment of the true strength of the evidence at this stage, as part of the proper application of the section. 
In discussion, I queried of the learned Crown Prosecutor whether, if it be the case that, for example, one of the witnesses is in truth very deaf, that is nevertheless something that should not be explored on the voir dire. He confirmed that that is his submission. 
Having taken some time to reflect on the question, I accept the position of the Crown Prosecutor. Without analysing the different judgments in R versus XY in detail, in summary the majority endorses the approach of Spigelman CJ in R versus Shamouil. 
In the very recent case of Burton versus R, the analysis of Simpson J to like effect commanded the unanimous support of the Court of Criminal Appeal comprised as well of R A Hulme J and Barr AJ. 
I respectfully consider that defence counsel is correct in his submission that the modern approach is not consistent with the approach taken by trial judges over many years with regard to the "probative/prejudicial" discretion at common law first enunciated in R versus Christie [[1914] AC 545.] Nor is it consistent, indeed, with the approach taken by trial judges over many years with regard to [s 137.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html)
Nevertheless, I consider that the position in New South Wales is now clear: questions of credibility, reliability, and weight, and indeed alternative explanations or inferences, are for the jury. They are not for me at the stage of undertaking the balancing exercise contained in [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).
Accordingly, any voir dire addressed to questions of weight and the like will be otiose. It follows that cross-examination in that regard of the two witnesses will not be permitted. * * *
