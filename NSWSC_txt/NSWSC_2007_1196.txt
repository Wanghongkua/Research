THURSDAY, 25 OCTOBER 2007  /07 LEVERAGED EQUITIES LTD versus AUSSIE PRODUCTS PTY LTD  
JUDGMENT  This winding up application was heard with the application by the same plaintiff relating to Finance & Equity Pty Ltd (see Leveraged Equities
Ltd versus Finance & Equity Pty Ltd [2007] 1197 NSWSC), with evidence in each being evidence in the other.  The circumstances of this case are exactly the same, save that the debt the subject of the statutory demand (challenged before Hammerschlag J but not set aside: see [[2007] NSWSC 886)] was in the sum of $766,405.00. Again, there has been filed a holding summons in respect of an application for leave to appeal against dismissal of the application to have the statutory demand set aside.
The proposed grounds of appeal, to the extent described orally, are the same in this case as in the other case.  As in the Finance & Equity case, a presumption of insolvency has arisen. The evidence upon which the defendant relies in attempting to rebut that presumption is exactly the same here as in the Finance & Equity case; also the other grounds of defence put forward are exactly the same.  For the reasons enunciated in the Finance & Equity decision, the court makes the following orders: 
Order that Aussie Products Pty Ltd (ACN 115 970 995) be wound up in insolvency. 
Order that Paul Andrew Billingham, an official liquidator, of Level 17, Kent Street, Sydney be appointed liquidator of Aussie Products Pty Ltd. 
Order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
