Judgment on objections to Statement of Stephen Coleman of 13 March 2001  The defendants have taken a number of objections to the statement of Mr
Stephen Coleman dated 13 March 2001. Mr Coleman is put forward by the plaintiffs as a person having, by his training study or experience, been shown to have acquired specialised knowledge within the meaning of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s79.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) so as to be capable of expressing opinions of an expert nature based wholly or substantially on that specialised knowledge. As I understand the position, the defendants accept that Mr Coleman satisfies the [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s79.html) criteria in principle but rely upon suggested lack of transparency of reasoning processes and suggested bare assertions for the purpose of pressing the subject objections. Other bases for the objections are to be found in MFI
D 233 in the template prepared to identify both the defendants' objections and suggested rulings and the plaintiffs suggested rulings.  Mr Coleman is presently proposed to be cross-examined from the commencement of term next year. Hence the importance of the parties being given as clear an indication as possible as to the rulings on the subject objections. Clearly where rulings can be given they should be given so that as appropriate, if a 'reserve/leave' ruling is given, Mr Coleman may be given an appropriate opportunity to supplement the statement in an attempt to overcome admissibility problems.  The rulings are as follows:  
Paragraphs 
Ruling  .1.1 - 3.1.5 allow paragraph 3.1.4 excluding last sentence. Grant leave in relation to last sentence.  allow paragraph 3.1.5  allow paragraphs 3.1.1,3.1.2 and 3.1.3 on the basis that they are to be read as going no further than and that the reasoning is based upon paragraphs 3.1.4 and 3.1.5.
