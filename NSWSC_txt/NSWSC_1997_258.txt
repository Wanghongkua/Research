GPI LEISURE CORPORATION LTD (IN LIQ) versus BRIAN RICHARD YUILL & 85 ORS (P1)` `1907/94` `14 July 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` `

JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: The issue is whether the document, Exhibit WEJ1, is admissible. The document is headed "WITHOUT PREJUDICE". [Section 131(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides that evidence is not to be adduced of the communication made between persons in dispute "in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute". 
This dispute is the subject of the fourth cross claim filed in these proceedings. The cross claimants seek declarations that they are entitled to an indemnity and to have liberty to apply for judgments for money sums. The defences basically are that the conditions precedent to liability have not been fulfilled.

The present motion is an application for summary judgment. The paragraph in the exhibit states, in essence, that the party is willing to put in place a workable mechanism for operation of any claims to be made under the indemnity.
It also contains other matters which that party would be willing to consider for approval.

The question is whether that is in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement. "Connection" is a word that can have different connotations and can mean "in any way connected" or "directly connected". When faced with such a choice, a court reaches for the interpretation which produces a sensible operation of the statute conformable to the intention of the legislature and the purpose of the enactment; see Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v
Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1981) 147 CLR 297], 321. This rule was applied with respect to a kindred expression "relating to" in R versus Sheffield Crown Court, Ex parte Brownlow [[1980] 1 QB 530] (see particularly per Lord Denning at 539, though he dissented in the result).

The scope of the "without prejudice" privilege under the common law was not consistently stated by the courts, some expressing it relatively widely and others narrowly; see McNicol, "Law of Privilege" (LBC Sydney 1992) pp et seq. In Field versus Commissioner for Railways  <case>; [(1957) 99 CLR 285], 292, the High Court said of the scope of the privilege, "It depends upon what formed part of the negotiations for the settlement of the action and what was reasonably incidental thereto". There needed to be a "proper connexion with any purpose connected with the settlement of the action" (p 293). In Trade Practices Commission versus Arnotts Ltd <case>; [(1989) 88 ALR 69], 71-73, Beaumont, J reviewed and contrasted cases where the parties discussed a possible compromise on the one hand (privileged) and where they had discussions merely asserting their respective positions (not privileged). An example of the latter is Buckingham County Council versus Moran [[1990] Ch 623], 634-5.

These considerations incline me to the view that the "connection" referred to in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) is a direct connection.

Is the letter an "attempt" to negotiate a settlement? An affirmative answer is suggested by the mere use of the words "without prejudice", but this is not conclusive. However, a letter headed "without prejudice" which does not contain an offer may be within the privilege if it can be categorised as an "opening shot" in a negotiation for compromise: South Shropshire District
Council versus Amos [[1986] 1 WLR 1271], 1277.

What then is an "attempt" to negotiate a settlement? Again, I think really it is a question of nexus. There may be many communications between parties, which one can read between the lines as saying that certain things may happen, and if those certain things happen, the dispute might be settled. I do not consider that generally such a communication would fall within the privilege in [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) 
The present letter seems to me merely to be a communication which indicates that if the litigation can be dealt with in some practical way, the writer is open to suggestions. Alternatively it indicates that if a claim arises in the future, a mechanism can be put in place to deal with it. The letter does not suggest a method of compromising the underlying dispute. I do not consider that it is sufficiently close to "an attempt to negotiate a settlement" of the dispute to come within privilege. Accordingly I will admit WEJ1.
