HUNT CJ at CL, SMART J, IRELAND J 
CATCHWORDS: SELF INCRIMINATION - COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY PRIVILEGES, STATUTORY ABROGATION OF PRIVILEGE, STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, INCRIMINATING V. UNDERMINING CREDIBILITY, [ROYAL COMMISSIONS ACT 1923](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/) [S.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Allowed 
HEADNOTE 
H, a Detective Constable, was tried pursuant to s309(3)(e) of the Crimes Act for unlawfully and intentionally obtaining access to stored data in a computer, being RTA motor vehicle registration details. The jury was unable to agree. Later H appeared before the Police Royal Commission, at which he gave evidence that he had not been driving his motor vehicle at the time it was involved in an accident. He later conceded that he had been driving the vehicle. Subsequently, H pleaded guilty to the s309(3)(e) offence and at the sentencing hearing it was put to him, over objection, that he had attempted to mislead the Commission. H agreed, having been directed to answer and given no warning. The judge took into account H's previous lies when deciding not to accept H's version of events surrounding the offence, including his denial of knowledge that would amount to an aggravating factor. The [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) did not apply to the sentencing proceedings.

HELD: . H should not have been required to answer the question regarding his evidence to the Police Royal Commission as it tended to incriminate him.
The privilege against self-incrimination that applied was the common law privilege.
[S.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/), which abrogates the common law privilege, did not apply because the question was asked at the sentencing proceedings, not at the Royal Commission.
The breach of privilege resulted in the sentencing judge taking into account matters that he should not have.
Per Smart J: 
Where a statute abrogates the privilege against self-incrimination and confers compensatory protection, the court must construe the ambit of that statutory protection. A technical or narrow approach should not be adopted having regard to the importance of that privilege; 
Where questions in cross-examination have the twofold purpose or effect of undermining the credibility of a witness and tending to incriminate that witness, those questions are not permissible. There is a rider to this principle where the offence in respect of which the witness is tending to be incriminated is trivial or technical and the dominant purpose and effect of the cross-examination is to undermine the credibility of the witness; 
Questions in cross-examination as to prior inconsistent statements to a
Royal Commission having the sole purpose and effect of undermining the credibility of a witness are admissible; 
In instances where it is hard to draw the line between cross-examination undermining credibility and that having a tendency to incriminate and there is a substantial risk that it may have the tendency to incriminate, such cross- examination is not permissible; 
The answer to the challenged question in cross-examination had the tendency to incriminate the accused of a serious offence, namely of knowingly giving false testimony under [s.21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s21.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/). It was thus inadmissible even though it also undermined the accused's credibility, assuming [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of that Act applied.

ORDERS . Leave to appeal granted.
Appeal allowed.
In lieu of the sentence imposed, Anthony James Hood is sentenced to a minimum term of 12 months commencing on 3 June 1996 and expiring on 2 June and an additional term of 4 months commencing on 3 June 1997 and expiring on 2 October 1997.
That the applicant be released on parole on 2 June 1997.
 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ AT CL: The circumstances in which this application for leave to appeal against sentence arises are set out in the judgement of Smart J.

I agree with Smart J, for the reasons which he has given, that: [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/) did not apply to the question asked of the applicant in the sentencing proceedings as to whether he had attempted to mislead the Royal Commission into the NSW
Police Service because he thought that it would be to his advantage; the answer to that question tended to incriminate the applicant in the commission of the offence provided by [s.21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s21.html) of the Act, of knowingly giving false testimony to a Royal Commission; and accordingly, the applicant should not have been obliged to answer that question because of his common law privilege against self-incrimination. (It is important to emphasise that the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) did not apply to the sentencing proceedings.) 
In those circumstances, the interesting (and complex) questions - possibly involving matters of policy - as to the interpretation of statutory provisions such as [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s17.html) do not need to be determined in this appeal, and I would prefer to reserve my opinion in relation to them for a case in which it becomes necessary to determine them.

Had the applicant been permitted to claim his privilege against self- incrimination, it seems that the judge would not have been entitled to draw any inference unfavourable to his credit for having done so.[1] A finding that his offence had been aggravated by his knowledge that the person to whom he gave the information was unsavoury is unlikely to have been made without the evidence which the applicant was wrongly obliged to give.

I agree with Smart J, for the reasons which he has given, that the sentence should be reduced as a result of that error. I agree with the orders which
Smart J has proposed.
 
SMART J: Anthony James Hood has applied for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of 20 months comprising a minimum term of 15 months and an additional term of 5 months imposed by the District Court on a charge of on November 1992 unlawfully and intentionally obtaining access to data stored in a computer, being data that he knew or ought reasonably to have known related to the personal affairs of a person. The charge which was laid under s.309(3)(e) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) carries a maximum penalty of two years.

Hood had pleaded not guilty at his first trial which lasted for 7 days in
August-September 1995. The jury was unable to agree. In December 1995 he appeared before the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service.
It was not a happy experience. In April 1996 and prior to any re-trial he entered a plea of guilty.

Hood joined the Police Service in about 1986 and in November 1992 he held the rank Detective Constable First Class. For about 8 or 9 years prior to the offence he had been friendly with Raffaele (Ralph) Panebianco. The friendship had its origins in their mutual interest in Rugby League and their association with the Lithgow Shamrocks but the friendship extended further.

In November 1992 members of the Drug Enforcement Agency commenced an operation after receiving information from an informant about a suspect who allegedly had access to 12 kilograms of heroin. Undercover operative, plain clothes
Constable Robinson (assumed name) was introduced to the target, Raffaele
Panebianco on 11 November 1992 and made several purchases of heroin from the target. The meetings were recorded.

During the investigation a serious breach of security was uncovered. Access was gained to Robinson's covertly registered vehicle, SJP-896. Hood telephoned
Constable Chillmaid and requested that he do "a quick rego check for me". Hood supplied the number FJP-896 to Chillmaid who was unable to obtain the information required. Hood suggested that Chillmaid try the number EJP-896.
This inquiry was also unsuccessful. Hood asked Chillmaid to try the first number again on past owners. That inquiry was unsuccessful. The telephone call ended. Hood contacted Chillmaid a short time later and asked him to try the number SJP-896. Chillmaid again gained access to the Roads & Traffic
Authority's computer records and supplied to Hood the registration particulars including the details of the owner.

On 23 November 1992 Robinson met Panebianco who spoke of a detective named "Tony" and amongst other things, Panebianco offered to Robinson a service of obtaining car registration details. On 24 November 1992 Robinson telephoned
Panebianco's paging service with registration number LWM-705. Sixteen minutes later Sgt Thompson accessed the RTA computer data concerning that vehicle.
Four minutes later Robinson received a telephone call from Panebianco who supplied ownership details of LWM-705.

The police were worried that the operation may have been compromised.
Ultimately in March 1993 Panebianco was charged with 7 drug conspiracy offences. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced. In other circumstances the safety of the police operative could have been compromised but that is not the present case.

A major issue before the sentencing judge was whether Hood, when he gained information from the RTA computer records and gave it to Panebianco, knew that he was a drug dealer or a criminal or a person in respect of whom no such confidential information should be disclosed by a police officer. Hood claimed that he was not so aware.

Ms Harrington, who was serving a 2 year sentence for being knowingly concerned in the supply of heroin, gave evidence to the contrary. She claimed that she was having a personal relationship with Panebianco and was working as a receptionist and cleaner at a brothel called "Plumes". He was a part owner of that business. She asserted that during this period Panebianco introduced Hood to her and that she came to know him. She said that she had meals with them and that at one dinner Panebianco had spoken about a plantation of Indian Hemp in Hood's presence. She could not recall the details which were mentioned. She insisted that Hood came to Plumes to speak to Panebianco and that she had met him there three or four times. She said that she was present when Panebianco had telephone conversations with Hood in which Hood was asked to obtain the registration details of a vehicle owned by a Garry Robinson. The information being sought was his address.

The accuracy and veracity of Ms Harrington's evidence was challenged in cross examination but she adhered to what she had said.

Hood denied ever going to Plumes or ever having heard of it before and asserted that he knew nothing of Panebianco's involvement with that establishment. He had had dinner on one occasion with Ms Harrington and
Panebianco but it was at a different restaurant. He denied that there was any mention of marijuana. Hood stated that he had been to Panebianco's home and met his wife and children. He was aware that Panebianco had a restaurant in
Sydney University and a convenience store in the Naremburn area and believed that Panebianco was a businessman in the food industry.

The cross examination of Hood commenced with the Crown Prosecutor seeking to undermine Hood's credit. Hood was first permitted to be asked, over objection, if he had given sworn evidence at his trial that he did not make a telephone call on 21 November 1992 to Constable Chillmaid. Hood agreed. Hood was next asked if he had lied on his oath. Objection was taken and the judge remarked that Hood would be entitled to have a warning. There was legal discussion.
Apparently, the question was not pressed.

Hood was next asked if he had initially told the Royal Commission into the
Police Service on 8 December 1995 that he was not driving his then motor vehicle at the time it was involved in a motor vehicle accident. Hood agreed and that he had later conceded, after another person had given evidence, that he had been driving that vehicle. It was put to him over objection, that he had attempted to mislead the Commission because he thought it was to his advantage. Hood agreed.

The cross examiner then moved from matters relating to Hood's credit to those relating to the particular matters in issue. Hood denied that he had discussed drugs in Panebianco's presence. Hood insisted that he was unaware in 1991/1992 that Panebianco was a criminal involved in drugs and that Panebianco then had no criminal history.

Hood answered, in a very unconvincing way, questions relating to him seeking money from Panebianco. Hood's explanation that he was seeking repayment of $100 was not credible.

Panebianco's evidence supported that of Hood, Panebianco stating that he had never met Hood at Plumes and that Hood was unaware of his interest in that brothel. Panebianco denied that Hood had been to the Naremburn home.
Panebianco denied that he had mentioned a plantation in Hood's presence or discussed drugs. Panebianco agreed that he had dinner with Hood and
Harrington.

Panebianco agreed that Hood, on the telephone, had asked him for "moolah". His explanation of the telephone conversations with Hood was not believable. Nor was his evidence as to payments to Hood. The judge declined to accept any of
Panebianco's evidence, regarding him as a most unimpressive witness who was telling lies to protect Hood. However, there were some matters about which
Panebianco was telling the truth as they appeared in the evidence of
Harrington and Hood and seemed to be correct. As to the matters in dispute, such as Hood's request for money, there was ample material justifying the rejection of Panebianco's evidence on such matters.

The judge found that Harrington was convincing in the way she gave her evidence and appeared to be truthful. As to Hood the judge relied on two previous instances where Hood had given incorrect evidence, namely at his first trial where he denied making the telephone call to Chillmaid and at the
Royal Commission where he initially denied that he was the driver of the vehicle and the unsatisfactory explanations of his telephone requests for money.

The judge, after dismissing the evidence of Panebianco said: "As to the prisoner his record of having told lies previously is such as to disentitle him from any consideration of my believing his story or accepting that version to the point where it casts any doubt upon the evidence given by
Ms Harrington.

In those circumstances...this matter has to proceed on the basis that I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the prisoner gave this information having some knowledge of the fact that Mr Panebianco was not the sort of person for whom confidential information should be obtained through the police computer.
 ...he knew of Mr Panebianco's association with the brothel and ...of other illegal activity although...it is impossible to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the detail of that." 
It was common ground that the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) did not apply to the sentencing proceedings. No direction was given applying it. No argument was addressed to the point of Hood being required, over objection, to answer the question whether he had given evidence in his trial that he did not make a telephone call to Constable Chillmaid on 21 November 1992. Further,
Hood was not warned at that stage. I will say nothing further about these matters. The relevant part of the transcript of the first trial, duly proved, could have been tendered.

Hood contended that he should never have been required to answer the question whether he attempted to mislead the Royal Commission because he thought it would be to his advantage.

The [Royal Commission (Police Service) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rcsa1994334/) applies only to the Police Royal Commission. It confers extended powers upon the
Commissioner and is to be read as if it formed part of the [Royal Commissions
Act 1923](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/) (but only for the purposes of the 1994 Act). Section 11 of the 1994 Act enables the
Commissioner to compel, by arrest if necessary, the attendance of any witness.
Section 12 relevantly provides that the Commissioner may declare that all or any class of answers given by a witness will be regarded as having been given on objection by the witness and that there is no need for the witness to make an objection in respect of each answer. The 1923 Act also confers extensive powers upon the Commissioner to compel the attendance of witnesses. It was conceded by the Crown that Hood had given his evidence unwillingly and therefore relied upon s.17 of the 1923 Act. That section relevantly reads: "(1) A witness summoned to attend or appearing before the commission shall not be excused from answering any question or producing any document or other thing on the ground that the answer or production may criminate or tend to criminate the witness, or on the ground of privilege or on any other ground.

An answer made, or document or other thing produced by a witness to or before the commission shall not, except as otherwise provided in this section, be admissible in evidence against that person in any civil or criminal proceedings.

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to render inadmissible: any answer, document or other thing in proceedings for an offence against this Act; any answer, document or other thing in any civil or criminal proceeding if the witness was willing to give the answer or produce the document or other thing irrespective of the provisions of subsection (1); any book, document, or writing in civil proceedings for or in respect of any right or liability conferred or imposed by the document or other thing." 
The Crown contended that the relevant part of s.17 was subsection (2) and that the question was whether the cross examination undertaken by the Crown
Prosecutor in order to discredit Hood was evidence "against that person".

While this is important I propose to discuss whether the answers made by Hood to the Royal Commission were admissible against him in the sentencing proceedings either on their own or as the basis of or springboard to the question that he had attempted to mislead the Royal Commission because he thought it would be to his own advantage.

There is also the further issue whether this last mentioned question falls outside s.17 of the 1923 Act as it was not asked before the Royal Commission but before the sentencing judge. Objection having been taken, is the question excluded by the common law privilege against answering incriminating questions or those which tend to incriminate? That principle and the need for clear statutory abrogation appears from Hamilton v. Oades <case>; [166 CLR 486.] 
The Crown submitted: 
It had alleged and had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an aggravating feature of the offence was that Hood was aware that Panebianco was an unsavoury person; 
The cross examination of Hood based on the evidence which he gave to the
Royal Commission was factually unrelated to the aggravating feature alleged and was directed to Hood's credibility as a witness; 
The cross examination as to credit was not admitted as evidence "against that person" (Hood). It could only be used to discredit him as a witness. The protection under s.17 applied when the witness unwillingly gives evidence that "may criminate or tend to criminate" the witness; 
Section 17 does not prohibit the Crown ever using the answers given before the Royal Commission in a later proceeding. The Crown is only prevented from so using the testimony if the purpose of such use is to incriminate the accused. That was not the purpose in the present case. The purpose was to destroy or severely affect the credit of the accused.

The researches of counsel and mine did not locate any Australian decision directly in point. Section 17 of the 1923 Act and similar provisions in other
Acts have been the subject of general observations in a number of cases. In many Acts the privilege against self incrimination has, as with s.17, been expressly abolished and then restored to a limited extent. In Hamilton v.
Oades the High Court considered s.541 of the Companies Code. Sub- section (3) empowered the Supreme Court to order that a director of a company be examined on any matters relating to its affairs. Sub-section (5) empowered the Court to give such directions as to the matters to be inquired into and as to the procedure to be followed as it thought fit. Sub-section 12 provided "a person is not excused from answering a question...on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him but, where the person claims before answering the question, that the answer might tend to incriminate him, the answer is not admissible in evidence against him in criminal proceedings other than proceedings under this section or other proceedings in respect of the falsity of the answer". The whole Court held that sub-section (12) abrogated the common law privilege against self incrimination. A majority, comprising
Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ, each in separate reasons, held that sub- section (5) did not enable the Court to relieve a person from the duty to answer a question on the ground only that the answer might tend to incriminate him.

Mason CJ undertook a review of the previous authorities. He noted the risk of injustice in a witness being compelled to answer and at 494 referred to the observations of Gibbs CJ in Sorby v. The Commonwealth [(1983) 153 CLR ]
at 294: "If a witness is compelled to answer questions which may show that he has committed a crime with which he may be charged, his answers may place him in a real and appreciable danger of conviction, notwithstanding that the answers themselves may not be given in evidence." 
Mason CJ at 496 explained that in s.541 Parliament had limited the protection of witnesses to the possible consequences of direct use in evidence of the answers of the witness, "thereby guarding against the possibility that the witness will convict himself out of his own mouth - the principal matter to which the privilege is directed." Mason CJ continued: "Thus the legislative resolution of the competition between public and private interest is to provide for a compulsory examination and to give specific protection in relation to the principal matter covered by the privilege but not otherwise, except in so far as a judge, in the exercise of a wide statutory discretion may see fit...to give directions as to the matters to be inquired into." 
In the present case it was not suggested that the Commissioner had given any directions, assuming that he had power to do so.

Hamilton versus Oades confirms that when a statute expressly abrogates the privilege against self incrimination, the compensatory protection is usually not co-extensive with the privilege which has been abrogated.

The Crown attached importance to the decision of the majority of the Canadian
Supreme Court in R v. Kuldip [61 CCC (3d) 385.] The accused was charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident. At his first trial the accused had testified that following the accident he had attended at a police station and reported what had occurred and that about a month later he had re-attended and spoken to a particular officer who allegedly professed to recall the accused attending the police station following the accident. At the second trial the accused learned that the particular officer was not on duty on the day of the accident. The accused said that he thought that the officer was there but that he, the accused, must have been mistaken. Crown counsel cross examined the accused on the testimony which he had given at the first trial.

The court by a majority of 4 to 3 held that s.13 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms did not prevent the Crown cross examining an accused at his re-trial on a prior inconsistent statement made by him to undermine his credibility. A distinction was drawn between evidence used to incriminate and prior statements used to test credibility.

Also of importance was s.5 of the Canada [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html) and read: "(1) No witness shall be excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer to the question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.

Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer on the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering the question, then although the witness is by reason of this Act or the provincial Act compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of that evidence." 
Lamer CJC isolated the issue which divided the majority and the minority (including the Ontario Court of Appeal) as whether it was permissible to examine the purpose of the cross examination of an accused at a new trial on testimony given at a previous trial, that is, to incriminate or undermine credibility (393).

The Chief Justice thought that it was legitimate for there to be a distinction based on the purpose of the cross examination (396). He held that using a prior inconsistent statement from a former proceeding during cross examination to impugn the credibility of an accused did not incriminate him (397). The
Chief Justice acknowledged that it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between cross examination on the accused's prior testimony for the purpose of incriminating him and for the purpose of impeaching his credibility (398). The
Chief Justice continued at 398-399: "An interpretation of [s.13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s13.html) which insulates such an accused [one who gives evidence] from having previous inconsistent statements put to him/her on cross examination where the only purpose of doing so is to challenge that accused's credibility would ...
`stack the deck' too highly in favour of an accused." 
The seemingly inconsistent answers to the Royal Commission did not relate to matters which were in issue before the sentencing judge but to other matters and the present case accordingly differs from Kuldip.

At 403 the Chief Justice stated: "[Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html) and s.[13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s13.html) offer virtually identical protection: a witness who testifies in any proceeding has the right not to have his or her testimony used to incriminate such witness at a later proceeding. Neither [s.5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html) nor [s.13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s13.html) prevents the Crown from using the testimony in cross-examination at the later proceeding for the purpose of undermining the witness' credibility. The difference between these sections is that [s.5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html) requires an objection at the first proceedings while [s.13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s13.html) does not." 
The three judges in dissent adopted the reasons of Martin JA in the Ontario
Court of Appeal, 40 CCC 11. He held that s.5(2) of the Canada [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), when invoked, imposed a blanket prohibition against the use of the accused's prior evidence on cross examination either for the purpose of incriminating him directly or for the purpose of impeaching his credibility. Martin JA also held that [s.13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s13.html) of the Charter had the effect of making the protection afforded by [s.5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html) available whether or not the accused objected as required by [s.5(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html)
Martin JA remarked: "...where the prior evidence is used ostensibly to impeach the accused's credibility only, it nevertheless does assist the Crown in its case and, in a broad sense, may help to prove guilt." 
There is considerable weight in this remark.

Lamer CJC was careful to point out that the view which he was espousing applied where undermining the credibility was the only purpose of the cross examination on the prior inconsistent statements. In Kuldip in the judgment of Martin JA at 19-20 there was a reference to a decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal that if the main purpose of the cross examination was to incriminate the accused, such cross examination would be contrary to [s.13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s13.html) of the Charter.

The judgments of the Courts of Canada contain much helpful discussion on the construction and policy issues. The Canadian Courts were dealing, in the main, with cases where the prior inconsistent statements related to issues in the trial. They went to the credit of the accused on issues of importance. They did not, as in the present case, go to the credit of the accused generally.
The Crown relied on the answers given to the Royal Commission as showing that
Hood was prepared to lie on his oath and was unworthy of credit.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/) deals not only with the privilege against self incrimination but with all types of privilege and any other proper grounds of objection. Questions of legal professional privilege would be covered under [s.17(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html)
I express no opinion as to public interest immunity. That may either not be covered or require a discrete approach given the special considerations relating to that ground. Interesting questions could arise if a solicitor was called and was asked to relate what the client had stated, where the client's remarks pointed to guilt.

There can be cases where the purpose of the cross examination on earlier statements as to the matters the subject of the trial or different matters is twofold. It may undermine the credibility of the witness and elicit incriminating evidence of guilt of an offence.

Further, while the cross examination may have the purpose of undermining credibility and do so, it may also have the effect, if not the purpose, of incriminating the accused of a serious offence. Putting to Hood, consequent upon his answers to the Commission as to who was driving his car, that he attempted to mislead the Commission initially because he thought it would be to his advantage and Hood's affirmative answer (over objection) provided strong supporting evidence for a prosecution under s.21 of the 1923 Act for knowingly giving false testimony. The maximum penalty for that offence is 5 years. It carries more than double the penalty of the subject charge. The answer to the question tended to establish that Hood had the requisite knowledge.

It will often be the case where the matters the subject of cross examination are not the matters directly in issue in the proceedings that the cross examination will have the effect of eliciting incriminating evidence of an offence.

Lamer CJ's formulation of principle would not permit cross examination as to previous statements unless its sole purpose was to undermine credibility.
"Purpose" would include effect. It is possible that the approach and emphasis of the Canadian Courts may be slightly different if they were dealing with cross examination on previous statements relating to matters not the direct subject of the proceedings.

Some of the discussion in the Australian cases has dealt with the broad question whether the use-immunity provision prohibits both the use of direct and derivative evidence (that is, evidence obtained as a result of the answers given on an examination) In Hamilton v. Oades (supra at 496) Mason CJ pointed out that Parliament had made its legislative judgment that providing specific protection against derivative use of answers was not required and had limited specific protection to the possible consequence of direct use in evidence of the answers of the witness.

While the privilege against self incrimination, both direct and indirect, and the other privileges involve matters of fundamental importance, Parliament has determined that there are occasions when, in the public interest, those privileges (or some of them) should be abrogated. Compensatory but limited protection is often given. It becomes a matter of determining, upon the correct construction of the statute, the ambit of the protection given.
Protection against the derivative use of the answers of the witness is sometimes but not usually accorded. In construing that compensatory protection, a technical approach is not taken as that would be inappropriate for such important privileges.

Royal Commissions are usually only appointed where there are matters of considerable public importance including apprehended public ills to be investigated or a particular possible injustice or possible acts of malefaction touching upon the administration of affairs of state and the ordinary powers of inquiry and investigation are regarded as insufficient.
Thus privileges are abrogated and the compensatory protection conferred by statute is limited to answers which incriminate or tend to do so. As to company examinations there is, as the High Court has pointed out, a high public interest in the affairs of companies being honestly conducted and in directors and officers being made to reveal what happened. Otherwise concealment would leave creditors and shareholders lamenting and powerless.
Drug dealers and their associates are also liable to be examined as to their assets, including their acquisition, dealing with and secreting of them.
Parliament has found it increasingly necessary to abrogate the privileges and confer limited protection in return.

In almost all, if not all, cases there is no protection given where the witness is untruthful or, perhaps more correctly, is being prosecuted for giving false testimony. While a witness may be prosecuted directly for false testimony when compulsorily answering questions, it would be incongruous if in other proceedings in which his credit is important, material could not be elicited of the witness giving contradictory and seemingly untruthful answers in compulsory questioning.

There is one further point which must be addressed. The specific question to which objection was taken was not asked and answered in the Royal Commission but in the subject proceedings. It follows that s.17 of the 1923 Act does not apply and that the common law privilege against self incrimination has never been abrogated. Hood was not warned. Instead, he was compelled to answer the question. I doubt if this was pointed out to the judge. Before this court and in the written submissions attention was focussed on [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/).

I have reached the following conclusions: 
Where a statute abrogates the privilege against self incrimination and confers compensatory protection, the court must construe the ambit of that statutory protection. A technical or narrow approach should not be adopted having regard to the importance of that privilege; 
Where questions in cross examination have the twofold purpose or effect of undermining the credibility of a witness and tending to incriminate that witness, those questions are not permissible. There is a rider to this principle where the offence in respect of which the witness is tending to be incriminated is trivial or technical and the dominant purpose and effect of the cross examination is to undermine the credibility of the witness; 
Questions in cross examination as to prior inconsistent statements to a
Royal Commission having the sole purpose and effect of undermining the credibility of a witness are admissible; 
Where it is hard to draw the line between cross examination undermining credibility and that having a tendency to incriminate and there is a substantial risk that it may have the tendency to incriminate, such cross examination is not permissible; 
The answer to the challenged question in cross examination had the tendency to incriminate the accused of a serious offence, namely of knowingly giving false testimony under [s.21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s21.html) of the [Royal Commissions Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/). It was thus inadmissible even though it also undermined the accused's credibility, assuming [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of that Act applied; 
However, [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) did not apply as the challenged question or the substance of it was not asked at the Royal Commission. Thus, in respect of that question the privilege against self incrimination had not been abrogated. The question was thus impermissible and covered by the privilege, objection having been taken, no warning having been given and the witness directed to answer the question.

The Crown contended that even if the question was impermissible the Court would still arrive at the same result. It relied on the judge finding Ms
Harrington to be an impressive witness, regarding Panebianco's credit poorly and disbelieving him and correctly not accepting Hood's explanation as to why he was seeking money from Panebianco. The Crown also pointed to Hood's evidence at the first trial and the change of plea.

There are a number of difficulties with the Crown's approach.

Hood should receive credit for his change of plea. It saved the expense of a second trial. The jury had been unable to agree at the first trial so that a conviction at the second trial was not inevitable. Accused need to be encouraged to plead guilty and not to feel that there is no point in pleading guilty even at a late stage.

The sentencing judge regarded Hood previously telling lies as disentitling him from any consideration of his story being accepted to the point where it casts doubt upon the evidence of Ms Harrington. With her drug conviction and activities, caution would usually be exercised in acting upon her evidence.
The details supplied by her were sketchy.

There is much substance in the appellant's submission that the evidence was inadmissible in the form in which it was elicited and that the judge's remarks on sentence reveal that he was influenced by that evidence and that this probably affected the sentence imposed.

The judge noted that Hood had no previous convictions and that he was described in the probation report as a dedicated police officer who went out of his way on occasions to assist others. The report suggested that he was given too much responsibility too soon and that he was ill equipped to handle it. In the sporting field he was a good performer but more importantly, he assisted others. The judge accepted that there were many aspects of his character which were worthwhile and that there were areas in which he had made a significant contribution to the police force and the community.

The judge correctly emphasised that Hood had betrayed his trust. The potential for harm existed. Fortunately, none seems to have eventuated. Hood allowed a personal friendship to cloud his judgment so that he departed from the standards expected of an honest and honourable police officer.

I think that the judge was influenced by the answer to the impermissible question. Having regard to that , the absence of prior convictions, his prior dedication as a police officer, his assistance to others, his plea of guilty and the harsher custody conditions encountered by a former police officer, the sentence of 20 months where the maximum penalty is 24 months is excessive. In my opinion the appropriate sentence was one of 16 months comprising a minimum term of 12 months and an additional term of 4 months. This ratio should not be varied on account of special circumstances. Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
Leave to appeal granted.
Appeal allowed.
In lieu of the sentence imposed, Anthony James Hood is sentenced to a minimum term of 12 months commencing on 3 June 1996 and expiring on 2 June and an additional term of 4 months commencing on 3 June 1997 and expiring on 2 October 1997.
That the applicant be released on parole on 2 June 1997.
 
IRELAND J: I agree with Smart J for the reasons he has given that leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed and the applicant resentenced in accordance with the orders he proposes.

In common with Hunt CJ at CL, I would reserve questions of interpretation of statutory provisions such as [S ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rca1923224/s17.html) of the Royal Commission Act, 1923 to a case in which their determination was necessary.
 [1] Many of the cases are discussed by Young J in "Taking the Fifth" [(1991) ALJ 412], to which I would add Boyle v. Wiseman <case>; <case> ER 598 at ].
