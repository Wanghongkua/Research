D M McFadden versus Pacific Timber Importers P/L and Anor [1996] NSWSC 308 (29
July 1996) 
Dennis Malcolm McFADDEN versus PACIFIC TIMBER IMPORTERS PTY LTD & ANOR /96 
MONDAY 29 July 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ABADEE J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Having regard to the matters raised in the affidavit of Paul Anthony Richardson dated 1 April 1996, which matters I accept, it seems to me to be appropriate that I should make the order as sought in paragraph one of the notice of motion. The order is that the plaintiff be given leave pursuant to <case> B of the Corporations Code to commence proceedings against the first defendant.

It has been brought to my attention that because of matters pertaining to an issue of limitation, the plaintiff seeks that the order should apply, in effect, retrospectively back to the date when the common law proceedings were instituted. Those proceedings were instituted on 9 February 1995. In support of that application I have been taken to a decision of Nicholson J in the
Supreme Court of Western Australia. That decision is in Alcoa Australia
Limited versus Petma Pty Ltd & Ors, (unreported, 29 July 1994).

It seems to me that it is appropriate for me to grant the relief sought and as
I have said, retrospectively. Having regard to the matters that have been put to me and the decision of the Western Australia Supreme Court in the matter of
Alcoa, it would be appropriate for me in a proper exercise of the discretion, to grant leave nunc pro tunc for the commencement of the action referred to. I make that further order.
