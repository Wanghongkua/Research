GUY LAWRENCE CRYER versus IAN LAWRENCE OSSHER AND ORS` ` 3093/97` `3 November 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from Master McLaughlin. The learned Master was faced with a very awkward situation. The plaintiff is one of three co-owners of commercial premises in Double Bay; the premises are a strata business unit. The plaintiff is in ill health. He commenced proceedings under [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) for an order for sale. 
The defendants indicated early on that the defence was that the premises were business premises which were acquired by the three co-owners for particular purposes and it would be unconscionable for any of them to frustrate those business purposes by seeking statutory relief under [s
G.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) 
The defendants sought to file a cross claim. This application was dealt with by Simos J on 3 October 1997. His Honour gave leave to file a cross claim without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to make application to the
Master to rescind that order. All that this cross claim sought was an order that the plaintiff's one-third interest in the property be sold to the defendants at a valuation. I would not have thought that that was a valid cross claim, although there is some authority to support the proposition that the defendants might succeed if they undertake to the Court that they will buy the property at a third of the valuation fixed by the Court. However, no such undertaking has ever been proffered by the defendants.

The claim and cross claim was listed before Master McLaughlin on 7 October for an expedited final hearing, but the matter was not reached. When it came on for final hearing before the Master on 13 October 1997, the defendants indicated that they wished to amend the cross claim to set up a further claim under [s
G(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), namely, that co-owners entitled to more than half the property wish to have partition rather than sale. The learned Master seemed to think that enough was enough, summarily rejected that application to amend, and made an order appointing trustees for sale. The defendants have appealed.

The case closest to this case is that of Pannizutti versus Trask [(1987) 10
NSWLR 531.] In that case I had done something similar to what the Master did in the present case, but the Court of Appeal reversed me by a unanimous decision. Although there are differences between Pannizutti's case and this case, particularly that Pannizutti was a situation where I was striking out a defence, the principles involved are relatively similar. The
Court of Appeal, I believe, thought my main error was not to make sure that the person seeking partition had no credible evidence on which they could succeed before striking out their defence.

In the instant case the learned Master did not turn his mind to that point. He was very concerned that there was an expedited hearing; that there had been leave to file a cross claim the previous week, and that now, for the first time, there was before him an application to add a further cross claim for partition. Moreover, the learned Master appreciated that the proposed amended cross claim would mean the postponement of the hearing because it would be necessary to get some evidence and indeed it might be necessary to wait some months before the parties were in a position to know whether partition was a real possibility. This is because not only will there need to be consent from the proprietors of other lots in the strata plan and the body corporate, but there would also need to be development consent from the local council, some surveying work and some work by the Registrar General.

I can well understand the learned Master reacting the way he did, especially in view of what I did in Pannizutti's case. However, it seems to me that subsection (4) does give a statutory right to the majority of the co-owners to put to the Court a case that there should be partition on the basis that that would be more beneficial to the majority.

The motion was heard by me last Friday. On that occasion Mr Patterson of counsel for the defendants put forward a whole lot of material to suggest that there was a case to be made that it was more beneficial for the defendants to have partition rather than sale. That material was received by me, not as evidence of its truth, but as the material on which the defendants relied.
That material was insufficient in that it did not show the difference in money terms that would be returned to the defendants if (a) there was sale and (b) there was partition. The matter was stood over until today so that that further evidence could be put on and some evidence was put on on that matter.

There is now before the Court material which suggests that if partition were possible and if the valuations are correct, that a smaller unit would sell for a greater price per square metre than a larger unit, and that looking at the figures, there would be considerable financial benefit to the defendants, even allowing for the cost of the subdivision and council approvals. The judgment of Needham AJA in Pannizutti's case at page 542 suggests that it is the financial benefit that the Court considers under [s
G(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) rather than any other benefit.

There has been some confusion in the defendants' case in that they endeavour to include not only the financial benefit to the co-owners but also the financial benefit to the business that is being carried on by a company which is controlled by them. That, as I understand it, is not a matter that I can consider under [s
G(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). It also appears from the evidence that although at one stage the defendants were insisting that the plaintiff pay one-third of the mortgage on the property, they currently are prepared to pay the outgoings on the property through the vehicle of the company that is in occupation. I have not that much evidence, but it would seem that the outgoings and the income are fairly close to being line ball. Accordingly, although the plaintiff is going to suffer by the delay in that he is in ill health and wishes to have the matter concluded as soon as possible, financially speaking, the delay is not likely to cost him very much.

Mr Enright for the plaintiff says there was no error in what the Master did.
He has cited to me cases such as Ketteman versus Hansel Properties Ltd [[1987]
AC 189] at , that one does not take into account only the money worth of the case, which can often be at least partly atoned for by costs, but one must also take into account the anxieties of the litigants. The force of Ketteman, I think, has been to a degree affected by what the High Court said in
Queensland versus JL Holdings Pty Ltd <case>; [(1997) 71 ALJR 294], so that when one has a case of a commercial nature, often costs are an adequate atonement for an adjournment. However, the litigants in the present case, although dealing with a commercial property at Double Bay, are each individuals and I appreciate the plaintiff is quite ill.

It seems to me that it is a very drastic decision to make not to allow an amendment by a person who is seeking, even at the eleventh hour, to raise a legitimate case. One strongly suspects that when an application is made very, very late that it is more likely than not that it is a specious amendment brought to delay. However, the extra material which has been tendered before me suggests it is more likely than not that the case is not in that situation.

Mr Enright submitted that there was nothing wrong with the learned Master's exercise of discretion and that there being nothing wrong with what he did and it being a discretionary matter, I should not allow the appeal. With respect to the learned Master, he fell into the same error as I did in Pannizutti in not making sufficient enquiries to establish whether what seemed to be a last minute delaying amendment may have had substance. Had he done so, the material now produced would have shown that the defendants might succeed under [s
G(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html); that although a three month delay might be involved there would not be a financial prejudice to the plaintiff; and although that still means that one must weigh up the personal inconvenience to the plaintiff and the extra stress there will be, one must remember too that this is not a case where the amendment was made after the proceedings commenced.

In all the circumstances, my view is that the learned Master's decision miscarried and I should allow the appeal and I should permit the defendants to amend their cross claim in accordance with the document MI01. However, I think that the whole suit should be heard as soon as possible, but I am not too sure what time it will take the parties to get ready for hearing.
 (Matter stood in list.) 
Counsel have considered the matter and directions have now been made in accordance with short minutes of order. The final hearing is fixed before me for 5 December 1997, not before 12 noon.
