JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: In this matter the only issue left for determination is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendant for the sum of $23,000 being the balance of a sum of $28,000 described as a deposit under a contract of sale dated 25 June 2004 between the plaintiff as vendor and the defendant company as purchaser. That contract was terminated by the vendor, and it is agreed that it was validly terminated.  The contract provided for a purchase sum of $238,000 and a deposit of $28,000, leaving a balance of $210,000. Special condition 67 of the contract which is headed "Reduced Deposit" provided that notwithstanding clause 2, which is the printed clause relating to payment and which in 2.2 provides that "normally the purchaser must pay the deposit on the making of this contract and this time is essential." It provides that the deposit be paid as to $5,000 on the date of the contract, and, as to the balance of $23,000, "on the completion date or on default by the purchaser of the purchaser's obligation under this agreement, and nothing shall relieve the purchaser of the obligation to pay the full 10 per cent deposit ... by the vendor."  There was a default by the purchaser. The contract was terminated by the vendor. The contract, as I have said, envisaged that normally it would be paid on the making of the contract. However, clause 2.3 of the printed terms provided that if the contract required the purchaser to pay any deposit by a later time, that time was also essential. The simple argument of the defendant is that the sum of $23,000 is a penalty; in other words, it is not an earnest of performance normally paid on entry into a contract but it is a penalty payable on default. For that argument, counsel for the purchaser company relies on the decision in Luong Dinh Luu versus Sovereign Developments Pty
Ltd <case>
That decision dealt with a contract which provided for a purchase price of $6,600,000 and a deposit of $65,000. It included a special condition which provided that if the purchaser paid less than 10 per cent of the purchase price as deposit, then if the purchaser committed a default, the whole of the per cent deposit would become payable, notwithstanding that the contract was not completed. The reasons for judgment were given by Bryson J with whom
Justices Handley and McColl agreed.  The rationale for the decision was that the deposit under that contract was clearly stated to be $65,000. It could never have been thought that the deposit was $660,000. Whatever might have been the meaning of special condition 5, it did not have the effect, and could not have had the effect, of making the balance between $65,000 and $660,000 a part of the deposit payable under the contract. That is the basis on which the court proceeded and that is the basis on which I think it is clear this matter should be determined.  When the provisions, as to the amount of the deposit, the printed provisions, as to payment of the deposit, and special condition 67 are read together, and they can clearly be read together, there is no ambiguity between them. The balance of $23,000 was always a part of the deposit. If the matter had been completed, as it ought to have been, then it would have been paid on completion with the balance purchase moneys. If there were default, then it became payable upon the default. The vendor is entitled to judgment accordingly. I will make that order.  It is agreed that the amount of interest payable on the sum of $23,000 at court rates is $2,001.95. In those circumstances, there should be judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for $25,001.95. The defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs. Exhibits can be returned.
