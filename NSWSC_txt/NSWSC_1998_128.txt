Last Updated: 20 May 1998 `MORGAN versus WEBB & ANOR` ` 3471/96` `3 April 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` `JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: This is a notice of motion seeking an order that the proceedings have been settled. 
The parties are in dispute over an estate. There was correspondence between solicitors in which the solicitors got to the position where they reached a figure that the plaintiff was prepared to accept from the estate. However, the figure was accepted conditionally by the plaintiff on the basis that certain costs would be paid and there was also an indication that the plaintiff would be prepared to negotiate on the issue or put forward some other proposition.
The parties might have agreed on a figure, but merely agreement on a figure is not sufficient to show that there was a concluded contract and I do not consider that the parties had got any further than this step. Accordingly, I note that the claim in order 1 of the notice of motion of 24 February 1998 is abandoned. I order that the notice of motion is dismissed with costs. I stand over the matter for mention before the Registrar on 1 May 1998 at 9.30am.
