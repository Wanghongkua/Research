TAMBERLIN AJ  December 2010  /287365 ROBERT DAVID AUGHTON v 
BRENT ALAN WILKIE (NO 2) 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: In this matter I have been asked by Counsel for the defendant/cross-claimant to apply the slip rule under [Pt 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p36), r 36.17 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) in relation to an order concerning the removal of a caveat. I think it is appropriate to do so, in view of the fact that there was a further amended cross-claim filed, seeking these orders, and they were not dealt with in the original decision, and had it been realised at the time by me, I would have made the orders. Accordingly, I apply the slip rule.
 I am informed that the orders have been taken out, and, accordingly, it is necessary to consider the provisions of the slip rule.
 In relation to the question of costs, it has been claimed by the defendant that there ought to be a modification of the order for costs, in view of the fact there was an issue as to whether the interest asserted by Mr Aughton had been made out. However, having regard to the substance of what was argued at the hearing, (it essentially turned on the question of misleading and deceptive conduct and there was no significant amount of time spent in endeavouring to press the question of right, title and interest of the land), the question of his claim to an interest in the land did not take any significant part of the hearing. I think in the circumstances, the appropriate order is that the order for costs should follow the ultimate outcome of the matter.
 It is not appropriate to apportion the costs on the basis of separate issues in this case. I decline to make any modification to the order for costs in this matter. The orders costs that I have made will stand.
