Regina versus Peter James Peterson [2002] NSWSC 1301 (16 July 2002) 
REGINA v. Peter James PETERSON /96 
Monday 5 May 1997 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
SMART J, BRUCE J 
JUDGMENT 
SMART J: Peter James Peterson has applied for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of 6 years comprising a minimum term of 4 years and an additional term of 2 years. This sentence and several concurrent sentences covered numerous break, enter and steal and other dishonesty offences. It was not suggested that the principal sentence and the concurrent sentences were of themselves too severe. Rather it is contended that they should not have started on 26 September 1996 but on 17 July 1996 to reflect the applicant's pre-sentence custody.

At an early stage of the hearing the Crown told the judge that the applicant had served a total of 71 days pre-sentence custody. Particulars were given and the judge noted the matter. Thereafter the applicant and his mother gave evidence, some of which required critical evaluation. There was also considerable documentary material.

The judge gave careful consideration to the overall criminality and the subjective features and the sentences which should be imposed on the various counts. The judge did not mention the pre-sentence custody. He determined that the sentences would date from the day on which he imposed the sentence, namely September 1996.

The matters and materials were quite complex and it seems that the pre- sentence custody was overlooked when the date on which the sentences were to start was fixed.

The Crown has accepted, and correctly so, that it would have been appropriate for the judge to have ordered that the sentence imposed upon the applicant date from 17 July 1996 so as to take into account the period of pre-sentence custody.

The following orders should be made:
Leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed;
Appeal allowed to the extent of quashing the dates on which each sentence is to start and end, imposing in lieu thereof: on Count 1 (taking into account Form 1 offences) - a minimum term of penal servitude for 4 years starting on 17 July 1996 and ending on 16 July 2000 with an additional term of 2 years starting on 17 July 2000 and ending on 16 July ;

On Count 2 - a fixed term of penal servitude for 2 years starting on 17
July 1996 and ending on 16 July 1998; 
On Count 3 - a fixed term of penal servitude for 2 years starting on 17
July 1996 and ending on 16 July 1998; 
On Count 4 - a fixed term of penal servitude for 2 years starting on 17
July 1996 and ending on 16 July 1998.

Section 51A Committal for Sentence - break, enter and steal (taking into account Form 1 offences) - a fixed term of penal servitude for 3 years starting on 17 July 1996 and ending on 16 July 1999.

BRUCE J: I agree.

SMART J: The orders will be as proposed.
