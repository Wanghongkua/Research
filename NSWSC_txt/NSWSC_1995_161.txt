JUDGE1
CLARKE JA I agree with Cole JA but wish to add some observations of my own.
The purpose of provisions such as [s 167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) of the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)") was discussed in the early Victorian case of
Sargood versus The Queen (1878) 4 VLR (L)389. Stawell CJ having referred to F J
Hamel's
Laws of the Customs (1854) in which the following passage appeared: "These provisions were inserted to meet a great difficulty that had occurred in dealing with disputes between importers and the customs. The officers were formerly not only empowered, but required, to detain the merchandise of any importer who, whether right or wrong, had the misfortune to differ with the collector as to the amount of duty imposed by the latter, and by which the merchant's goods were unprofitably locked up pending the settlement of the dispute, however advantageous it might be to bring them to market." went on to say (at 395): "A reasonable mode of redress is provided for the importer. In some respects he enjoys certain advantages, in others he is subjected to certain limitations. He is given interest for his money, but he is to bring his action within three months. This limitation is of great advantage to the revenue, and so to the general public, as well as to the individual importer. It is desirable in these cases to have the dispute disposed of as rapidly as possible. Evidence may be difficult to obtain, as well as retain, in litigation which may extend for many years, but which might easily be procured if that litigation commenced within a few weeks. It is undesirable that where goods are supposed to have paid duty, actions might be brought to recover back that duty at any time... "
The Chief Justice's statement that the importer is given "interest for his money" reflected the provisions of ss21 and 22 of the Customs Act 1857 (Vic) in which there was specific reference to interest. In s167 as on originally enacted there was similarly a provision requiring the payment of interest where the importer had paid more than the proper duty (as it was determined by the court). However, in 1910 s167 was amended. Its new form was substantially identical with the form in which it is found today and there is, of course, no reference in it to interest.
Notwithstanding, it is clear since the advent of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) 19 that if an importer succeeds in an action under s167 then, at least in the
Supreme Court of New South Wales, it would have a right to claim interest. It would also appear, although it is probably not important, that provided specific conditions were met interest would have been recoverable under s140 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1899 .
Following the 1910 amendment to s167 there was only one available procedure for the recovery of duty paid under protest and subsequently found not to be due. So much is clear from s167(4) the obvious purposes of which is to deny the availability of other actions for the recovery of the amount paid and to require the commencement of an action within six months of the date of payment in order to enable the customs authorities properly to regulate their financial affairs.
That position continued until 1975 when the [Administrative Appeals
Tribunal Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/) (Cth) was enacted. The substance of the provisions which later became s273GA of the Act were enacted as PtXII of the schedule to the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/). That schedule contained the legislative response to the report of the Committee on Administrative Discretions (The
Bland Committee) which was published in October 1973. The relevant paragraph of the report is No 80 which it is worthwhile setting out in full: "80. We do not regard the present arrangements for questioning decisions as satisfactory. It is our view that the citizen should not always have to go to the courts to establish that an administrative decision is wrong or that forfeiture or seizure of goods is unwarranted. In a number of cases, we think recourse to our proposed General Administrative Tribunal should be allowed for. It should be less costly and less formidable.
While cases for which section 167 of the Customs Act provides may sometimes involve large sums of money, so do cases that go to the Taxation Board of Review. We see no reason why a person aggrieved should not have, as in the taxation legislation, an election to go either to the Tribunal or the appropriate court.
If an aggrieved person on paying duty under protest, elected to apply to the Tribunal to determine the duty payable and if the Tribunal fixed an amount: less than the duty paid under protest, the Commonwealth would refund the difference; more than the duty paid under protest, the extra amount would be a debt recoverable by the Commonwealth in a competent court."
In 1980 the substance of those provisions became, apparently for reasons of convenience, s273GA of the Act (the amendment was effected by Customs
Amendment Act No 3 (1980)). It is apparent from the terms of s273GA that the legislature intended that importers should have two avenues for challenging the Collector's claim that duty was payable or the assessment of duty. The first was by following what was previously the exclusive procedure for the recovery of the moneys under s167 of the Act. The second was to apply to the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the demand made by the Collector for the sum in question. The following observations should be made about the new section and its relationship with s167.
First the applicant for review is required to lodge the application within the times specified in s167(4). Again there is the requirement that the proceedings be commenced within 6 months of payment.
Secondly, an applicant is disentitled, once it has lodged an application, from bringing an action under <case>.
Thirdly, when the Tribunal reviews the Collector's demand the proper duty payable is deemed to be the lesser of the Tribunal's determination (or if there is an appeal the Court's) and the sum paid under protest. Once, therefore, there is a decision of either the Tribunal or a court on appeal reviewing the Collector's assessment the proper duty is deemed to be the lesser of the two figures I have mentioned.
Fourthly, there are no means provided in s273GA for the recovery of any overpayment.
It follows that, subject to any provision of the Act, the importer is entitled to maintain any suitable action at law in order to, in effect, enforce the decision of the Tribunal.
The appellant, however, submits that s167(4), particularly when read with s273GA(6), prohibits the bringing of any action 'for the recovery of the overpayment'. As it is unthinkable that the legislature intended that an importer should have a means of challenging the assessment of duty but no means of enforcing a successful challenge the question arises how, if the appellant's argument is correct, the importer could secure his recovery. In this context it is not to the point to say that the Controller would automatically pay upon a decision of the Tribunal, or a court on appeal, for the Controller may, as the cases below demonstrate, raise defences to any claim such as estoppel, abuse of process and unjust enrichment.
 .
The answer proffered by the appellant is that the importer may seek an order by way of mandamus to require the Controller to carry out his obligation consequent upon the Tribunal's determination. Such an application is not, according to the argument, an action for the recovery of money and reliance is placed on the dictum of Brennan J in Commissioner of Slate Revenue versus Royal
Insurance Australia
Ltd <case>; [(1994) 126 ALR 1], at 28. His Honour was there discussing a different problem and, while there is an obvious difference between an action to recover a sum of money and an application for relief in the form of mandamus I am not convinced that the latter does not fall within s167(4).
If it were otherwise form would be preferred to substance and one of the primary purposes of this section would be defeated. That is because an importer could bring an application for mandamus many years after the payment under protest and thereby circumvent the requirement that action be brought within six months.
It is unnecessary to pursue this question further for I am of the opinion that the substantive grounds for the judgments under appeal are correct. At the time when s167 provided the sole means of challenging an assessment of duty it is obvious that the meaning and effect of sub-s4 was clear. There simply was no other way in which the challenge could be mounted. Once, however, an alternative mode of redress had been provided the position became less clear and the terms of the alternative mode of redress make it plain that some provisions of s167 ceased to have effect in circumstances where the alternative was utilised by an importer. The clearest example of that is the provision in sub-s1 that the amount demanded by the Collector as the duty payable should be deemed to be the proper duty payable in respect of the goods unless 'the contrary is determined in an action brought in pursuance of this section'. That provision has to be read down in the light of the terms of s273GA(7). Once the Tribunal determines a figure different from, and less than, the amount demanded by the Collector then the proper duty is deemed to be the amount determined by the Tribunal notwithstanding the clear terms of s (1) and, in the light of [s43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/s43.html) (6) of the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/) , is deemed to have that effect, subject to a contrary order, from the date on which the decision under review came into effect.
Furthermore, an action under <case> and an application under s273GA have to be brought within six months of the date of payment and once the latter is brought recovery under <case> is not available to the importer. Although there is no provision in s 167 similar to s273GA(6) it is clear that the two paths for challenging the duty are true alternatives and the importer may seek relief under one or the other but not both.
The combination of these factors persuade me that the provisions in <case> apply to limit applications for recovery of duty paid except in cases where an importer adopts the avenue for challenge afforded by s263GA.
As I have indicated the provisions of s167 need, at the very least, to be read down in some respects where an application is made under s273GA and in my opinion the above considerations tend strongly in support of the view that the reading down should extend to sub-s4.
Of course, if action is commenced by an importer in the New South Wales
Supreme Court under <case> and the importer is successful it will recover not only judgment for the amount payable but, subject to discretionary considerations, a judgment for interest under s94 of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).
If, on the other hand, a successful applicant under s273GA is limited to the seeking of relief by way of mandamus it will not be able to take advantage of s94 or any other provision entitling it to the payment of interest and will be placed in a substantially disadvantaged position as against the importer who proceeded under s167. There is no indication in the terms of s273GA, or the history leading to its introduction into the Act, to suggest that the legislature intended that the newly introduced avenue for challenge should, if followed by an importer, substantially disadvantage that importer as against one who proceeded under the old provision.
This provides a final reason why I would conclude that the judges at first instance were correct to exclude the limiting operation of <case> where an application was made by an importer under s273GA.
The same reasons would lead me to reject the alternative argument that the amount paid as duty was deemed to be the proper duty payable in respect of the goods under <case> until a contrary determination under s273GA had been made and that therefore no interest should be ordered in respect of the period prior to the latter determination.
In my opinion once the determination is made under the latter section then sub-s7 and [s43(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/s43.html) of the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/) apply with the result that the proper duty payable is to be ascertained in accordance with s273GA(7). The deeming provision in s167(1) simply has no relevance once an application is made under s273GA.
I would dismiss both appeals with costs.
JUDGE2
HANDLEY
JA I agree that these appeals should be dismissed for the reasons given by Clarke and Cole JJA but wish to add some further brief reasons of my own. In Comptroller-General of Customs versus Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd (No 2) <case>; [(1991) FCR 243] at 263 Hill and Heerey JJ said:- ... Section 167 represents the only method whereby an action for recovery of overpaid Customs duty can be brought where there is a dispute between the owner and the Collector as to liability or matters affecting liability and ... it operates to exclude the availability of any alternative common law remedy".
With respect, I agree. However since Commonwealth legislation has provided a parallel procedure through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for determining such disputes. Once the AAT (or a court on appeal from it) has decided that the proper rate of duty is less than that demanded by the
Collector and paid by the importer that determination operates retrospectively and relates back to the time of the original decision and the consequent demand made by the Collector. See Customs Act <case> read with the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/) [s43(6).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/s43.html) Accordingly the demand by the
Collector for payment of the additional duty is retrospectively exposed as unlawful and the payment to obtain release of the goods is recoverable in an action for money had and received or in modern terms, restitution.
Mr Sullivan
QC for the Customs contended that s167(4) applied in the present case but in my opinion that provision has no application to proceedings against the Customs for restitution in which no issue arises as to the duty properly payable.
He further contended that if this be the case nevertheless the importer's cause of action was not complete until the AAT had determined the correct rate of duty.
Although in a case such as this an action by the importer for the recovery of overpaid duty could not succeed while the Collector's decision stood unreversed, this does not mean that the importer's cause of action for restitution did not arise at the time the unlawfully demanded overpayment was made. In such a case the decision of the AAT forms no part of the plaintiff's cause of action and would not have to be pleaded in its statement of claim.
Compare Coburn versus Colledge [(1897) 1 QB 702] at 706. The plaintiff would only have to plead payment to the Collector when demanded by him of moneys not properly payable under the Act which were received by the Collector for the use of the plaintiff.
The decision of the AAT (or a court on appeal) in favour of the importer in such a case does not complete the plaintiff's cause of action but merely removes a procedural defence.
The decisions of the House of Lords in Central
Electricity Board versus Halifax Corporation (19631 AC 785, General Tire and Rubber
Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [(1975) 1 WLR 819] establish that such procedural defences do not postpone the accrual of causes of action either for limitation purposes or for determining the period for which interest can be awarded under provisions such as <case> of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).
A further analogy is to be found in the principle that causes of action for malicious prosecution and wrongful arrest are complete when the acts complained of occur, and if necessary damage is suffered, although the plaintiff cannot succeed unless the prosecution later terminates in his favour, or the relevant conviction or order is set aside. See O'Connor v
Isaacs [(1956) 2 QB 288] at 325, 338-9, 357-358, 359-360, 364-5.
The appeals should be dismissed with costs.
JUDGE3
COLE JA These three appeals, heard together, raise the same issues, namely, whether an owner of imported goods which are wrongly assessed for duty by the
Collector of Customs which duty is thereupon paid by the importer under protest, is entitled to recover interest upon the moneys so paid, and if so from what date, where the correct duty payable is determined by the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
 
THE FACTS IN THE GAYLOR
APPEAL
Between October 1988 and December 1989, Gaylor Pty Limited (Gaylor) paid, under protest customs duty on 26 shipments of imported jewellery. Between
December 1989 and May 1990 it similarly paid under protest custom's duty upon a further 14 shipments of jewellery. On 5 June 1990 in consequence of proceedings commenced by Gaylor in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that
Tribunal decided that duty was not payable on the first 26 shipments. On 4
July 1990 Gaylor commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court seeking the sum of $2,343,578.63, being the amount of the duty paid under protest in respect of the 26 shipments, together with interest pursuant to s.94 [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).
On 27 July 1990, by consent of the parties, the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal decided that no duty was payable on 5 of the later shipments, and shortly thereafter the parties agreed that no duty was payable on the remaining 9 shipments. On 27 July 1990
Gaylor commenced proceedings in the
Supreme Court seeking judgment in the sum of $1,733,716.29, being the amount of duty paid under protest on the 14 shipments, together with interest pursuant to s.94 [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).
On 2 August 1990 the collector repaid the duty on the first 26 shipments and on 13 August 1990 repaid the duty on the 14 shipments.
No interest was paid.
In a judgment delivered on 15 October 1991, Carruthers J held that interest was payable and awarded the sum of $435,824.04 interest in respect of the duty paid on the first 26 shipments, and the sum of $159,089.16 interest on the duty paid under protest in respect of the later 14 shipments.
 
FACTS IN THE DAHLIA MINING APPEAL
On 11 January 1988 Dahlia Mining
Company Limited (Dahlia) paid under protest custom's duty assessed and imposed by the Collector upon imported oil.
On 2 June 1992 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal held that the imported oil was not dutiable. On the same date Dahlia filed a statement of claim in the
Supreme Court seeking repayment of duty of $601,881.48 together with interest which, in accordance with the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), to the date of issue of writ amounted to $445,689.11.
On 15 July 1992 the Collector repaid the wrongly assessed duty but without interest. On 18 August 1992 Studdert J held that Dahlia was entitled to interest.
In each of the matters before Carruthers
J and Studdert J, the owner claimed interest from the date upon which the duty had been paid under protest. In addition to arguing that no interest at all was payable, the
Collector alternatively contended that if interest was payable it was payable only from the date of the determination by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that the duty had been wrongly assessed. This contention was rejected by each of Carruthers J and Studdert J. Those submissions that no interest at all was payable, or alternatively that it was payable only from the date of determination of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, were maintained by the
Collector in these appeals.
The judgments of Carruthers J and Studdert J were each consistent with the views expressed by Giles J in Dahlia Mining
Co. Limited versus Collector of
Customs. ((1) [(1989) 17 NSWLR 688).] The respondent contended they were consistent with the later decision of Ashley J in BHP Petroleum (Bass Strait)
Pty Limited versus Jenkins ((2) [(1993) 115 ALR 179)], whose decision was upheld on appeal. ((3) BHP Petroleum (Bass Strait) Pty Limited versus Jenkins, Collector of
Customs; Esso Australia
Resources Limited versus Jenkins, Collector of Customs (unreported Supreme Court of Victoria, Appeal Division, 15 August 1994)).
 .
The appellants conceded that unless the decision of Giles J in Dahlia was overruled, the appeals must fail. They contended that
Giles J's decision in
Dahlia could not stand with the majority decision of the Full Court of the
Federal Court in Controller General of Customs versus Kawasaki Motors Pty Limited (No.2) ((4) <case>; [(1991) 32 FCR 243)], notwithstanding that the majority of Hill and
Heerey JJ wrote regarding the decision of Giles J: "It is not necessary here to consider the correctness of that decision, although we should not wish to be thought to suggest that the decision was incorrect." ((5) <case>; [(1991) 32 FCR 243] at ).
 
THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
The material portions of the Customs Act 1911 as amended, are contained in s.167 and s.273GA. Those provisions are: "167(1) If any dispute arises as to the amount or rate of duty payable in respect of any goods, or as to the liability of any goods to duty, under any Customs Tariff, or under any Customs
Tariff or Customs Tariff alteration proposed in the Parliament (not being duty imposed under the [Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping)
Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/cta1975295/)), the owner of the goods may pay under protest the sum demanded by the Collector as the duty payable in respect of the goods, and thereupon the sum so paid shall, as against the owner of the goods, be deemed to be the proper duty payable in respect of the goods, unless the contrary is determined in an action brought in pursuance of this section.

The owner may, within the times limited in this section, bring an action against the Collector, in any Commonwealth or
State Court of competent jurisdiction, for the recovery of the whole or any part of the sum so paid.
 ...

No action shall lie for the recovery of any sum paid to the
Customs as the duty payable in respect of any goods, unless the payment is made under protest in pursuance of this section and the action is commenced within the following times:
In case the sum is paid as the duty payable under any
Customs Tariff, within 6 months after the date of the payment; or
In case the sum is paid as the duty payable under a Customs
Tariff or Customs Tariff alteration proposed in the Parliament, within 6 months after the Act, by which the
Customs Tariff or
Customs Tariff alterations proposed in the Parliament is made law, is assented to." 
Section 273GA(1) "Subject to this section, applications may be made to the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of: (specified determinations by the Collector including determinations regarding duty payable)." "(2) Where a dispute referred to in subsection 167(1) has arisen and the owner of the goods has, in accordance with that subsection, paid under protest the sum demanded by the
Collector, an application may be made to the tribunal for review of the decision to make that demand and of any other decision forming part of the process of making, or leading up to the making of, that first-mentioned decision.

An application may not be made to the tribunal under subsection (2) unless the application is made within the time specified in paragraph 167(4)(a) or (b), whichever is appropriate.

Where the owner of the goods has made an application to the Tribunal under subsection (2), he is not entitled to bring an action under subsection 167(2).

Where, on an application made under subsection (2), the
Tribunal has made a decision reviewing a demand made by the
Collector, the proper duty payable in respect of the goods concerned shall be deemed to be: the sum determined to be the proper duty by, or ascertained to be the proper duty in accordance with: the decision of the Tribunal; or an order of a court on appeal from that decision; or the sum paid under protest. whichever is the less."
The quoted provisions of s.273GA were introduced by the [Customs Amendment
Act (No.3) 1980](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/caa31980231/). However the substance of those provisions was first enacted in 1975 as [Part XII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/caa31980231/index.html#p12) of the Schedule to the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/). ((6) [Part XIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/index.html#p13), clause 12(iii),(vii),(viii), (ix) which correspond with s.273GA(2), (5), (6), (7)). Also included in the [Administrative Appeals
Tribunal Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/) was [s.43(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/s43.html) which provided: "A decision of a person as varied by the Tribunal or a decision made by the Tribunal in substitution for the decision of a person, shall, for all purposes (other than the purposes of applications to the Tribunal for a review or of appeals in accordance with [s.44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/s44.html), be deemed to be a decision of that person and, upon the coming into operation of the decision of the
Tribunal, unless the
Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect, or shall be deemed to have had effect, on and from the day on which the decision under review has or had effect."
Accordingly the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in these matters that no duty was payable operated as and from the date on which the
Collector wrongly assessed and required payment of the now refunded duty.
 
THE APPELLANTS' CONTENTIONS
The appellants' contentions may be summarised as follows: 
At common law a party had no right to recover interest or a sum equivalent to interest by way of damages. ((7) Reliance was placed upon
Australian National Airlines
Commissioner versus Commonwealth of Australia and
Canadian Pacific Airlines Limited <case>; [(1975) 6 ALR 433).] 
Accordingly, the claim for interest depends upon the proceedings brought by the owner of goods falling within s.94(1) or (1A) [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/).
((8) "94(1) In any proceedings for the recovery of any money (including any debt or damages or the value of any goods), the Court may order that there shall be included, in the slim for which judgment is given, interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date when the judgment takes effect. (1A) Where - proceedings have been commenced for the recovery of a debt or liquidated damages; and payment of the whole or a part of the debt or damages is made during the currency of the proceedings and prior to or without judgment being given in respect of the debt or damages, the Court may order that interest be paid at such rate as it thinks fit upon the whole or any part of the money paid for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the payment..."). 
In consequence of S.167(4) [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), any action for the recovery of duty being a proceeding for the recovery of money, must be brought pursuant to [s.167.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) The Collector accepted that, if an action for recovery of duty was brought pursuant to [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html), s.[94](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s94.html) [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) conferred a power to award interest. He argued that the only remedy to recover improperly assessed duty, and interest thereon, was by an action pursuant to s.167. 
Section 273GA(2) provides an administrative remedy to a dissatisfied owner, which remedy is a true alternative to the judicial process provided by s.167(2). The deeming provisions in s.273GA(7) result in the Tribunal's determination fixing the proper duty payable, and result in the Collector having a duty to repay any duty paid in excess of that determined as the proper duty by the Tribunal. The duty upon the Collector to repay arises either "directly and by implication from the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) without need to invoke notions of common law restitution", or, from [s.163](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s163.html) [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and [Regulation 126(e)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s126.html) The duty of repayment may be enforced by mandamus.
Enforcement proceedings by way of mandamus do not conflict with [s.167(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html), as mandamus proceedings do not fall within the description of an action for the recovery of money.((9) Reliance was placed on Commissioner of State Revenue v
Royal Insurance Australia Limited <case>; [(1994) 126 ALR 1] at 28).
The judicial route via [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html), and the administrative route via [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) are alternatives. Whilst an action pursuant to [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) will result in a determination of the proper duty and may attract interest from the date of payment of duty paid under protest, a determination by the Tribunal that no duty was payable "does not result in a conclusive determination that a sum demanded by the
Collector was wrongly or unlawfully demanded at the time of demand". ((10) Written submissions, paragraph 9). It was contended that a
decision of the Tribunal merely substituted one administrative decision for another. ((11) Reliance was placed on Drake versus Minister for Immigration and
Ethnic Affairs [(1979) 24 ALR 577] at 589). 
The effect of [s.167(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) is to deny the existence of any cause of action to sue for recovery of moneys found, in consequence of a Tribunal determination pursuant to [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html), to have been wrongly levied because the only such action permitted is one pursuant to [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html), and s.[273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html)(6) denies the right to bring an action under [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) if a review pursuant to [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) is sought. [Section 273GA(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) speaks only from the date of the Tribunal decision with the consequence that it is only at that date that there is deemed to be a different or no duty payable. Accordingly no cause of action for recovery of moneys paid under protest could arise until that date, and thus any interest would only commence to be payable from that date.
 
THE RIGHT TO RECOVER WRONGLY ASSESSED DUTY PAID UNDER PROTEST
The Collector accepted that, since the amendments to the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) which introduced [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) in 1980, and presumably since the corresponding amendments introduced by the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/), there were two methods by which an owner who paid duty under protest could contest the propriety of the duty imposed. The first method was by bringing an action pursuant to s.167, and the second was by way of review pursuant to s.273GA. If the owner of the goods was successful under either process, the result would be that there was an obligation upon the Collector to refund the wrongly imposed duty. The source of that obligation if the s.167 route was followed, is the order of the court in an action permitted by s.167(2) brought within the time limitations specified in s.167(4). Such an action permitted by s.167(2) is clearly an action for the recovery of money within the meaning of s.94 [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), and, if the action be brought in the Supreme Court of
New Court Wales, interest may be awarded.
It is in my view implicit in s.167(2) that the cause of action to recover duty paid under protest is complete at the time of payment under protest for otherwise there would be an incomplete cause of action insufficient to ground the contemplated proceedings.
If an owner of goods proceeds by the available alternative of administrative review, it is obvious that his purpose in doing so is to recover any duty wrongly imposed which he has paid under protest. The
Collector accepted, rightly in my view, that there was imposed upon him the obligation to repay to the owner any duty determined by the Tribunal to the improperly levied in consequence of its determination that no duty or a lesser duty was truly payable. The effect of s.273GA(7) is to deem as the duty properly payable the sum determined in consequence of the administrative review, or the sum paid under protest, whichever be the less. It matters not, in my view, whether the source of the obligation upon the Collector to repay overpaid duty paid under protest flows from s.163 [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), by implication arising from the statute, or in consequence of principles of restitution. The purpose of the proceedings by way of administrative review as the owner knows, and as the Collector accepts, and as is in any event obvious, is to determine whether or not the Collector is obliged to repay to the owner either the whole or portion of the sum paid under protest. In substance the administrative procedure is a claim by the owner to recover the moneys paid under protest. The provisions of [s.273GA(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) and (7) and the acceptance by the
Commissioner that he has an obligation to repay moneys paid under protest determined by the Tribunal to have been improperly demanded makes that clear.
The question remains whether, there having been a tribunal determination that moneys paid under protest were improperly demanded, the owner may then commence an action to recover those moneys. [Section 273GA(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) makes clear that, having made an application to the Tribunal, no action may be brought under [s.167(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) [Section 167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) contains, and contained when [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) was introduced, two relevant restrictive provisions. The first was that by the concluding words of [s.167(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html), as against the owner of goods, the sum of duty paid under protest was deemed to be the proper duty payable in respect of the goods "unless the contrary is determined in an action brought in pursuance of this section".
Prior to the introduction of [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) the only method of challenging the correctness of the Collector's levy was by "an action" brought in pursuance of [s.167.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) The one action was to determine both the correct duty payable, and any amount the Collector was obliged to repay.
The second restriction was that the owner could not commence an action for recovery of moneys wrongly levied as duty unless payment was made under protest and "the action" was commenced within the specified times. "The action" referred to in [s.167(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) was that action anticipated under [s.167(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html)
The effect of [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) was to provide a second means whereby duty paid under protest could be determined to be no longer "deemed ... the proper duty payable in respect of the goods". [Section 273GA(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) resulted in the Tribunal's determination, if it be less than the duty imposed by the Collector and paid under protest, being "deemed to be ... the proper duty payable in respect of the goods".
If an owner elected to seek a Tribunal determination of the "deemed proper duty payable in respect of the goods", the words in [s.167(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) "unless the contrary is determined in an action brought in pursuant of this section", ceased to have any application to the subject goods. A method of determining the proper duty payable applied different to that contemplated by [s.167(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) [Section 273GA(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) made clear that in such circumstances no action contemplated by [s.167(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) and (2) could be brought.
Just as [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) removed, in relation to goods in respect of which the owner sought to have determined by Tribunal decision the proper duty payable, the restriction that such proper duty could only be determined by action in court in accordance with [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html), so it removed the second restriction that recovery of moneys paid under protest could only be recovered in the same action under [s.167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) as determined the proper duty payable. This necessarily follows, in my view, because the "action" contemplated in [s.167(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) and s.[167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html)(4) is the same action.
In those circumstances, for the reasons expressed by Giles J in Dahlia ((12) [(1989) 17 NSWLR 688] at 692-695), subsequent to a determination by the
Tribunal that the Collector had wrongly assessed duty and that there be a different and lesser "deemed" proper duty in consequence of [s.273GA(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html),the owner is entitled to commence proceedings against the Collector for recovery of that duty. The effect of [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) was to effect a revocation of the exclusive method by which an owner could both dispute imposed duty and recover any wrongly levied duty which was paid under protest.
To construe [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html) otherwise would be to infer a legislative intention to remove from a person from whom moneys had wrongly been demanded, the right to sue for their recovery. Such an intention is not to be inferred absent clear words.
I can see no reason in principle, nor is there any provision in [s.273GA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s273ga.html), which results in the owner being restricted to commencing proceedings by way of mandamus to enforce a decision of the Tribunal altering the deemed proper duty payable in respect of goods. It follows, in my view, that the respondents were entitled to commence proceedings, as they did, for recovery of the moneys paid to the Collector under protest and, such actions being actions for the recovery of money, the court had a power to award interest.
The appellant's contention that interest is payable only from the date of the Tribunal's award is in my view unsustainable for at least two reasons.
First, [s.167(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s167.html) which permits an action to be brought against the Collector after payment of the duty under protest and prior to there being any court determination as to what constitutes the proper duty payable, necessarily implies that the cause of action so permitted is complete. The action may be commenced on the day the duty is paid under protest. The purpose of interest is to compensate a party, here the owner, for wrongly being deprived of the money so paid. That deprivation commences when the moneys are paid. Second, [s.43(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s43.html) Administrative Appeals Tribunals Act 1975 makes clear that the
Tribunal's decision speaks from the date of the initial wrongful determination.
The "proper duty", once determined by the Tribunal, was always the proper duty. The consequence is that the Collector demanded and received more duty than the legislature had made exigible. The owner had been deprived of that wrongly levied duty for the period from payment under protest and should be compensated by an award of interest from that date.
Each of the appeals should be dismissed with costs.
