Dean-Willcocks versus Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd & Anor` ` 1884/97` `6 June 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /97 - DEAN-WILLCOCKS V SOLUBLE SOLUTION HYDROPONICS PTY 
LTD & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff is the liquidator of two companies, Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd and Soluble Solution (Wholesale) Pty Ltd. 
The plaintiff was appointed administrator of each of these companies by resolution of their board of directors on 20 January 1997 pursuant to s
A(1) of the Corporations Law.

The business of the companies was the production of hydroponic products such as nutrients for the growing of produce hydroponically and packaging hydroponic items for sale on a retail and wholesale business. The sole director and secretary of each of the defendants was a Mr Laurence Levy. Mr
Levy died on 28 January 1997. The effect of this was that the administrator was not able to obtain the information that he might otherwise have obtained from the former controller of the companies.

The administrator sold the assets of the companies on 21 February 1997.

Meetings of each of the companies were held pursuant to s 439A(1) of the Corporations Law on 7 March 1997. Each meeting passed, inter alia, the following resolutions, with no dissent from those who were present: 
A. "That the company be wound up".

B. "To approve combining recoveries, costs and distribution to creditors of Soluble Solution 
Hydroponics Pty Ltd and Soluble Solution (Wholesale) 
Pty Ltd".

I am informed from the bar table that all creditors of each company attended their respective meetings save that the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation who was a creditor did not attend either meeting.

The liquidator informs the court that he has had great difficulties in administering the companies which difficulties have been exacerbated by the death of Mr Levy. It appears from the books and records that the liquidator holds, that Mr Levy was indiscriminate in his ordering process, sometimes using order forms from one company when the stock was to be recorded as an asset of the other company. The affairs of the companies were interdependent.
However, theoretically "Wholesale" operated as a manufacturer, wholesaling to customers including Hydroponics, whilst Hydroponics operated as retailer.
Various creditors claimed to be a creditor of one or other of the companies in circumstances not supported by the companies' records. Furthermore, the companies did not operate separate bank accounts.

The liquidator seeks an directions pursuant to <case> or <case> of the
Corporations Law that it would be just and beneficial for the liquidations to proceed by consolidating the creditors and assets of both companies.

The matter was argued before me on 5 May 1997. I tentatively formed the view that what was sought by the liquidator was eminently sensible, but that there were serious technical difficulties in the way of implementing it.
Accordingly, I reserved my decision.

The first thing to note is that <case> has no application except in a court winding up. The winding up that takes place when a meeting convened under s
A of the Law resolves that the company be wound up pursuant to <case> of the Law is that the company is deemed to have passed a special resolution for voluntary winding up under <case>. The administrator becomes the liquidator as if he had been nominated under <case>.

There is a real difference between a court appointed liquidator and a liquidator appointed in a voluntary winding up. In the former case the liquidator is an officer of the court and the court is at liberty to give him directions accordingly or may utilise the statutory power under <case>. With a voluntary winding up, the liquidator is not an officer of the court but is the agent of the company. Thus, in Re Reid Murray Holdings Ltd <case>; [[1969] VR 315] at 318, Adam, J pointed out that the court has an inherent or implied jurisdiction on an application by its own officer to assist him. This does not apply to a voluntary liquidator.

However, I need not stay on this point as it is clear that although a voluntary liquidator does not have access to the court through <case>, he has access through <case> and the authorities tend to suggest that the court has the same jurisdiction under both sections, see Re County Marine Insurance
Co; Rance's case [(1870) LR 6 Ch App 104], -5.

I note Rance's case tends to say that the jurisdiction under ss 479 and is much the same, but this cannot be completely true. Although the court may under <case> direct its officer to commit a breach of trust or to do something which it is arguable he has no power to do, under <case> the court is only given power to avoid expensive procedures but must act according to law and not authorize the liquidator to do anything which is ultra vires the company.

Section 511(2) provides that the court is only to accede to the liquidator's application if the determination of the question or exercise of power "will be just and beneficial". These words have been in companies legislations since the English Act of 1862. Although there have been some observations from judges from time to time as to what these words comprehend; see eg Re Serene
Shoes Ltd  <case>; [[1970] VR 593], 595, it seems to me that they plainly mean that the court has a discretion as to whether making an order under the section will be of advantage in the liquidation. There are many questions where the only order that the court should make is that the liquidator or the claimant proceed in the ordinary courts in the ordinary way for the determination of a dispute.
However, there are many other situations where the court can summarily solve the difficulty that has arisen in the liquidation by an order under the section in a cheap and efficient manner. Where this can be done it is "just and beneficial" to exercise the power.

There are also authorities under <case> or its predecessors that applications under the section cannot or should not be made ex parte. Although older cases such as Re Household Co-operative Supply Co <case>; [(1885) 11 VLR 295] tend to use the words "must not", more modern cases use the words "should not" (Re Evers Motor Co Ltd [[1962] QWN 6)], or say that ex parte applications are "inappropriate" (Shiraz Nominees Pty Ltd versus Collinson [(1985) 10 ACLR 7).] It is interesting to note that the only New South Wales case on this particular aspect of the matter, Re Nirvana Soap Co Ltd [(1920) WN 87], was one where PW Street, CJ in Eq said not one word against the application being made on an ex parte basis, but did demand that the court be furnished with evidence to determine whether its power should be exercised.

I can see no reason why, in a proper case, the court cannot exercise its powers under <case> on an ex parte application. The present is the perfect example where such an application should be made, a case where there is no real dispute amongst the creditors as to what should happen "on the merits" of the matter, but the liquidator is unsure as to whether he is able to administer the companies on that basis.

Under <case>, the court does not give directions to the liquidator as to what he should do. It cannot advise the liquidator to do something which would be, for instance, a wise and commercial breach of trust. Although it is said that the section must be construed liberally, see per Gibbs, J in Re Evers Motor
Co Ltd at p 13 and Re Union Bank of Kingston-Upon-Hull [(1880) 13 Ch D ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281880%29%2013%20Ch%20D%20808 "View LawCiteRecord" ), the court's role is to decide disputes according to law. Thus the court decides a question of fact or law in a summary way, but the decision is the same as would have been reached by a court sitting with a jury or after full- blown pleadings. The jurisdiction is not to decide matters according to the opinion of the presiding judge as to what would be commercially appropriate.

Having said these things, I now look to see what is the effect of the resolution (which I have called Resolution B) that was passed by the creditors of each of the companies and whether the liquidator can, as requested by that resolution, consolidate the assets and liabilities of the two companies.

Mr Cussen, the solicitor who appeared for the liquidator, was unable to refer me to any case where a court exercising jurisdiction in corporate insolvency had made such an order. He did refer me to two old cases in bankruptcy where a court had made a consolidation order so that a personal debtor's joint and several estate could be consolidated where the joint and separate creditors had agreed. He cited Ex parte Strutt [(1821) 1 Gl & J 29] and
Ex parte Sheppard [(1833) Mont & B 415.] There are more modern examples, see Re Oswald [(1985) 61 ALR 339.] The bankruptcy cases are not, with respect, of much value to the solution of the problem in the present case for at least two reasons. First, they are usually dealing with the same debtor's joint and several estates rather than two legal entities, and secondly, because there is a statutory basis for consolidation in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s53.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/); see also [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s110.html) 
However, a rule did grow up in bankruptcy independently of the statute that where estates were so inextricably blended as to render it impracticable to keep them distinct, the court would order them to be administered in consolidation: Re Kriegel; Ex parte Trotman [(1893) 10 Mor 99.] In Anmi
Pty Ltd versus Williams [[1981] 2 NSWLR 138], 164,
Powell, J applied a statement from Archbold on Bankruptcy 11th ed p 598.
This passage relied on the two cases to which Mr Cussen referred, and omitting the references, reads as follows: "Where (the joint and separate) estates are so blended together as to render it impracticable to keep them separate, they may be consolidated; but not where the accounts can be kept distinct, and a single creditor objects; and even if the creditors at a general meeting agreed to consolidate the estates, they will not be consolidated without it is ascertained that the proposed consolidation will be for the benefit of creditors generally." 
Powell, J went on to say, "To this must be added, as a gloss, that the mere fact that proofs may be difficult of investigation or that difficult questions may arise as to whether creditors are joint or separate creditors seems not to be sufficient to bring a case within the exception ...".

The case is significant because Powell, J was dealing with a company winding up case. However, as things turned out, his Honour did not actually apply the principle in the case before him.

Assuming it is possible to have consolidation in corporate insolvency, how does one go about it? I will endeavour to answer this question with respect to companies that have gone into liquidation after the appointment of an administrator.

There seem to me to be four main possibilities. First there is no doubt at all that a scheme of arrangement under s 411 of the Corporations Law could be approved by the creditors and the court. This course is sure, but would involve not inconsiderable costs in calling fresh meetings of creditors and making a two stage application to the court.

Then there is <case>(c) which is made applicable to voluntary liquidations by <case>(b). This gives the liquidator power to make any compromise with creditors.

In Re Trix Ltd [[1970] 1 WLR 1421], Plowman, J had to consider an application by a liquidator of one of a group of 12 companies to sanction a conditional agreement of compromise made under the then English equivalent of <case>(c). The proposal was that there would be a compromise with the creditors of this particular company to enable the assets of all 12 companies to be pooled and distributed. Plowman, J dismissed the summons. He said that the only proper method of dealing with the problem was under <case>, as otherwise the pooling would take place without the opportunity of objectors being considered.

The English judges have perhaps relaxed a little since that time. There have been a series of cases involving Bank of Credit and Commerce International
SA to which I will refer as BCCI. Unfortunately, these cases are not always consistently numbered in the specialist law reports. In what is reported as
Re BCCI (No 3) [[1993] BCLC 106] and as BCCI (No 2) [[1992] BCC 715 (Nicholls], VC) and 1490 (Court of Appeal), it was held that the principle in Re Trix did not apply to an exceptional case and that the BCCI case was an exceptional case because the affairs of the companies in the group had been so commingled that it was not possible to say what the assets of each were and it was also impracticable to hold creditors' meetings. Accordingly leave should be given to the liquidator to enter into a compromise under the current English equivalent of <case>(c).

The most recent episode in the BCCI litigation is Re BCCI (No 10) [[1997] 2 WLR 172.] This deals with problems in an international liquidation where there are surplus funds in one jurisdiction but not in another.

The third method of dealing with the problem is under s 510. This section permits an arrangement to be entered into between a company about to be wound up and its creditors and gives dissenters three weeks to appeal to the court. Accordingly the procedure under <case> removes the stumbling block that there is no opportunity for a disappointed creditor to escape from the effect of a compromise that a liquidator has made.

As far as I am know, <case> has not been utilised to deal with the present type of problem. However, the present case is one where there is not the normal problem with <case>, namely, whether the arrangement has been made when the company is about to be in the course of being wound up as it was made at the same time as the winding up resolution was passed.

The word "arrangement" in <case> is to be liberally construed. In Re ED White
Ltd <case>; [(1929) 29 SR 389], , Harvey, CJ in Eq said, "Provided what is proposed is a transaction such as a reasonable business man might carry out bona fide in the course of his business." However, the word "arrangement" does not cover a composition whereby the company will become solvent: Re Contal Radio Ltd [[1932] 2 Ch ];
Setco Manufacturing Pty Ltd versus Sifa Pty Ltd [(1982) 7 ACLR 327] and Re
Robinson [[1983] 1 NSWLR 154.] 
In the Contal Radio case, Maugham, J thought that "arrangement" in <case> was not intended to cover a compromise. His Lordship's reasoning is logical, but I believe I should follow the decision in White's case in this State.

It would appear that one cannot have an arrangement under <case> which is ultra vires the company.

The prime example of this is Re Salisbury Railway & Market House Co Ltd [[1969] 1 Ch 349.] In that case the company passed a resolution prior to voluntary liquidation which the court construed as having the effect of altering the company's objects. The resolution was commercially sensible. The liquidator applied for advice and was advised that he could not implement the resolution because it was ultra vires, see p 371.

The authorities have held that the court will not confirm an arrangement under s 510 unless it provides that the creditors are to be paid pari passu or unless the unfavoured creditors are sent to it: Re Farmer's Freehold Land Co
Ltd [(1892) 3 BC 39.] In the instant case, Resolution B does offend against this principle. At the very least the court could not advise the liquidator to proceed in accordance with it unless the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation who appears to be the only creditor of either company who did not attend the meeting indicated that he had no objection.

There is another problem with <case>, and that is because one just does not know who is a creditor of what company, it is virtually impossible to hold a creditors' meeting of the companies. This is because one never knows whether the required majority has been obtained or whether the meeting may have been made invalid because of the participation in the meeting by a person who was not authorized to take part in it. There would need to be an order under s in order to regularise the position.

As to a majority at a meeting under <case>, the section in its current form is rather odd. Prior to Act No 210 of 1992, <case> sets out what sort of majority was needed to pass a creditors' resolution under the section. Section (2) and (3) still state who might be a creditor for what value, but does not deal with majorities. The reason for this is that following the Harmer
Report, creditors' meetings are governed by Regulations 5.6.11 through to .6.36A which constitute the rules for any creditors' meeting. Although I have made some search for it, I cannot find any provision in the Corporations Law which actually justifies one in reading the procedure in the Regulations into s 510. However, for present purposes I do not need to concern myself with that particular problem.

Another way of approaching the problem is under <case> of the Corporations
Law. This provides that "The court may make such order as it thinks appropriate about how this Part is to operate in relation to a particular company." "This Part" refers to Part 5.3A, that is, the provisions as to administration. Sections 439A and 446B are within Part 5.3A. The resolutions to wind up under <case> may in one sense terminate the administration, but the passing of the resolution is within Part 5.3A. Accordingly, in my view s 447A does allow the court to make orders.

In Cawthorn versus Keira Constructions Pty Ltd [(1994) 13 ACSR 337], 341, after examining the Harmer Report and the Minister's Speech introducing the amendments, I said, with respect to <case>, "The court is to have plenary powers to do whatever it thinks is just in all the circumstances ...". That conclusion has been followed on many occasions since including by the Federal
Court, Hamilton versus National Australia Bank Ltd [(1996) 19 ACSR 647] and by the
Supreme Court of Victoria in Re Brashs Pty Ltd [(1994) 13 ACLC 110], 115. See also the decision of the Appeal Division of the Victorian Supreme Court in
Brash Holdings Ltd versus Katile Pty Ltd <case>; [[1996] 1 VR 24] at 26-27 and the article by KJ Bennetts "Voluntary
Administration: Shaping the Process through the Exercise of Judicial
Discretion" [(1995) 3 Insolvency Law Journal 135] at 139 and following.

As I have said earlier, what the creditors did was very sensible. It seems to me that as Resolution B was passed in the final throes of administration under
Part 5.3A, I can under <case> give the liquidator the direction that he should treat that resolution as valid for all purposes and act upon it.

On the evidence there is only one creditor who did not participate in the resolution and that is the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. It would be in the spirit of the Corporations Law that the Deputy Commissioner should be notified of the order I propose to make and that the order not be formally taken out until the Deputy Commissioner has an opportunity to acquiesce in the order or to move the court to discharge it.

Before noting the formal order it may be of use to summarize the basic principles I have covered. These are:
That where there is to be consolidation of the assets and creditors of a group of companies, normally that result should be obtained by a formal scheme of arrangement under <case> or some other appropriate section of the
Corporations Law.
In exceptional cases, the liquidator can obtain approval of a compromise bringing about consolidation which he has entered into under <case>(c).
The bankruptcy rule that where it is impracticable to keep the assets and liabilities of different companies in a group separate they may be consolidated if the consolidation is for the benefit of creditors generally if no creditor objects, applies in a corporate winding up.
Where a company has been under administration and the resolution is passed when Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law is still applicable, the court may make the appropriate directions to the liquidator under <case>.
It would be possible for the court to advise a liquidator in a court winding up that he should consolidate debts, but it would be unlikely that the court would do so unless every creditor agreed or a regime was put in place for creditors to object.

In the present case, the court orders pursuant to <case> of the Corporations
Law -
That the resolution of creditors of each of Soluble Solution Hydroponics
Pty Ltd and Soluble Solution (Wholesale) Pty Ltd severally passed on 21 March "to approve combining recoveries, costs and distribution to creditors of
Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd and Soluble Solution (Wholesale) Pty Ltd" should be acted upon by the liquidator.
Direct that the liquidator of the aforementioned companies serve on the
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation a copy of these reasons and a notice that the
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation may within 14 days after service apply to the court to discharge this order.
Direct that this order not be taken out before the 15th day after proof of service of the said copy of reasons upon the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation unless there is produced to the Deputy Registrar asked to enter the order the consent of such person.
The costs of this application may be paid out of the assets.
Liberty to apply.
