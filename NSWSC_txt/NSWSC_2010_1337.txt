IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
CORPORATIONSLIST  
BARRETT J  
THURSDAY 18 NOVEMBER 2010  /299154 PRIME INFRASTRUCTURE HOLDINGS LIMITED & 2 ORS 
JUDGMENT On 17 November 2010, orders were made to bring into operation the acquisition mechanism in respect of Prime Infrastructure stapled securities that was the subject of reasons published on 24 September 2010: Re Prime
Infrastructure Holdings Ltd <case> One matter that arose calls for comment.
 The element of the acquisition mechanism consisting of a compromise or arrangement under [Part .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.1) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) was expressed to be a scheme of arrangement between the company (called "PIHL") and the "holders of fully paid ordinary shares in PIHL (other than the
Excluded Security Holder").
 There was a definition of "Excluded Securityholder" as follows: "Excluded Securityholder: any Prime Stapled Securityholder who is BIP, BIP Bermuda Holdings IV
Limited, a Bermuda exempt limited company (registration number 43696) or a
Subsidiary of BIP or any Prime Stapled Securityholder who holds any Prime
Stapled Securities on behalf of, or for the benefit of BIP, BIP Bermuda
Holdings IV Limited or a Subsidiary of BIP." Other definitions elucidated the meaning of "BIP", "Prime Stapled
Securities" and "Subsidiary" in ways to which it is not necessary to refer.
 It seemed to me undesirable to make an order under [s (4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s411.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) approving the scheme of arrangement until it had been amended to identify with clarity and precision each "Excluded Securityholder".
 Without such an amendment, one would never know whether or not a particular holder of securities was bound by the scheme. At least two possibilities would exist in relation to every holder that was a corporation: that it was a "Subsidiary" of BIP or that it held securities "on behalf of, or for the benefit of" BIP, BIP Bermuda Holdings IV Limited or a "Subsidiary" of BIP. The latter possibility would also exist in relation to every holder that was not a corporation.
 In addition, the fact that a particular holder held a number of Prime
Stapled Securities "on behalf of, or for the benefit of", say, BIP and, at the same time, held other Prime Stapled Securities "on behalf of, or for the benefit of" persons unconnected with BIP (or for its own benefit and in its own right) would mean that none of the securities held by that holder were dealt with by the scheme.
 It was eventually made clear that, in fact, all securities intended to be excluded were held by one or other of BIP and BIP Bermuda Holdings IV Limited.
The definition of "Excluded Securityholder" was amended accordingly and the court's approval was granted in relation to the amended scheme.
 Such an amendment introducing clarity and avoiding ambiguity which might be productive of future uncertainty is clearly within the contemplation of [s (6):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s411.html) see, in particular, the following passage in the judgment of Gyles J in Re
Investorinfo Ltd <case>; <case>: "The following propositions emerge from the cases on [s (6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s411.html) and its predecessors, <case> of the Companies Code and <case> of the
Uniform Companies Acts: 
If the alteration is of a minor kind which does not really affect the details of the scheme, then the Court has power to approve the scheme as amended: Re Adelaide Air Conditioning and Domestic Engineers Ltd (In Liq) [[1972] 6 SASR 603] at 605 (Zelling J); Re H Craig Pty Ltd (1971-73) CLC 40-026 (Mitchell J); Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd <case>; <case> (Barrett J).

The discretion under the section has to be exercised at the time the scheme is approved and cannot be exercised once the approval order has been made: Re BTS Bearings and Transmission Supplies Pty Ltd (1983) 8l ACLR (Needham J).

The discretion under the section may be exercised to omit wording in a scheme which is not appropriate for inclusion in a scheme: Re
Homemaker Retail Management Ltd (Barrett J).

The discretion under the section may be exercised, with the consent of the creditors at the scheme meeting and a priority creditor, to omit a priority creditor from the definition of "creditor" in the scheme, thereby maintaining the priority of the omitted priority creditor: Re V &
M Diagnostic Services Pty Ltd [(1985) 9 ACLR 663 (Cohen] J).

The discretion may be exercised where the amendment improves the smooth working of the scheme without affecting its substance: Re Evandale
Estates Ltd 1962 VSC unreported (Adam J), noted in WE Paterson & HH
Ednie, Australian Company Law, 2nd edn, Butterworths, Sydney, 1971- at para /43; Re H Craig Pty Ltd (1971-73) CLC 40-026 (Mitchell J); Re Permanent
Trustee Co Ltd (2002) at [21] (Barrett J)." Section 411, as it relates to an arrangement between a Part 5.1 body and "its members or any class of them", contemplates that, where some group other than the totality of the members is to be bound, the precise constitution of that group must be certain on the face of the arrangement itself or, at the least, by reference to the terms of the arrangement read together with readily available and accessible records of an official kind (such as a register of members maintained under the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)).
