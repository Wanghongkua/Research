EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
In this matter on 22 May 2013 his Honour Hidden J made extended supervision orders in respect of the defendant, Mr Stevenson, under <case>(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (see State of New South Wales versus Jason Leslie Stevenson <case> On 12 June 2013 Slattery J extended those orders until 15 July of this year. The matter is listed for final hearing on 6 and 7 August. 
By notice of motion filed in court today the plaintiff seeks a further order under <case> and <case> of the Act that the interim supervision order be further extended from 6pm on 15 July 2013, to expire at 6pm on 12 August. A further order is sought pursuant to <case> that during the period of the extension the defendant comply with conditions 1 to 59 set out in the schedule signed on 17 May 2013.
The parties come before the Court today seeking that the necessary extension orders be made by consent in terms of short minutes which have been filed. The effect of the proposed order will be to extend the existing orders for a period which expires shortly after the date fixed for hearing. 
In all of the circumstances I am satisfied that the orders which the parties ask the Court to make by consent should be made. Accordingly, I make orders in terms of the short minutes filed in court today which the parties have signed.
