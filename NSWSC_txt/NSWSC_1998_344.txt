HEADNOTE 
Held: [Subsection (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) operates as a constraint on the exercise of the discretion in [s5(1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html)
If the Court decides that there are "special circumstances", this triggers the exercise of the discretion as to whether or not the existence of such circumstances justifies an additional term in excess of one third of the minimum term. There is only one question: are there "special circumstances" which justify a larger additional term than one-third.

It was open to the trial judge, pursuant to his discretion, to decide that there were no such special circumstances as would justify the imposition of an additional term longer than the one-third period.

Phelan [(1973) 61 A Crim R 466] disapproved in part.

ORDER 
Leave to appeal refused.

JUDGMENT 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant, Kylee Jane Hampton, pleaded guilty to three charges of manslaughter before Justice Dunford of this Court. The charges related to three deaths in a house at 45 Westmoreland Street, Glebe. The premises were occupied by a number of persons. Some escaped during the course of the fire, three died. The deceased were Christine Troiano, and two of her four children, Joey Fox aged eleven, and Sabrina Fox aged seven. 
The Applicant deliberately lit a fire in two separate areas on the ground floor of the house. The incident involved a number of persons, two of whom,
Ryan Joseph Mackey and Daniella Cheryl Ann Caldwell, pleaded guilty at the same time as the Applicant and were sentenced by Justice Dunford on the same day as the Applicant. Mackey also seeks to appeal from his sentence to this
Court, but asked that the application before the Court be adjourned today, and it was.

His Honour indicated that the Applicant was ill-disposed towards Christine
Troiano for one reason. The Applicant was the mother of a young child who has been in the custody of its paternal grandmother, and was the subject of a custody dispute. It appears that Christine Troiano had told the child's grandmother about the fact that the Applicant had been arrested and charged with robbery. The Applicant believed that the grandmother's knowledge would jeopardise her prospects of obtaining custody of the child. On Tuesday 5
December the Applicant and Christine Troiano had a confrontation about this matter.

Early on the morning of 7 December the Applicant and Mackey, who had his own reasons to feel ill-will towards the Troiano family, had a discussion, which his Honour described as "a tirade against Christine and her family." It was during the course of this that the Applicant said she was going to burn the house down; Mackey agreed and encouraged her to do so. His Honour concluded: "I am satisfied that the instigator of the idea to set fire to the house that night was Hampton, and that she actually lit the fire and was the principal offender." 
His Honour added: "The two of them later saw the house burning but neither called the police or fire brigade or gave an alarm." 
There was no submission made on behalf of the Applicant that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive or otherwise vitiated by any error of law.
Rather, the submission was that there was a failure to find special circumstances pursuant to [s5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/)  and, accordingly, that the minimum term should be reduced.

Counsel for the Applicant referred to a number of findings of primary fact made by his Honour, and concluded that these facts established the need for an extended period of supervised parole. In written submissions the Applicant's counsel stated: "After what must inevitably be a lengthy period of incarceration, the transition from custody to community of a woman who had ten years of offending from age twelve, drug addictions from age fourteen, precious little schooling, no employment, violent relationships, no support mechanisms as a child, is very unlikely to be smooth. A parole period of a little less than a quarter of the total sentence in such a case is, it is submitted, plainly inadequate." 
His Honour sentenced the Applicant to penal servitude for a minimum term of eight and a half years with an additional term of two and a half years. The submissions of the Applicant proceeded on the basis that his Honour had sentenced the Applicant to penal servitude for eleven years.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) , provides: "5(1) When sentencing a person to imprisonment for an offence, a Court is required: 
Firstly, to set a minimum term of imprisonment the person must serve for the offence; and 
Secondly, to set an additional term during which the person may be released on parole.

The additional term must not exceed one third of the minimum term, unless the Court decided there are special circumstances.

If a Court sets an additional term that exceeds one third of the minimum term, the Court is required to state the reason for that decision.

The minimum and additional terms set for an offence together comprise, for the purposes of any law, the term of the sentencing of the Court for the offence." 
The proper construction of [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the Act, particularly the relationship between minimum term and additional term, was considered by a bench of five in this Court in R versus GDR [(1994) NSWLR 376.] A bench of five was set because of differences of opinion about what was considered to be the "statutory norm" which [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) was said to apply.

In GDR a similar submission to the one made before this Court was made, and the Court dealt with it in the following way (pp 377-378): "The Applicant's first submission is that this was a case in which the sentencing judge should have decided that there were special circumstances within the meaning of [s5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) and, in the result, there should have been a longer additional term. This was accompanied by the submission that, as a corollary, there should have been a shorter minimum term. As a matter of logic, of course, that does not necessarily follow. When, in the course or argument, counsel was asked whether, if there had been a minimum term of eight years and an additional term of three years, he could have supported an argument that the total sentence was beyond the range of a proper sentencing discretion, he acknowledged the difficulties of doing so. However, clearly enough, the object of the appeal is not to persuade the Court merely to increase the additional term. If, in a given case, the Court of Criminal Appeal considers that there has been an error in the exercise of sentencing discretion concerning the relationship between minimum and additional terms, it may, in the exercise of its own discretion, decide that the appropriate course is to leave the head sentence as it is, reduce the minimum term, and increase the additional term.
On the other hand, as was considered in argument, there may be cases in which the Court will consider that no lesser minimum term could reasonably be imposed, and dismiss the appeal." 
In the present case the same question as was posed by the Court in GDR was put to counsel for the Applicant, namely, if there had been a minimum term of eight and a half years, and an additional term of, say, three and a half years, could this have supported an argument that the total sentence was beyond the range of proper sentencing discretion. Counsel's response was that this was a matter for judgment. He did not say it was beyond the range.

Counsel submitted that the Court start first of all with the total sentence. I do not accept that submission. The reasoning in GDR appears to be inconsistent with the statements in Phelan [(1973) 61 A Crim R 446] at :
 "The necessary consequence of a decision that a longer than usual additional term is necessary or desirable is that the minimum term must be shorter than it otherwise would have been." 
That statement was said to be based on certain passages in Moffitt [(1990) NSWLR 114], not all of which support that conclusion (c/f 117-118 per
Samuels JA; 121 per Wood J and 133-5 per Badgery-Parker J). The issue turns on whether [s5(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) requires a sequential or two-step process, on the one hand, or whether the primary consideration is the total sentence on the other hand. In view of the affirmation in GDR that general sentencing principles guide all relevant steps in the process, it is not necessary to resolve the issue, which has a chicken and egg quality about it. The two approaches may go on simultaneously (see e.g. Gower [(1991) 56 A Crim R 115] at ; Astill (No 2) [(1992) 64 A Crim R 289] at at 292).

The Applicant submitted that the decision to be made under [s5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) is not a true discretion in the sense of its exercise depending on balancing- out conflicting considerations. In GDR, the Court, after referring to the factors in that case which were said to constitute "special circumstances" said: "It would have been open to the sentencing judge, in the exercise of his discretion, to regard those circumstances, in combination, as special circumstances within the meaning of [section (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html)
However, his Honour was not bound to do so, or to respond to the circumstances by setting an additional term which was in excess of one-third of the minimum term." (Page 378) 
This is, in my opinion, also true in the present case.

Plainly there is a discretion of a general character in [s5(1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) [Subsection (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) operates as a constraint on the exercise of that discretion. The operative word in [s5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) is "decided". What is involved is, if the Court makes a decision that there are "special circumstances", this triggers the exercise of the discretion as to whether or not the existence of such circumstances justifies an additional term in excess of one-third of the minimum term. It is quite artificial to approach the matter in a two-stage manner. The only point in making the preliminary finding is if it justifies a period in excess of one-third. There is in truth only one question: are there "special circumstances" which justify a larger additional term than that.

In the present case his Honour expressed his finding on the Applicant in the course of one sentence when he said: "I find there are no special circumstances within [s5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/)." 
This statement occurs in a context of reasons for sentence for all three persons. His Honour's reasoning in the case of Mackey was: "Although there are a number of matters which could give rise to a finding of special circumstances, including serving a sentence in protection and the reduction of a minimum term to allow for pre-sentence custody, the additional term which I consider appropriate and adequate for his rehabilitation does not exceed one-third of the minimum term and, accordingly, I find special circumstances do not exist." 
Similarly in the case of Caldwell, his Honour outlined at some length the particular circumstances of the case and concluded: "Because of the need for a lengthy period under supervision on parole to facilitate a rehabilitation, I find there are special circumstances in her case." 
In the light of his Honour's reasoning considered as a whole, particularly these extracts for the other two persons, it is plain his Honour's finding that "there were no special circumstances" in the case of Hampton, was a finding that there were no such special circumstances as would justify the imposition of an additional term longer than the one-third period. This was a discretionary decision which it was open to his Honour to make.

The test which his Honour's reasoning indicates he applied is in accordance with that in Phelan (supra), at p 449: "What does constitute a matter as a special circumstance within the meaning of [s5(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) is its production of the need or the desirability of the offender to be subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole." 
It may be that the matters relied on by the Applicant as special circumstances could have justified a decision of a different character. However, a period of two and a half years is well within the range of what is appropriate supervision on parole in the circumstances. In this case it is quite a lengthy period.

His Honour took all of the matters into account and there is no reason to disturb his Honour's ultimate sentence.

There can be no doubt that the objective seriousness of the offences required a substantial period of imprisonment. A mother and her two children asleep in their own home in the middle of the night lost their lives as a result of this crime. Nothing but a significant minimum term of imprisonment would be appropriate. His Honour expressly took into account a range of subjective factors including her genuine sorrow and remorse.

In my opinion leave should be refused.

POWELL JA: I agree. 
NEWMAN J: I agree. 
SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are leave is refused. * * *
