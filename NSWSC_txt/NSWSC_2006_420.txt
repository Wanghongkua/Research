ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR NEW SOUTH WALES versus GALLAGHER  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This matter comes before me this afternoon on the application of the parties. Since I made interim orders on 13 April 2006 the defendant has been advised that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural
Affairs has cancelled his transitional permanent visa and absorbed person visa. The defendant has also been advised that a notice setting out the reasons for the cancellation of his visa will be sent to him shortly.  The evidence before me discloses that the defendant acknowledges that his visa has been cancelled, with the consequence that he will no longer be permitted to remain in Australia. He has indicated that he does not intend to challenge that decision and expects to be deported by the Department of
Immigration when released by the Department of Corrective Services. He understands that when removed from Australia he will be sent to the United
Kingdom, where as I understand it, he is entitled to reside.  In these events the parties join in an application that I vacate the hearing of the matter fixed for next Monday, 8 May 2006, and make ancillary orders, including provision for the parties to approach the court to seek further relief as and when necessary.  I am informed that there is agreement between the parties that it is likely that the Minister will give effect to her decision at an early date, in which event, when released from custody by the State, he will remain in detention at the behest of the Minister for Immigration until he is removed from Australia.  As I understand the position, it is accepted by the plaintiff that if the foreshadowed events occur, orders under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders)
Act will no longer be required, and the present proceedings may then be dismissed. However, because the necessary steps have not yet been taken, the current proceedings must remain on foot and the interim orders remain in place.  I have expressed my concern to the parties that if it should happen that the foreshadowed steps by the Minister do not take place within the anticipated time frame, and the question of releasing the defendant into the New South
Wales community again arises, this could create particular problems. The parties are aware of those problems, but nevertheless and in particular, the defendant indicates that he wishes to pursue the course reflected in the minutes of order which the parties have agreed.  In those circumstances I will make the orders in the document entitled "Draft short minutes of order" which I have initialled and dated, and I will provide that the matter will be mentioned again before me at 4.30pm on
Wednesday 10 May 2006.
