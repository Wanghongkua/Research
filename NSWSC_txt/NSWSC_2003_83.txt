IN THE SUPREME COURT  
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
JAMES J  
Friday 28 February 2003  /02 Shephard versus Director of Public Prosecutions   
JUDGMENT  This is an appeal pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/index.html#p5) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) in which the plaintiff Maurice Richard Shephard claims orders pursuant to [s (a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s109.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) quashing (1) his conviction on 4 June 2002 at the Newtown Local Court on a charge of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence on 2 May 2002 (2) an order made in the Newtown Local Court on 29
August 2002 refusing an application made by him under <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) that his conviction on the charge of breaking entering and stealing be annulled, and a consequential order that the proceedings against him on the charge of breaking entering and stealing be remitted to the Newtown Local Court to be dealt with according to law. The person shown as being the defendant to the appeal in the
Court documents which have been filed in the appeal is the police officer who was the informant in the prosecution of the plaintiff in the Local Court. It was common ground on the hearing of the appeal that the proper defendant to the appeal was the Director of Public Prosecutions and, to the extent to which it may be necessary, I make an order substituting the Director of Public
Prosecutions as the defendant.  The appeal was instituted out of time but at the hearing of the appeal counsel for the defendant informed the Court that the Director did not oppose the making of an order extending the time for the institution of the appeal and I make such an order.  The history of the prosecution of the plaintiff is set out in an affidavit by a solicitor in the employ of the Legal Aid Commission, who since about
August 2002 has had the carriage of the matter for the plaintiff. At the hearing of the appeal there was no dispute about the facts deposed to by the solicitor in her affidavit.  
HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS  On 2 May 2002 the plaintiff was charged with breaking entering and stealing and with a back-up charge of goods in custody. The charges were mentioned in the Newtown Local Court on 21 May 2002, when they were adjourned to 4 June On 4 June 2002 there was no appearance by the plaintiff at the Newtown Local
Court. By some means the Local Court magistrate had been informed that the plaintiff claimed to be ill. However, the magistrate said "I don't accept that" (that is, that the plaintiff was ill). In the absence of the plaintiff the magistrate, purporting to act pursuant to ss 75A to 75F of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/), which sets out a scheme for ex parte proceedings where a defendant fails to attend, convicted the plaintiff on the charge of breaking entering and stealing and issued a warrant for the arrest of the plaintiff. The prosecution was then given leave to withdraw the charge of goods in custody.  On 24 June 2002 the plaintiff was arrested and later that day he was granted bail.  On 29 August 2002 the magistrate who had convicted the plaintiff on the charge of breaking entering and stealing refused an application made by the plaintiff's solicitor under <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) that the conviction made in his absence be annulled.  After 29 August 2002 there were delays in the transcript of the proceedings on 4 June 2002 and on 29 August 2002 becoming available and these delays explained the late institution of the appeal.  
GROUNDS OF APPEAL  The grounds of appeal, stated very broadly, are that the offence of breaking entering and stealing of which the plaintiff was convicted was an indictable offence; as an indictable offence it could be dealt with summarily by the
Local Court magistrate, only if that was permitted by [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/index.html#p2) Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act; the requirements of Pt 2 Div 3 of the
Criminal Procedure Act were not complied with; and that, consequently, the
Local Court magistrate lacked jurisdiction to deal with the offence summarily.  
THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT  It is convenient to set out some of the provisions of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the
Criminal Procedure Act. This Division is headed "Summary Disposal of
Indictable Offences by Local Courts".  . Objects of this Division  
The objects of this Division are:  to require the indictable offences listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority or the person charged with the offence concerned elects to have the offence dealt with on indictment, and  to require the indictable offences listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elects to have the offence concerned dealt with on indictment.  . Indictable offences to which this Division applies  
This Division applies to the indictable offences listed in Tables 1 and 2 to
Schedule 1.  . Offences to be dealt with summarily unless election made to proceed on indictment  
An indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by a Local Court unless the prosecuting authority or the person charged with the offence elects in accordance with this Division to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  
An indictable offence listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by a Local Court unless the prosecuting authority elects in accordance with this Division to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  . Procedure for dealing with offences summarily if no election made  
An indictable offence listed in Table 1 or 2 to Schedule 1 is, if no election is made in accordance with this Division, to be dealt with summarily in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Act, the relevant provisions of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) and any other relevant law as if it were a summary offence.  . Procedure for dealing with offences if election made  
An indictable offence listed in Table 1 or 2 to Schedule 1 is, if an election is made in accordance with this Division, to be dealt with on indictment in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Act, the relevant provisions of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) and any other relevant law.  
If an election is made in accordance with this Division and the person charged with the offence pleads guilty to the offence before a Local Court and the Court accepts the plea, the offence is to be dealt with in accordance with [section 51A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s51a.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) as if the person charged had pleaded guilty under that section to the offence.  . Time for making election  
An election to have an offence dealt with on indictment must be made within the time fixed by the Local Court.  
An election may, with the leave of the Local Court, be made after the time so fixed if the Court is satisfied that special circumstances exist.  
However, an election may not be made after the following events:  in the case of a plea of not guilty---the commencement of the taking of evidence for the prosecution in the summary trial,  in the case of a plea of guilty---the presentation of the facts relied on by the prosecution to prove the offence.  . Election may be withdrawn  
An election for an offence to be dealt with on indictment may be withdrawn by the party who made the election.  
However, an election may not be withdrawn after the following events:  in the case of a plea of not guilty---the commencement of the taking of evidence for the prosecution in the committal for trial proceedings,  in the case of a plea of guilty---the committal of the person charged for sentence. 
An offence is to be dealt with summarily in accordance with this Division if an election is withdrawn in accordance with this section.  . Information to be given to person charged (Table 1 offences]  
When a person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table l to Schedule 1 first appears before a Local Court in respect of the offence, the Court:  is to address the person about the person's right to make an election and the consequences of not making an election, and  is to give to the person a statement about the person's right to make an election and the consequences of not making an election that is in the form of words prescribed by the regulations. 
The prosecuting authority is to serve, or cause to be served, on the person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1:  a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence that complies with [section
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s66d.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), and  a copy of the person's criminal record (if any) known to the prosecuting authority,  within the time fixed by the Local Court. The time so fixed must be before the time fixed by the Court for the making of an election in respect of the offence. 
Despite subsection (2) (a), the prosecuting authority is not required to include a copy of a proposed exhibit identified in a brief of evidence if it is impossible or impractical to copy the exhibit. However, the prosecuting authority must in that case comply with [section 66C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s66c.html) (2) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).  
Without limiting the powers of a Local Court to adjourn proceedings, the Local Court is to grant such adjournments as appear to be just and reasonable if a brief of evidence or a criminal record, or both, are not served in accordance with this section, and the Court is to extend accordingly the time fixed for the making of an election in respect of the offence.  
In this section, a reference to a "brief of evidence" is a reference to a brief of evidence within the meaning of Subdivision 6A of Division 2 of [Part 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p4) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).   Section 26 provides that regulations may be made for or with respect to elections under Div 3 of [Pt .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s27.html) prescribes maximum penalties for offences in Table 1 to Sch 1 to the Act which are dealt with summarily under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3. By subs (2) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s27.html) the maximum term of imprisonment that a Local Court may impose for such an offence is, subject to the other provisions of the section, two years or the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law for the offence, whichever is the shorter term.  The offences listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 to the Act include in cl 8 of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2) of the Table the offence of breaking entering and stealing where the property stolen does not exceed $15,000 in value. The condition that the value of the property stolen should not exceed $15,000 was satisfied in the present case.  [JUSTICES ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/)  It is also convenient to refer to some of the provisions of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).  Scheme for ex parte proceedings where defendant fails to attend.  
A(1) [Sections
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html)--[75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html) constitute a scheme for the determination of matters in the absence of a defendant where the defendant fails to appear on a day, and at the time or place, specified by a summons or attendance notice. 
The provisions of this section and [sections
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html)--[75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html) are supplemental to, and do not derogate from, the provisions of any Act that relate to proceedings that may be taken in respect of offences punishable summarily before a Justice or Justices. 
B.(1) If a defendant who has been served with a summons or attendance notice does not appear on the day and at the time and place specified by the summons or attendance notice and has not notified a plea of not guilty under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html), the Magistrate may proceed to hear and determine the matter in accordance with this section and [sections
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75c.html)--[75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html).
. .
 
The Magistrate may not proceed to hear and determine a matter under this section unless satisfied that the defendant had reasonable notice of the date, time and place of the hearing. 
If a defendant is charged with 2 or more offences for which the hearing or hearings have been listed on the same date, time and place, the Magistrate may proceed to hear and determine some or all of the matters together. 
A reference in this section to a time and place includes, if the hearing of the matter has been adjourned, a reference to the time and place to which the hearing has been adjourned. 
D(1) A Magistrate who proceeds to hear and determine a matter without the defendant may determine the matter on the basis of the information without hearing the informant's witnesses or any other additional evidence of the informant, if of the opinion that the matters set out in the information are sufficient to establish the offence. 
Before determining the matter, the Magistrate must consider any written material:  given to the Magistrate by the informant, and  lodged by the defendant in accordance with [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html) 
The Magistrate may require the informant to provide additional evidence if of the opinion that the matters set out in the information are not sufficient to establish the offence. 
The additional evidence is not admissible unless:  it is in the form of written statements that comply with [section
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48c.html), and  a copy of any such statement has been given to the defendant a reasonable time before consideration of the additional evidence by the Magistrate. 
The Magistrate must reject a written statement, or any part of a written statement, tendered in proceedings if the statement or part is inadmissible because of this section. 
Despite subsection (4), the Magistrate may require evidence to be given orally if it is not practicable to comply with that subsection or if the
Magistrate thinks it necessary in the particular case. 
E(1) A Magistrate who proceeds to hear and determine a matter without the defendant may determine the matter by convicting the defendant, by making an order as to the defendant or by dismissing the information.  . .
 
The Magistrate may adjourn the proceedings to enable the defendant to appear or be brought before the Magistrate for sentencing.  
Review of decisions by local courts  
D(1) An application may be made by or on behalf of a person for the annulment of any of the following:  a conviction or an order (other than an interlocutory order) made in respect of the person by a Magistrate that was made in the absence of the person,  a sentence imposed on the person by a Magistrate in the absence of the person. 
An application for an annulment of a conviction or an order made by a
Magistrate or a sentence imposed by a Magistrate may also be made by or on behalf of any person who is an informant in the proceedings concerned.  
K. Grounds for granting applications 
A Local Court must grant an application if the applicant is the informant and if it is satisfied that there is just cause why the application should be granted. 
A Local Court must grant an application if the applicant is a person other than the informant and if it is satisfied that:  the defendant was not aware of the relevant proceedings until the proceedings were completed or the sentence was imposed or the other action was taken, or  the defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the relevant proceedings, or  having regard to the circumstances of the case, there is other just cause why the application should be granted.  
COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFF'S SUBMISSIONS  The steps in counsel for the plaintiff's argument can be summarised as follows.  1. The offence with which the plaintiff was charged was an indictable offence.  2. Subject to any statutory provision to the contrary, an indictable offence must be dealt with on indictment, that is a person charged with an indictable offence has a right to be tried by a jury.  3. In the present case the only statutory provisions which might provide to the contrary were in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html) to [75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), which the Local Court magistrate purported to apply on 4 June 2002, do not confer any jurisdiction to deal summarily with indictable offences; these sections of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) merely authorise the Local Court to adopt certain procedures for dealing with offences which are able to be dealt with summarily.  4. The right of a person charged with an indictable offence to have the offence dealt with on indictment, including the right to be tried by a jury, is an important right of a criminal accused and the provisions of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act should be interpreted, in accordance with a well recognised principle of statutory interpretation, as not abrogating or qualifying that right, unless and except to the extent that the provisions of the Act clearly so provide.  5. The offence with which the plaintiff was charged, breaking and entering and stealing property the value of which did not exceed $15,000, is an offence listed in Pt 2 of Table 1 to Sch 1 to the Criminal Procedure Act.  6. Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 is to be dealt with summarily by a Local
Court, unless the prosecuting authority or the person charged elects in accordance with Pt 2 Div 3 of the Act to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  7. Section 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 is, if no election is made in accordance with this Division", to be dealt with summarily as if it were a summary offence.  8. Part 2 Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act contains a number of provisions, the obvious purpose of which is to ensure that a person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 should be provided with the means of making a considered, informed decision on whether he or she should elect to have the offence dealt with on indictment. These provisions include ss 23 and 25. Under <case> a time is to fixed by the Local Court within which any election to have the offence dealt with on indictment must be made.
Under <case>, when a person charged with such an offence first appears before a
Local Court in respect of the offence, the court is to inform the person charged, orally and in a written statement, of the person's right to make an election and the consequences of not making an election. The form of the written statement is to be prescribed by regulations made under the Act and such a form has in fact been prescribed.  Under <case> the court is to fix a time within which the prosecuting authority is to serve, or cause to be served, on the person charged a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence and a copy of the person's criminal record (if any) known to the prosecuting authority and the prosecuting authority is required to serve a copy of the brief of evidence and a copy of the person's criminal record (if any) within the time fixed by the
Local Court. The time fixed for service of these documents must be before the time fixed by the court for the making of an election in respect of the offence. If the brief of evidence or the criminal record are not served within the time fixed, the time fixed for the making of an election must be extended.
The obvious purpose of these provisions is to ensure that a person charged will have the opportunity of considering these documents, before he or she has to decide whether to make an election.  9. Having regard to the terms and obvious purpose of these provisions of Pt Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act and to the principle of statutory interpretation already referred to, the words in <case> of the Criminal
Procedure Act "If no election is made in accordance with this Division" should be interpreted, not as meaning simply that the person charged has not in fact made an election to have the offence dealt with on indictment, but as meaning that the person charged has not made an election to have the offence dealt with on indictment, after the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 including ss and 25 have been carried into effect, so that the person charged has been provided with the means of making a considered, informed decision on whether he or she should make an election.  10. In the present case the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 were not carried into effect. For example, no time was fixed by the Local Court within which an election would have to be made and no copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence was served on the plaintiff.  11. Consequently, on the true interpretation of <case> of the Criminal
Procedure Act, it was not the case that no election had been made in accordance with Pt 2 Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act and the offence with which the plaintiff was charged could not be dealt with summarily as if it were a summary offence.  12. On 4 June 2002 when the magistrate purported to deal summarily with the offence charged against the plaintiff, the magistrate exceeded his jurisdiction.  It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff's failure to appear at the Local Court on 4 June 2002 did not mean that the offence with which the plaintiff was charged could never be dealt with summarily. What the magistrate could, and should, have done on 4 June 2002 was to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the plaintiff pursuant to either <case> or possibly [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s31.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). If such a warrant had been issued and the plaintiff had been apprehended pursuant to the warrant and had been brought before the Local Court, the provisions of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, including ss 23 and 25, could have been carried into effect by the Local Court and by the prosecuting authority. If, after the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 had been carried into effect by the Local
Court and by the prosecuting authority, the plaintiff did not make an election to have the offence dealt with on indictment, the Local Court could then have properly dealt with the offence summarily. For example, if, after the Local
Court and the prosecuting authority had carried into effect ss 23 and 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the plaintiff had not appeared in the Local
Court on the date fixed by the Local Court for the making of any election, the
Local Court could have proceeded to deal with the offence summarily, including proceeding under [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html) to [75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).  With regard to what counsel for the defendant in his submissions submitted were safeguards which would protect a person in the plaintiff's position against any possible injustice if the interpretation of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3 contended for by counsel for the defendant was adopted, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that a person charged with an indictable offence should not be placed in a position where, in order that he should not suffer injustice, he has to rely on decisions which might or might not be made by others; for example, by the prosecuting authority itself electing to have an offence dealt with on indictment, or a Local Court magistrate declining to proceed ex parte under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html) to [s
F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), or a
Local Court magistrate proceeding ex parte requiring additional evidence to be provided and not simply determining the matter on the basis of the averments in the information, or if an application is brought by a person who has been convicted ex parte for the annulment of the ex parte conviction, the Local
Court being satisfied that grounds have been made out for the granting of the application.  
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT'S SUBMISSIONS  Counsel for the defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions, did not dispute most of the steps in counsel for the plaintiff's argument. The only steps in counsel for the plaintiff's argument which were disputed by counsel for the defendant were step 8 (to some extent) and steps 9, 11 and 12.  Counsel for the defendant made some general submissions about [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  Counsel for the defendant submitted that it was clear that an object of Pt Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act was to "expedite the criminal process", by permitting some indictable offences, which could otherwise be dealt with only on indictment, to be dealt with summarily. Counsel for the defendant pointed out that Pt 2 Div 3 could confer benefits on a person charged with an indictable offence, in the form of a more expeditious disposition of the criminal proceedings against him and a lower maximum penalty.  Whether the Local Court magistrate acted within or beyond the jurisdiction of the Local Court on 4 June 2002 in dealing summarily with the offence with which the plaintiff was charged depended on the proper interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3. Counsel for the defendant accepted that the right of a person charged with an indictable offence to a trial by jury is a fundamental right "which cannot be removed or cut down otherwise than by express language" and that "the language of the statute should be construed strictly in favour of the person charged". However, it was submitted that, even giving full weight to this principle of statutory interpretation, the right to be tried on indictment by a jury had, in the circumstances of the present case, been removed by clear words contained in the provisions of Pt 2
Div 3 of the Act.  It was submitted by counsel for the defendant that Pt 2 Div 3 enacts a scheme which places obligations on all of, the person charged, the prosecuting authority and the Local Court. The obligations of the person charged are (i) to appear before the Local Court (s 25(1)) and (ii) to make any election within the time fixed by the Local Court for the making of an election.  It was submitted by counsel for the defendant that by the express words of s 25(1) the obligations of the court under <case> arise, only "when a person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 first appears before a Local Court in respect of the offence". If a person charged with such an offence appears before the Local Court, the Local Court becomes subject to the obligations to address the person charged about his right to make an election and the consequences of not making an election (s 25(1)(a)) and to give the person a statement in the form prescribed by the regulations about his right to make an election and the consequences of not making an election (s 25(1)(b)); to fix a time for the prosecuting authority to serve or cause to be served a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence and a copy of the person's criminal record (if any) known to the prosecuting authority (s (2)); and to fix a time within which any election must be made (s 23(1), s (2) and (3)). However, it was submitted, these obligations arise, only if the person charged appears before the Local Court. If the person charged does not appear before the Local Court, the Local Court does not become subject to any of these obligations.  Submissions were made by counsel for the defendant about the proper interpretation of ss 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act. It was submitted that <case> by its clear words provides that, unless an election is made, an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 is to be dealt with summarily and that the words in <case> "if no election is made in accordance with this Division" apply both to situations where the defendant has appeared and, after the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 such as ss 23 and 25 have been carried into effect, has not made an election, and to situations where the defendant has not appeared and hence there has been no need for the provisions of Pt 2
Div 3 and particularly ss 23 and 25 to be carried into effect and the defendant has not made an election.  On the interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 contended for by counsel for the defendant, no election had been made by the plaintiff to have the offence dealt with on indictment, within the proper interpretation of those words in <case>, and the magistrate had jurisdiction to deal with the offence summarily.  It was submitted that no injustice would arise from the interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 contended for by counsel for the defendant. A person charged with an indictable offence who has been summonsed to appear before a Local Court should appear before the Local Court and, if he fails to perform his obligation to appear, it is not unjust that he should be deprived of the benefit of statutory provisions, which would have applied if he had appeared.  It was submitted that there were safeguards against any possible injustice to a person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 who does not appear in the Local Court and who, on the interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 contended for by counsel for the defendant, would be deprived of the benefit of those provisions.  If an offence falling within Table 1 to Sch 1 is a really serious offence, it is likely, even if there is no election by the person charged, that the prosecuting authority will itself elect to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  If a person charged does not appear, a Local Court magistrate has a discretion whether to proceed ex parte pursuant to [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html) to [75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). If the offence charged is a really serious offence, it is unlikely that a magistrate will exercise his discretion in favour of proceeding in the absence of the defendant. A magistrate may proceed to hear and determine a matter ex parte pursuant to [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html) to [75F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75f.html), only if the magistrate is satisfied that the person charged had reasonable notice of the date, time and place of the hearing. Although [s
D(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75d.html) provides that a magistrate who proceeds to hear and determine a matter ex parte may determine the matter on the basis of the information, without hearing the informant's witnesses or any other additional evidence of the informant, under [s
D(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75d.html) the magistrate may require the informant to provide additional evidence, if of the opinion that the matters set out in the information are not sufficient to establish the offence, and in a serious matter a magistrate is likely to require the informant to provide additional evidence.  If a person charged with an offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 does not appear before the Local Court and is convicted in his absence, he can apply under [s
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100d.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), as the present plaintiff did, to have the conviction annulled and, if there is a valid excuse for his not having appeared, his application for the annulment of his conviction should succeed. Under [s
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100k.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) a Local
Court must grant an application for the annulment of a conviction made in the absence of the defendant, if inter alia the defendant was hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the relevant proceedings or, having regard to the circumstances of the case, there is other just cause why the application should be granted. If a conviction made in the absence of the person charged is annulled pursuant to [s
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100d.html), the protective provisions of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p2)
Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act can then be applied in favour of that person.  For the sake of completeness, counsel for the defendant referred to a number of decided cases, including R versus Fisher <case>, Cowan versus The Police <case>; [(1987) 163 CLR 34] but counsel did not suggest that any of these cases were of any real assistance in deciding the present appeal.  
DECISION  Whether the Local Court had jurisdiction to deal summarily with the indictable offence with which the plaintiff had been charged depends on the proper interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 of the Criminal
Procedure Act.  As counsel for the plaintiff submitted and as counsel for the defendant accepted, statutory provisions should not be interpreted as abrogating or qualifying the right of a person charged with an indictable offence to have that offence dealt with on indictment, including the right to trial by jury, unless the statutory provisions clearly so provide. If statutory provisions are open to more than one interpretation, the Court should tend to prefer the interpretation which would least qualify the right of a person charged with an indictable offence to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  The provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act clearly have as a purpose the purpose identified by counsel for the defendant of expediting the disposition of some charges of indictable offences by permitting some charges of indictable offences to be dealt with summarily. Furthermore, as counsel for the defendant submitted, there can be advantages for a person charged with an indictable offence in having the offence dealt with summarily by virtue of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3.  However, in my opinion, a number of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3, and particularly ss 23 and 25, also have the purpose of ensuring that a person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Sch 1 should not be deprived of the right to have the offence dealt with on indictment, unless he has been provided with the means to make a considered, informed decision on whether he should elect to have the offence dealt with on indictment and has then not made an election to have the offence dealt with on indictment.  That this is a purpose of these provisions is confirmed by passages in the speech of the Attorney-General on the second reading of the Bill which inserted Pt 2 Div 3 in the Criminal Procedure Act. For example, in a passage in the speech referring to the clause in the Bill which became <case> of the
Act, the Attorney-General said:-  "This provision ensures that a person appearing before a Local Court on a charge falling within Table 1 is armed with all the material necessary to enable that person, or his or her legal advisers, to make an informed decision either to elect to have the matter dealt with on indictment or to decline to make an election".  The key words in <case> "if no election is made in accordance with this
Division" are open to the interpretation contended for by counsel for the defendant. However, I consider that these words are also open to the interpretation contended for by counsel for the plaintiff and, in my opinion,
I should prefer the interpretation contended for by counsel for the plaintiff, that the words mean, if no election is made by the defendant after the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 including ss 23 and 25 have been carried into effect.
This interpretation is in accordance with a purpose of Pt 2 Div 3 to which I have referred and is consistent with the principle of statutory interpretation to which I have referred.  Clear words would be required in Pt 2 Div 3 to produce the consequence that a person charged loses the benefit of the protective provisions in Pt 2 Div 3, if he does not appear in the Local Court on a day on which he should have appeared. Counsel for the defendant sought to rely on the opening words of s (1) as amounting to clear words to that effect. However, the opening words of <case> are open to the interpretation, particularly as the first word is "when" and not "if", that they are directed only to the time at which the
Local Court is to discharge its obligations, and not to the existence of those obligations. Indeed, in my opinion, the opening words of <case> contemplate a the person charged with an offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 will make a first appearance before the Local Court in respect of the offence.  I accept the submission by counsel for the plaintiff that a person charged with an indictable offence should not, in the absence of clear statutory provision, be placed in a position where, in order that he should not suffer injustice, he has to rely on decisions which might or might not be made by others, such as the prosecuting authority or a Local Court magistrate.  As submitted by counsel for the plaintiff, on the interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 contended for by counsel for the plaintiff and accepted by me, if a person charged with an indictable offence listed in Table to Sch 1 does not appear before the Local Court on a day on which he should have appeared, a warrant can be issued for his arrest and, if the person charged is arrested and brought before the Local Court, the provisions of Pt 2
Div 3 can then be carried into effect and if, after those provisions have been carried into effect, the person charged does not make an election, the Local
Court can proceed to deal with the offence summarily.  It follows from my interpretation of the provisions of Pt 2 Div 3 of the
Criminal Procedure Act that the Local Court magistrate did not have jurisdiction to deal with the offence summarily and that the conviction of the plaintiff was made without jurisdiction. Consequently, the conviction of the plaintiff should be quashed and the order refusing the plaintiff's subsequent application to have the conviction annulled should also be quashed.  
CONCLUSION  I make orders in accordance with pars 1-5 inclusive of the summons instituting the appeal.
