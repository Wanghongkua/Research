EQUITY DIVISION  
HAMILTON J  
WEDNESDAY, 21 JANUARY 2004  /04 AUSTIN AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED (IN ADMINISTRATION) - APPLICATION OF K W HUTCHISON & ANOR  
JUDGMENT   HIS HONOUR: This is an application by administrators of a company for extension under [s
A(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) of the convening period for a meeting of creditors. The reasons given for the application are that the administrators need additional time in which to investigate whether a viable proposal can be identified to be put to the creditors' meeting or whether it would be better for the company to pass into liquidation. In the course of this investigation, the administrators are investigating whether it is viable to sell the company's business as a going concern.  In the circumstances that appear from the affidavit of Mr Hutchinson read before me this appears to be a reasonable and proper course. It has been approved by the committee of creditors and the course is not opposed by the
Westpac Bank which is the major secured creditor. In those circumstances I propose to grant an extension to 31 March 2004 as asked.  The orders I make are as follows: 
I grant leave to the plaintiffs to file the originating process initialled by me returnable on 21 January 2004 at 11.00 am before me. 
I dispense with service of the originating process. 
I make the orders set out in form of order initialled by me and placed with the papers. 
I direct that order 3 be entered forthwith.
