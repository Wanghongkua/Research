EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff company guaranteed to the defendant bank ("the bank") the obligations of Noble Growth Investment Limited ("Noble Growth") under a loan agreement pursuant to which the bank lent Noble Growth $32,150,000.  
As security for its obligations under the guarantee, the plaintiff mortgaged to the bank a resort known as the Fairmont Resort at Leura, New South Wales ("the resort").  
Noble Growth defaulted on the loan and on 26 February 2010 the bank appointed receivers to the plaintiff who took control of the resort.  
On 28 April 2010, a solicitor then acting for the plaintiff and taking instructions from Mr Kwok, the plaintiff's sole director, wrote to the receivers' solicitors expressing concerns with respect to the receivers' management of the resort.  
On 23 December 2010, the receivers sold the resort. The proceeds were applied in reduction of the debt owed by Noble Growth (and guaranteed by the plaintiff) leaving a shortfall of $13,583,412.13, for which amount the bank obtained judgment against the plaintiff on 16 March 2011.  
On 5 April 2011, the bank served a statutory demand on the plaintiff for the judgment amount.  
On 21 April 2011, the plaintiff sued out an Originating Process in the Corporations List seeking an order under [s 459G(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)") that the statutory demand be set aside.  
On the same day, the plaintiff sued out a Summons in the Commercial List seeking an order under [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5), r 5.3 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) that the receivers give it preliminary discovery of documents which it says, if provided, might reveal that the plaintiff has a claim for damages against the receivers in negligence for loss suffered as a consequence of the way in which the resort was managed and of its sale at the price obtained. Those proceedings have been set down for hearing tomorrow.  
The plaintiff puts that the present proceedings should be adjourned to await the outcome of the preliminary discovery application. In the alternative, it puts that the statutory demand should be set aside under [s 459J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) which provides that:  
On an application under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html), the Court may by order set aside the demand if it is satisfied that: ...
 there is some other reason why the demand should be set aside.
The plaintiff accepts that the bank's claim against it is unassailable. It does not put that there is an offsetting claim. It also accepts that the material before the Court does not reveal, even on a prima facie basis, that it has any claim against the receivers. It puts the position no higher than that it has a preliminary discovery application on foot which is not on its face an abuse of process and that if the application succeeds, it may obtain documents which might reveal the basis for a claim against the receivers. It puts that if such a claim is brought and ultimately succeeds, any amount recovered may be applied to reduce its debt to the bank.  
These considerations provide no basis, either for adjourning these proceedings, or for the exercise of the Court's power and discretion to set aside the statutory demand pursuant to [s 459J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).  
The bank's debt is undisputed and there is no offsetting claim. The preliminary discovery application (if it succeeds) will do no more than to reveal documents which may assist the plaintiff in determining whether to sue the third party receivers. Even if thereafter it were to sue and succeed, this would not give rise to any defence which would avail it against the bank. The bank is entitled to avail itself of the statutory demand procedure contained in Div 2 of [Pt 5.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.4) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).  
The result is that the proceedings are dismissed with costs.  * * *
