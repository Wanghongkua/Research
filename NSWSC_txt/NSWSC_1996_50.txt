ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITY v. Dennis Richard COOKE /95 March 1996 
COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
HUNT CJ AT CL, SMART J, BADGERY-PARKER J 
CATCHWORDS: MEANING OF 'DISINTEGRATED' - COSTS; POWERS 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED:Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED:Case remitted with answers 
HEADNOTE 
Cooke operated premises where scrap metal was cut by the use of mechanical jaws into smaller pieces for sale and ease of transport to other metal recoverers.

HELD: On the facts the scrap metals were not 'disintegrated' within the meaning of the paragraph in cl.1 of the Schedule to the Clean Air Act 1961 providing that scrap metal recovery works were works in which scrap metals are disintegrated by mechanical means for recovery of metal.

The Court of Criminal Appeal has no power to make an order for costs on a case stated by the Land and Environment Court.

Recommended that the legislature consider whether the Court of Criminal Appeal should be given such power.

ORDERS 
Case stated remitted with the answers set out in the reasons for judgment.
 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ at CL: I agree with the answers proposed by Smart J to both questions posed for this Court's determination, for the reasons which he has given. I also agree with Smart J, again for the reasons which he has given, that this Court has no power to order costs in relation to its determination of any questions of law submitted by the Land and Environment Court pursuant to [s 5A(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5a.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). 
The result would, however, have been different if the questions of law had arisen on an appeal to the Land and Environment Court and had been submitted for this Court's determination pursuant to [s
BA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5ba.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). [Section
BA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5ba.html) is indistinguishable from [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html), pursuant to which questions of law arising on an appeal to the District Court may be submitted for this Court's determination. Both sections give this Court power to make any order as it thinks fit, which includes an order for costs:
Clyne versus Wrigley [[1980] 1 NSWLR 599] at -602; Proust versus Blake [(1989) 17 NSWLR 267] at -272. It is a power which is not infrequently exercised in cases of no merit; see, for example: Regina versus Alexander William Madden (CCA, 15
December, unreported) at 11.

The proceedings before the Land and Environment Court with which this case is concerned were not such proceedings. They were original proceedings before that Court in its summary jurisdiction, and [s
A(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5a.html) provides the only procedure whereby the questions of law could be submitted for this Court's determination during the course of those proceedings.
[Section
A(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5a.html) also provides that procedure in relation to proceedings before the Supreme
Court and the Court of Coal Mines Regulation in their respective summary jurisdictions. It should be regarded as a very beneficial procedure where the questions arise in such proceedings, in that - if all that is to be determined is a question of law - it may avoid a possibly wrong conviction from which an appeal would in any event lie to this Court, and it may also avoid an unmeritorious acquittal from which no appeal would lie. But the means by which that beneficial procedure has been provided in <case> appears to be based upon a misunderstanding by the draftsperson of what is involved in that procedure, and which may easily lead to complexity, even confusion, with two courts dealing with the same issue at the same time.

Section 5A was originally inserted in the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) to permit questions of law arising out of or in reference to a trial on indictment to be submitted for the determination of this Court following a conviction, and the submission is to be dealt with as if it is an appeal pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) by the convicted person. The convicted person, of course, already had the right to have questions of law determined in his appeal pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html), so that the provision was obviously inserted more for the benefit of the Crown than of the convicted person. In 1951, subs (2) was inserted (in a slightly different form to that in which it now appears) by which the Crown is entitled to require the trial judge to submit questions of law for this Court's determination following an acquittal. The point to be made in relation to both procedures is that each follows the conclusion of the trial, and they are not available during the course of the trial. That perhaps explains the reference in subs (1) to the submission of the questions of law being dealt with as if it were an appeal pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) (the general right of appeal in criminal cases), although it did not appear to be thought necessary to have such a provision in relation to subs (2). In my respectful opinion, the form of subs (2) is the preferable one, and it should be made applicable also to subs (1).

Subsection (1A) pursuant to which the present matter came before this Court was inserted at the time when the [Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/scja1967425/) was amended, and it reflected the different nature of the appeals which were thereafter permitted from proceedings heard pursuant to that Act. It was later expanded to cover matters heard in the summary jurisdiction of the Land and
Environment Court and the Court of Coal Mines Regulation. It was, however, enacted that the submission of the questions of law by all three courts were to be dealt with as if it were an appeal pursuant to <case>, which deals with appeals in matters heard in the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court where there has been a conviction or where an order has been made that a party pay costs. It is not without significance that a judge hearing a matter in the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and in the other relevant trial courts has power to order costs to be paid by the prosecutor or the defendant.

As <case> provides that an appeal is by way of rehearing - with the right (if leave is given) to adduce further evidence; originally an unlimited right - such a procedure is wholly inappropriate for the determination of questions of law arising in the proceedings which are, by definition, still continuing in the trial court. It is thus possible for both this Court and the trial court to be hearing evidence at the same time - at the very least, hearing and rehearing evidence at the same time. The obvious purpose of <case>(1A) is to provide in proceedings in the various summary jurisdictions the same assistance which ss 5B and 5BA provide to judges who are hearing appeals from lower courts. There should be no rehearing allowed and no fresh evidence allowed in determining such questions of law. Those provisions are so wholly inappropriate that the device of having the questions of law dealt with as if an appeal pursuant to <case> must have been adopted in ignorance of what was involved.

In my respectful opinion, consideration should be given by the Legislature to amending <case>(1A) so that the questions of law in cases such as the present are determined in a way analogous to the Stated Case procedures in ss 5B and
BA. As the trial court has power to order costs in such proceedings, so should this Court have that power when determining those questions of law.

SMART J: The Land and Environment Court (Bignold J) has stated a case raising the true meaning of the word "disintegrated" where it appears in the Schedule to the Clear Air Act 1961. Does it include cutting fairly large pieces of metal into smaller pieces of metal by the use of mechanical jaws? Secondly, does it take place only when metal is reduced to particles or to dust or granules such as occurs with pulverisation of an object. Thirdly, does it occur at some intermediate stage? 
The Authority charged Mr Cooke that between 4 May 1992 and 14 April 1993 he committed an offence against the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act in that being the occupier of scheduled premises at 162-164 Inch Street,
Lithgow he did not hold a licence contrary to ss.10 and 32(1)(a) of the Clean
Air Act.

Mr Cooke did not hold a licence. He received or had scrap metal on the premises. By the use of mechanical jaws scrap metal items were placed in the jaws and cut into smaller parts. This shearing action operates something like a pair of scissors. Sometimes the result was that the object was flattened.
The purpose of the operation was the sale and ease of transport of the scrap metal to other metal recoverers.

The judge held that the sole issue was whether there were scrap metals handled at Mr Cooke's premises which were disintegrated by mechanical means for the recovery of metal. He resolved that issue in the negative.

Section 10 relevantly provides that any person who is the occupier of any scheduled premises and who is not the holder of a licence issued in respect of such premises shall be guilty of an offence.
 "Scheduled premises", by s.5(1) "means any premises: used for any of the facilities or works for the time being prescribed by clause 1 of the schedule; ..." 
Under cl.1 a wide variety of facilities and works are prescribed. Many industries and operations are covered. The relevant paragraph reads: "Scrap metal recovery works, being works, ... in which scrap metals are treated in any type of fuel burning equipment or open fire or electrically heated furnaces, or are disintegrated by mechanical means for recovery of metal..." 
Both parties had recourse to the dictionaries. The definition contained in the
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edition gives these meanings: "1. to separate into its component parts or particles; to reduce to fragments, break up, destroy the cohesion or integrity of. Also fig, b. to separate as particles from the whole mass." 
The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Edition 1989 is fuller: "1. a. to separate into its component parts or particles, to reduce to fragments, break up, destroy the cohesion or integrity of (as by mechanical or atmospheric action). Also fig. (some interesting physical and figurative illustrations follow); b. to separate or break off as particles or fragments from the whole mass or body; c. to cause (a substance or an atom or nucleus) to undergo disintegration." 
The intransitive meanings are also given. If a car body were by use of mechanical jaws cut up into many small pieces it would be appropriate to describe that as disintegration. If it were cut into 3 or 4 pieces there would be room for debate whether that was disintegration. The car body has been broken up and its integrity as a car body destroyed. Is there an element of degree involved? 
The Macquarie Dictionary gives these meanings: "1. to reduce to particles, fragments, or parts, break up or destroy the cohesion of; to separate into its component parts, break up.
 ..." 
This review of the dictionary meanings illustrates that the word "disintegrated" has a number of meanings. This is emphasised by its various figurative uses. Assistance has to be sought from the context.

The judge accepted the evidence of a forensic consulting engineer that the operation of the jaws did not disintegrate the metal object. The jaws functioned in a shearing or cutting action to produce one or more pieces from the parent piece thereby reducing the size of both. The judge further accepted his evidence that "disintegrated" had an established meaning in the fields of engineering and metallurgy of reducing the parent object to dust or granules as occurs with the pulverisation of the object.

The judge had regard to the context in which the word "disintegrated" was used, the rest of the prescribed works contained in clause 1 of the Schedule and the objects of the Act. He noted that the meaning ascribed in the fields of engineering and metallurgy was adequately reflected in some of the dictionary definitions. The judge thought that this meaning had "obvious relevance to the statutory regime of the Act to prevent or minimise air pollution" whereas other of the more general dictionary meanings did not have obvious relevance to the objects of the Act. Its purpose, according to its long title, is to prevent and minimise air pollution. By s.5(1) "air pollution" means the emission into the air of any air impurity. "Air impurity" includes smoke, dust (including fly ash), cinders, solid particles of any kind, gases, fumes, mists, odours and radioactive substances.

The Act achieves its purpose by, inter alia, requiring scheduled premises to be licensed, the licence conditions to be met and the occupier of any scheduled premises to maintain any control equipment in an efficient condition and to operate it in an efficient manner. It imposes penalties for non- compliance if air pollution is increased by reason of failure. Section 15(1) provides for penalties for emissions of air impurities above the prescribed rate. Section 15A imposes penalties for the emission of odours.

An examination of the prescribed facilities or works in the Schedule reveals that all the works and facilities have the potential to produce air impurities and emit them. Of course, they may not do so. Depending upon the nature of the works and facilities and probably the extent of potential air pollution either the works as a whole or activity above a certain level results in the premises being scheduled and suitable control measures being adopted. The effect is that emissions are either controlled by the licence conditions or they come under such control upon exceeding certain limits. For example, scheduled premises include bulk cargo handling facilities at which certain crop products and other specified items are loaded or unloaded or capable of being loaded or unloaded in bulk at a rate of more than 100 tonnes per day. There are some works specified which do not have to reach a quantitative limit before the premises become scheduled premises, e.g., cement works.

Section 5(3)(a) provides that the Schedule may be amended by proclamation. The
Schedule has been amended by proclamation many times since the Act was passed as various facilities and works have been inserted and the initial facilities and works have been expanded. There can also be variations in the level of activity required before premises become scheduled. In providing that the
Schedule could be amended by proclamation Parliament recognised that ease of amendment was necessary to allow for developments and adjustments to deal with new problems and processes, further knowledge and to avoid unfair results.

The works and facilities which will result in premises being classed as scheduled are those having the potential to produce air impurities in harmful quantities. With scrap metal recovery works what are first prescribed are works in which scrap metals are treated in any type of fuel burning equipment or open fire or electrically heated furnaces. No question of degree or quantification arises. However, when the clause refers to mechanical means what is required is disintegration.
 "Disintegrated" in this context does not involve mere slicing of metal into smaller pieces but a reduction to such an extent that there is a potential for air pollution. That potential may exist if the scrap metal is cut into very small pieces by mechanical means or is otherwise reduced by mechanical means so that there is a potential for air pollution. A question of degree and of fact is involved.

In his reasons the judge found that there was no evidence of the mechanical jaws being operated so as to produce particles or any emission of air impurities or any risk thereof.

I share the conclusion reached by the judge on the facts found by him that the scrap metals were not "disintegrated" with clause 1 of the Schedule.

However, I prefer a different approach. I would not rely on the expert evidence and would prefer to construe the word "disintegrated" without recourse to that evidence.

In the present case it is unnecessary to go as far as the judge appears to have done and hold that "disintegrated" means reducing to dust or granules or particles. As earlier indicated the scrap metals may be regarded as "disintegrated" at the earlier stage where the scrap metal is cut into small pieces or fragments. It is prudent to wait until that point arises directly for decision. There may be amendments by proclamation which clarify the point.

There is also the principle of last resort. An offence has been created for which a penalty may be imposed. If the application of other principles do not yield a result by pointing to a preferred meaning the ambiguity should be resolved in favour of Mr Cooke.

In dealing with the case stated it is sufficient to say that the judge reached the correct conclusion.

I answer the questions asked thus: 
Q1: Did I err in law in the construction I adopted of the word "disintegrated" where appearing in clause 1 of the Schedule to the Clean Air Act, 1961 in relation to the words "scrap metal recovery works"? 
A: Unnecessary to answer.

Q2: Do the material facts as found by me fall within the provisions of clause of the Schedule to the Clean Air Act, 1961 and in particular the word "disintegrated" where appearing in relation to the words "scrap metal recovery works"? 
A: No.

The Authority submitted that this court has no power to make an order for costs on a case stated from the Land and Environment Court.
 [Section
A(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5a.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) provides that at any time before the completion of proceedings before the Land and
Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction the judge hearing the proceedings may, or if requested by the Crown, shall submit any question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings to the Court of Criminal
Appeal for determination and the submission shall be dealt with as if it were an appeal under [s.5AA(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5aa.html) as applied by [s.5AB.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5ab.html) [Section

The case stated should be remitted with the answers given.

BADGERY-PARKER, J: I agree with the answers proposed by Smart, J. to both questions, and with his opinion that this court has no power to award costs in this matter.

I agree with the additional remarks of Hunt, CJ. at CL. on the question of costs and the desirability of an amendment to [s.5A(1)(A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5a.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
