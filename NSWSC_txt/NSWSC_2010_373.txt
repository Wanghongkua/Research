WEDNESDAY 28 APRIL 2010  /291026 N A INVESTMENTS HOLDINGS PTY LTD versus PERPETUAL NOMINEES LTD  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff makes an application under [s
F(2)(a)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459f.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) for an order extending the time for compliance with a statutory demand.
 An application under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) for an order setting aside the statutory demand was heard by Macready AsJ on March 2010. His Honour gave judgment on 8 April 2010 and dismissed the application.
 The [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) application was brought exclusively on the ground in [s
J(1)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html)
Several matters were canvassed including, in particular, the correct construction of the contractual provision under which the relevant debt was said to arise, at being clause 11.18 of the restated facility agreement.
 Macready AsJ held, in effect, that that provision, despite limitations expressed within it, created a debt and that no "other reason" within [s
J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) arose from the provision (including the aspect of it limiting or restricting the ability to bring "proceedings" or applying for a winding up order in order to recover any "shortfall"). The meaning of "shortfall" is, I accept, somewhat obscure in the context.
 The plaintiff intends to seek leave to appeal (see [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), [s (2)(p)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s101.html)
Counsel for the plaintiff has today outlined bases on an appeal would be initiated. They go very largely to the construction of clause 11.18.
 On an application of this kind, the matters to be taken into account are, first, the prospects of success in the appeal and whether an arguable case has been shown; second, whether the appeal will be rendered nugatory unless the extension is granted; and third, the prejudice the respective parties will suffer in the alternative eventualities. This was the approach taken in
Australian Beverage Distributors Pty Ltd versus Cranswick Premium Wines Pty Ltd <case>; (2004) 50 ACSR 544 and Jem Developments Pty Ltd versus Hansen
Yuncken Pty Ltd <case>; [(2006) 60 ACSR 393.] As to the first matter, the points already noted are sufficient to indicate that an arguable case exists or should be taken to exist for present purposes.
 As to the second matter, the consequences made clear by the High Court in
Aussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd versus Esanda Finance Corp Ltd <case>; [(2008) 232 CLR 314] establish that the appeal will be rendered nugatory unless the time for compliance with the statutory demand is extended.
 This leaves the third matter, which is prejudice. The defendant, naturally enough, is concerned to be free to take all appropriate steps to protect its position with respect to the debt which, from the defendant's perspective, is owed to it by the plaintiff as guarantor not as a principal debtor. There is particular concern with the potential for the relation-back day for the purpose of any winding up that eventuates not be unduly extended and therefore not to allow the appeal process to become extended. To that end, the position taken by the defendant is that any extension of time for compliance should only be given in response to an undertaking given by the plaintiff to prosecute the appeal promptly. Such an undertaking has been proffered by the plaintiff through its counsel.
 An extension should be granted but there is a question as to how long the extension should be. It is inappropriate that it should be open ended so as to match whatever time is taken for the appeal and antecedent application for leave to appeal to be disposed of. The better course - and that taken in
Australian Beverage Distributors Pty Ltd versus Cranswick Premium Wines Pty Ltd - is for an extension to be granted sufficient to enable the appeal process to be commenced so that the matter may come under the control of the
Court of Appeal which may address then the need for any further extension of the time for compliance.
 Upon the plaintiff by its counsel giving to the court the undertaking in written form which I now initial and date, I order pursuant to [s
F(2)(a)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459f.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) that the time for compliance with the statutory demand dealt with by Macready AsJ in these proceedings be extended to and including Friday 18 June 2010.
 I direct that the costs of the present application follow the costs of the appeal and if there is no determination of an appeal that the question of costs be reserved for further consideration.
