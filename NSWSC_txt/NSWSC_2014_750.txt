JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: On 24 March 2014 I gave judgment in this matter reserving for argument questions of costs and any further issues that required determination. I have received written submissions on costs on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank and SGOL. I have also heard brief oral submissions. Clause 12.1(b) of the General Terms for Business Lending dated December 2007 provides as follows: "You must pay or reimburse...all our costs in otherwise acting in connection with the Facility Documents such as exercising, enforcing or preserving rights (or considering doing so), or doing anything in connection with any inquiry by a government agency involving you, any of your Related Entities or any
Guarantor".
Costs is defined in cl 22 of the General Terms to mean: "Costs, charges and expenses and includes: (legal costs) (including internal legal costs) on whichever is the higher of a full indemnity basis or solicitor and own client bases".
The Commonwealth Bank and SGOL seek costs of the consolidated proceedings on the indemnity basis. In my view they are entitled to such costs in respect of the proceedings brought by the Commonwealth Bank and SGOL as falling within the meaning of "acting in connection with the Facility Documents" as described in cl 12.1 of the General Terms, but they are not entitled to costs on an indemnity basis with respect to the proceedings brought by Mr Neale and now dismissed. They are only entitled to the costs of those proceedings on the ordinary basis. 
I make the orders in the Short Minutes of Order which I have initialled, dated today's date and placed with the papers.
