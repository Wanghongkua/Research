 /90 McCAMLEY versus HARRIS 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: These are proceedings under [s.126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) for damages for deprivation of land. Those damages are sought by the first cross claimants, the executors of the estate of the late John Ham. The original plaintiffs were purchasers from the fraudster, Raymond Ham, but proceedings between the original plaintiffs and John Ham have now been settled. 
By the first cross claim filed 24 October, 1991, the estate of John Ham sues the Registrar General, and by the third cross claim, the estate of John Ham sues Raymond Ham. By the fifth cross claim, the Registrar General sues Raymond
Ham. That cross claim, however, has never been served.

The underlying facts are clearly established. The relevant property, being land under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), was held as tenants in common as to one third by Raymond Ham and two thirds by John
Ham. Raymond Ham forged John Ham's signature on a withdrawal of caveat and
John Ham lost his land by virtue of the operation of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). Raymond
Ham, in due course, was convicted of forgery.

The land in question was valued by Mr May, a registered valuer, as having a value of $260,000 as at 7 April 1989, the same value in 1990 and a value of $300,000 as at 28 May 1996. I accept his valuation. Of course, John Ham only had a two third interest. So one has to discount that valuation by one third to get the loss of John Ham.

Raymond Ham appears to have had financial problems at the time when the forgery took place and the probability is that those financial problems were the cause of him taking this extreme step. Raymond Ham was conducting a restaurant in Cairns, North Queensland at the relevant time, which in his statement of affairs in bankruptcy he said failed because of the pilots' strike of that time. Whether that be so or not, Mr Raymond Ham was declared bankrupt on 12 August 1993, showing assets of $420 and one unsecured creditor, namely, a bank, in the sum of $41,676, the bank debt having been incurred on May 1992.

We are not told why that debt was incurred, whether it was a consolidation loan or a fresh loan. It is merely described as a joint debt being a business debt. The statement of affairs also indicated that during the five years previous, Mr Raymond Ham had lived, starting from the most recent address, at /25 Market Street, Sydney; 74/71 Victoria Street, Potts Point; 4/1-3 Mona
Lane, Darling Point - all of those addresses being with his daughter, Vicky, and before that in Abbot Street, Cairns, being rented property. The statement of affairs also says that the bankrupt told the Official Trustee's office that he was presently sick and resided in Sydney and the restaurant business he was involved in in Cairns had not traded since 1990.

As at the date of filing the statement of affairs, the bankrupt showed he was unemployed and living on a disability support pension with rental assistance and pharmaceutical allowance, a total of $7,800 per year. He was not paying any board to his daughter, who was paying the rent for the premises in which he was living. He said that his business closed down in February 1990 because he was unable to pay the rent.

It would seem that the business may have been carried on under the name of a company, Caysand No. 117 Pty Ltd or Caysand No. 118 Pty Ltd, in conjunction with another person. Both those companies have been struck off the register and do not appear to have any assets.

Mr Raymond Ham, although called and served, did not appear. There is no doubt at all that the executors of John Ham are entitled to a verdict against him for the cause of action set out under [s.126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). I think the amount is $200,000, being the value of the property as at today's date with interest as from now, but there can be some debate about that when the short minutes are brought in.

As the probabilities are that no actual monies will be recovered from Raymond
Ham, the question that has taken most of the time is whether the estate of
John Ham can recover against the Registrar General.
 [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) is as follows: "In any of the following cases, that is to say: where such person ceases to be liable for the payment of damages as aforesaid; or when the person liable for damages under this section is dead, bankrupt, or insolvent, or cannot be found within the jurisdiction, such damages with costs of action may be recovered out of the Torrens Assurance Fund by action against the 
Registrar-General as nominal defendant." 
The "such person" referred to is, as appears from subsections (2)(b) and (3) of [s.126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html),
Raymond Ham.

The argument before me has mainly centred over what the words "person ... is dead, bankrupt or insolvent, or cannot be found within the jurisdiction" mean when used in subsection (5)(b). Even though Mr Heydon (Commissioner for the
Consolidation of Statute Law) observed in his memorandum, when the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) was consolidated in 1900 (See Cockshott & Lamb, Statutes of New South
Wales 1900 pp 100 and following), that [s.126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) is "this most confused section", no-one has heeded that observation. Indeed, the learned Commissioner said that the original Real Property Acts were very badly drawn, but he thought it would be too hazardous to use a free hand in reforming their arrangement and language because of the large interests that are governed by them and, accordingly, whilst he would have liked to have been more free with his redrafting, he resisted.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) is the re-enactment of s.117 of the Real Property Act 1862. That section said, so far as is relevant: "Any person deprived of land ... in consequence of fraud ... may bring and prosecute an action at law for the recovery of damages against such person as the Governor ... may appoint as nominal defendant and in any other case against the person upon whose such land the application was brought under the provisions of this Act or who acquired title through such fraud ... provided further that ... in case the person against whom such action for damages is directed to be brought as aforesaid shall be dead or shall have been adjudged insolvent or cannot be found within the jurisdiction then and in any such case such damages with costs of action may be recovered out of the assurance fund by action against the Registrar General as nominal defendant." 
The only judicial consideration of the words in s.126(5)(b) by a superior court was by the High Court in Saade versus Registrar General <case>; [(1993) 179 CLR 58] at 68 to 69. The basic thrust of the judgment in
Saade's case was to show that Registrar of Titles (WA) versus Franzon <case>; [(1975) 132 CLR 611] did not apply in New South Wales because of different wording. The question as to whether Mr Saade, the fraudster, could be found within the jurisdiction does not seem to have been considered either by Powell J at first instance; see
Saade versus Saade 1 December 1989 unreported, or by the Court of Appeal 18
June 1992 unreported; and it is not really clear how the High Court came to deal with it. It may be that the passage is obiter dicta, but even so, it is such seriously meant obiter dicta that what was said by five justices of the
High Court even if not, strictly speaking, binding on this Court, should be followed. The High Court said that: "Mr Saade could not be found within the jurisdiction at the time proceedings were commenced. Counsel for Mrs Saade submitted that this is the relevant time for determining the operation of s.126(5)(b). We agree. The right to bring action against the Registrar General only arises 'when the person liable for damages ... cannot be found within the jurisdiction.' The right of action against the Registrar General crystallises at that time." 
Mrs Donohoe, for the Registrar General, says that the High Court has clearly said that when one is considering an action against the Registrar General one must ask, as at the date of commencement of the proceedings, whether any of the four events set out in s.126(5)(b) has occurred.

On the other hand, Mr Haffenden, for the defendants/first cross claimants, says that when one reads a little further, one can see that what the High
Court is really saying is that it is necessary to look at the Act as a whole and not to throw an impossible burden on a claimant. The High Court said that otherwise, "... there would need to be an inquiry as to the whereabouts of the person concerned at each stage of the proceedings up to and including the time of the hearing. This could cast an impossible burden on a claimant and is inconsistent with the purposes of an Assurance Fund designed to provide a practical scheme of compensation for persons who have suffered loss through the operation of the Torrens system of indefeasibility of title." 
It may be because the High Court was not really directing its mind to this point other than as a subsidiary matter that the full ramifications of what was being said did not strike home. In a case note by a Western Australian barrister, Paul Mendelow, in [(1994) 2 APLJ 279] at 281, the learned author says of the idea that the right of action crystallises when proceedings are commenced: "This raises interesting questions about when it would be strategically appropriate to commence proceedings and against whom such proceedings ought to be brought." 
The reason for this comment is quite clear. If one focuses solely at the moment when the action was commenced, then the accidental fact that the fraudster was not within the jurisdiction or, alternatively, could not be found, but could have been found at other times, means that there is an action against the Registrar General.

Again, can one only bring an action if at the exact time when it is instituted the fraudster is bankrupt? If so, it does not matter that the fraudster became bankrupt shortly afterwards and was bankrupt at the time of hearing. Again, if at the time when the action was brought the fraudster was bankrupt, but ceased to be bankrupt before verdict, then the action was properly brought. This all seems rather absurd.

If this reasoning is correct, it follows that had the first cross claimants held back from suing from 24 October 1991 until 24 October 1992, there would be no difficulty at all about their meeting the condition. However, because their action was, on one argument premature, they face defeat and the
Registrar General cannot be made liable. As Raymond Ham ceased to be a bankrupt on 1 September 1996, he is not now a bankrupt and, accordingly, the matter of bankruptcy no longer provides a reason for suing the Registrar
General. This concept of being able to bring actions at certain times of the year is a rather strange one, but it would seem to follow from what the High
Court has said.

I consider that there is a lot in what Mr Haffenden says about looking at the
Act as a scheme for providing a practical scheme of compensation for persons who have suffered loss. However, I do not feel brave enough to go against what appears to me to be a clear finding on the matter by the High Court, especially one which has been adopted by the text writers since, even though I believe that if the matter had been fully ventilated, the High Court might have come to some different view.

However, the Act is designed to provide a practical scheme for compensation and this concept must influence the construction of s.126(5). One must construe sections such as this in a purposive way in order to meet the legislative scheme.

The legislative scheme in the Torrens Act was perhaps rather ill thought-out, but essentially it is that no-one can be defeated by some forgery or other matter including notice of an equitable interest, but that each time there is a dealing with the land, the government guarantees the title and the title is indefeasible.

Thus, under the general law system of land holding, a forgery makes the document a nullity and ordinarily even registration in the register of deeds will not give the document any greater validity and the original proprietor of the land will be able to obtain ejectment against the person who has taken under a forged conveyance. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s124.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) protects a person who has become registered proprietor and who has an indefeasible title against actions in ejectment. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html) then complements this by providing that the deprivation of the proprietor by, inter alia, the fact that he or she cannot get ejectment under [s.124](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s124.html) is to be converted into a statutory cause of action for damages. Primarily, this action is against the fraudster but, in certain circumstances, it is against the Assurance Fund.

It should be remembered that the basic scheme of the Act when it was introduced was that land would be brought under the Act by primary applications and that a contribution would be made by every applicant to the
Assurance Fund. I think it was hoped originally by Torrens and his associates that what would happen would be a simple system whereby people could just deal in land by filling in a simple form and handing it over the counter to the
Registrar General. It would be registered automatically and if there were any problems then the State would pay compensation in the odd case where the problem arose, and thus considerable amounts of money would be saved. That did not happen in practice for a variety of reasons, some of which are sketched out by Mr Moore in his article in [(1966) 40 ALJ 190.] 
As is clear from an examination of the operation of Torrens systems outside
Australia, a compensation fund is not necessary for the operation of a Torrens system but it seems to have been necessary in New South Wales and in the rest of the Australian States so that the deep seated opposition to the system by the legal profession could be overcome. That is perhaps why it has never really been settled whether the Assurance Fund is an insurance fund or whether it is just there for political grandstanding. These matters are dealt with in
Stein & Stone on Torrens Title (Butterworths, Sydney 1991) p 354, and by the recent report of the Law Reform Commission, Report No 76 "Torrens
Title Compensation for Loss" (June 1996) and see also my article, "Why
Did the Torrens System Succeed in Australia Yet Fail in North America?" in [(1994) 2 APLJ 225.] 
Indeed, it is interesting that in the only big claim against a Torrens fund that has ever been brought was when a clerk in the Alberta registry, by mistake, omitted some oil rights on the title of the Canadian Pacific Railway, even though the Privy Council held that the railway was entitled to compensation. See Borys versus Canadian Pacific Railway [[1953] AC 217.] The Alberta legislature straightaway amended the Act to put a cap of $1,000 per acre on claims that could be made. Thus assurance fund claims have really not figured very highly in the scheme of the legislation.

However, the scheme of the New South Wales [Real Property Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) is quite clear. There is a group of sections, including 41, 42, 43, 43A, 124 and 135, which operate so that a person who is registered as proprietor has an indefeasible copy of the title which cannot be attacked by an action in ejectment. It is accordingly necessary to make provision for the situation where a person under the general law would have had a claim in ejectment, to give an equivalent action. That action is given by [s.126.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html)
As the High Court said in Registrar General versus Behn <case>; [(1981) 148 CLR 562] at 568, the action is a fresh action created by the statute.
The section does not merely declare that such an action already existed.

The action having been created by the statute, it is necessary to construe the statute to see what it comprehends. This is a difficult process. I have already noted Commissioner Heydon's comments on the deplorable state of drafting of the Act as at 1900 and, despite two or three overhauls since, things have not got any better in this part of the Act.

The prime thrust of s.126 is that the action should be initially against the fraudster. The fraudster ceases to be liable in certain events under s.126(4), including the event where there is a further transfer to a bona fide purchaser for value. In that case, s.126(5)(a) gives an action against the Registrar
General as nominal defendant.

The fraudster may well be an individual. However, the fraudster may also be a corporation and may be two or more people. However, when one gets down to s.126(5)(b), the legislature seems to act under the misapprehension that the fraudster must be a single individual and a natural person. For instance, a company cannot become dead or bankrupt. Nor can it ever fulfil the description "cannot be found within the jurisdiction". Suppose A, B and C are joint tenants and A and B jointly convince D that she should impersonate C and provide an instrument that A and B can present to the Registrar General to have the land transferred to E. If A dies and B becomes bankrupt, it is hard to see how the person, which must mean the jointure, is either dead or bankrupt. It is strange that because one is dead and one is bankrupt, the section does not apply.

There is another glaring anomaly too and that is that under s.133(c), the
Assurance Fund is protected against claims where land is included in a title through misdescription of boundaries or parcels unless it is proved that the person primarily liable: is dead; or has absconded; or is insolvent or bankrupt; or that the Sheriff certifies such person is unable to pay the full amount awarded.

As there is nothing in s.126(5) or anywhere else to make the Registrar General liable if the person is unable to pay the full amount, it is hard to see why that provision is put into s.133(c). One could think that the legislature has copied the South Australian provision without thinking, but one does not lightly impute that thought to the legislature. Another possibility is that a person unable to pay the full amount is insolvent and so the word "insolvent" is picked up in s.126(5)(b). That argument is weakened by the fact that the words "is insolvent or bankrupt" appear in s.133(c). Yet one finds also the word "absconded" rather than "cannot be found within the jurisdiction".

With all these difficulties, one focuses on the word "insolvent" in s.126(5)(b). Mrs Donohoe says that the word "insolvent" means "adjudged insolvent" and she looks to the history of the Act from s.117 of the 1862 Act.
The argument can take many forms but the strongest version of it is that in , the New South Wales Bankruptcy Act came into force so that in 1900, when the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) was consolidated, there were two types of people whose estates had been sequestrated: those who had been made insolvent under the Insolvency Act 1841; and those who had been made bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act 1898.

Such a construction does mean that one has to, in 1997, look at legislation years old to find the meaning of a provision, but the answer to that criticism is that one has to look at the Act as at 1900 and see what the legislature meant when it passed it and, in 1900, it may have been quite sensible to have that construction. This construction also means that one deprives the present tense of the verb to be, "is", of semantic significance because a person is adjudged bankrupt at one point in time and then is a bankrupt during the period before he or she is discharged from bankruptcy and from then is not a bankrupt, but is a person who has been adjudged bankrupt.

It would seem that Commissioner Heydon did make some amendments to the text to make it more meaningful and he certainly changed the meaning from that of the Act. The argument is really that he did not change it very much and "insolvent" should still mean adjudged insolvent.

I consider that probably the best reason for adopting that view is the provision of s.131(2), that the Registrar General is allowed to recover "from the estate of such insolvent or bankrupt" in a situation where he has paid on account of a person who is insolvent or bankrupt. It is strange that in some sections insolvency occurs before bankruptcy and other sections vice versa, but that is just another difficulty with the drafting. The section seems to contemplate that the insolvent or bankrupt will have his or her estate administered by the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy. However, a little thought shows that s.131(2) does not completely marry in to s.126(5).

First of all, it makes no provision at all for bankrupt or insolvent corporations who do not have an estate. They merely have a change of management of their property by a liquidator being appointed. Secondly, it is not necessarily the case that the insolvent mentioned in s.131(2) was insolvent at the time when the Registrar General makes his claim under s.131(2). A person who is bankrupt or insolvent at the time the Registrar
General makes his claim may have quitted the jurisdiction at the time when the summons was filed by the person deprived, but has since become bankrupt.
Accordingly, although s.131(2) points towards the construction that "insolvent" means "adjudged insolvent", it does not seem to me that it goes the whole way.

There is then the statement by Mr Baalman, an acknowledged expert on the working of the Torrens system in the first edition of his Commentary on the
Torrens System, in New South Wales (Law Book Co, Sydney, 1951) at pp 397-8. Mr
Baalman speaks of the transmutation of rights, meaning that a person's claim in ejectment is transmogrified into a claim under s.126. He says: "This transmutation of rights has its ultimate phase in a claim against the
Assurance Fund. But before that phase is reached, that is, before the Fund can be called upon to perform its appointed function of insuring against loss, there must have been a loss. The person deprived of land must have pursued his remedies fruitlessly against the wrongdoer or his voluntary assigns if they were accessible." 
That passage is not in the current successor to Baalman, Woodman and
Nettle on the Torrens System by Butt & Ticehurst and seems to be contrary to what was decided by the High Court in Behn's case. That is, it is not necessary to pursue the wrongdoer by action or by action to judgment.

The contrary argument that "insolvency" should have a wider meaning is that the normal meaning of the word is "unable to pay his or her debts as they become due". In a settlement the word "insolvent", even when joined with "bankrupt", has that meaning; see for instance, Re Muggeridge's Trust
Johnson 625 at 627; [70 ER 569], 570, and Re Bevin [[1936] NZLR 789.] Mrs Donohoe referred me to the High Court's decision in an election case where the legislature imposed a disqualification on people who were undischarged bankrupts or insolvent from being elected. In that case, Nile versus Wood <case>; [(1988) 167 CLR 133], the High
Court held that the word "undischarged" attached to both "insolvent" and "bankrupt" and so there was a composite reference to the status of a person who had been declared bankrupt or insolvent. I do not find that authority of any assistance because it was plainly focusing on the word "undischarged".

The purpose of the Act is to make sure that people who have been deprived of their actions in ejectment by the Torrens system should not go away empty- handed. Mrs Donohoe spoke of the fund as being taxpayers' money, which should not be dissipated by courts expanding the liabilities of the fund. I must confess I found it strange to hear that submission as most of the text writers make it quite clear that the funds were really the funds that had been put together by applicants to bring land under the Act over the years and that whilst technically the fund is currently supplied from consolidated revenue, it was part of the original Torrens system, which was in force up until 1940; thus the fund was a contributory fund from the people taking advantage of the
Act to compensate for errors.

However, the point is really decided by a case to which I was not referred in argument but which I have already mentioned, Registrar General versus Behn.
That case started off before Holland J in [[1979] 2 NSWLR 496] where the facts are fully set out. The plaintiff, Valerie Behn, was the registered proprietor of land. She had been deprived of her interest by one Donald
Bodiam, who was a director of a company, Cornic Loan & Credits Pty
Limited. That director obtained the Certificate of Title and, as agent for the company, procured the company to become registered proprietor and so deprived
Valerie Behn of her land. The learned judge said at page 513 that Cornic was not worth suing. It is nowhere set out in the report that Cornic had ever been adjudged bankrupt (if a company can be adjudged bankrupt) or had been even wound up on the ground of insolvency. The learned judge found for Mrs Behn.

The Court of Appeal [1980] 1 NSWLR 589 dealt with the matter in the same way,
Mahoney JA saying at 593: "Cornic has at all relevant times been insolvent and there is no prospect of any recovery from it." 
In the High Court, the justices came to the same view. So we have consideration of the very point that is raised here by nine learned judges, all of whom had no difficulty at all in saying that the word "insolvent" in s.126(5)(b) had the meaning of a person who, because he had no funds, was not worth suing. This construction is in accordance with the general principle that it is where the fraudster is not worth "powder and shot", rather than a technical construction that would put barriers in the way of such a plaintiff.

Accordingly, in my view, the word "insolvent" in s.126(5)(b) means unable to pay his, her or its debts as they fall due.

Therefore, I need to look at the facts. Mrs Donohoe says that the evidence would not satisfy me that the fraudster was insolvent as at 24 October 1991.
Under [s.140](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s140.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), I have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fraudster was insolvent on that day. The facts are that the fraudster had a business in Cairns. It closed down in February 1990 because he or his company could not pay the rent.
He then ceased living in Cairns and lived with his daughter at her expense. By he was receiving a pension and told his trustee in bankruptcy in 1993, which the trustee in bankruptcy seems to accept, that he was ill. The only inference is that he ceased working after the restaurant in Cairns failed in , was not able to earn income, had assets as disclosed in the statement of affairs of some $420 and that the estate was administered in bankruptcy without paying a dividend anywhere near a hundred cents in the dollar.

The only contrary material is that Westpac Bank granted the fraudster a business loan together with his partners in 1992. However, this is equivocal and the point has not been strengthened at all by any corroborative evidence of the loan. It could well have been a loan that consolidated previous loans or there may have been a guarantee by the partners. The mere fact that it was made does not seem to me to alter the balance of the evidence, and I find as a fact that, from 1990 through to August 1993, the fraudster was insolvent.

That being so, it is not necessary to look at the other part of [s.126(5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html), that is, that the fraudster "cannot be found within the jurisdiction". That phrase may mean cannot be found within the jurisdiction or outside the jurisdiction or is not within the jurisdiction or has absconded from the jurisdiction. There may be other possibilities. Interstate Acts based on the
South Australian 1862 Act do use the word "absconded" in lieu of "cannot be found within the jurisdiction." For instance, s.127 of the Queensland [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) of 1861 says in the final proviso: "Provided also that any person so absconding beyond the jurisdiction if subsequently found within the jurisdiction shall be liable to be sued in the name of the Registrar General." 
The word "absconding" does find its way into [s.132](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s132.html) and s.[133](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s133.html).
I have mentioned [s.133(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s133.html) already, where the word "absconded" appears by itself. However, in [s.132(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s132.html), the words are "any person who has absconded or who cannot be found within the jurisdiction". So one would think that there are two separate situations envisaged but as [s.132(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s132.html) could not come into play unless there was some liability under [s.126(5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s126.html), the words "cannot be found within the jurisdiction" must be equivalent to "absconded".

One can well imagine why the legislature of the Colony in 1862 might so provide because it would appear that one of the ways of evading debt was to surreptitiously leave the Colony and so defeat the creditors. Accordingly, I do not think that I am at all assisted by any evidence as to whether the fraudster was hiding somewhere within New South Wales. I consider that, on the evidence, the likelihood is that after about February 1990, the fraudster was living in New South Wales and probably living with his daughter. As a result,
I would not be satisfied that he had absconded from New South Wales as at 24
October 1991 so he is not a person who "cannot be found within the jurisdiction". However, as I have found that he was an insolvent that day, that does not matter over much.

It follows from what I have said that the Registrar General is liable at the suit of the defendants/first cross claimants for the damages of $200,000 unless one of the defences to the cross claim is made out. John Ham died on 20
September 1995. He left his estate to the fraudster, his brother. At that stage, the fraudster was still an undischarged bankrupt, and it would seem that the benefit that the fraudster obtained from the estate would be property divisible amongst his creditors because of [s.116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s116.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/). However, the Official Trustee is not a party to these proceedings and I should not be taken to be making any findings which would affect the Trustee in any subsequent proceedings but I will proceed on the basis that what I just said is the situation.

It would also appear that if the Registrar General paid, say, $200,000 to the executors of John Ham, they would pay their costs of these proceedings such as were not recovered from the Registrar General on taxation. They would pay the general administration expenses of the estate and then pay the balance to the
Official Trustee. But the Official Trustee would then pay the creditors of the fraudster and then would distribute any balance to the fraudster. The fraudster would then be liable, because of [s.128(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s128.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), if for no other reason, to pay that sum to the Registrar General. It may also be that under [s.131(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s131.html) the Registrar General could claim directly against the Official Trustee, but this is a little unclear and there is no need to say anything more about it.

Mrs Donohoe said that it would be repugnant to public policy and contrary to the interests of justice to allow the fraudster to benefit from his own fraud, and that, accordingly, the proceedings were not maintainable or, alternatively, the Registrar General had a defence of circuity of action.

I do not consider that this is a case where the defence of circuity of action applies. That was a very technical defence that was available under the old common law system of pleading. Under that system, one had to have a cause of action as at the date the writ was issued. It was necessary, in some situations, where the cause of action had not fully accrued, to permit a defendant to plead circuity of action, that is, that upon damages being found in the plaintiff's action there would instantly accrue to the defendant a claim of exactly equivalent amount and because of this it would be a complete waste of time to permit the plaintiff to succeed. Indeed, there would also be an injustice as to the costs of the proceedings.

Circuity of action was looked on, however, very technically because it was an exception to the common law system of pleading, one which, surprisingly for the old common law system, was based on avoidance of scandal and absurdity; see Charles versus Altin <case>; [(1854) 15 CB 46], 62; <case>; [139
ER 335], 341, which was applied by the High Court of Australia in Eastern Extension Australasia & China Telegraph Co Ltd versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1923) 33 CLR 426], 441. The principle is also considered by the Full Court in this State in Andrews versus Nominal Defendant [(1962) 63 SR 110.]
Unfortunately, although this judgment has been considered to be authoritative, the respondent said it was unarguably wrong in the High Court, which allowed an appeal by consent; see [(1962) 36 ALJR 371.] However, a later decision in the Court of Appeal in Imperial Furniture Pty Ltd v
Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Ltd [[1967] 1 NSWLR 29] at 41 re- established its authority.

Before one can have circuity of action, as I understand it: it must be shown that precisely the same amount of damages would be awarded in the defendant's proposed action as in the plaintiff's action; both the plaintiff and the defendant must be suing each other in the same right; both actions must be actions at law, not one in law and one in equity; and either the cause of action must be complete, or alternatively, the defendant so obviously has an action as a result of the finding for the plaintiff that it would be scandalous to put the defendant to the trouble of starting a fresh action.

I do not consider that all these requirements are present in the instant case and accordingly, the technical defence of circuity of action should not succeed.

The next principle is the principle that no person should be able to profit from his or her own wrong. This is often said but is really a convenient tag for at least eight different principles. I have reviewed these eight principles in a judgment that will shortly be delivered (see now Drinkwater v Caddyrack Pty Ltd 25 September 1997, unreported) and I will not repeat them now. One of the eight principles is the principle of public policy, which prevents a person from making a claim against an estate where he or she has killed the testator; see, for instance, Troja versus Troja [(1994) 33 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281994%29%2033%20NSWLR%20269 "View LawCiteRecord" ), a principle that has more recently been modified by the Forfeiture Act of
The principle also occurs in Admiralty, preventing a claim of salvage taking place where the person making the salvage has to some extent contributed to the accident; see The Kafiristan [1935]P63, 69, which is an interesting application of the public policy rule combined with the circuity of action rule in the Court of Admiralty.

However, in the instant case the person who is going to make the profit is really only going to make the profit by chance or because of something completely unrelated to his own wrong. Where the wrong and the benefit are not inter-related, the general rule that you cannot benefit from your own wrong does not necessarily apply; see Thornton versus Abbey National PLC [[1993] TLR .] 
Even if the principle did apply, there is a problem as to whether it operates so as to prevent not only the fraudster taking advantage of his own wrong, but also the fraudster's creditors who have proved in his bankruptcy. The Westpac
Bank, which seems to be the substantial creditor, was not affected at all by the forgery of the fraudster. Why should it be precluded from receiving a dividend in the bankruptcy in the ordinary course of events merely because of a fraud by the bankrupt, unrelated to the bankruptcy, and the chance events that John Ham died before the discharge from bankruptcy and made the fraudster his beneficiary? The answer to this may be that if the fraudster is subject to an equitable obligation to hold money on trust then, putting aside all principles of bankruptcy, his creditors would not be entitled to part of the property.

It seems to me that it would be wrong to deal with all these matters without hearing submissions of counsel for the trustee or the creditors because the decision on the matter is not obvious and may be influenced by factors which are not presently before the court. However, I believe that there should be some equitable lien placed on the funds that are left after the party and party costs and administration costs of John Ham's estate have been met and the estate has been fully administered, so that there would be an opportunity for the present point to be litigated. It may be that it never arises because of some action that the Registrar General may take or a proof that he may lodge with the Official Trustee.

Accordingly, on the claim between the estate of John Ham and the Registrar
General, I find a verdict for the defendants/first cross claimants for $200,000 and order the cross defendant to pay the costs. But the better thing is, I believe, in view of the problem about the lien, for the matter to stand over for short minutes to be brought in. Now that can happen on say 23
September 1997 at 9.30 am but if counsel wish to establish some other time, they can do so so long as they arrange it with my Associate no later than 17
September 1997.
