Judgment 
Jonathon Davison murdered a woman on 25 December 1990. He was then aged 19 years. He pleaded guilty to the offence and was sentenced by Wood J to a term of imprisonment of 20 years and 5 months with a minimum term of 13 years and 5 months and an additional term of 7 years. His minimum term expired on 10 February 2006. Since that date, he has been refused parole and remains in prison. His sentence will end on 10 February 2013.  
By these proceedings, Mr Davison seeks prerogative relief in the nature of orders for certiorari pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and declaratory relief under [s 75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s75.html) of the Act in respect of the following decisions concerning the administration of his sentence:  a decision of the Commissioner of Corrective Services (the first defendant) made on 13 October 2010 in respect of Mr Davison's classification and placement as a prisoner; the decision of the Serious Offenders Review Council (the second defendant) made on 19 October 2010 to advise the New South Wales State Parole
Authority (the third defendant) that it was not appropriate in the public interest for Mr Davison to be considered for release on parole; the decision of the Parole Authority made on 13 January 2011 refusing Mr
Davison a review hearing of his parole and refusing parole; the decision of the Parole Authority made on 24 March 2011 refusing a review hearing of Mr Davison's parole.
Mr Davison requires leave under [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the [Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/) to institute the proceedings. The defendants do not oppose the grant of leave.  
Background 
It is appropriate to record something of the background to the decisions under review. In recording such matters, I am not mistaking my task as one of reviewing the merits of the decisions. I am merely seeking to explain the nature of those decisions, which are better understood in their context.  
The facts of Mr Davison's offence are recorded in the remarks on sentence given by Wood J on 11 September 1992. The victim was aged 17 when she was killed. She regarded Mr Davison as a close companion but did not wish to form a close emotional or physical relationship with him. He was infatuated with her and wished to form a closer relationship. A post mortem examination revealed that the victim had suffered a series of injuries including fractures and bruising to the skull, strangulation marks and a stab wound in the back. She was also found to have bruising extending deep into the wall of the vagina, which was firmly packed with sand.  
Mr Davison said that he had no recollection of that feature of the offence and no recollection of doing anything that could have caused vaginal injury. Wood J was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those injuries were caused before death. His Honour found that the victim was killed in Mr Davison's flat following her rejection of his sexual advances.  
An aspect of the administration of sentences in this State is that inmates are classified for the purposes of security and the provision of appropriate development programs. The classification of male inmates is governed by clause 22 of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/cosr2008439/). In each classification, the determinative consideration is the opinion of the Commissioner of Corrective Services as to the appropriate level of security or supervision for the inmate in accordance with the criteria stated in clause 22.  
The classifications range from category AA (inmates representing a special risk to national security) to category C3, which is the lowest classification. An inmate who is able to progress through those classifications is afforded a graduated easing of security constraints in anticipation of release back into the community.  
Mr Davison's first classification was category A2 (inmates who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, should at all times be confined by a secure physical barrier that includes towers, other highly secure perimeter structures or electronic surveillance equipment). By February 2001, Mr Davison had passed through category B and had obtained a category C1 classification (inmates who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, should be confined by a physical barrier unless in the company of a correctional officer or some other authorised person).  
From that point, all going well, it remained for Mr Davison to progress through categories C2 and C3. Category C2 is the category of inmates who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, need not be confined by a physical barrier at all times but who need some level of supervision. Category C3 is the category of inmates who, in the opinion of the Commissioner, need not be confined by a physical barrier at all times and who need not be supervised. Such inmates may be granted leave to work outside prison on weekends prior to their ultimate release into the community on parole or at the end of their sentence. Under department guidelines, Mr Davison was eligible for C2 classification in February 2004.  
A result of the sentence imposed by Wood J (since it included a minimum term of more than 12 years) was to bring Mr Davison within the definition of a "serious offender" in [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s3.html) of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/). Decisions relating to his placement, classification and parole are accordingly required to be informed by the views of the Serious Offenders Review Council. Any decision by the Commissioner to change the classification of a serious offender is to be made with mandatory regard to the recommendations of the Review Council in that regard (see clause 27 of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/cosr2008439/) ). The Commissioner is also bound to consider any submissions of the Review Council before making a decision as to a serious offender's placement (see clause 20 of the Regulation).  
The Review Council also has an important statutory function in the decisions of the Parole Authority whether to grant parole to a serious offender. In the case of any sentence of more than 3 years, the Parole Authority must have regard to any report of the Review Council in relation to the grant of parole: [s 135(2)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s135.html) of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/) . As to serious offenders, [s 135(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s135.html) of the Act provides that, except in exceptional circumstances, the Parole Authority must not make a parole order unless the Review Council advises that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole.  
In June 2002, in the context of a determination by the Commissioner that Mr Davison would remain classified in category C1, the Review Council directed that Mr Davison be assessed as to whether he should undertake a program for sex offenders known as CUBIT. The Review Council noted that, although Mr Davison was charged with murder, "there appears to be a sexual element to his crime". In due course Mr Davison was categorised as a sexual offender following examination by a psychologist.  
Mr Davison was at the time of the psychologist's examination suffering from a chronic auto-immune disease (systematic lupus erythematosus). The psychologist reported in the following terms:  
Given the details outlined in the official document it would be imprudent to assume there was no sexual motivation for his crime. Hence, until further information is received to the contrary, Mr Davison appears to fulfil DCS's [Department of Corrective Services] definition for a sexual offender.
The psychologist's report in 2003 assessed Mr Davison's risk for sexual and violent recidivism as being in the moderate-low range. The psychologist stated that, in order for Mr Davison to reduce his risk of re-offending, he needed to complete a moderate intensity treatment at CUBIT. It was accepted at that point, however, that Mr Davison's medical condition, being a chronic auto-immune disease, would preclude him from undertaking such a program until his condition was in remission.  
Mr Davison remains classified as a C1 inmate. The primary impediment to his further progression through the classification system is what might be described as an impasse between the Commissioner and Mr Davison as to the sexual component of his offence. The first decision challenged in these proceedings is the Commissioner's refusal in October 2010 to reduce the classification to C2 and change Mr Davison's placement.  
Completion of referral to the sex offender program 
A detailed and helpful chronology provided by the parties gives a good understanding as to the genesis of the problem. Without descending into all detail (and at the risk of over simplification) the salient events may be summarised as follows.  
I think the Department would accept that, for at least a period of time, Mr Davison's ill health remained an impediment to his participating in any intensive, custody-based sex offender program. The impasse emerged after his condition improved. In order to be considered for a suitable program, Mr Davison had to complete and sign a form providing information about the offence and giving his consent to be referred to a suitable program. For a considerable period of time, Mr Davison failed or refused to complete the form to the satisfaction of the relevant authorities. His approach to that issue was driven by a number of concerns including the fact that he did not perceive his offending as entailing a sexual component, his desire to receive more information about the programs and his fear that there would be reprisals against him from other inmates if he became identified and stigmatised within the prison system as a sex offender.  
In February 2006, upon the expiration of his minimum term, Mr Davison was refused parole due to his perceived inability to adapt to normal lawful community life; the risk of re-offending and the need for him to address the sexual component of his offending behaviour.  
The wrangling as to the need for Mr Davison to complete the consent form for referral to the sex offender program continued. In December 2006, Mr Davison wrote to the Parole Authority:  
I will concede that there is a suggestion that there is some level of sexual motivation to my offence. However, without full recollection of events, and subsequential insight into the crime, I cannot confirm something that may or may not have happened ... I refute the claim that I have been avoiding treatment.
In October 2008, Mr Davison wrote:  ... It is my ideological and methodological objection to the program and to the principles which underpin them. I do not concede of there being a sexual motivation to my offence, nor do I believe in the treatment regime, based as it is on the Canadian model, and is premised on what I know as the bio-medical model. As far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no causal relationship between participation in your program and reducing recidivism.
After being pressed further for completion of the relevant forms in terms satisfactory to the department, Mr Davison ultimately completed his referral for CUBIT by January 2010. In April 2010 he provided the following further response to the question "Briefly describe what happened" (relating to the offence):  
My perception of the crime is one of violence not of sexual offending. There is no sexual component to report.
The result of the referral was that, in July 2010, Mr Davison was found unsuitable for either of the programs previously nominated (CUBIT and CORE) due to his denial that there was a sexual component to his offending, but suitable for the Deniers program. He was advised that his name had been placed on a waiting list for that program. He subsequently consented to referral for assessment for the Violent Offender Therapeutic Program (VOTP) but was found ineligible for that program due to his low risk of re-offending.  
Decision of the Commissioner 
On 6 October 2010, the Review Council recommended that Mr Davison's classification be reduced to C2 with a consequential change of placement. The reasons given for the decision were to assist Mr Davison's eventual progression to supervision in the community, noting that he had been found ineligible for VOTP, had no history of violent re-offending, had completed the CALM and SMART programs and was on the waiting list for the Deniers program, was assessed as having a low risk of recidivism, had only two offences in custody (none since 2005) and that he had completed his minimum term, with his sentence expiring on 10 February 2013. The report noted that the Deniers program was not anticipated to commence until "mid next year". It stated:  
Inmate to be advised that Council expects that he will undertake Deniers program before further progression is considered.
On 13 October 2010, the Commissioner decided not to accept the Review Council's recommendation. The decision was recorded in the form of an endorsement on the memorandum of the Review Council. The endorsement was in the following terms:  
Comply with programs nominated. Review again in six months.
As already noted, any decision by the Commissioner to change Mr Davison's classification was to be made with mandatory regard to the recommendations of the Review Council. Although the regulation does not say so in terms, that requirement would extend clearly enough in my view to any decision not to change the classification.  
I am mindful of the constraint this Court should exercise in reviewing managerial decisions made within a prison: see Modica versus Commissioner for Corrective Services [(1994) 77 A Crim R 82.] It was submitted on behalf of the defendants, and I accept, that I should not interfere with the decision unless convinced that the recommendation of the Review Council was not considered (or unless the decision was made in bad faith, which is not alleged in the present case).  
It was acknowledged on behalf of Mr Davison that the Commissioner was not bound to accept the recommendation of the Review Council. It was submitted, however, that the Commissioner could not have taken the recommendation into account. Ms Burgess, who appeared for Mr Davison, submitted that the direction to comply with "programs nominated" must refer to the Deniers program, since that was the only outstanding program at the time of the decision, Mr Davison having been assessed as ineligible for the CUBIT, CORE and VOPT programs.  
The Review Council's recommendation included the information that Mr Davison was on a waiting list for the Deniers program and that the program was not anticipated to commence for nine months.  
The terms of the Commissioner's decision, expressed in the imperative rather than as a record of a decision or opinion duly reached, reveal nothing of the reasons that moved the delegate not to accept the recommendation of the Review Council. One is left to speculate.  
Although the delegate was not bound to accept the Review Council's recommendation, he or she was bound to consider it. It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Commissioner must be presumed to have read and considered the recommendations of the Review Council which appeared immediately above the note of the decision. In my view, the terms of the decision itself overwhelmingly support the contrary inference. In circumstances where the only outstanding program "nominated" in respect of Mr Davison was not anticipated to be available for nine months, a direction that he comply with that program and be reviewed in six months time made no sense. The plaintiff would have no ability to follow the directive, and there would be no utility in any such review in the circumstances.  
The task of the delegate was to form an opinion in the terms of clause 22 of the Regulation. In particular, the delegate had to form an opinion as to whether Mr Davison should be confined by a physical barrier unless in the company of a correctional officer or some other authorised person, or whether (conversely) he was an inmate who did not need to be confined by a physical barrier at all times but who needed some level of supervision. Mr Davison's prior failure or refusal adequately to complete the forms for referral to a sex offender program was of limited relevance to that choice and, in my view, was not of itself a reason to refuse to reduce Mr Davison's classification: cf DCU versus State Parole Authority of New South Wales  <case> per Johnson J at [45] to [53] and the cases there cited.  
It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the decision must be read in the context of the lengthy history of consideration of Mr Davison's case as recorded in the earlier reports of the Review Council. I accept that is so, but in my view such consideration only confirms the apprehension that the content of the most recent report must have been overlooked. Following a tortuous process, Mr Davison had finally completed the relevant forms and a single appropriate program had been identified, but it was not available for 9 months. A direction to complete "nominated programs" coupled with an apparent blanket refusal to reduce the classification in the meantime points strongly to the conclusion that the detail of the recommendation was passed over, perhaps understandably having regard to the firmly entrenched positions of the relevant players by that stage.  
Inflexible application of policy 
A separate ground for impugning the Commissioner's decision was that it must have entailed the inflexible application of a policy without regard to the individual merits of the case. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Davison that there is overwhelming evidence from a number of documents that the Department of Corrective Services has a policy that reduction in classification and change in placement of a sexual offender will be delayed until eligibility and participation in a sex offender program is confirmed. A series of documents was relied upon in support of that submission but there is no need to recite them.  
In my view, if (contrary to the conclusion I have reached) the delegate did consider the recommendation of the review Council, the terms of the decision itself provide ample support for the conclusion that the rejection of that recommendation must have entailed the inflexible application of a rule or de facto policy that the reclassification must be refused simply because Mr Davison had not completed the nominated sex offender program at that time. Absent the expression of any other reason for rejecting the reclassification, that is the only sensible explanation for the decision, in my view (assuming that the terms of the Review Council's recommendation were considered by the delegate).  
The relevant principles are conveniently summarised in the plaintiff's written submissions as follows:  
While it is permissible for a decision maker to develop criteria for the exercise of a discretionary statutory power and to take account of policy in doing so: Drake versus Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [(1979) 24 ALR ], a failure to consider the circumstances of an individual case will constitute an error of law, Green versus Daniels <case>; [(1977) 13 ALR 1.] A discretionary power "must be exercised on each occasion in the light of the circumstances at that time: " R versus Secretary of State for the
Home Department; Ex parte Venables <case>; [[1998] AC ] at -497; ID, PF and DV versus Director General, Department of Juvenile Justice  <case> at <case>.
 
In Surinakova versus Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs
Hill J held that policies can "ensure consistency of administrative decision making", but a "decision maker must take care to ensure that he does not slavishly follow a policy and disregard the particular circumstances of a case". Hill J also cited with approval the decision in Khan versus Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  <case>, where Gummow J said at [25]: "... what was required of the decision maker, in respect of each of the applications, was that in considering all relevant material placed before him, he give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the merits of the case and be ready in a proper case to depart from any applicable policy.
The defendants accepted that, if the Commissioner had inflexibly applied a policy without due regard to Mr Davison's individual circumstances, that would constitute an error of law. It was submitted, however, that his contention as to the existence of such a policy (no reclassification for sex offenders until completion of treatment programs) was founded on mere speculation. I disagree. In my view, there is ample basis to infer the existence of such a rule or policy.  
The Commissioner's processes were summarised in an affidavit affirmed by Ms Sue Wilson. She stated that inmates assessed as being at a low risk of re-offending generally progress in classification levels without a pre-requisite for program participation unless gaol behaviour or other factors such as intelligence, time left to serve, association or protection matters indicate an unsuitability for a minimum security environment.  
At paragraph 32 of her affidavit, Ms Wilson stated that sex offenders assessed as suitable for a therapeutic program who refuse to undertake that program do not generally progress beyond C2 classification (as already noted, Mr Davison remains at the higher classification, C1). Ms Wilson stated:  this reinforces to inmates the priority that the organisation places on program participation as well as ensuring 'untreated inmates' retain an appropriate security presence.
It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that, expressed in those terms, the relevant procedures could be seen not to entail any policy prohibiting reduction in classification to from C1 to C2 (any relevant policy relating only to progression beyond C2). The difficulty, however, is that Ms Wilson's description of the perceived relevance of program participation to classification and placement only serves to reinforce the apprehension that progression is tied to the completion of programs. That is the only sensible understanding of the reference to "reinforcing" to inmates the "priority" placed on program participation.  
The extent to which inmates appreciate the priority that the department places on program participation is of doubtful relevance to the opinion the Commissioner is required to form when classifying an inmate in accordance with clause 22 of the Regulation.  
For those reasons, I am persuaded that so far as the record reveals, the Commissioner's decision entailed error and should be set aside. Accordingly it is not necessary to consider Mr Davison's alternative ground that the decision entailed irrationality or unreasonableness as comprehended in the decision in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited versus Wednesbury <case>; [[1948] 1 KB 223.]  
Decision of the Review Council 
On 19 October 2010 the Review Council advised the Parole Authority that it was not appropriate in the public interest for the plaintiff to be considered for release on parole. As already noted, a consequence of that decision is that, pursuant to [s 135(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s135.html) of the Act, the Parole Authority must not make a parole order except in exceptional circumstances.  
The decision was the exercise of the function of the Review Council under [s 197(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s197.html) of the Act. A list of the matters the Council must consider when exercising its functions under that section is contained in [s 198](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s198.html) of the Act. The matters listed include "any other matter that the Review Council considers to be relevant" [(s 198(2A)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s198.html) of the Act).  
The decision was recorded in the following terms:  "Council has been consistently of the view that DAVISON needs to address his offending behaviour.
 
Council notes that DAVISON has been assessed as ineligible for VOTP but that he has been assessed as eligible for the CUBIT Deniers Program. Council believes that it is essential that he complete this program before being considered for parole.
 
Therefore, Council is of the view that it is not appropriate for DAVISON to be considered for release to parole at this time.
 
In preparing this advice the Review council has had regard to the matters to be considered under [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s197.html) and [198](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s198.html) of the [Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/).
The first basis for challenging the decision was an alleged failure to take relevant considerations into account. Without derogating from the careful and comprehensive submissions prepared on behalf of Mr Davison, this challenge may be summarised in the proposition that the Council was obliged, under the rubric "any other matter that the Review Council considers to be relevant", to take into account the fact that the Deniers program was not available for at least nine months and the fact that Mr Davison could be assessed for a sex offender program in the community organised by the ACT Corrective Services if his parole was transferred there. It was acknowledged that the decision recorded that the Council had "had regard" to the matters to be considered under [sections 197](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s197.html) and [198](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s198.html). It was submitted, however, that it may be inferred from the advice actually given that Council did not in fact take those matters into account.  
The plaintiff's written submissions provide a compelling critique of the advice of the Review Council by reference to the circumstances on the strength of which it might have reached a different conclusion. However, as submitted on behalf of the defendants, much of what has been put in that respect amounts in effect to an invitation to the Court to review the merits of the decision. That, of course, is beyond the permissible scope of my task.  
The determinant as to what was required to be taken into account by the Review Council under [section 198(2A)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s198.html) was the Council's own consideration as to what was relevant. The weight to be placed on any individual consideration was a matter for the Council.  
The plaintiff submitted that the fact that he had not acknowledged a sexual component to his offending and had not participated in a sexual offender program in custody should not have been the sole determinative factor. Ms Burgess relied in that respect upon the decision of Johnson J in DCU to which I have already referred and the decision of Adams J in Galli versus NSW State Parole Authority  <case> at <case>.  
As explained in the decision of Mott referred to by Johnson J in DCU , there will be circumstances in which a refusal to acknowledge guilt (or a sexual component to the offence) may be regarded as a relevant consideration in assessing an application for parole. The relevance of such a circumstance to the question whether an inmate should be considered for release on parole is perhaps more remote.  
It is apparent from the body of the report that the Review Council regarded the plaintiff's acceptance into the Deniers program, including the likely starting date, to be a relevant consideration. The more difficult matter to discern is the extent to which the latter consideration was taken into account. The report recorded the fact that the program was not anticipated to be available until the middle of 2011. Although it is perhaps not the conclusion every person would reach, it seems to me to have been open to the Review Council to take a hard-line approach on that issue in the present case. The difficulty is that the reasons for decision reveal no analysis of that complexity of the matter, an issue to which I will return.  
I am not persuaded that the conclusion of the Review Council that completion of the Deniers program was "essential" before parole would be considered in itself necessarily demonstrates that the Council overlooked, as a relevant consideration, the likely delay until the commencement of that program.  
For the same reasons, I do not think that it can be concluded that the decision reflected the inflexible application of a policy that sex offenders will not be recommended for release on parole if they are "untreated" in the sense that they have not participated in one of the department's specified sex offender courses. As noted in the submissions on behalf of the defendants, the lengthy history of material before the Review Council revealed a legitimate basis for concern that the plaintiff's rehabilitation as a sex offender had not progressed to a satisfactory extent.  
That brings me, however, to Mr Davison's separate contention that the Review Council gave inadequate reasons for its decision. It was submitted that it was necessary for the Council to indicate why, taking into account the statutory criteria and other relevant matters, it was essential for the plaintiff to do the Deniers program in custody before being considered for release on parole. It was further submitted that it was necessary for the Council to explain its decision in the light of delay in the commencement of the program in custody, which would inevitably lead to the plaintiff's spending at least another year in custody in order to complete it.  
The defendants accepted that the relevant principles were as stated in the plaintiff's submissions. In particular, it was accepted that a duty to give reasons is necessarily implied by the terms of [sections 197](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s197.html) and [198](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cosa1999348/s198.html) of the Act, since part of the Review Council's statutory duty is to provide advice to the Parole Authority and its advice has important legal consequences for serious offenders.  
The defendants accepted, further, that the content of the requirement is as stated by Mahony JA in Soulemezis versus Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited [(1987) 10 NSWLR 247] at 273. However, they submitted that the content of the obligation is also informed in the present case by the terms of the statute. It was submitted that the Review Council's "audience" is the Parole Authority, whose members will have a working understanding of the prison system, the kinds of rehabilitative programs offered in prison and the statutory criteria that bind the Review Council.  
That submission overlooks an important aspect of the obligation to provide reasons, namely the need to apprise Mr Davison of the explanation for the decision made. In my view, there is force in the contention that the reasons were inadequate to explain why it was considered essential for Mr Davison to complete the Deniers program in custody when that would extend by so long the period before which he could even be considered for parole.  
I accept that the decision had to be read in the context of the lengthy history of administration of Mr Davison's sentence. However, the sands were shifting. The identification of the fact that the only program for which he was eligible was one which would not be available for nine months, coupled with the fact that the end of Mr Davison's sentence was hurtling forward, in my view called for a discrete analysis. The decision does not reveal whether that analysis was in fact undertaken and, if it was, what considerations lead the Council to conclude that the completion of a program that was then unavailable was nonetheless "essential" before it would give its recommendation that Mr Davison be considered for release on parole over five years after the completion of his minimum term.  
I am persuaded that the decision entailed error only in that respect.  
Having regard to the obvious importance of these matters to Mr Davison, I consider it appropriate to exercise my discretion to set aside both decisions. It was acknowledged on behalf of the defendants that, in those circumstances, there would be no need for me to determine the challenge to the decisions of the Parole Authority, it being inevitable that those decisions would arise for fresh consideration in that event.  
The orders are:  * (1) That the plaintiff have leave under [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/s4.html) of the [Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fpa1981240/) to institute these proceedings. * (2) That the decision of the first defendant made on 13 October 2010 not to reduce the plaintiff's security classification from C1 to C2 and not to change the plaintiff's centre of placement be set aside. * (3) That the decision of the second defendant made on 19 October 2010 to advise the third defendant that it was not appropriate for Mr Davison to be considered for release t parole be set aside.  * * *
