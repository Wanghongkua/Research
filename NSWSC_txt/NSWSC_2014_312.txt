JUDGMENT
These proceedings commenced on 30 January 2014, naming Tony Osman as a defendant. An unexplained wealth order was sought against him pursuant to [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), with orders under [s 31D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s31d.html) that he and another person Mohammed Osman be examined before a registrar of the Court concerning Tony Osman's affairs. Some other ancillary orders were sought.
The Plaintiff now applies ex parte by Notice of Motion to amend the proceedings to name Mohammed Osman as a Second Defendant to the proceedings and to ask for restraining orders under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act. Ancillary orders in relation to those orders are also sought in the Notice of Motion.
The Notice of Motion is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 20 March 2014. Mr Spark, who is an "authorised officer" as defined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that Mohammed Osman has engaged in a serious crime-related activity or serious crime-related activities, being: the supply of a prohibited drug of an amount larger than or equal to the commercial quantity contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/); supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to [s 25A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25a.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/); and supplying a prohibited drug of an amount greater than the indictable quantity contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/). Those offences are all "serious criminal offences" as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in para 7 of his affidavit. They consist in chief of Mr Spark's reading of the police fact sheet in relation to charges against Mohammed Osman. Mr Spark forwarded an email to the named author of the fact sheet to ask him: if he drafted the fact sheet; if to the best of his knowledge and belief the contents were true and correct; and whether the fact sheet that was prepared was based on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation described in the fact sheet. The police officer concerned, Constable Liam Daley, replied in the affirmative to those questions.
I have read the fact sheet. The matters that are set out in that fact sheet, if proved, are sufficient to show that Mohammed Osman has committed each of the offences charged.
Mr Spark also annexes to his affidavit a search of the COPS database showing that Mr Mohammed Osman has been charged with the offences that I have referred to. [Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. By reason of what is contained in the fact sheet, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion.
Mr Spark also suspects that the interest in the property of Tony Osman, the First Defendant, in the Audi motor vehicle is "serious crime derived property" within the meaning of [s 9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s9.html) of the Act because of the serious crime-related activity or activities of Mohammed Osman, the Second Defendant. 
Mr Spark deposes in paragraph 11 of his affidavit to the basis on which he holds his suspicion. In short, it consists of a number of documents which show purchases of the Audi motor vehicle (said to be the property concerned) together with a statement of an employee of the motor dealer where the Audi was purchased. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion in relation to Mr Tony Osman is held on reasonable grounds.
I am further satisfied, as [s 10A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) requires, from the material annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit that the defendants are domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the orders are sought is situated in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to the defendants before an order is made if the Court thinks fit. The First Defendant has filed a notice of appearance on 14 March 2014. However, no notice has been given to him of the present application. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred, I do not consider that either defendant should be given notice of the application before the orders are made. The defendants have available to them the rights set out in [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) if they wish to have the orders set aside or varied. 
I consider in all the circumstances that it is appropriate that leave be given to amend the summons both by adding Mohammed Osman, also known as Mohammed Osmankerin, as well as the other amendments that are proposed to the summons.
Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages, the giving of which by its solicitor Ms Goh is noted, and considering the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 20 March 2014, I make the orders set out in paras 1 to 4, 6 to 8, 11 and 12 and I grant the leave and liberty set out in paras 5, 9 and 10 of the draft order provided to me.
