REGINA versus Katy Rachelle BOSKOVITZ 
JUDGMENT 
SPERLING J: As at September 1993, the applicant stood charged with offences under <case> of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). Having regard to charges withdrawn and to be withdrawn at that stage, there were in effect, twenty one charges then on foot. Following a "paper committal" in September 1993, the twenty one charges were subsumed in an indictment containing eleven counts. 
Relevantly, I can then come forward to 1998. On 13 March 1998, an ex-officio indictment was presented containing four counts in substitution for the previous indictment. The new counts charged offences under <case>.

Section 178BA provided as follows.
 "(1) Whosever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

In subsection (1) - "deception" means deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including - a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the or of any other person; and ..." 
Section 178BB provided as follows.
 "Whosever, with intent to obtain for himself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years." 
It may be noted immediately that facts which satisfy an element or elements of s 178BB can also satisfy an element or elements of <case>. In particular, knowingly making or being concerned in the making of a false statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage within the meaning of <case> could constitute a deception as defined in <case>.

On 22 April 1998, an amended notice of motion, filed on 16 April 1998, came before Shillington DCJ, to whom the trial had been allocated. The orders sought were that the date for trial, fixed for 27 April 1998, be vacated, and that the proceedings be permanently stayed. Shillington DCJ postponed the date for trial but, by judgment delivered on 23 April 1998, refused a permanent stay.

This court now has before it an amended notice of appeal dated 4 May 1998 (filed on 20 May 1998) challenging the refusal of a permanent stay.

Leave to appeal is sought and is required: [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) , [s
F(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) 
The applicant asserted before Shillington DCJ and before this Court that the new charges are different from those on foot at the time of the committal, that they are in breach of an agreement or arrangement made with the Crown at that time, and that the applicant is prejudiced by the change in the Crown's approach.

At the hearing before Shillington DCJ in April 1998, the Court had before it an affidavit by the applicant's solicitor, Mr G Boskovitz, sworn on 9 April , deposing to communications with representatives of the DPP prior to the applicant's consent to a "paper committal". Shillington DCJ proceeded on the basis that this account of the communications was correct. It was to the effect that no "further" or "other" charges would be laid. It was said that the applicant had foregone her right to cross-examine witnesses at the committal hearing in reliance upon that assurance. I proceed on those assumptions.

The difficulty for the applicant is that it had to be conceded on the hearing before this court that evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of each of the new charges could, if accepted by a jury, establish an element or elements of at least one of the charges on foot at the time of the committal. Nor could it be disputed by the applicant that, at the time of the committal proceedings, statements had been served which included such evidence.

In this context, the new charges were not relevantly different from those on foot at the time of the committal. They were not relevantly "further" or "other" charges in the context of the communications between the applicant's solicitor and representatives of the DPP in 1993.

The applicant was driven to the submission that, in the wider ambit of the charges on foot at the time of the committal, the applicant's legal advisers could not reasonably have anticipated that the alleged representations now relied upon by the Crown would ultimately be the focus of the Crown case. As things stood at the time of the committal, it was said, the applicant was faced with a wide ranging Crown case and the prospect of a very lengthy committal. It was argued that, if what is now the situation had been known at the time, the applicant would not have foregone cross-examination of those witnesses whose statements had then been served and whose evidence is now seen to be at the chore of the Crown case in its present form.

It was also argued (somewhat inconsistently, I have to say) that the applicant had reason to believe at the time of the committal that the Crown case was essentially a documentary one, so that cross-examination of witnesses was not thought to have been necessary.

These submissions do not answer the unanswerable proposition that, at the time of the committal proceedings, the appellant was on notice of a case she now has to meet. The new charges are not relevantly different. They are not in breach of any agreement of arrangement made with the Crown. If the applicant is disadvantaged because the applicant's legal advisers made a decision not to cross-examine witnesses at the earlier time which they would not have made had the Crown case then been more selective, that is not a prejudice which could provide a basis for a permanent stay of the proceedings. The idea that criminal proceedings should be stayed because they have been narrowed is anathema to considerations of policy and irrelevant to considerations of fairness. I am not satisfied, in any event, that the applicant has been so disadvantaged in view of the readiness of the trial judge to allow a Basha enquiry.

In my opinion, there could only be one result in the application before
Shillington DCJ and that was for the stay to be refused. In these circumstances, it would be wasteful to examine his Honour's reasons for decision. If this court were to exercise its discretion afresh, the result would, in my opinion, have to be the same.

The application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.
