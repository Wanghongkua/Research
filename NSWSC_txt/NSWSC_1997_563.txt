JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In this case, the lease has come to an end. The lessee seeks to say that because of an unequivocal representation by a representative of the landlord in February 1997, which the lessee had acted upon, it should be permitted to remain in the premises after the end of the lease and until its deed of arrangement had run its course. The words used were "We wish you well through your administration. You will have our full support." It does not seem to my mind that one finds in those words any such unequivocal representation. The words are friendly words, but they are very very vague and full support could mean support at a meeting of creditors. It could mean support through the term of the lease or many other possibilities. 
I cannot see how what was said could amount to a representation of permission for the tenant to remain in the premises until its deed of arrangement had run its full course. Even if it did go that far, nothing was said as to the terms and conditions pursuant to which the occupation would continue. Accordingly, I will not grant any interim relief.

As this is the only point involved in the whole suit, the proper order is the suit is dismissed with costs. The exhibits may be returned.
