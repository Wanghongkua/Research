JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: In these proceedings, the defendant seeks an order for a mediation conducted by a private mediator to be agreed upon by the parties.
The plaintiff's instructions to his counsel are that he has concerns as to the holding of mediation due to the concerns he has articulated in the particulars of aggravated damages in the proceedings. In particular, the plaintiff is anxious to avoid any form of personal confrontation with the defendant and states that he would not wish to be in the same room as him.
In my view, those concerns ought to be able to be accommodated by a private mediator.
I propose to order the mediation in the terms of the short minutes handed up.
I note the plaintiff's concerns.
I note my apprehension that mediation ought to be able to be conducted in a manner that accommodates those concerns and I note, finally, that in the event that my apprehension on that issue proves to be ill-founded, the plaintiff may exercise the liberty to restore the proceedings to the List with a view to varying the mediation orders.
I would also note that under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s27.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) , a party ordered to participate in mediation is under a duty to participate in good faith in the mediation.
On that basis, I make order 3 in the short minutes of order handed up by Ms Barnett.
