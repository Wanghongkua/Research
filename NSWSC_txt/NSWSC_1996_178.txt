ALISA GAY BEVERLEY V MATO ALEKSIC & ANOR /93 
FRIDAY 7 JUNE 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
DUNFORD, J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings pursuant to the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) the plaintiff claims damages for personal injuries allegedly suffered by her on 18 May 1991 when the motor vehicle in which she was a passenger left the road at high speed, and collided with one, and possibly two trees, in Horsley Park. The plaintiff was apparently thrown from the vehicle and came to rest some 50 metres from the vehicle.

Liability has been admitted and the matter has proceeded for assessment of damages only.

The plaintiff was born on 23 November 1972 and so was aged about 18 and a half years at the time of the accident and is now about 23 and a half years.

As a result of the accident, the plaintiff suffered a closed head traumatic brain injury with about ten days post traumatic amnesia, although a CT brain scan was reported as normal.

She also suffered a Chance fracture of the two lumbar vertebrae, cracked fracture at the second vertebra, a mesenteric tear and retroperitoneal haematoma, lacerations and abrasions to both knees, her right hand, forearm and back with some glass imbedded, and a ligamentous strain to her right knee.

She was taken to Fairfield Hospital where her comparatively minor wounds were attended to and a laparotomy performed to repair the tear.

She was then transported to Westmead Hospital where she came under the care of
Dr Cummine for her orthopaedic injuries and on 31 May she was placed in a thoraco-lumbar jacket. She was discharged from hospital on 4 June 1991, and she removed the thoraco-lumbar jacket shortly before 10 July 1991.

Since then her condition has gradually improved, but as a result of the brain injury she was left with headaches, diminution in memory and concentration, a reduced ability to cope with stress and a loss of tolerance and self-control, moodiness and occasional aphasia, most of which conditions are gradually improving but are likely to continue to some degree.

She is also left with ongoing low back pain, occasional neck pain, some laxity in the right knee, an inability to stand for long periods or lift heavy weights and extensive scarring to her abdomen, back, right elbow and left knee which causes her considerable embarrassment and inhibits her wearing a swimming costume and going to the beach, and there is the possibility of degenerative arthritis in her lumbar spine as she gets older. She has had counselling and physiotherapy and will probably need some of each in the future.

I found the plaintiff to be an open and refreshingly frank and honest witness with no hint of exaggeration, and I accept her description of her continuing problems.

I am satisfied that the plaintiff's ability to lead a normal life has been significantly impaired by the injury and I assess such loss at 45 per cent of a most severe case, and accordingly allow $105,750 for non-economic loss.
Although Exhibit G only shows a total of $6,194 it was agreed during final addresses that the out of pocket expenses to date amount to $8,220 and I allow this amount. I also allow $2,000 as a cushion for future medical, physiotherpeutic and counselling expenses.

The plaintiff claims that as a result of her injuries she had time off from her employment with KFC Limited and lost her prospects of promotion with that employer and that she is presently unfit for such work. A lot of oral evidence was given about the hours she had worked from time to time, and schedules were produced about current gross wage rates, average weekly earnings, and notional calculations. However no records from KFC Limited were tendered showing actual hours worked or wages earned, nor was any person put forward as a comparable employee. Accordingly, the evidence is somewhat incomplete.

The plaintiff commenced work at KFC Grafton part-time while still at school in late 1988 and continued on after leaving school in 1989 when in Year 11, and by early 1991 was working what was described as permanent part-time, consisting of up to 25 hours per week, or according to Mrs Cussen, the then manager, anything from 20 to 32 hours a week.

She was apparently a most satisfactory employee and worked to become a shift supervisor, working full-time, the badge of which rank was, and presumably still is, a blue shirt. She also wished to move away from Grafton so Mrs
Cussen arranged for her to be transferred to the Wetherill Park outlet to work full-time and undergo on the job training as a shift supervisor. The plaintiff commenced at Wetherill Park in about March 1991 and Mrs Cussen, whose opinion
I accept, believed she would have reached shift supervisor status.

Notwithstanding her severe injuries, the plaintiff returned to work on 21 July , a mere ten weeks after the accident. She returned to Wetherill Park and then to Liverpool, initially on light duties, but she only obtained limited hours work and so returned to Grafton where Mrs Cussen re-employed her as a part-time employee working about 13 and a half hours a week, and she was given some assistance when lifting was involved.

In February 1992 her employment status was changed to casual, but she resigned on 18 May 1992 because of headaches and back pain and stress in coping with customers, although Mr McGrath (who succeeded Mrs Cussen as manager) regarded her as satisfactory notwithstanding that he was aware of her head and back injury and tolerated her mood swings, the fact that she did not handle pressure well and tended to get short with customers.

After physiotherapy and rehabilitation counselling she resumed work with KFC, originally on three hours a week and extra hours when available, and on 31
August 1993 this was increased to nine hours a week plus extra hours on occasions, but the plaintiff said she would have been prepared to try more hours if it had been available. She continued to find it stressful, particularly when working on the drive-through service and she also had headaches and back pain.

She continued working there until December 1995 when she resigned and moved to
Kurri Kurri. Her reasons for leaving included the stress, head and back aches associated with her work, but also other stress not described which made her want to leave Grafton, and also a desire to live with her boyfriend who was and is living in Kurri Kurri and working at Sandgate near Newcastle.

She has not worked since but is actively seeking work in a shop, bakery or such like but not in a fast-food establishment such as KFC because of the difficulty she has coping with stress. She says she wants to work and within reason is prepared to try anything to see how she goes.

I am satisfied that if she had not been injured she would have completed her supervisor training course, obtained her blue shirt and had regular full-time employment with KFC as a shift supervisor until such time as she decided to move on to other comparable or more remunerative employment.

I am also satisfied as a result of the accident and her partial loss of memory and concentration and inability to cope with stress she became incapable of completing the supervisor training.

I am satisfied she was capable of working in a KFC environment where she was known and tolerated for up to about 13 and a half hours a week, but is not suitable for employment in such an establishment where she was not previously known before her accident and her difficulties understood.

She is capable of working in a shop, bakery or similar establishment provided she is not subject to constant pressure and stress and has an opportunity to rest her back from time to time. She would also be able to do various forms of process work provided she was not required to lift heavy weights and not required to be on her feet constantly, but was able to move around from time to time.

In the tax year ended June 1991 she earned $7,821.24 less $279.28 tax, a net figure of $7,541.96. Assuming she was paid only two weeks sick pay after her accident on 18 May 1991 that represents an income for 48 weeks at $157.12 per week, but it must be remembered that whereas she had been a part-time employee in Grafton, she was, as I understand it, a full-time employee at Wetherill
Park.

Exhibit E which was admitted by consent shows her net weekly wage at the time of the accident as $215.05 per week. This is within a few dollars of the rates shown for a permanent full-time 18 year old employee at that time in Exhibit
C, and is consistent with the plaintiff's evidence that she was earning slightly over $200 net per week at the time. I accept $215 as her weekly net rate of pay at the time of the accident.

If not injured she would have earned as a full-time employee and by reference to Exhibit C while allowing for percentage wage increases as she got older the following amounts:- .05.91 to 24.7.91 (10 weeks) at 70% of $353.10 $2,471.70 .07.91 to 24.10.91 (13 weeks) at 70% of $361.90 $3,293.29 .10.91 to 22.11.91 (5 weeks) at 70% of $369.20 $1,292.20 .11.91 to 24.4.92 (22 weeks) at 80% of $369.20 $6,497.92 .4.92 to 24.10.92 (26 weeks) at 80% of $376.50 $7,831.20 .10.92 to 22.11.92 (4 weeks) at 80% of $383.80 $1,228.16 .11.92 to 22.11.93 (52 weeks) at 80% of $391.80 $16,298.88 .11.93 to 19.1.94 (8 weeks) at 90% of $391.80 $2,820.96 .1.94 to 22.11.94 (44 weeks) at 90% of $391.80 $15,515.28 .11.94 to 12.4.95 (20 weeks) at $391.80 $7,836.00 .4.95 to 30.4.96 (54 weeks) at $399.80 $21,589.20 .4.96 to 7.6.96 (5 weeks) at $407.80 $2,039.00 $88,713.79 
Deduct 15% for tax $75,406.00 
Less actual earnings $17,916.00 $57,490.00 
There is a need however to make a further deduction because of the move to
Kurri Kurri and her associated resignation from KFC Limited was not substantially due to the accident, and she could have continued at KFC Grafton earning approximately $13 net per hour for 9 hours a week for 23 weeks less tax, say $2,290. Accordingly for past economic loss to date I allow $55,200.

The current rate of pay for a full-time employee is $407.80 on which tax is about $70.65 which leaves a net figure of about $337 a week. The plaintiff has a residual earning capacity and its extent is difficult to assess.

She is prepared to try full-time work in a shop or bakery and believes she could do it if not required to work under pressure as in a fast-food outlet, but this does restrict her somewhat. I believe she would have some difficulty as a shop assistant, continuing to suffer back pain if she was required to stand all day and this may reduce her hours of work. Doing the best I can, I assess her loss of earning capacity as somewhere between about 33 and 40 per cent of $337, say $130 net a week.

Mr Levy submitted I should allow 41 years, but that would be to age 65 and the
Court of Appeal in Baldwin versus Lisicic (unreported, 30 March 1993) has reaffirmed that in the absence of evidence to the contrary it is appropriate to assess the loss of earning capacity for a female plaintiff to age 60.

Accordingly I allow $130 a week for 36 years at five per cent per annum which comes to $115,024, and to allow for vicissitudes, including the possibility of time out of the work force to have a family, I discount this by 25 per cent, resulting in a net figure of $92,020.

The defendant's counsel wishes to obtain instructions on the plaintiff's claim for the loss of the benefits of past and future superannuation contributions by an employer, and there may be submissions to be made in relation to interest and costs; subject to those matters the plaintiff's damages may be summarised as follows: 
Non-economic loss $105,750 
Out of pocket expenses $8,220 
Future treatment 2,000 
Past loss of earning capacity $55,200 
Loss of future earning capacity $92,020 $263,190 (Counsel advised that it had been agreed that the plaintiff's loss of the benefit of employer contributions to superannuation should be assessed at $3550 for the past and $4,826 for the future, making a total judgment of $271,566, and there was no claim for interest. Mr Petty sought an order that the plaintiff pay the costs of the adjournment on 29 May 1996 and that there be no order for the costs of 31 May and 3 June 1996. Discussion ensued).

This matter was originally listed for hearing at Grafton on Wednesday 29 May last and would have been reached that afternoon in the ordinary course.
However, Mr Petty, counsel for the defendant, applied for an adjournment to the next sittings on the grounds that the defendants' lawyers had only recently been informed for the first time that the plaintiff had ceased her employment at KFC Grafton in December 1995, and accordingly they wished to interview an additional witness from that establishment.

I refused the application to adjourn the matter to the next sittings, but did direct that it not proceed before Friday 31 May 1996, to give the defendants' lawyers the opportunity they sought. In the meantime another matter which lasted almost three days commenced on the Friday and this matter was not reached until Tuesday 4 June. Mr Petty therefore seeks an order for the costs of Wednesday 29 May, and an order that the plaintiff not recover costs for
Friday 31 May or Monday 3 June.

In my view the defendant was justified in making the application on Wednesday th, and should have the costs of the application and the costs of that day.
However, the fact that another matter took its place ahead of this case and proceeded for nearly three days is, I am afraid, part of "the luck of the draw", and I will not make any special orders in respect of the costs of the
Friday or the Monday.

I direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff for $271,566. I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, save and except the costs of Wednesday, 29 May 1996, including the costs of the adjournment application on that day, in respect of which I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs.
