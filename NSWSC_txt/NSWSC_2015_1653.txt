EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: This is an application for leave to file and serve on the defendant's former solicitor a subpoena for production of documents, the application being made because it requires short service to be permitted.
The application is supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Lee, the plaintiff's solicitor, which explains the relevance of the documents sought to be produced to the court for a hearing which is due to commence on 10 November.
I have received today a written outline of submissions from the defendant. Having considered what is sought to be subpoenaed and the circumstances in which the need to subpoena the documents has arisen, I am satisfied that justice requires that the leave sought be granted.
Accordingly, I order that the plaintiff have leave to file and serve on Kennedy Australasia Pty Limited by 6 pm on 5 November 2015 a subpoena for production of documents in the form provided to the Court on 5 November 2015, which I will now mark MFI 1, such subpoena to be returnable at 10 am on 10 November 2015.
