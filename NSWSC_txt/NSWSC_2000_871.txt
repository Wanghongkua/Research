THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
FRIDAY 25 AUGUST 2000 /1990 - RE G 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: G was badly injured in a motor car accident in NSW on 16
October 1984. On 8 June 1990 Powell J declared that G was a person incapable of managing her affairs and committed the management of her estate to the
Protective Commissioner.
 Some time ago G removed herself to Victoria. By administrative arrangement with the Protective Commissioner of NSW, G's Victorian affairs were managed by
State Trustees Limited of Victoria which is the appropriate person to administer such affairs in Victoria on an informal basis.
 On 8 February 2000, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal made an order that State Trustees Limited be appointed as administrator of the estate of G pursuant to the Victorian [Guardianship and Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/gaaa1986304/). G has requested, and the Protective Commissioner is satisfied that it is a proper request, that her affairs now only be handled by State Trustees Limited.
 The problem is how to bring about this state of affairs. It has been suggested that registration of the Victorian order in NSW might be effective, but for reasons which I gave in EMG versus Guardianship and Administration Board of Victoria  <case> this is probably not effective to deal with any property in NSW. [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/gaaa1986304/s66.html) and [67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/gaaa1986304/s67.html) do not appear to be appropriate. [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s34.html) and [35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/s35.html) of the [Protected Estates Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pea1983200/) cannot be utilised because G remains a protected person.
 It seems to me that the appropriate way to deal with the problem with the least inconvenience is merely to revoke the appointment of the Protective
Commissioner as Manager and appoint State Trustees Ltd as Manager without security. I so order.
