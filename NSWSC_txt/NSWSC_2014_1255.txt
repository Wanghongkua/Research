Catchwords: 
REAL PROPERTY - Co-owners - Statutory power of sale - Application by bankruptcy trustees of one co-owner - Whether bankruptcy trustees ought be appointed as trustees of sale - whether costs of trustess relevant when considering the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy as trustee for sale - whether mortgagee ought be notified  
JUDGMENT
This is an application by the trustee in bankruptcy of one co-owner of residential property in Belfield. The defendants are the other two co-owners. 
The plaintiff needs to realise all the bankrupt's property for the best price he can get, and so needs to be able to sell the whole of the property, and for that purpose needs to have trustees for sale appointed. It is far preferable commercially for trustees in bankruptcy to take this attitude, rather than what has happened in some regrettable cases in the past, to sell the bankrupt's interest to a loan shark. 
Under [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) each co-owner has the right to approach the court for partition or sale, and although the word "may" is used with respect to the court's powers under the section, except in very special cases, any applicant/co-owner is entitled to an order under the section almost as a right, see, for instance, Re Fettell [(1952) 52 SR 221] I need not go further because after sensible discussion between counsel, the parties have agreed on a consent order. However it is still a matter for the court to consider the appropriateness of the trustees. In the instant case one of the proposed trustees is a partner of the trustee in bankruptcy.
In another connection, I have said in Dixon versus Roy (1991) 5 BPR 11, 655 that as the trustee must be impartial between the co-owners it is inadvisable for trustees to retain the same solicitor, and it would be inadvisable, where there is a dispute between the co-owners, that a trustee be appointed who would be perceived to be partial to one party or the other. 
Mr A Spencer of counsel, who appeared for the plaintiff, recognised that he would be asked questions about the appointment of the trustee in bankruptcy's partner, and so referred me to the decision of Brereton J in Harb versus Harb <case>, where his Honour analyses the obligations and duties of a trustee, and indicates that there would not be a problem in this area even if the trustee in bankruptcy himself was appointed as one of the trustees. See also the decision of Davies J in Rambaldi versus Woodward <case> I agree with that view.
The other matter that impinges on whether the partner of the trustee in bankruptcy should be appointed is cost. No matter who is the trustee, it will be a commercial person, and will be entitled to remuneration. The hourly rate for partners in one of the leading firms of liquidating accountants, as is the present plaintiff, may well bill at $550 an hour for a partner, and proportionately less for lower ranking members of staff. If a trustee company were appointed there would be a statutory rate of commission plus expenses, and it would usually be useful to know, when considering the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy, whether the estate would be saved by having him appointed rather than a less expensive operator. One would also have to be careful to make sure that there weren't any extra expenses, such as often occurs when there is a 'Chinese wall', or the like, in a solicitor's office, where the clerk on one side of the wall charges the client to confer with the clerk on the other side of the wall. However in the present case the parties are agreed that the appointment be made, and that the hourly remuneration rates of the plaintiff should be permitted, so that I need go no further. 
I should note that, whilst it is not mandatory, it is good practice to notify any mortgagees of the making of the application. Those mortgagees will in any event have to be contacted for a payout figure and it may be that despite the fact that their interest is preserved under the order, they may be affected by the order.
Accordingly, I make orders 1 to 8 in the summons. Order that the costs of the plaintiff be deducted from the sale of the proceeds of sale. By consent I stay all of those orders until 9 October 2014, and in amplification of order 8, order that a writ of possession may issue on or after 7 November 2014.
