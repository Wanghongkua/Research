Barlile Corporation Ltd versus National Nominees Pty Ltd & Ors /95 
Monday, 29 January 1995 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is, in substance, an application by the Australian Securities Commission (the ASC), which has today intervened in these proceedings, to abridge the time for service of an application until tomorrow morning - the application being in substance for an injunction restraining Chadwell Ltd and Belonus Pty Ltd (who are not yet parties to the proceedings) from exercising any rights whatsoever attaching to any shares in the plaintiff Barlile Corporation Ltd, in which they have a beneficial interest. According to what has been said this afternoon, those two companies, Chadwell and Mercer, are associated with the fifth defendant in the proceedings, Mr Paul Eagland. The occasion for the proposed application for that relief is that an extraordinary general meeting of the plaintiff company, which was requisitioned on 30 November 1995, is to be held tomorrow, 30 January 1996. The basis for the contemplated order is, as I understand it, alleged breaches by Chadwell and Belonus and Mr Eagland of s.615 of the Corporations Law in respect of the acquisition of shares in the plaintiff company by Chadwell and Belonus, or other companies as nominees for those companies. It is said that there is evidence from which it might be inferred that Mr Eagland and associates of his might, if they obtained control of the plaintiff company, utilise assets of it in a way which it is said would be contrary to the interests of that company. The evidence from which it is said that inference may be available is voluminous in the extreme and there has been no opportunity to examine it in detail either by the Court or, for that matter, by the representatives of Mr Eagland and, necessarily, the companies Chadwell and Belonus.

The meeting in question was requisitioned, as I understand it, by Mr Eagland.
The material on which the ASC proposes to rely in seeking the contemplated order was, so far as appears, material that was available to it, or at least to the plaintiff company itself, with which the ASC was relevantly in communication and in the same interest, at latest it would seem, at the beginning of December 1995. Accordingly, there has been enormous delay between then and this afternoon (and I should note that this application was made at about four o'clock this afternoon); the evidence relating to what has occurred during that period suggests that for a substantial part of it, until some time in the second week of January 1996, the company itself was contemplating applying for some sort of relief in relation to tomorrow's meeting, and the
ASC only started making its own preparations when the company itself decided not to do so.

It has been pointed out by Mr Perram for the ASC that the ASC has wider responsibilities than simply to the company itself, specifically to the investing public and particularly to those who have invested in the plaintiff company.

Taking all that into account, it still appears to me that the delay which has occurred and the severe prejudice which is likely to be suffered as a result of that delay by Mr Eagland and by Chadwell and by Belonus are such that the
Court should not accede to the ASC's application to bring the substance of this matter on tomorrow morning - even if it were possible for a Court tomorrow morning to examine the great volume of material which is going to be, apparently, relied upon in support of this application, let alone expect the defendants, who have had very little prior notice of either the application or this material, to fully absorb it, or sufficiently absorb it to deal with such an application brought on tomorrow. This seems to me to be a clear case where the delay in making the application is so great, having regard to the complex nature of the application, what was known many weeks ago and to the relative prejudice which affects either side, to render it necessary to refrain from giving the Court's support to what is proposed. At one stage I contemplated the possibility that by agreement the meeting in question might be adjourned, but it seems that that is not likely to be able to be done on terms which are acceptable to all sides and I see no reason why an adjournment should be forced on Chadwell and Belonus, which may well seriously operate to their detriment.

Accordingly, I propose to refuse the leave which is sought and I think it is only necessary to order that the notice of motion filed in Court today be dismissed with costs. That is the order I make.
