EQUITY DIVISION

WEDNESDAY 30 DECEMBER 2009  /09 CLIFFSHAW PTY LIMITED versus BETOHUWISA INVESTMENTS PTY LIMITED 
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT In proceedings between Cliffshaw Pty Limited and Betohuwisa Investments Pty
Limited an interlocutory injunction was sought restraining Betohuwisa from mortgaging, encumbering or transferring special leases transferred to it by the Old Kiama Wharf Company Pty Limited.
 The leases had been sold by Cliffshaw to Old Kiama for which it obtained a judgment on 21 March 2007 in default of payment of the purchase price in the amount of $l,270,257.53. The judgment gave Cliffshaw leave to issue a writ of possession forthwith. That did not happen until some two years later on l5
July 2009. An interim stay of the order was obtained and thereafter Cliffshaw agreed to an order for a permanent stay.
 Cliffshaw alleges that it has a lien over the leases held by Betohuwisa for the unpaid purchase price of its sale of the leases to Old Kiama. It has not been explained to me how a lien arises in circumstances where possession was given up and a writ for possession was, with the consent of Cliffshaw, stayed.
 It is also submitted on Cliffshaw's behalf that the sale price of the leases from Old Kiama to Betohuwisa was at an undervalue. The sale price was $475,000 of which vendor finance secured by a mortgage was given by Old Kiama in the amount of $400,000.
 There is no suggestion in the summons that a claim is being made in fraud with respect to that transfer under the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) A voluntary administrator was appointed to Old Kiama and, at the insistence of Cliffshaw, replaced by a new voluntary administrator. Both administrators were seized of the need to investigate whether the transfer of the leases to
Betohuwisa was at proper value.
 In these circumstances, I do not see that there is a prima facie case as the matter is thus far pleaded, and the balance of convenience would favour allowing the replaced administrator to investigate the question of value. If at some subsequent stage proceedings are commenced alleging fraud under the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s37a.html) or otherwise, Cliffshaw may have difficulty in establishing that damages are not a sufficient remedy. It has not established that proposition to my satisfaction in these proceedings.
 The injunctions that I granted yesterday will expire this evening.
 I dismiss the summons.
