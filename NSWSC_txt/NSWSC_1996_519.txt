Regina versus F [1996] NSWSC 519 (28 October 1996) 
REGINA versus F /93 October 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
HUNT CJ at CL, IRELAND J, BELL AJ 
CATCHWORDS: Criminal law and procedure - Regina versus Hamzy [(1994) 74 A Crim R 341] 
RESULT:Appeal allowed 
The recent decision of the High Court in Walsh versus Tattersall (2 October 1996, unreported) has not overruled the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina versus Hamzy [(1994) 74 A Crim R 341], which permits the Crown - subject to any question of unfairness in the particular case - to charge a person with supply in the one count where it is relying upon more than one act of supply.

Until the High Court expressly determines by majority in some case that the general approach described in DPP versus Merriman [[1973] AC 584] at 607 and adopted in Hamzy should be rejected, the decision in Hamzy should continue to be followed by the courts of this State.
 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ at CL: The applicant (whom for the purposes of security I identify only as "F") pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of prohibited drugs, and he was sentenced by Judge Gallen to a sentence of imprisonment for two years, consisting of a minimum term of six months and an additional term of eighteen months. The judge took into account, pursuant to [s 21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s21.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/), twentyfive offences relating to the illegal possession of firearms.

Initially, the applicant sought only leave to appeal against the sentence imposed, coupled with an application to do so out of time. Subsequently, an appeal against conviction was filed, also coupled with an application for leave to appeal out of time. The appeal against conviction is necessarily dependent upon this Court granting to the applicant leave to withdraw his plea of guilty in the District Court.

An applicant for such leave must demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. That test is one of longstanding authority. A miscarriage of justice may occur in many different situations. Many of them are discussed in this
Court's decision in Regina versus Boag.1 What must usually be shown is some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt,[2] but this Court has since held that this did not have to be shown where the miscarriage of justice had arisen out of the failure of the late and unlamented Sentence Indication
Scheme to work properly in the particular case.[3] Even then, however, the
Court insisted upon a miscarriage of justice being established.

Before turning to the applicant's arguments, it is necessary to quote the terms of the count to which he pleaded guilty and to refer shortly to the evidence which was placed before the judge. The need to refer to the evidence arises particularly because there arose during the sentencing proceedings a very real issue as to whether the applicant was in fact guilty of the charge to which he had pleaded guilty. The count was in the following terms: " ... that, on or about the 14 May 1990, at Pottsville in the State of New
South Wales, [he] did knowingly take part in the supply of prohibited drugs, namely, cannabis leaf, cocaine and heroin in that he, then being an occupant of certain premises, did suffer or permit those premises to be used for the supply of those prohibited drugs." 
The charge was laid pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), which provides that a person is guilty of an offence where that person - " ... supplies, or ... knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug ...".

That subsection contains two separate offences - to supply, and to knowingly take part in the supply. In the present case, the applicant had previously been charged with supply but, after a perfectly proper charge bargaining negotiation, the charge was altered to knowingly taking part in supply. A concession was made in the District Court that the police were unable to obtain any evidence of actual supply by the applicant. The expression "take part in" the supply of a prohibited drug is defined by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s6.html) in various ways; so far as it is relevant here, it occurs where that person - " ... suffers or permits any [step ... in the process of that ... supply] to be taken in premises of which the person is the ... occupier ... ." 
It must, of course, be kept in mind that the adverb "knowingly" governs the terms of that definition when it is applied to [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html)
The definition of "supply" in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s3.html) is an inclusive one. That means that "supply" retains its ordinary meanings, which include to furnish or to provide something which is needed or wanted or required by the person to whom it is given.[4] "Supply" is also given by [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s3.html) a number of extended meanings, including "having in possession for supply".
This Court has held that the extended definition of "supply" is applicable where the charge is knowingly taking part in supply.[5] 
The evidence which was placed before the judge was within a small compass.
When the premises (of which the applicant conceded that he was an occupier) were searched by the police, they located in and around the premises a total of 1,012 grams of cannabis leaf, 277 grams of powder containing cocaine and sixtyfive grams of powder containing heroin. The cannabis leaf was located in a coffee jar and in large glass jars, and the powder containing the cocaine and heroin was found in plastic bags and in both trace amounts and more substantial quantities in a number of smaller clear resealable bags. There was also considerable evidence of preparation for actual supply, including a sugar type substance suitable for "cutting" the drugs and other small resealable plastic bags marked variously with the letters "C" and "H", for cocaine and heroin.

The applicant gave evidence, which was accepted to be accurate, that over the period when he was an occupier there were a number of other people living in these premises with him. His de facto wife had gone to Victoria some time before the day of the search, and the applicant had been in Brisbane for a short time before that search. At least three other adults had been living in the premises at that particular time. Two of them, the police said, had criminal records for possession of prohibited drugs. All three had decamped when they became aware that the police were about to search the premises. The applicant also gave evidence, which the judge accepted, that he knew that other persons had been using drugs on the premises and that he had seen drugs changing hands. He gave evidence of one specific incident where he actually saw small packets of a white powder being exchanged by one member of the household for somewhere between $800 and $1000 provided by a person from outside the household. He saw the same parties together on another occasion and, although he did not see what went on, he nevertheless knew that another drug transaction was taking place. He accepted that he was in a position to have done something to prevent those drug transactions taking place or, at the least, to tell that member of the household to leave, and that he should have done something about it. He denied that he was aware of the particular drugs located in the premises during the police search, a denial which was not challenged.

There is necessarily raised by this evidence a considerable doubt as to the basis or bases upon which the applicant pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the supply of prohibited drugs as an occupier of premises by suffering or permitting those premises to be used for their supply and as to the basis or bases upon which he was sentenced.

The reference in the indictment to all three types of prohibited drugs which had been located in the premises during the police search, and the evidence given as to the total amounts of each of those types of drugs so located, suggest that the nature of the supply for which he suffered or permitted the premises to be used was possession by the other members of the household of those three types of drugs for supply. But that basis for the charge does not appear to be supported by the evidence before the judge, evidence which was produced with some care because of the judge's understandable concern that the applicant may have been pleading guilty to a crime which he had not committed.

That evidence referred only to a knowledge on the part of the applicant that the other members of the household were using drugs in the house, that drugs were changing hands and that one member of the household was using the premises to sell drugs to persons from outside the household. The drugs changing hands could have referred to such sales, but it could fairly be inferred that it would also have referred to drugs being furnished or provided by one member of the household to another member of the household (and thus falling within the ordinary meaning of supply to which I have already referred). That evidence suggests that the nature of the supply for which the applicant suffered or permitted the premises to be used was in fact actual supply rather than the possession by the others for the purposes of supply.
That is a substantially different type of case.

In either case, there was no investigation by anyone into the question whether the applicant knowingly took part in the supply (in whichever sense) of any of the cannabis leaf which is referred to in the count and of the amount of heroin and cocaine supplied or in their possession for supply. The form of the count itself is misleading, in that the particulars of taking part included in the count make no reference to the adverb "knowingly" which, as I have pointed out, governs the suffering or permitting identified in those particulars. The actual supply which the applicant witnessed involved white powder. There was no investigation into whether his knowledge that the others were using drugs included knowledge that they were using cannabis and whether they were furnishing or providing cannabis to each other.

Ordinarily, of course, the courts are entitled to assume that legally represented accused persons who plead guilty to an offence are acknowledging their guilt in relation to every ingredient of the offence charged.[6]
However, the unusual inclusion in the one count of three different types of drugs, and the very real issue which arose as to the extent to which the applicant knowingly suffered or permitted the premises to be used in relation to all three drugs and in relation to the whole of those drugs located in the premises, do not leave me with any degree of comfortable satisfaction that the applicant's plea of guilty was attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt in relation to them all. The matter was simply not investigated.

In addition, the applicant has raised an issue of duplicity in relation to the inclusion of all three types of drugs in the one count. No such issue was raised in the District Court, but in Regina versus Hamzy[7] this Court held that a challenge to the form of an indictment may in some cases lead to a miscarriage of justice such that it may be raised for the first time on appeal. That was, however, said in relation to a case in which there had been a trial. It is not often that the inclusion of more than one offence in the one count could lead to a miscarriage of justice where there is a plea of guilty, in that such a miscarriage arising out of duplicity is usually associated with the difficulty for the accused person in submitting that there is no case to answer in relation to some but not all of the offences included within the charge, and in raising pleas of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict should he subsequently be charged with one of the offences included within the one count, as no one would know whether that particular offence had been accepted or rejected by the jury.[8] None of those embarrassments can usually arise where there has been a plea of guilty.

In the present case, however, the difficulties to which I have already referred do relate at least in part to the inclusion of all three types of drugs in the one count, but those difficulties arise simply because there was a plea of guilty which may well not have been appropriate to them all. That does, in my opinion, demonstrate a miscarriage of justice, although I would prefer to attribute that miscarriage to the way in which the sentencing proceedings were conducted than to any duplicity in the form of the count itself.

I would therefore grant leave to the applicant to withdraw his plea of guilty, so that the matter would ordinarily have to go back for a new trial. Whether it should do so in this case I will consider in a moment. Before giving that consideration, I should refer to another issue which was raised in relation to the suggested duplicity in the form of the count.

This Court has in a number of cases decided that, subject to any question of unfairness in the particular case, the Crown is permitted in the one count to charge an accused person with the supply of prohibited drugs contrary to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) where it is relying upon more than one act of supply. Those decisions are identified and the leading ones are discussed in Regina versus Hamzy.9 They followed and applied a long line of English authority which was described by Lord Diplock in DPP versus Merriman[10] in these terms: "Where a number of acts of a similar nature ... were connected with one another, in the time and place of their commission or by their common purpose, in such a way that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, it was the practice, as early as the 18th century, to charge them in a single count of an indictment." 
The Crown has relied upon that principle in this case, in that (at least upon one interpretation of the Crown case) the count refers to a number of acts of actual supply for which the premises were suffered or permitted to be used - be they of one or the other of the three drugs identified in the count.

We have been referred to a recent decision of the High Court in which this principle was discussed, that of Walsh versus Tattersall.11 The appellant in that case had been charged in one count with a breach of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/wraca1986400/s120.html) of the [Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/wraca1986400/) (SA) which relied upon a number of payments having been obtained by the appellant over a period during which he was found not to have been entitled to them, and this had been justified by the prosecution as showing a course of conduct amounting to one compendious false pretence of incapacity for work. The High
Court split three to two in holding that the count was bad for duplicity.
Gaudron and Gummow JJ upheld the appeal upon the basis that, upon its proper statutory interpretation, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/wraca1986400/s120.html) did not permit the rolling up in the one count of a number of acts of obtaining payments.[12] There was therefore duplicity. Kirby J agreed with the result, but considered at length whether what has been described as the "practical" or "common sense" approach described in Merriman and adopted by this Court in Hamzy and other cases should be permitted. He held that it should not, saying that, save for statutory warrant and for the exceptional cases of continuing offences or facts so closely related that they amount to the one activity, separate offences should be the subject of separate charges.[13] Gaudron and Gummow JJ had said that, in their task of interpreting the provisions of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/wraca1986400/s120.html), they took into account the assistance which a strict interpretation would have in the determination, upon conviction, of the sentence appropriate to the offence and in determining the availability, if it be relevant, of pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict,14 both matters being relevant to duplicity and to which Kirby J had referred. They did not, however, adopt the policy decision which Kirby J had expressed concerning the general approach described in Merriman. On the other hand, Dawson and Toohey JJ dissented upon the basis that the approach described in Merriman and adopted by this
Court in Hamzy was correct and was applicable in that case.[15] 
I am not persuaded that the High Court has by its decision in Walsh v
Tattersall overruled this Court's decision in Regina versus Hamzy. It is inevitable that that issue will be determined by that Court at some time in the future in a case where the statutory provision being interpreted is [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), or in some other case in which the general approach described by Merriman is either expressly accepted or rejected by a majority of the High Court. Until it is rejected, this Court's decision in Regina versus Hamzy should, in my opinion, continue to be followed by the courts of this State.

If the present case were to go back to the District Court for trial, the Crown would have to replead the charge in order to overcome the obvious duplicity which it presently exhibits by its reference to the three different drugs. The question is, however, whether this case should go back to the District Court for trial. [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s8.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) provides that a new trial may be ordered where the miscarriage of justice leading to the quashing of the conviction can more adequately be remedied by such a new trial rather than any other order which this Court has power to make. The wide discretion thus given to this Court is discussed in its decision in Regina v
Honeysett.16 
In the present case, the applicant received a minimum term of only six months as a result of two factors: one, the extremely minimal involvement which he had had in the offence of suffering or permitting his premises to be used for supply; and, two, because of assistance which he had given to the authorities in relation to other matters which had occurred elsewhere. The extent of this assistance (the details of which are in a sealed envelope which this Court has seen) was considerable. Indeed, such was the degree of assistance given that the applicant has been provided with a new identity under the witness protection programme pursuant to the [Witness Protection Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wpa1995248/).

At the time when he was sentenced, the judge was not told that the applicant had already served a discrete period of pre-sentence custody of fortysix days referable to this matter, and that period was not reflected in the sentence imposed. In the circumstances of this case, the applicant could not properly receive a sentence any greater than that now imposed in the event that he pleads guilty or is found guilty at a new trial, and the sentence to be imposed would now have to be adjusted to take that period of pre-sentence custody into account. Moreover, the applicant has already served a period of sixty days of the sentence imposed before being granted bail pending the hearing of this appeal. There remains therefore only seventysix days of the minimum term to be served. The applicant has been on bail for a period of just under three years pending the hearing of this appeal,[17] on undemanding conditions, and he has been - so far as we are aware - out of trouble for that period. A parole period could hardly be thought to be necessary any longer.

I do not believe that there is any purpose to be served in the circumstances of this case for there to be a new trial. At the same time, I do not believe that it is appropriate for there to be a judgment of acquittal entered. In any event, if such a judgment were entered, the applicant would once more become liable to prosecution for the twentyfive firearms offences presently taken into account. What I propose are the following orders, in part pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s7.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/): 
The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is quashed.

The count pleaded in the indictment is by consent amended by deleting from it the words from and including "namely".

The applicant is convicted of that count, and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment from 1 October 1993 to 28 November 1993.

The period already served by the applicant is to count in satisfaction of that sentence.

The matters on the Form 2 have been taken into account in imposing that sentence.

The orders made by Judge Gallen that the drugs located on the premises be destroyed, that the money located there by the police be forfeited to the
Crown and that the firearms also located there by the police be forfeited and destroyed be confirmed.

IRELAND J: I agree.

BELL AJ: I agree. I want to add two things. Regarding the High Court decision in Tattersall, it seems to me the decision of Gaudron and Gummow JJ could be characterised as purely an interpretation of the statute, viz that, because of the wording of s120 of the Workers Rehabilitation & Compensation Act 1986 South Australia, a charge expressed in the plural was not a charge of an offence created by the Act.

The other comment I wanted to make is directed to the reference by the presiding judge to the way in which the problem has arisen "from the way the sentencing proceedings were conducted." I did not understand Hunt CJ at CL to be critical of the sentencing judge in that remark. Indeed the sentencing judge went to great pains and in fact granted two adjournments to ensure the appellant really was intending to admit all the necessary matters.

Subject to those comments I agree with the proposed orders and the reasons as stated.

HUNT CJ at CL: The interpretation placed by Bell AJ upon my judgment is correct. I had not intended in any way to criticise the sentencing judge.

The orders of the Court are as I proposed.
