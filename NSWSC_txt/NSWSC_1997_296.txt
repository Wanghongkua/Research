REGINA versus John Kenneth SPINKS 
JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against a decision of Hunt CJ at CL, given on 14 March 1997, in respect of an application under [s13A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) of the [Sentencing Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) . The Court is of the view that because of the seriousness of the matter from the point of view of the applicant, the applicant should have leave to appeal and the Court grants leave to appeal. Leave to appeal is granted. I will go on to deal with the merits of the appeal. 
In May 1988 the appellant was sentenced by Wood J for the crimes of murder and of robbery with striking and wounding. Wood J, in his remarks on sentence, said that each was an appalling crime, involving a brutal and cowardly attack on a defenceless invalid pensioner, living alone. His Honour said that the criminality of the appellant was aggravated by the fact that he had previously inflicted physical harm on the victim.

Having given certain details of the killing, Wood J said: "I mention these details of the killing so that there can be a convenient permanent record of the brutality which the prisoner displayed this night in his attack on a man many years his senior, who was a defenceless pensioner.
That this crime is one which must attract the most severe penalty available is obvious. Elderly or disabled or defenceless people are entitled to feel safe in their own homes and to look to the Courts to impose sentences which will deter similar attacks." 
The concluding portion of that paragraph is a reference to what would probably now be called the "home invasion" aspect of these crimes.

Wood J sentenced the appellant to penal servitude for life in respect of the charge of murder. In respect of the other charge, he sentenced the appellant to penal servitude for thirteen years and declined to specify any non-parole period.

The appellant is a man who has an extremely long and complex criminal record and custodial history. In one important respect the complexity of his custodial history cuts across the considerations to be taken into account in the present appeal. It is therefore convenient at this stage to make brief reference to that aspect of the matter.

The two crimes for which the appellant was sentenced by Wood J were committed on 6 May 1987.

To take up the appellant's criminal history at a somewhat arbitrary point, he was released to parole on 30 October 1983, after having served part of sentences for crimes of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault, robbery, larceny, buggery and indecent assault.

On 30 December 1983 the appellant, whilst on parole, assaulted the man who was the victim of the ultimate murder in 1987. The appellant was taken back into custody in February 1984 and was subsequently sentenced, for that and two other robberies, to penal servitude for a total of six years. Whilst in prison he threw boiling water at the face of a fellow prisoner and his sentence was increased by a further two years. He was released to parole on 10 March 1987.
On 1 April 1987 he committed an armed robbery using a sawn-off rifle and on 30
April 1987 he committed a further robbery.

When in due course the appellant was sentenced in respect of those other offences, that is the offences other than the murder and the robbery which came before Wood J, he received an effective total of a little under twenty- four years, with a non-parole period of ten years. However, those sentences were redetermined in accordance with the transitional provisions of the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/), so that the effect of the total minimum term expired on 10 November 1994 and the additional term will expire on 30 December 1997.

In a psychologist's report written in 1988, the appellant was described as a violent recidivist with limited intellect and minimal impulse control.

The appellant's behaviour in prison is dealt with at length in the reasons for judgment of Hunt CJ at CL and it is unnecessary to repeat what his Honour there said about that matter.

Pursuant to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) of the [Sentencing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/), the appellant applied for a determination of minimum and additional terms to replace the sentence of penal servitude for life imposed upon him by Wood J in respect of the murder. That application came for hearing before the Chief
Judge at Common Law. The circumstances of the murder and of the previous robbery were described by the Chief Judge in his reasons for judgment in the following terms: "On 6 May (1987) the applicant spent time drinking with Henderson, whom he had known from gaol for some years and the applicant persuaded Henderson to accompany him to the home of the deceased where (he told Henderson) there was money.

When they entered the premises, the applicant punched the deceased about the face, causing him to bleed. Henderson grabbed the accused and told him to back off. The accused ordered to deceased to give him his money, which turned out to be only $100. The applicant punched the deceased three or four more times about the face, causing his nose to bleed profusely. Henderson again intervened and was told to get a taxi. He was away for some 20 minutes carrying out this task and when he returned with the taxi, the applicant left the deceased's house carrying the deceased's television receiver. The applicant had tied the deceased up with electric flex.

A taxi took the two men to Henderson's flat, where Henderson was left with the television receiver. The applicant said he was returning to the deceased's home because he had left some clothing and a bottle of fortified wine there.
The Crown case at the trial was that once back inside the deceased's home, the applicant beat the deceased around the face and body. He forced the deceased to complete a bank withdrawal slip for $1,000 from his bank account. He slashed the deceased's neck with a kitchen knife before binding his angles with electric flex, which flex was then pulled up to the deceased's neck and wound three times tightly around his neck. He also bound the deceased's wrists. He then vandalised the house, with blood being found in five different rooms.

When the applicant returned to Henderson's flat at about 3.00am on 7 May, his shirt was saturated with blood. Later that morning he presented the withdrawal slip and received $1,000. The deceased was found dead that afternoon." 
Hunt CJ at CL redetermined the appellant's sentence. He set a minimum term of penal servitude of twenty years and an additional term for the remainder of the applicant's natural life. Being constrained by the provisions of [s13A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) the learned judge fixed as the commencing date of the minimum term, 10 May
Accordingly, the minimum term will conclude on 9 May in the year 2007 and the applicant will be eligible to release on parole on 10 May in the year .

The principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is directed towards the additional term. It was also argued on behalf of the appellant that the minimum term fixed by his Honour was "a little too long". I would reject the latter argument and take no more time about doing so than was devoted to the putting of the argument.

It is not suggested that the learned judge committed any error of fact or principle in his assessment of the objective circumstances of the case or the subjective features relevant to sentencing or resentencing the appellant. It will be necessary to advert in more detail to considerations of totality when considering the appellant's main argument, but it should be remarked for present purposes that those considerations had a relevance to the argument that the minimum term was a little too long, although I do not suggest that is their only relevance. In my view, the minimum term fixed by his Honour was well within the range of a proper exercise of discretion.

I turn now to the principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellant. The first submission for the appellant was one concerning the construction of [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html)
It is not a submission that was advanced at first instance and that, no doubt, is why it is not referred to in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Judge at
Common Law. The submission for the appellant was to the following effect.
[Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) presents a judge dealing with an application under that section with a range of alternative courses that may be pursued by way of response to the application. The course that was taken in the present case is expressly provided for as the second of two alternatives in the words in parenthesis in [s13A(4)(a)(ii).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html), in a number of its provisions, states certain conditions which must be satisfied before a particular power reposed in a Judge may be exercised.
[Section
A(8)C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) provides that a direction of a certain kind, which is provided for under subs(8) of [s13A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) (not a direction given in the present case) may only be given in certain circumstances. Such a direction may only be given if the crime in question was the crime of murder and it was a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that a certain determination be made. (It may be noted in passing that [s13A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) does not apply only to cases of murder.) The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was that the second of the two alternatives provided for in the words in parenthesis in [s13A(4)(a)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) may only be adopted by a Judge in "a most serious case of murder". At least by implication, it was also argued on behalf of the appellant that the present is not "a most serious case of murder".

These are not arguments that were advanced at first instance, and so the reasons for judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law are silent upon them. I would reject both of the arguments. In my view it would be an unduly narrow and rigid construction of [s13A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) to import into [s13A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html), in the manner contended for on behalf of the appellant, part of the language of [s13A(8)C.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) 
The circumstances in which, as a matter of a proper exercise of discretion, it might be appropriate to exercise the power given in the second of the two alternatives in [s13A(4)(a)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) are not limited to "a most serious case of murder". Indeed, there is no reason for concluding that that power can only be exercised in a case of murder. As has already been mentioned, [s13A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s13a.html) applies to cases other than cases of murder.

Furthermore, and in any event, if it were necessary to decide the question, I would conclude that the present is a most serious case of murder. The reasons for that conclusion are to be found in the description of the circumstances of the case given earlier in these reasons. Those circumstances, if necessary, may be considered in conjunction with the criminal history of the appellant.

Although it was not suggested that the reasons the judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law contained any express error, it was argued that they contain implied error in that in a proper exercise of discretion, his Honour could not reasonably have concluded that it was appropriate in the present case to set an additional term of the remainder of the appellant's natural life.

A large part of the reasons for judgment of his Honour involve detailed consideration of the subject of totality, which was of particular importance in the present case, having regard to the number of crimes committed by the appellant and the interplay or interaction of the various sentences to which he was subject, including the sentence which was the subject of the application for redetermination. I am unable to accept a submission on behalf of the appellant that the learned judge regarded those considerations of totality as being relevant only to the fixing of the minimum term. They were, in my view, relevant to the entirety of the sentencing or resentencing procedure in which his Honour was engaged and his Honour so regarded them.
Those considerations of totality have, amongst other things, an importance in relation to the discretionary decision made by the learned judge in connection with the additional term and they strongly support the conclusion which he reached in that connection.

Another aspect of the case, which obviously weighed heavily upon his Honour's mind, was the uncertainty that applied in relation to considerations of rehabilitation. Those considerations were discussed at some length by his
Honour, and he plainly, and justifiably, regarded the present as a case in which there was, at the very least, a large question as to the extent to which the appellant would represent a danger to the community on his release. His
Honour did not attempt to make any precise finding or prediction in that respect, but the problem formed part of the background of his consideration of the relevant circumstances of the case.

As I have earlier indicated, the extremely serious objective circumstances of the present case, which I would regard as a most serious case of murder, taken in conjunction with the criminal history of the appellant, warrant the imposition of a total sentence of the kind imposed at first instance. No successful challenge to the reasoning or the conclusion of the Chief Judge at
Common Law has been made. I would propose that the appeal should be dismissed.

SHELLER JA: I agree. 
SMART J: I also agree. 
GLEESON CJ: The order of the court will be will be as I have proposed. * * *
