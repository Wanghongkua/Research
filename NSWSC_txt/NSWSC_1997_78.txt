Killen V Leigo [1997] NSWSC 78 (10 March 1997) `KILLEN V LEIGO` `3204/96 ` `Monday 10 March 1997` `SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: The plaintiffs seek to have the defendant vacate his office as a trustee of an informal trust. The defendant is prepared to retire, but only on conditions unacceptable to the plaintiffs.` ` The trust concerned came into being as an aftermath of the well-known Marra
Development litigation, but was not actually written down. A company, Pinata
Pty Limited, was formed to acquire property including Marrra. Two shares were issued in that company, one of which is held by the defendant.` ` The defendant has not at any stage disputed that he holds his one share as trustee for "the families" of EDL Killen and BGL Killen.` ` The nine plaintiffs are the wife of EDL Killen, the children of EDL Killen, the wife of BGL Killen and the children of BGL Killen. They have all requested the defendant to resign as trustee and to vest his share in another company,
Castanair Pty Limited, unconditionally.` ` The defendant does not object to this on certain conditions. The conditions have changed from time to time, but essentially they are, first that it be established to his satisfaction who are the members of the families of the
Messrs Killen, that is whether the plaintiffs comprehensibly comprise that class, or whether there are others who fit into that class as well.` ` Secondly, the defendant seeks an indemnity and release in connection with certain liabilities which he says may have been imposed upon him by reason of him being a trustee of the trust. There was a matter of some $3,731 which was actually due to the defendant as trustee and this was paid on demand. The defendant also claims to be concerned that there might be a stamp duty liability on him as trustee, and also that he might be liable because certain questionable transactions took place in the trust at the request of some of the beneficiaries.` ` After the dispute had been stewing for some years, the plaintiffs formally asked the defendant in August last year to retire as trustee and transfer his share to Castanair. When no action followed, the summons was issued on 28
August 1996. It was returnable in September. It went into the Short Notice
List on 15 October 1996 and came on for trial before me today.` ` There is no doubt at all that a trustee of a trust, where all the beneficiaries are sui juris and who is requested to terminate the trust, or transfer the property, as the beneficiaries advise, must comply with that request. The defendant acknowledges this. However, he says he is not certain as to who all the beneficiaries are. That alleged quandary of the trustee seems to have varied from time to time. He then solicitor's letter of 13
September 1996 seemed to suggest that "only some of the plaintiffs, together with at least two other parties, were intended to be the beneficiaries at the time the trust was 'created'." However, today the defendant filed an affidavit indicating that one of the Killens allegedly was living in a de facto relationship and may have produced further children.` ` The facts are that the defendant has been well acquainted with EDL Killen and BGL Killen for some forty years. However, he would have me believe that he had never made any inquiries as to whether there were any children by any de facto union. The fact that he only submitted what little material he had on which to base a suspicion on the day of the hearing makes me consider that the matter is merely put up for forensic purposes or to embarrass. However, the defendant was not cross examined, mainly because there was very little material on which to cross examine him that was relevant to my decision. So, apart from the question of costs which I will come to later, any feeling that the trustee is merely causing embarrassment or putting technicalities in the way of the plaintiffs is irrelevant.` ` The defendant then says that the word "family" is a very vague and ambiguous word and his counsel points to the decision of O'Bryan, J in Re Brewis <case>; [[1946] VLR 199.] However, that was a very unusual case where there was a condition of forfeiture in the will that a nephew should not marry a member of the family "X".` ` There have been a series of cases over the last two hundred years which makes it fairly clear that the word "family", when employed in a will or trust, ordinarily means "children"; see In re Terry <case>; [(1854) 19 Beav 580]; [52 ER 476]; Re Parkinson; Ex parte Thompson <case>; [(1851) 1 Sim (NS) 242]; Pigg v
Clarke [(1876) 3 Ch 672]; Re McGrath's Will <case>; [(1899) 20 LR (B & P) 55]; Re Nash [(1979) Qd R 219]; and Re
Mehmet [(1986) 10 Fam LR 1035.]` ` If the propositus does not have children, then the word means "relations":
In re Barlow's Will Trusts [[1979] 1 WLR 278], 283.` ` The word "family" initially meant a group of people over which the paterfamilias presided and one gets this sense from some of the eighteenth century cases such as R versus Inhabitants of Darlington <case>; [(1792) 4 TR 797]; [100 ER 1308.] The word is often interpreted in landlord and tenant statutes in this particular way. Nowadays the paterfamilias need not be a male and the members of the group may be in a de jure or genuine de facto relationship with the paterfamilias. Indeed the word is often to be understood in its colloquial sense: Dyson Holdings Limited versus Fox <case>; [[1976]
QB 503.]` ` Accordingly, there was not the great problem about the word "family" as the defendant says there was. If there had been any real problems, one would have expected either that he would file a summons under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/) or commence a suit for construction. However in fact the details as to who were the families did not appear to be a matter of any legal uncertainty, the question was rather whether the two fathers would have been included in the group. Furthermore there is the recent allegation that there might be some illegitimate children.` ` To my mind, there was really no uncertainty in this case. The "family" means the plaintiffs. It is true that it was only today that there was actually evidence before the Court that the nine plaintiffs, and only the plaintiffs, could be the "family (the nine plaintiffs including the two wives, but that matters very little because the other seven plaintiffs constitute all the children). This defendant could have easily found out the totality of the children if he did not already know, by simple enquiries. The Court does not take kindly to a trustee putting barriers in the way of a distribution of the trust property.` ` In any event, it is the primary duty of the trustee to acquaint himself, or herself, with the property of the trust and the persons who are entitled to have the trust administered. It is so peculiar for a trustee at the end of a trust to say he just does not know who the beneficiaries are, that I cannot find any exact case in the books covering the situation.` ` However, the duty laid on a trustee is set out in Scott on the Law of
Trusts 3rd edition (Little Brown & Co Boston (1967)) <case>.1. Scott quite clearly indicates that the trustees must make themselves familiar not only with the assets of the trust but also the beneficiaries. This trustee apparently has not done that and then has used his own ignorance as a reason why he should not comply with the beneficiaries' request. This the Court does not tolerate.` ` The next reason put why the trustee could not do what he would be delighted to do in ordinary circumstances was that there should be some indemnity given to him for the liabilities he may have incurred. Mr Somerset for the plaintiffs said of course, primarily though not exclusively, that the trustee should resort to the trust assets, not to the beneficiaries personally, and that he has resort to the trust assets, notwithstanding that he may have ceased to be a trustee.` ` Certainly Coatesv McInerney [(1992) 6 ACSR 748] is an authority for the second half of the proposition. However, there is an awkward decision of the Privy Council in an appeal from Hong Kong, Hardoon v
Belilios [[1901] AC 118], where it was laid down that where there is a single beneficiary who is sui juris, that beneficiary will be personally liable to indemnify the trustee.` ` The extent to which the principle adopted by the Privy Council in that case applies where there is more than a single beneficiary is unclear. However, the trend of the decision is that the principle applies generally, including situations where there are multiple or successive beneficiaries, JW
Broomhead Pty Limited <case>; [[1985] VR 891] at 936, or even where the trusts are more complicated,
Poignand versus NZI Securities Australia Limited <case>; [(1992) 109 ALR 213] at 221-222.` ` Accordingly, there may well be something in the defendant's argument that he would be entitled to resort to the beneficiaries for indemnity. However, the indemnity sought is against liabilities which are very contingent indeed and it would not seem to me that any person of commercial commonsense would think that this was of any great risk at all.` ` I take into account the fact that there is bad blood between the two sets of parties, but even so, the matters about which the defendant seeks indemnity are not likely to occur. If they do occur, then there would still be an indemnity against the trust assets, or if the principle in Hardoon's case applies, against the beneficiaries. Accordingly, the existence of any such right of indemnity should not be a barrier to the trustee doing what all the beneficiaries have requested him to do.` ` Accordingly, there should be orders 1 and 2 in the summons and liberty to the plaintiffs to apply to a Registrar of this Court under <case> of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) if these orders are not implemented within twenty-eight days.` ` I now turn to the question of costs. Mr Hunt, who appeared for the defendant with Mr Elrington, put that in this sort of case the general rule should apply and that is that trustees in a case where there is some doubt should get their costs of the estate or trust.` ` He cited as an illustration Bullas versus Public Trustee [[1981] 1 NSWLR ]
where there were problems with how far ex-nuptial children should be considered as beneficiaries.` ` There are, however, a whole series of cases which are much closer to the present point than Bulla's case. The closest to the present situation that
I have been able to find is Palairet versus Carew <case>; [(1863) 32 Beav 564]; [55 ER 222.] Although usually decisions late in Beavan's Reports are looked at with some suspicion, this one does appear to be in the mainstream of the authorities. It is closer to the present facts than others in the series which I will mention shortly. In that case there were two trustees who were required to sell property and hold the produce on trust for Mr and Mrs Bateman and, after their death, for their children. After Mr Bateman died, Mrs Bateman insisted that the trustee sell, but he put up all sorts of technical reasons why he should not. The trustee was not guilty of any serious misconduct. He was not guilty of any dishonesty, yet he did not do what he was asked to do by the beneficiaries in a situation where the beneficiaries legitimately expected that he would do.` ` Romilly MR at ER 224 said:` ` "I have endeavoured to arrive at a conclusion` ` which might relieve me from the necessity of` ` making the defendant bear the costs of the` ` suit, but I am of the opinion that the ` ` defendant has rendered this suit necessary,` ` and that he must pay the costs of it up to and` ` including the hearing."` ` The next case in the same line is AG versus Murdoch <case>; [(1856) 2 K & J 571]; [69 ER 910.] That case is well known in the ecclesiastical law for another point, but the problem was that the trustee of a meeting house on the English-
Scottish border were removed and new trustees appointed. The main fault on the part of the defendants was that they misinterpreted the trust and let their churchmanship outweigh their judgment.` ` Page Wood VC said at ER 911:` ` "If a trustee voluntarily retires from a trust ` ` like the present on account of difference of` ` opinion, he pays no costs, whether he will` ` receive costs is a question for the discretion` ` of the Court, and may depend upon the` ` circumstances of his retirement.` ` But here all the proceedings in the suit have` ` been occasioned by the trustees' refusal to` ` retire from their trust. They took what the` ` Court considered an improper and perverse` ` view as to the duties imposed upon them, and` ` the suit for their removal and all the` ` proceedings consequent thereon have been` ` occasioned by their taking that view."` ` The hostile defendants were then accordingly ordered to pay the costs for the suit in which they were removed.` ` Other cases in the same line, which are not as important because they deal with situations where the trustee was actually guilty of misconduct are
Passingham versus Sherborn [(1846) 9 Beav 424]; Letterstedt v Broers [(1884) 9 App Cas 371] at 390 and
Hunter versus Hunter (No 2) [[1937] NZLR 934], which was affirmed on appeal in [[1938] NZLR 520], see especially pages 528 to 539.` ` It seems to me that on the authority of those cases that in the present case
Mr Leigo did not act reasonably and properly in refusing to accede to the request of the beneficiaries. Thus he should pay the costs of the proceedings.` ` Accordingly, in addition to the orders I have already forecasted, the defendant must pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.` ` Exhibits may remain with the papers.` `` * * *
