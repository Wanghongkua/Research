Hyde and Worsley ("the appellants") were both seriously injured playing rugby union. Each sought damages for negligence against the opposing club, the referee and various persons and bodies responsible for the administration of the sport within Australia. Subsequently, the appellants attempted to join a wider group of defendants (the "IRFB defendants"; the IRFB referring to the
International Rugby Football Board) for their failure, as the persons and bodies responsible for rugby at the international level, to ensure that the rules of rugby prevented or reduced the risk of injury in the type of incidents that befell the appellants.

After numerous interlocutory proceedings, the IRFB defendants were served by the appellants in New Zealand and London. Each of the IRFB defendants filed
Notices of Motion seeking (pursuant to [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r6A and [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p11) r8) to set aside service, a stay based on forum non conveniens, and other relief. The appellants each countered with a Notice of Motion seeking leave to proceed against the IRFB defendants (pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r2), and orders extending the time for bringing their claims against the IRFB defendants under the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

In July 1996, Grove J heard together the motions in the two sets of proceedings. The motions on behalf of the appellants for leave to proceed and extension of time were dismissed. Service in each case was set aside on the application of the IRFB defendants.

HELD, allowing each appeal: 
An applicant for leave to proceed against a foreign defendant must establish to the standard of a "good arguable case" that the proceedings fall within one of the sub-rules of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A.

Vitkovice Horni A Hutni Tezirstvo versus Korner [[1951] AC 869], considered. 
Where the applicant satisfies at least one of the paragraphs of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A, there remains a discretion whether leave to proceed should be given under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2 or, alternatively, service set aside under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r6A and [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p11) r8. The discretionary phase is separate and distinct, although not at large.

Seaconsar Far East Ltd versus Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran [[1994] AC 438], followed. 
It is inappropriate to apply a principle of restraint in construing those categories of extended jurisdiction where a clear and objective link with the territory of the forum is present, or where the jurisdiction assumed by the rules is similar to or less "exorbitant" than that exercised by many other countries.

The Societe Generale de Paris versus Dreyfus Brothers [(1885) 29 Ch D 239], distinguished. 
The discretion under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r6A should be exercised in accordance with the principles of forum non conveniens as they are enunciated by the Australian courts. If such principles would not lead to the staying of local proceedings, then it is incorrect to take account of the "foreignness" of the particular litigation as a basis for declining to exercise the discretion in favour of a plaintiff.

Pendal Nominees Pty Ltd versus M & A Investments Pty Ltd, not followed. 
It is not appropriate, during interlocutory applications under [Supreme
Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) rr2, 6A, to determine the existence of a duty of care in an evolving area of law beyond the standard of a "good arguable case".

Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia versus Hunt [(1982) 44 ALR 365], applied. 
There is a good arguable case that the tort or torts alleged are located in New South Wales, where the appellants suffered their injuries.

Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd  <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 538] 
It is just and reasonable to grant the appellants an extension of time under [ss60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) and [60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html)(1) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

Consideration of whether sporting administrators owe a duty of care to participants in a sport in the formulation of the rules of their respective games. 
ORDERS
Appeals allowed.
Direct parties to bring in Short Minutes within 7 days. If an agreed form of Short Minutes is not submitted to the Registrar within that time, direct the matter to be listed before the President at 9.30am on a date (within the following 7 days) to be fixed by the Registrar after consultation with the parties.

HYDE versus AGAR & ORS 
WORSLEY versus AUSTRALIAN RUGBY FOOTBALL 
UNION LTD & ORS 
JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: Each appellant is a young man who was seriously injured playing rugby union. Each seeks damages for negligence against the opposing club, the referee and various persons and bodies responsible for the administration of the sport. 
Mr Hyde was hooker for the first grade "Colts" of Warringah Rugby Club when they played a team fielded by Gordon Rugby Club on 23 August 1986. He was 19 at the time. It is alleged that the Gordon forward pack in scrum formation charged the Warringah pack before it was set in position. Mr Hyde suffered severe spinal injury and resultant incomplete quadriplegia.

Mr Worsley was also hooker, representing Wagga Agricultural Rugby Football
Union when it played against the Rivcoll team on 19 August 1987. He was 18 at the time. It is alleged that the Rivcoll forward pack engaged in scrum formation before Mr Worsley was ready to receive them and while his head and neck were at an awkward angle. He suffered severe spinal injury and resultant quadriplegia.

The allegations against the local defendants 
Mr Hyde's proceedings commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 5 August 1988.
It has been amended from time to time. In its present form, its defendants include Australian Rugby Football Union Ltd, New South Wales Rugby Football
Union Ltd, Sydney Rugby Union (a corporation), the match referee, the Sydney
Rugby Referees' Association (a corporation) and the Gordon Rugby Club Limited.

Mr Worsley's proceedings commenced by Statement of Claim filed on 19 August
Like his fellow plaintiff, Mr Worsley has also sued several persons concerned with the particular match in which he was injured and with the administration of rugby in Australia. These include Australian Rugby Football
Union Ltd, New South Wales Rugby Union Ltd, Charles Sturt University, Rivcoll
Union Inc, members of the executive of the Riverina Rugby Union and Wagga
Agricultural Rugby Union Football Club in 1987, the match referee and members of the executive of the Riverina Rugby Union Referees Association in 1987.

The defendants already mentioned (whom we shall describe compendiously as the "local defendants") are sued for negligence in the conduct of the particular football match or their responsibility for the rules under which it was played, including responsibility for failure to enforce the rules or to have them modified locally so as to require scrummaging to take place safely.

Regrettably the claims of the two injured men have not yet come to trial. At least some of the delay has been due to the disputes about parties and service out of the jurisdiction which will be referred to in more detail below.

The allegations against the IRFB defendants 
The present applications are concerned with attempts by the appellants to join a wider group of defendants (whom we shall describe as the "IRFB defendants") in order to propound an alternative basis of liability to that alleged against the local defendants. IRFB refers to the International Rugby Football Board.
Stated baldly, the appellants wish to sue the IRFB defendants for their failure, as the persons and bodies responsible for rugby at the international level in 1986, to ensure that the rules of rugby prevented or reduced the risk of injury to hookers in the type of incidents that befell the appellants.
These rules are described in key documents as the "Laws of the Game". The appellants argue that the risk of such injuries could have been avoided by the adoption of rules to "depower" the engagement of scrums.

Reliance is placed on a paper by Professor Taylor and Dr Coolican, "Spinal- cord injuries in Australian footballers, 1960-1985" published on 3 August 1987 in the Medical Journal of Australia. The paper was based on a review of footballers who suffered a spinal-cord injury between 1960 and 1985. It argued that collision at scrum engagement caused the majority of such injuries; and that the injuries were largely preventable by appropriate rule changes. The paper led to changes in the rules in 1988 (introducing the "crouch, touch, pause" requirements), unfortunately too late for the appellants.

The appellants fear that, unless the IRFB defendants are included, the local defendants will defend the action on the basis that they were bound to apply the Laws of the Game promulgated by the IRFB. (The Laws of the Game assert in the Foreword that it is the duty of the referee to apply fairly the Laws of the Game without any variation or omission.) 
The novelty of the claims against the IRFB is one problem faced by the appellants. They are further overlaid by substantive and procedural impediments stemming from the following facts: the IRFB is an unincorporated association; most of the IRFB defendants reside overseas and none have submitted unconditionally to the jurisdiction of this Court; the applications to join the IRFB defendants were made outside the primary limitation period of six years.
 "International Rugby Football Board" is an expression used in two different senses. One meaning is the voluntary association of national Rugby Football
Unions ("Member Unions" and "Associate Member Unions") that are involved with the sport. The other meaning is the governing committee, in the sense of a board of directors, that has certain powers to control the sport worldwide, being a board of directors constituted by representatives appointed by Member
Unions who are themselves members of the IRFB in its first sense.

In an endeavour to reach juristic persons responsible for the acts or omissions of the IRFB in promulgating the Laws of the Game, the plaintiffs have sought to join as "IRFB parties": the Member Unions, incorporated and unincorporated; and the representatives of the Member Unions who attended relevant meetings of the Board before the appellant's injury.

Bye-Laws of the IRFB 
IRFB is used in each sense in the Bye-laws of the International Rugby
Football Board, April 1986 which are in evidence. So far as relevant those bye-laws provide:

Earlier interlocutory proceedings 
There have been a plethora of interlocutory applications in each matter. We shall concentrate on those relevant to the matters now in issue.

Hyde Proceedings 
In his original Statement of Claim, Mr Hyde sued only three defendants, the
Sydney Rugby Union, the match referee and the Sydney Rugby Referees'
Association. It was alleged against the Sydney Rugby Union that it was negligent in failing to disseminate information and warnings about the risks of spinal injuries in scrummaging.

The original defendants (being local defendants) sought to have the Statement of Claim struck out on the basis that it alleged a duty of care not known to the law. McInerney J dismissed the application: Hyde versus Sydney Rugby Union & Ors, 28 November 1988. The learned judge recognised that the alleged duty of care was "novel and perhaps a startling one". However he declined to strike out the pleading, recognising that the categories of negligence are never closed. He cited Rootes versus Shelton <case>; <case>; <case>; [(1964) 112 CLR 125], his Honour refused to strike out the Statement of Claim or to stay or dismiss the proceedings. He concluded that the question whether there was evidence of sufficient proximity to establish a duty of care was properly a matter for determination at trial. In the penultimate paragraph of his judgment he remarked: "In conclusion, whilst I understand the considerable force in the arguments by the defendants, and the dismay that such a case would cause in the ranks of the followers, officials and referees of Rugby Union, nevertheless justice, in my mind, demands that the plaintiff be given an opportunity to argue his case after a full elucidation of all the circumstances." 
On 21 June 1991 Registrar Berecry made orders by consent giving Mr Hyde leave to further amend the Statement of Claim. Mr Hyde retained the original local defendants (as the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants) and added New South
Wales Rugby Union Ltd and Gordon Rugby Club Ltd. He also joined three parties in an attempt, inter alia, to find defendants responsible for the making of the Laws of the Game. These were: 
Australian Rugby Football Union Ltd ("ARFU Ltd") (first defendant), sued in the capacity of representing the IRFB. The allegation against it in this capacity was that "the first defendant made the Rules of the game" (para 9).
Negligence included failure to change the Rules appropriately (para 15).

ARFU Ltd (second defendant), sued in its own right. The allegation against it in this capacity included failure to vary the Rules to permit the "depowerising" of scrums, as well as failures to warn and to enforce the existing rules.

New South Wales Rugby Union Ltd (third defendant). The allegation against it was the same as against the second defendant. (In fact similar allegations were made against Sydney Rugby Union, Sydney Rugby Referees
Association and Gordon Rugby Club Ltd.) 
The Amended Statement of Claim was sent by registered mail to an address in
Sydney understood by Mr Hyde to be the correct address in Australia of the
IRFB. Thereupon Hunt and Hunt, who advised that they acted as solicitors for the IRFB (letter dated 17 December 1991), moved for a declaration that service on the first defendant had not been duly effected and for orders setting aside the purported service of the pleading as well as the pleading itself so far as it made claims against the first defendant. Mr Hyde countered with a Notice of
Motion seeking an order under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p9) r11 that the Amended Statement of Claim be taken to have been duly served.

These motions came before Master Greenwood. On 11 March 1992 Master Greenwood declared that, notwithstanding the representative order previously made, ARFU
Limited had not been served otherwise than in its own right.

Three further Notices of Motion came before Master Greenwood on 2 April 1992.
The Master set aside the earlier order of the Registrar appointing ARFU
Limited as the representative of the IRFB. He also set aside the service of the Statement of Claim on the IRFB, noting that it was not proper that an organisation resident outside New South Wales should be served within the
State on the basis of an inappropriate representative order. However, in the light of evidence before him, he made an order under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p9) r11 confirming service on the IRFB. In doing so, he concluded that it was impractical to serve the documents in the manner required by the Act; and that steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing or having the tendency to bring the documents to the notice of the Council of the IRFB. He recorded that the service confirmed was service on a defendant outside Australia. The Master then made an order (relying on [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p25) r1) appointing Dr Roger Vanderfield the representative of the IRFB as the first defendant, in lieu of ARFU Limited. (He was the Chairman of the Board of the IRFB at the time. The Council was invited to appoint an alternative representative if it so chose.) The Master noted that this first defendant remained at liberty to seek relief under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r6A.

Mr Hyde has sworn that he believed at the time that this decision, made after argument, cured any defects of the Further Amended Statement of Claim so far as the IRFB was concerned. There is no reason to reject this evidence.

However the matter came on again for further argument before Master Greenwood on 21 April 1992. The Master ruled that Mr Hyde was obliged to seek leave to proceed against the first defendant pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2. At one stage in this appeal the appellants were seeking to challenge this decision. Ultimately that challenge was not pursued.

Mr Hyde sought leave in a Notice of Motion filed on 15 May 1992. The IRFB filed its own Notice of Motion seeking to have service set aside and a declaration made that the Court had no jurisdiction over it. On 17 December the Master refused leave to proceed and made a consequential order setting aside service on the IRFB. He found against Mr Hyde because there was no evidence to show that the Laws of the Game as they stood at the time of the injury were insufficient to avoid the type of injury sustained by the plaintiff; and no evidence as to the potential Laws which would have prevented the injury.

Mr Hyde appealed. Dr Vanderfield countered with an application to set aside the Master's order appointing him as the representative of the IRFB. The IRFB filed a Notice of Contention claiming to have the decision of the Master affirmed upon the additional ground that there was no legal entity recognised in law against whom the plaintiff could enforce any cause of action. The appeal was heard by Badgery-Parker J in July 1993. Responding conditionally to
Dr Vanderfield's application, Mr Hyde sought leave to make further amendments to the Statement of Claim. These amendments included the joinder of representative defendants in lieu of Dr Vanderfield, being persons who would represent IRFB Member Unions.

Mr Hyde's appeal was dismissed by Badgery-Parker J on 10 February 1994. His
Honour referred to the status of the IRFB as an unincorporated body and to evidence that established that the Board had held all annual meetings between and 1986 in Europe. He held that it was fundamental that the IRFB was not a corporation, but an unincorporated association. As such, it had no legal identity and was incapable of incurring legal liabilities: Smith v
Yarnold [[1969] 2 NSWR 410.] The learned judge recognised that there could be exceptional cases where all of the members of an unincorporated association were found to have been carrying on a relevant activity, thereby exposing themselves to damages in tort (Kennaway v Thompson <case>; [[1980] All ER 329]; Evans versus Waitemata District Pony Club [(1974) 1 NZLR ).]
It was held impossible to apply these principles to the Member Unions of the
IRFB, several of which were themselves unincorporated associations.

His Honour recognised that the alternative would be to fix liability upon those members of the association who held office or constituted the association's board of management. If any persons associated with the IRFB were to be held liable for the form of the Laws of the Game and for failure to amend them, they were those who had been Members of the Board in 1986 and earlier years. It was necessary that those persons be sued as individuals.
Accordingly, he ruled that the IRFB was not a proper defendant and that the position could not be cured by appointment of any representative party under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p8) r13. The judge therefore concluded that Mr Hyde should not have leave to proceed, and that service of the originating process effected upon the IRFB by service on its purported representative should be set aside. Mr Hyde's appeal from the Master's decision was dismissed.

Badgery-Parker J then embarked upon an extended discussion of the matters Mr
Hyde would need to address in order to get leave to proceed with respect to suitably amended proceedings. This discussion involved reference to issues of foreseeability, proximity, policy and causation similar to those later debated before Grove J and before us. Badgery-Parker J expressed agreement with
McInerney J's reasons for having refused to strike out the original Statement of Claim. He also addressed proleptically the issue of forum non conveniens.

On 31 March 1994 Mr Hyde filed a Notice of Motion seeking leave to further amend the Statement of Claim, substitution of certain defendants and other relief. On 20 May 1994 that leave was granted by Badgery-Parker J who ordered, pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p20) r4(5A), that the amendment take effect from that date. The leave to amend added as defendants to the proceedings in lieu of the former first defendant: individuals (all resident outside Australia) to be joined under the designation "first defendants"; individuals (two resident in New Zealand and two in Australia) to be joined under the designation "eighth defendants";
New Zealand Rugby Football Union Incorporated ("NZRFU Inc") to be joined as the ninth defendant.

The basis upon which the new defendants were added appears in the Further
Amended Statement of Claim (subsequently filed on 25 May 1994). As to the proposed first and eighth defendants, it is alleged that they were representatives of the Member Unions on the Council of the IRFB who attended meetings of the Council with voting rights in that capacity. It is pleaded that they were the persons responsible for the conduct of the Council of the
IRFB in making, not making, changing or not changing, the Laws of the Game at the time relevant to Mr Hyde's injury. As to the ninth defendant, NZRFU Inc, it was sued as a corporation being a Member Union of the IRFB. Like ARFU Ltd (the second defendant) it was alleged that it bore responsibility for the Laws of the Game.

The proceedings were amended by joining the three categories of IRFB defendants referred to above without prior notice to those parties. In granting leave to amend Badgery-Parker J relied on [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p20) r4, because it was apparent that limitation issues had come into play.
However, his Honour was concerned to protect the rights of the newly joined parties, who had not been notified in advance of the orders being made. He did this by exercising the power under r4(5A) and ordering that the amendment take effect as at the date of the judgment (ie 20 May 1994).

These orders led to the filing of a Further Amended Statement of Claim on 25
May 1994. But Mr Hyde still faced the procedural difficulties of serving the newly joined defendants, all but two of whom were resident outside Australia.
Hunt and Hunt, who had previously represented the IRFB under certain conditions, declined to accept service. (There was nothing improper in this.)
Arrangements were then made for the Further Amended Statement of Claim to be served in New Zealand on the ninth defendant and upon London solicitors who agreed to accept service on behalf of the sixteen individuals that had been joined, except for one who was deceased. These included the two "eighth defendants" who resided in Australia.

Having been served in New Zealand and London respectively, the various IRFB defendants filed Notices of Motion seeking (pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r6A and [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p11) r8) to set aside service which had been effected outside Australia, a stay based on forum non conveniens, and other relief. Mr Hyde countered with a
Notice of Motion seeking leave to proceed against the IRFB defendants (pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2) and an order that the limitation period against the IRFB defendants be extended pursuant to the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

It was these two sets of applications that were heard by Grove J in July 1996.
The IRFB parties were successful. We shall return to Grove J's reasons after recounting the interlocutory stages in Mr Worsley's proceedings which had an identical outcome.

Worsley proceedings 
Mr Worsley's Statement of Claim was filed on 19 August 1993. As amended, it joins 12 (groups of) defendants. We have already indicated the local defendants joined in these proceedings. The IRFB defendants, and the allegations made against them by Mr Worsley are:-
Seven individuals are sued as the second defendant as representatives of
Member Unions on the Board of the IRFB.
ARFU Ltd (first defendant) and NZRFU Inc (twelfth defendant) are sued as
Member Unions of the IRFB in 1987. The NZRFU Inc is sued as representative of itself and:- "(a) All other members of the executive of unincorporated Member Unions (other than the Second Defendants) and 
All other incorporated Member Unions other than the First Defendant of the International Rugby Football Board as in 1987." 
The NZRFU Inc was served in New Zealand in September 1994. It thereupon applied by Notice of Motion for orders setting aside service; declaring that the Court had no jurisdiction over it; declining jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens; and other relief.

Solicitors in the United Kingdom representing the six living second defendants accepted service on their behalf. This was done in circumstances where it was made clear that the plaintiff was still required to seek leave to proceed.
Each of the IRFB defendants moved to set aside service and for other relief.
Mr Worsley moved for leave to proceed against the IRFB defendants pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2. Mr Worsley also sought leave nunc pro tunc to add NZRU Inc as a representative defendant, and for leave to file and serve the Amended
Statement of Claim previously filed. He also applied "if it be necessary" for an order extending the time for bringing his claim, under the [Limitation
Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

Judgment of Grove J 
The motions in the two sets of proceedings were heard together by Grove J in
July 1996. Judgment was delivered on 22 July 1996. The plaintiffs' applications were dismissed and the applications of the IRFB parties were upheld. It is from this judgment that these appeals are brought (by leave).

Grove J referred to the judgment of Badgery-Parker J where his Honour had discussed possible bases of liability by different IRFB parties. He acknowledged that the issues with which he was faced were "congruent with those hypothetically addressed by Badgery-Parker J" in the concluding portion of the latter's judgment. He recorded that Bank of America versus Bank of New
York [(1995) ATPR 41-390] had been delivered since the judgment of Badgery-Parker
J. Acknowledging the need for comity in decisions by single judges of the
Supreme Court, Grove J nevertheless came to a different conclusion than that expressed in Badgery-Parker J's extensive obiter dicta. The essential steps in his Honour's reasoning were as follows:
A party seeking leave to proceed must show a "good arguable case" before leave will be granted. (His Honour noted that the possibility that some other standard applied had been discussed in Bank of America.)
Irrespective of what test is applied, it was fatal to the plaintiffs' applications that "there is no foundational duty of care in the circumstances existing between the [IRFB] individuals sued and the plaintiffs". He held that there was no relevant proximity between the plaintiffs and the IRFB defendants. Foreseeability alone was insufficient (Jaensch versus Coffey  <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR 549] at 553, ). The plaintiffs' contentions would involve the persons attending IRFB meetings being in "close and direct affinity with players of Rugby Union all over the world". [Cf Jaensch at 579.] Circumstantial proximity was lacking between those attending an IRFB board meeting at which (upon notice having been given by a Member Union) changes of rules could be made and the plaintiffs who were participants in teams which had chosen to play by those rules of the game. "To categorize them as `rule makers' and `those bound by the rules' is to ignore or discount to irrelevance the voluntary nature of rulemaking and rule adoption." Earlier he had observed that: "... inherent in playing to rules is the election to adopt them in order, no doubt, to engage in competition against teams which have made like election.
There could be nothing to stop any persons responsible for the safety of those engaged in a sporting endeavour from changing their own rules to avoid perceived unreasonable risks to participants. Obviously constituents of other bodies which were unwilling for any reason to adopt such changes might not engage them in competition but alleged inability to change rules may be more precisely defined in terms of an accepted condition of playing a game in an identical fashion to like minded others." 
His Honour pointed out that the rules had existed in the same form for many years prior to alteration in 1988. This emphasised the lack of causal proximity between those defendants who attended meetings in 1986 and 1987 who were sued for having omitted to amend the rules: "as opposed to those persons who involved themselves in formulating them in the whole span of years (ignoring limitation barriers) since the school boy is said to have picked up the ball and run with it".

It was common ground before Grove J that no precedent recognised the cause of action propounded.
Grove J stated that, if the conclusion that no duty of care existed were incorrect, these matters were nevertheless apt to determine whether the plaintiffs had demonstrated a "good arguable case" in the context of the exercise of the discretion required by [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2. The learned judge declined to exercise that discretion in favour of granting leave to proceed. In doing so, he had regard to the following circumstances:- the exorbitant jurisdiction of requiring a foreigner to defend a claim before a court should be exercised with restraint especially in a context where the claim was statute-barred under the municipal law, as the present claims are: cf Leal versus Dunlop Bio-Processes Ltd [[1984] 2 All ER ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%202%20All%20ER%20207 "View LawCiteRecord" ); the difficulties faced by the plaintiffs in establishing liability against the IRFB defendants. Grove J highlighted the fact that no individual defendant alone could change the Laws of the Game, and that a change required notice from a Member Union and a majority vote of three-quarters of the persons present at a meeting. He also drew attention to the problem of remoteness of damage given the fact that the plaintiffs' teams ultimately chose to play by the promulgated rules.
In the course of his reasons, Grove J observed that the torts alleged against the IRFB defendants related to omissions at meetings held variously in
England, Scotland, Wales and France between 1980 and 1986. He held that the place of the relevant tort was outside New South Wales: cf Voth versus Manildra
Flour Mills Pty Ltd <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 538]; Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd versus Thompson [[1971] AC .] His
Honour did not elaborate upon the relevance of this observation.
Since the decision to refuse leave was based upon the matters referred to above, it was unnecessary for Grove J to deal in detail with the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) motions.
He neither refused the applications to extend time, nor ruled that they were bound to fail.
As regards Mr Worsley's application to join NZRFU Inc as a representative defendant, Grove J refused leave, adverting to the fact that the application was made 7 years after the cause of action was said to have arisen. It is apparent that he considered NZRFU Inc to be relevantly identical to the other
IRFB defendants.

Accordingly, the various motions on behalf of the plaintiffs for leave to proceed, extension of time and (in Mr Worsley's case) to add NZRFU Inc as a defendant were dismissed. On the motions by the IRFB parties, service was in each case set aside. The costs of all motions were ordered to follow the events.

Proceedings against defendants served outside Australia [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A provides a number of bases upon which, subject to rr 2 and 2A, originating process may be served outside Australia. Unlike the corresponding English rule, the grant of leave is not required prior to service. But if a defendant, having been served outside Australia, does not enter an appearance within the time limited for appearance, the plaintiff may not proceed against that defendant except with the leave of the Court (r2(1)). Where the defendant does not enter an appearance, the plaintiff must take the initiative by seeking leave to proceed. Alternatively (and concurrently) the defendant may move to set aside service in reliance upon [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r6A and [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p11) r8. Where a defendant is served outside Australia, a notice in prescribed form must be served with originating process [(Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s10.html) r2A), thereby alerting the defendant to the relevant provisions in the Rules.

In Bank of America versus Bank of New York, this Court affirmed that an applicant for leave to proceed against a foreign defendant must establish that the proceedings fall within one of the paragraphs of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A. The submission rejected in that case was to the effect that the discretion under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2 could be exercised even in a case not falling within [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A. As Meagher JA stated (at 40,340): "... Rule 1A is still the governing Rule ...".

The present proceedings are quite different from Bank of America in that the appellants do not rely on the submission rejected in that case. Indeed, they claim that they can satisfy the jurisdictional pre-conditions under no less than four separate paragraphs of r1A namely (a), (d), (e) and (i).

The satisfaction of any one of these pre-conditions would establish the jurisdictional nexus which enlivens the discretion to grant leave to proceed under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2. However, the discretion to grant leave must still be exercised.
Conversely, the Court could still exercise its discretion under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r6A even though service of the originating process would have been authorised by one or more of the paragraphs in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A. The discretionary phase is separate and distinct (see Seaconsar Far
East Ltd versus Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran [[1994] AC 438)], although it is not at large.

Since the IRFB defendants were served outside Australia and did not enter an appearance, the plaintiffs required leave to proceed [(Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s10.html) r2).
Conversely, the IRFB defendants were entitled to move the court for various orders, including orders setting aside service of the originating process or declining in the court's discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in the proceedings [(Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s10.html) r6A, [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p11) r8). It is convenient at this stage to set out those rules: [10.2] Leave to proceed where no appearance (1) Where an originating process is served on the defendant outside Australia and the defendant does not enter an appearance within the time limit for appearance, the plaintiff shall not proceed against the defendant except with the leave of the Court.

A motion for leave under subrule (1) may be made without serving notice of the motion on the defendant.
 [10.6A] Setting aside service outside Australia 
A (1) The Court may make an order of a kind referred to in [Part 11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p11) [rule 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s8.html) (which relates to setting aside etc originating process) on application by a person on whom an originating process is served outside Australia.

Without limiting subrule (1), the Court may make an order under this rule on the ground - that the service of the originating process is not authorised by these rules; or that this Court is an inappropriate forum for the trial of the proceedings.
 [11.8] Setting aside originating process, etc (1) The Court may, on application made by a defendant to any originating process on notice of motion filed within the time fixed by subrule (2), by order - set aside the originating process; set aside the service of the originating process on the defendant; declare that the originating process has not been duly served on the defendant; discharge any order giving leave to serve the originating process outside the State or confirming service of the originating process outside the State; discharge any order extending the validity for service of the originating process; protect or release - property seized, or threatened with seizure, in the proceedings; or property subject to an order restraining its disposition or disposal or in relation to which such an order is sought; declare that the Court has no jurisdiction over the defendant in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings; decline in its discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in the proceedings; grant such other relief as it thinks appropriate.

Notice of a motion under subrule (1) - may be filed without entering an appearance; shall bear a note "The defendant's address for service is" and state the address; shall be filed within the time limited for entering an appearance.

The making of an application under subrule (1) shall not be treated as a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the Court.

Satisfying [Part 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) rule 1A: the applicable standard and to what it refers 
The respondents' submissions proceeded on the basis that, in order to satisfy one of the jurisdictional bases in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r1A, each appellant, as an applicant for leave under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10) r2, first had to establish that he had a cause of action against the respondents to a particular standard: i.e. either a "good" or "strong arguable case". Grove J accepted the test of a "good arguable case" on the basis of
English authorities to which we will refer below.

Before discussing the English authorities, it is relevant to note that the
English Rule has always been in a different form to that applicable in New
South Wales. Order 11, r1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (UK) corresponds to the present [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/index.html#p10), r1A of this Court's Rules. Each sets out a list of paragraphs providing a jurisdictional nexus as the basis of permitting service. However, O 11, r4 has, at all relevant times, required a prior grant of leave to serve out of the jurisdiction, and restricted the basis upon which that leave might be granted. Order 11, r4(2) has provided at all times relevant to the understanding of the English authorities: "No such leave shall be granted unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court that the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Order." 
The reasoning in the English cases is by way of exegesis of what "proper" means in this context. The judicial history of this rule is set out by Lord
Goff of Chieveley in Seaconsar at 449-457.

The formulation which found favour with Grove J, ie a "good arguable case", had a rather inauspicious origin in the following passage from the speech of
Lord Simonds in Vitkovice Horni A Hutni Tezirstvo versus Korner [ [1951] AC ] at -880: "...whether upon all the materials then before him, the judge is of opinion that the case - I can find no better word - is a proper one to be heard in our
Courts. The description "a good arguable case" has been suggested and I do not quarrel with it." 
The proposition with which Lord Simonds was not prepared to quarrel has since been adopted as the relevant degree of proof in the White Book, which has stated for some number of editions: "Good arguable case: This is the degree of proof required by the Court to show that the case falls within one of the sub-paragraphs of O.11, r1(1) so as to give it jurisdiction to consider the application." (Supreme Court
Practice 1997 11/1/6) 
It is now accepted as the English test (see Seaconsar).

The first issue to decide is whether this Court should adopt the "good arguable case" test. We conclude that it should, provided it is understood that the test is to be applied to establishing the jurisdictional nexus. It is difficult to see any difference between a "prima facie" test and an "arguable case" test. (See Underwriting Insurance (Aust) Pty Ltd versus Barden, Supreme
Court of New South Wales, Rolfe J, unreported 19 October 1994.) The difference, if any, arises by the introduction of a qualifying adjective before "arguable" namely, either "good" or "strong". Should any such adjective be introduced for purposes of the Rules of this Court? 
Rule 1A(1), like its analogues, contains a series of objectively stated pre- conditions: "contract", "tort", "cause of action", "damage", "domicile", breach" etc. A mere allegation is not enough. However, the courts have always been conscious that they should not embark at this stage upon a trial of substantive causes of action, such as whether there was a "tort" or a "breach of contract". The context in which the nexus issue has to be determined is the assumption of jurisdiction by the court. Plainly, the court will not assume jurisdiction where it appears that the applicant has no arguable case. Does the applicant have to show more? In our opinion he or she may have to do so, but the strength to which the "arguable case" must be a "good" one will vary with the applicable provision or provisions of Rule 1A and the circumstances.

Until 1988 Pt 10 of the New South Wales [Supreme Court
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/) set out in r1 the criteria required to be met in order to permit service outside New
South Wales (the equivalent of r1A). The system was then, as it was and remains in England, that prior leave of the Court was necessary before service outside New South Wales could occur. However, such service could only occur: "(2) Where the Court is satisfied on the following matters - 
That the proceedings are proceedings to which r1 applies; and 
That the Applicant has a prima facie case for the relief which he seeks." 
In the Bank of America case, this Court rejected the proposition that the change to the Rules in 1988 had effected a significant transformation in the approach to be adopted with respect to these matters. As noted above, the
Court rejected the proposition that the discretion under Pt10 r2 was enlivened even when the case did not fall within one of the particular sub-rules of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r1A.

In Bank of America the Court was concerned with the subject of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r2(a) of the old Rules ie the link to the pre-conditions. That case was not concerned with [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r2(b) of the old rules which required "a prima facie case for the relief" sought. This latter provision has no equivalent in the new rules. The general issue of strength of the case is a relevant consideration for the exercise of the separate discretion under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r2. But no particular test of proof is there stipulated.

Before us, the respondents propounded a higher test of a "strong arguable case". It finds its origin in the speech of Lord Radcliffe in Vitkovice (at 883): "... A case does not sufficiently appear to be a proper case for the purposes of this Order unless on consideration of all admissible material there remains a strong argument for the opinion that the qualifying conditions are indeed satisfied." 
His Lordship thought that a "prima facie case" may be too low a test and said he preferred "a strong case for argument" (at 884). This has not prevailed as a test in England, and there is no reason to adopt it here. However, what is significant in his Lordship's reasoning is that the test is to be applied to the satisfaction of "the qualifying conditions", not to the merits of the case.

The relevant subject matter is also confirmed in the judgment of Meagher JA in this Court in Bank of America where his Honour said: "... The question which arises is whether the plaintiff, in a rule 2 application, must prove that he falls within one of the categories specified in r1A on a prima facie basis, or whether he must prove the existence of a merely arguable case, or whether he should prove something else." (40,340 emphasis added) 
In that case it was not necessary to determine the actual level of proof for the test. However, the decision confirms that the subject matter of the test is whether or not one of the pre-conditions of r1A has in fact been satisfied.
This is a distinction of significance in this case bearing in mind that the matters in issue are whether the proceedings are "founded on" (paras (a), and (e)) or "for" (para (e)) particular types of claim; and whether the appellants have satisfied para (i)'s low threshold of showing that the foreign defendants were to be "properly joined" as parties to the existing proceedings.

In Seaconsar, in the course of his analysis of the case law, Lord Goff of Chieveley (at 454) explained Vitkovice in terms that indicated that the relevant test of "good arguable case" had to be applied to each of the relevant aspects of the pre-conditions of the English Rule there relied on, namely, "all three elements of contract, breach and place of breach" (454B).
His Lordship went on to indicate that it was wrong to apply any such test of "good arguable case" to the merits of the Plaintiff's case as a whole (454D).
Whilst his Lordship acknowledged that questions of strength of the case were relevant to the exercise of the final discretion, he concluded (at 456): "But if jurisdiction is established under r1(1), and it is also established that England is the forum conveniens, I can see no good reason why any particular degree of cogency should be required in relation to the merits of the plaintiff's case." 
His Lordship further concluded (457B) that the English Court of Appeal had erred in considering it necessary to establish a "good arguable case on the merits" of the existence of contract made within the jurisdiction under the
English counterpart of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r1A(1)(c)(i). He held that: "... it was enough for Seaconsar to establish ... that there was ... a serious issue to be tried." 
A similar approach is appropriate for the Rules of this Court.

The appellants claim to have satisfied [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r1A(1) on at least four bases. They invoke paras: "(a) Where the proceedings are founded on a cause of action arising in the
State; 
Where the proceedings are founded on a tort committed in the State; 
Where the proceedings, wholly or partly, are founded on, or are for the recovery of damages in respect of, damage suffered in the State caused by a tortious act or omission wherever occurring; 
Where the proceedings are properly brought against the person served or to be served in the State and the person to be served outside the State is properly joined as a party to the proceedings." 
On the facts of the present case there is no material difference between paras and (d). The application of each involves the assessment of whether there was a tort, and whether it arose in or was committed in the State. The application of para (e) also raises the issue as to whether there was a tortious act or omission. If this is established to the requisite standard, then the paragraph is clearly satisfied because the plaintiffs suffered damage in the State.

It was ultimately common ground that service was authorised, at least under para (i). Paragraph (i) demonstrates the proposition that the strength of the case against the foreign defendant does not arise as a central or necessary consideration in the jurisdictional nexus, unless it is to be read - as the
English cases do (because of the unique terms of O 11 r4(2)) - into the word "properly".

Exercising the discretion: "exorbitant" jurisdiction and the principle of restraint 
Where a plaintiff establishes jurisdiction under r1A to the requisite standard, there remains a discretion whether leave should be given or, alternatively, service set aside. As stated above, the discretionary phase is separate and distinct (Seaconsar). The question is whether, the plaintiff having passed through the nexus gateway, it is appropriate to grant leave to proceed to trial against the non-resident, non-submitting defendant.

In exercising the discretion, the court is not involved in trying the proceedings, but neither is it confined to the narrow issue of determining whether the proceedings are bound to fail according to the standard discussed in General Steel Industries Ltd versus Commissioner for Railways  <case>; [(1964) 112 CLR 125.] Whichever side of the coin is examined (r2 or r6A), the discretion is not expressly confined (Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd versus Wordplex Information Systems
Ltd [(1990) 19 NSWLR 146] at -155). In these circumstances, principle cautions against attempts to circumscribe a discretion that is not bounded by verbal formulae in the rules themselves: see generally Pambula District Hospital versus Herriman [(1988) NSWLR 387] at 400-402. The merits of the plaintiff's case are not the only matters relevant to such discretion (see Esanda Finance Corporation
Ltd at 154-155).

There are statements advocating caution and restraint before a foreign defendant is put to the expense and inconvenience of being forced to defend in the jurisdiction: see eg Vitkovice Horni a Hutni Tezirstvo versus Korner [[1951] AC 869] at 877 (Lord Simonds); Spiliada Maritime Corporation v
Cansulex Ltd [[1987] AC 460] at 481 (Lord Goff); Contender 1 Ltd versus LEP
International Pty Ltd <case>; [(1988) 82 ALR 394] at 398-399 (Brennan J). Grove J indicated agreement with these sentiments, stating that "the exorbitant jurisdiction of requiring a foreigner to defend a claim before a court should be exercised with restraint".

This area of legal doctrine finds its origins over a century ago. The seminal decision is the first reported judgment after O 11, r1 was adopted in England.
In The Societe Generale de Paris versus Dreyfus Brothers [(1885) 29 Ch D ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281885%29%2029%20Ch%20D%20239 "View LawCiteRecord" ) Pearson J, in a passage which has been repeatedly cited since that time, said (at 242-243): "But of course it becomes a very serious question, and ought always to be considered a very serious question, whether or not ... it is necessary for the jurisdiction of the Court to be invoked, and whether this Court ought to put a foreigner, who owes no allegiance here, to the inconvenience and annoyance of being brought to contest his rights in this country, and I for one say, most distinctly, that I think this Court ought to be exceedingly careful before it allows a writ to be served out of the jurisdiction." 
The principle of restraint is frequently justified on the basis that the jurisdiction capable of being assumed by provisions such as [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r1A is "exorbitant". Unfortunately, this expression is more likely to confuse than illuminate, as we shall endeavour to demonstrate later in this judgment.

Contemporary developments in communication and transport make the degree of "inconvenience and annoyance" of a qualitatively different order to that which existed in 1885. It follows that a modern court applying the Rules must be sensitive to the actual degree of "inconvenience and annoyance" which will be imposed in the circumstances of a particular case, rather than assuming that any person or resident abroad must suffer such consequences in substantial degree. See Earthworks & Quarries Ltd versus F T Eastment & Sons Pty
Ltd <case>; [[1966] VR 24](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1966%5d%20VR%2024 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 28 (Dean J).

This is particularly the case where, as in the present case, one is dealing with a defendant that cannot be said to have a definite residence at all. This
Court has increasingly before it defendants or prospective defendants which operate on a global scale. The IRFB is a genuinely international organisation.
It conducts a global enterprise which operates throughout the world. It has a direct influence on conduct which occurs within Australia. If perceived as a multinational unincorporated body the IRFB's members include a resident of
Australia (ARFU Ltd). If perceived as a board of individuals with oversight, its members include Australian representatives who are residents here.

Perhaps unusually for an international organisation, the IRFB does not have a separate corporate personality. This unquestionably complicates matters insofar as individuals are sought to be joined. Nevertheless, there is no difference in principle between this organisation and any other international organisation. In a case of a genuinely global enterprise operating in much the same way in many different nations, including Australia, the Court should be slow to impose on plaintiffs greater difficulties than those which would apply in the case of a defendant domiciled in Australia.

It also bears remembering that any body, corporate or incorporate, requires agents such as legal practitioners to defend proceedings. The ease with which such agents may be contacted by phone, facsimile, e-mail and other modern means of communication do not differ significantly whether the message passes across the city or across the world.

While it is appropriate to require a "good arguable case" for purposes of determining whether or not the matter falls within one of the pre-conditions set out in r1A, the strength of the evidence needed to establish a cause of action/tort as a condition of leave to proceed based on paras (a), (d) or (e) should not be regarded as much, if anything, more than is required to survive a strike out application in accordance with the well known principles applicable in this Court. Once the applicant for leave passes that hurdle, it is unlikely that questions of the merits of the case will play much role in the exercise of the ultimate discretion. In Seaconsar, Lord Goff said (at 456) that, if jurisdiction is established and if forum non conveniens is not shown, "I can see no good reason why any particular degree of cogency should be required in relation to the merits of the plaintiff's case". We agree.

One of the submissions made by the respondents was that the Rules, and in particular the various pre-conditions to be found in r1A, must be construed strictly in favour of the foreigner because any action against a foreign defendant falls within what has sometimes been described as "the exorbitant jurisdiction of the Court". Alternatively, it was submitted that Grove J was correct to have paid regard to this consideration as a ground for declining to exercise his discretion in favour of the plaintiffs. The authority relied on for these propositions was Lord Diplock in Siskina (Cargo Owners) versus Distos
Campania Naviera SA [[1979] AC 210] at 254-255. Lord
Diplock said with reference to O 11, r1(1): "In several of the cases specified in the sub-rules (a) to (o) the jurisdiction exercisable over foreigners by the High Court is wider than that which is recognised in English law as being possessed by courts of foreign countries. These are "exorbitant" jurisdictions which run counter to the normal rules of comity among civilised nations. For this reason it has long been held that where there is any room for doubt as to their meaning provisions of the sub-rules are to be strictly construed in favour of the foreigner." 
His Lordship relied as authority for this proposition on the judgment of
Farwell LJ in The Hagen [[1908] P 189] at 201 where he had said: "If on the construction of any of the sub-heads O.11 there was any doubt, it ought to be resolved in favour of the foreigner." 
That is not the same as saying that the particular pre-conditions for service should be "strictly construed". In any event, we do not believe there is any warrant for anything other than a normal approach to construction as to the meaning of the various paras of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r1A. Certainly, it is no justification for extending the dictum in The
Hagen into the area occupied by the discretion to grant leave (see
Buttes Gas & Oil Co versus Hammer [[1971] 3 All ER 1025] at per Megaw LJ). It is instructive to note the reason why Lord Diplock, and others, have felt it appropriate to describe the jurisdiction in such a case as an "exorbitant" one: it is because of the lack of comity involved in asserting jurisdiction in an action in personam over a foreigner. This, and fear of retaliation by foreign governments offended by an excessive claim of jurisdiction over their nationals, were the reasons leading to the cautious approach adopted by English cases in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (see L Collins, Essays in International Litigation and the Conflict of Laws, 1994, Claredon Press, 227-230).

For the reasons we have already mentioned, such an approach is not appropriate in the case of a defendant that cannot truly be said to be a resident of a particular overseas jurisdiction, but rather is a global enterprise operating in many different countries including Australia. In the usual case such a defendant will be a corporation. But the fact that the IRFB is unincorporated, with a constitution which allocates differing functions to member unions and a board of directors, is a complicating feature giving rise to no difference of principle.

There is another reason why Lord Diplock's stated reason undermines his conclusion in the 1990s, at least in proceedings touching events occurring in
Europe. Courts in those jurisdictions appear ready to assume jurisdiction in civil and commercial claims every bit as "exorbitant" as those attracting [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p10) r1A. (Indeed, Article 14 of the French Civil Code allows a French national to sue any foreigner in the French court, whether or not the case has any connection with France: Collins op cit 207; Schlesinger, Comparative
Law 4th ed, 802-805. We are not suggesting that Australian conflicts law should react expansively in response to this much criticised example of exorbitant jurisdiction.) In such circumstances the sorely overstretched notion of comity (cf Cheshire and North, Private International Law 11th ed , 338) ought not to be invoked as a justification for a doctrine of restraint that is capable of frustrating the expansive objectives of Pt 10.

In our view, the expression "exorbitant jurisdiction" is unhelpful, indeed misleading, in the present context. Stemming from a view expressed by Lord
Diplock in Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation versus Kuwait Insurance Co [[1984] AC 50](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1984%5d%20AC%2050 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 65, one finds discussion of the concept of "exorbitant jurisdiction" which treats the term as equivalent to jurisdiction going beyond that recognised at common law (see eg Spiliada at 481, Voth at 551).
However, a different meaning is attributed to the term in academic writings relating to the enforcement of judgments (see eg Joseph Halpern, "'Exorbitant
Jurisdiction' and the Brussels Convention: Toward a Theory of Restraint" Yale Journal of World Public Order 369; Kathryn A Russell, "Exorbitant Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments: The Brussels System as an Impetus for United States Action" (1993) 19 Syracuse J Int'l L and Com ). At least in the latter context, the expression refers to situations where courts assume jurisdiction on bases involving inadequate connections between the forum and the subject matter of the particular claim. Thus, the Brussels
Convention of 1968 (the European Communities Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters) treats as exorbitant jurisdiction those bases prohibited in Article 3 as a ground giving rise to an obligation to recognise a foreign judgment. These are: - personal service during the temporary presence of the defendant in the territory of the forum; - defendant doing business in the territory of the forum (unless the action arises out of that business); - presence of seizure of the defendant's property (unless the action concerns that property or it serves as security) and attachment as the basis of quasi- in-rem jurisdiction; - unilateral specification of the forum by the plaintiff; and - nationality, domicile, or habitual residence of the plaintiff.

In our view, it is inappropriate to heap all categories of extended jurisdiction in the same basket, and (having applied the label "exorbitant") to apply a principle of restraint in construing the rules or exercising the discretion conferred by them. Restraint may be appropriate where inadequate connections are lacking, as with the examples stated above. But there seems no compelling basis why a doctrine of restraint should be invoked at the discretionary phase to dent the thrust of the rules, at least in those categories of case where a clear and objective link with the territory of the forum is present. A fortiori where the jurisdiction assumed under the rules is similar to or less "exorbitant" than that exercised by many countries. See
Collins, "Temporary Presence, Exorbitant Jurisdiction and the US Supreme
Court" (1991) 107 LQR 10 at 13-14. Paragraphs (a), (d), (e) and (i) all fall within such categories.

As Lord Goff of Chieveley said, speaking for a unanimous House of Lords in
Spiliada (at 481): "I myself feel that the word "exorbitant" is, as used in the present context, an old-fashioned word which perhaps carries unfortunate overtones: it means no more than that the exercise of the jurisdiction is extraordinary in the sense explained by Lord Diplock in the Amin Rasheed case." 
In Amin Rasheed, Lord Diplock said ([1984] AC 50 at 65): "My Lords, the jurisdiction exercised by an English court over a foreign corporation which has no place of business in this country, as a result of granting leave under RSC O.11, r1(1)(f) for service out of the jurisdiction of a writ on that corporation, is an exorbitant jurisdiction, ie it is one which, under general English conflict rules, an English court would not recognise as possessed by any foreign court in the absence of some treaty providing for such recognition. Comity thus dictates that the judicial discretion to grant leave under this paragraph of RSC O.11, r(1)(1) should be exercised with circumspection in cases where there exists an alternative forum, viz the courts of the foreign country where the proposed defendant does carry on business, and whose jurisdiction would be recognised under English conflict
Rules." 
None of Lord Diplock's reasons justifying "circumspection" or "restraint" apply in the instant case. Nor does "comity" dictate it. It is not the case that IRFB defendants carry on business in a foreign country and not in
Australia. Nor can it be said that there is a clear alternative forum, namely, the courts of the country where it does carry on business, and where proceedings could plainly be instituted. And if, as we later conclude, the appellants' reliance on r1A(1)(d) (tort committed in the State) is justified, principles of comity would be readily satisfied.

It is clear that the inappropriateness of the local forum may be a basis for exercising the discretion against a plaintiff (see Pt 10 r6A(2)(b), Pt 11 r8(1)(h)). But care needs to be exercised lest the discretion under the rules is used to undermine the principles of forum non conveniens stated in
Voth. If the application of Voth would not lead to the staying of local proceedings then, in our view, it would be wrong to take account of the "foreignness" of the particular litigation as a basis for declining to exercise the discretion in favour of a plaintiff if it were otherwise appropriate to do so. There is no reason why the principles of forum non conveniens should not in principle apply equally to cases involving service out of the jurisdiction under the Rules as to cases where the defendant was served as of right within Australia. After all, the common law's transient or "tag" jurisdiction is no guarantee of a genuine connection with the forum.
Recognition of the existence of a general power to decline jurisdiction on forum non conveniens grounds was a much later development than conferral by statute or rules of power to serve process ex juris. And forum non conveniens is a more finely tuned principle. This judicial power to decline the exercise of jurisdiction offers a principled and non-discriminatory basis for segregating appropriate and inappropriate cases for litigation in the forum. Implicit in what we have said, is the conclusion that r6A picks up the principles of forum non conveniens as they are enunciated from time to time in Australian law. This requires fidelity to Voth and not Spiliada where there is inconsistency. We do not agree with the suggestion to the contrary of Rogers CJ Comm D in Pendal Nominees Pty Ltd versus M & A
Investments Pty Ltd [(1989) 18 NSWLR 383] at -397.

In our view Grove J erred, first, in directing himself to approach the discretion with "restraint" as reflected in the judicial statements we have discussed, and secondly, in applying those statements to the facts of this case.

Applying the principles we have enunciated, we note that the appellants have clearly established the jurisdictional nexus required by r10A(1)(i). The contrary was not suggested. And the appellants have undoubtedly suffered damage in the State for the purposes of r10A(1)(e). At this stage it is appropriate to consider whether they established additional grounds of jurisdictional nexus by virtue of showing a good arguable case of a cause of action (para (a)) being a tort (para (d)) or a tortious act or omission (para ). The location of that tort is relevant to paras (a) and (e) and we shall return to the locus issue later.

A good arguable case of a tort: the duties owed by sporting administrators 
Grove J was of the view that the law would not recognise a duty of care owed by the IRFB individuals to the plaintiffs, and that the appellants would have real difficulties in establishing causation and meeting a defence that their damage was too remote. His Honour did not find it necessary to examine the likelihood of success in establishing breach, beyond highlighting the facts that no individual IRFB defendant alone could change the Laws of the Game, and that a change required notice from a Member Union and a majority vote of three-quarters of the persons present at a meeting. As we understand it, all parties have run their cases to date upon the basis that establishing breach would be a matter for trial if the proceedings advance.

In concluding that there was "no foundational duty of care in the circumstances existing between the [IRFB] individuals sued and the plaintiffs", Grove J differed from McInerney J and Badgery-Parker J who had refused to terminate the proceedings on this basis at this stage of the litigation. For reasons set out below, we disagree with Grove J's opinion that the appellants should not be allowed to go to trial on the issue of duty of care, with its attendant issues of causation and remoteness. And we conclude that his finding of absence of a viable case of duty of care vitiated the exercise of the discretion, notwithstanding that Grove J exercised the discretion adversely against the appellants on alternative grounds.

Plainly leave should not be granted under Pt10 r2 if the proceedings are liable to be struck out at a later stage. If it appears clearly to the court that there is no breach of contract or no tort, nor any other cause of action, then not only will the relevant subparagraph of r1A not be satisfied because there is not even an arguable case, let alone a good arguable case, of the relevant jurisdictional nexus, but furthermore the discretion under r2 would properly be exercised against the applicant for leave.

Grove J correctly approached the issue in the following passage: "I turn next to a matter which in my view is fatal to the plaintiffs' applications irrespective of what test is applied. I hold that there is no foundational duty of care in the circumstances existing between the individuals sued and the plaintiffs." 
He went on to say: "I consider that there is no relevant proximity between the plaintiffs and the intended foreign defendants." 
If his Honour was correct in this conclusion, then plainly he was correct to refuse leave. This is what this Court did in Bank of America where the
Court found that there was no relevant contract, nor any other cause of action.

The determination of whether sporting administrators owe a duty of care to participants in a sport in the formulation of the rules of their respective games is, as all parties have stated, a matter of novelty. It plainly raises significant issues of policy. Although the materials placed before Grove J at this interlocutory stage of the proceedings barely touched upon the relevant considerations, his Honour was acutely aware of such considerations, as the following passages of his reasoning demonstrate: "The IRFB parties point out, (and the plaintiffs did not dispute) that there is no precedent recognising a cause of action by an injured person alleging breach of a duty of care on the part of a voluntary association arising from exercising or failing to exercise rule-making powers. This includes the absence of precedent where there is geographical, national and any other sort of physical proximity. Novelty is not a bar to the plaintiffs' success but the absence of precedent is highly suggestive that community standards would be compatible with the perception that a duty of care did not exist in those circumstances.
 ....

Whilst it has become unfashionable in recent years to refer to the concept of remoteness I do not understand it to be forbidden. The remoteness between the plaintiffs and the IRFB parties is extreme. The plaintiffs' propositions involve a potential liability of some voluntary administrators of a (then amateur) sporting code to any member of a team which through association chooses to play by the promulgated rules anywhere in the world. To the comment that if potential liability were declared insurance can no doubt be negotiated against risks of those magnitudes and dimensions I would respectfully express the greatest scepticism." 
The issues of policy which arise in the extension of a duty of care to novel situations require careful assessment. (See eg The Hon Justice M H McHugh "Neighbourhood, Proximity and Reliance" in Finn (ed) Essays on Torts 1989 esp 39-42; Bell Policy Arguments in Judicial Decisions 1983, Chapter III "Duty of Care in Negligence"; Stanton "Incremental Approaches to the Duty of
Care" in Mullany (ed) Torts in the Nineties 1997. Professor Jane
Stapleton has recently demonstrated why courts examining duty of care in novel situations need to abandon the language of "tests" such as proximity. No substantive "test" for duty captures the rich diversity of legal concerns and policy factors which inform judicial reasoning in this area. Policy factors have always operated, usually sub silentio. They require explicit acknowledgement and weighing. See J Stapleton, "Duty of Care Factors: a
Selection from the Judicial Menus" in Cane and Stapleton (eds), The Law of
Obligations, Essays in Celebration of John Fleming OUP, 1998.

The materials put before his Honour did not, and did not purport to, cover the full range of issues that are relevant to making such a relevant assessment.
Granted that a plaintiff propounding a novel tort must show more than foreseeability of damage (see generally W D & H O Wills (Aust) Ltd v
State Rail Authority [(1997) 43 NSWLR 338] at -351), we consider that sufficient has been shown to permit the matter to go to trial. There are clear indications that the IRFB saw itself as the law- giver for the sport of rugby and that it regarded the safety of players as an important factor. Serious injuries are not uncommon. There is evidence of assumption of control by the members of the IRFB Board and tenable allegations of reliance by players of the sport. This is arguably the basis of an assumption of responsibility giving rise to a prima facie duty of care, albeit one that may be relatively easy to discharge. The class of potentially affected persons may be very large, but it is finite and readily identifiable.

To deny any duty of care in relation to the sports administrator with respect to the running of games must depend on policy factors that have regard to the public utility of sports and the undesirable consequences of placing legally enforceable obligations upon administrators who may be part-time amateurs. For some sports these analogies may be compelling, but for others quite unrealistic. Sports administration in the modern era bears many of the trappings of big business, such as corporate controlling bodies, paid full time executives and administrators, insurance and marketing and sponsorship arrangements designed to attract viewers rather than merely enable the game to be played for the enjoyment of the players. Even judged by the standards of -86, the sport of rugby was a world-wide enterprise with major commercial potential.

In argument, counsel for the respondents raised the spectre of the popular sport that prices itself out of existence as its rule-making administrator is crushed by legal claims by athletes. Like all floodgates submissions, this needs to be taken with a grain of salt. After all, opposing players can already sue each other for intentionally and negligently inflicted injuries (cf Rootes versus Shelton <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 383]; Johnson versus Frazer [(1990) 21 NSWLR 89)]; they can sue the referee for negligent failure to enforce the rules (Smoldon v
Whitworth, English Court of Appeal, 17 December 1996, unreported (see The
Times, December 18, 1996)); and the sports administrator that dons the mantle of an occupier assumes well-established duties of care towards players (Trevali Pty Ltd (trading as Campbelltown Roller Rink) versus Haddad [(1989)
ATR 80-286)], spectators (Hall versus Brooklands Auto Racing Club [[1933] KB 205)](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1933%5d%201%20KB%20205 "View LawCiteRecord" ) and (in the case of golf clubs) neighbours. A duty of care is not negated merely because participation in the sport is voluntary (Rootes).
Although it was common ground in the appeal that no case could be found suggesting any duty of care such as the one propounded here, such a duty was found (but on the facts not breached) in Hamstra versus British Columbia Rugby
Union [(1989) 1 CCLT (2d) 78 (BCSC).]
That case involved a young rugby player who was rendered quadriplegic when a scrum collapsed.

It is not desirable that at this preliminary and interlocutory stage the Court of Appeal should express any views, one way or another, as to the existence of the relevant duty beyond the arguable case stage. It is sufficient to note that the boundaries of liability for sporting injuries have been expanding.
(See eg Kelly "Prospective Liabilities of Sports Supervisors" [(1969) 63 ALJ ]; Opie "Sports Associations and their Legal Environment" in McGregor Lowndes et al (eds) Legal Issues for Non-Profit Associations
LBC Sydney 1996 esp 87-89; Opie "Referee Liability in Sport: Negligent Rule
Enforcement and Smoldon versus Whitworth" [(1997) 5 Torts LJ 17.)] 
The application before his Honour was not an appropriate occasion to determine a triable issue in an evolving area that is dependent on evidence and submission addressing the policy matters to which we have adverted. Cf
Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia versus Hunt [(1982) 44 ALR .]
His Honour's conclusion may ultimately be established to be correct and no duty of care held to exist. Alternatively, the appellants may fail to establish causation against the IRFB defendants. These matters should await the outcome of the proceedings.

In the event, a number of local manifestations of the sport of rugby union remain in the proceedings with allegations that they enforced or failed to amend or vary the rules of the game. Indeed the ARFU Ltd is a party both as the Australian body and as a member union of the IRFB. It has not sought to be excused in either capacity. In such circumstances, the fact that some of these defendants would allege that they were inhibited, or even unable, to effect a relevant variation which would have avoided the risk of injury, is a matter that should make the Court hesitate before excusing any party whose conduct had an affect on the rules under which the games in which the injuries were caused were played. This seems to be the very function of para (i).

Grove J correctly observed that the strength of the case with respect to the existence of a duty of care and its breach was relevant to the exercise of the discretion. We have not overlooked the fact that Grove J indicated that he considered the exercise of discretion independently of his view that no duty of care existed. However, in doing so he had regard to a perception of the appellants' difficulties in proving the necessary elements of the torts they relied upon. In our view, the proper weighing of those difficulties cannot be divorced from the consideration of the policy issues and the trends towards liability in this area to which we have adverted.

Location of the putative tort 
The appellants also challenged the finding by Grove J that the tort alleged against the IRFB defendants occurred where the IRFB held its meetings, this being where the negligent omissions allegedly occurred. It was submitted that the tort occurred in New South Wales because the injury occurred through application of the existing Laws, thereby demonstrating that damage suffered here was the intended and natural consequence of the IRFB's conduct in promulgating the Laws of the Game.

The principles are set out in Voth at 566-568. From that passage we derive the propositions that: the search is for the place where in substance the cause of action arose, by determining in a commonsense way the place of the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff the cause of complaint (567); in relation to omissions, the inquiry is to determine the place of the act or acts of the defendant in the context of which the omission assumes significance (567); the focus of attention is some act of the defendant, and not its consequences (567); if the place of the happening of damage might have been quite fortuitous it is unlikely to be a pointer to the place of the tort (567-568).

When summarising Grove J's reasons, we observed that his Honour did not elaborate upon the relevance of his observation that the place of the alleged tort was outside New South Wales. We would infer that the perceived relevance lay in providing a ground for disregarding the claims of Pt 10 r1A paras (a) and (d) as additional bases for assuming jurisdiction. Furthermore, the existence of a "foreign tort" is relevant to the inappropriateness of New
South Wales as the forum. Cf Voth at 566.

This Court should frankly acknowledge that it is presently divided as to the location of the putative tort. Two members (Spigelman CJ and Stein JA) incline to the view that the tort or torts alleged are located in New South Wales, where the appellants suffered their injuries. In their view the pleadings are to be read as containing alternative allegations, including allegations that the IRFB defendants permitted the Laws of the Game, in their unamended form, to be promulgated throughout the rugby world with such implications as flow from that promulgation (see particular (c) of the Hyde allegations of negligence and particulars (a) and (c) of the Worsley allegations of negligence in the current pleadings). Spigelman CJ and Stein JA would hold that the location of the meeting, rather than the location of the damage, was "fortuitous" in the sense used in Distillers and Voth. They agree with the following conclusion expressed by Badgery-Parker J in his judgment given on 10 February 1994 in the Hyde proceedings (46-47): "The omission of the defendant to act to amend the rules cannot itself be located at any particular place but, in the words of the High Court in
Voth, "it is possible to speak of the place of the act or acts of the defendant in the context of which the omission assumed significance and to identify that place as the place of the cause of complaint". The omission to amend the rules assumed significance in this State because of the requirement of the rules that football be played in this State in accordance with their provisions. It was that factual context which gave significance to the omission and gave rise to the plaintiff's cause of complaint. I am of opinion therefore that within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (d) of Part 10 Rule
A(1) the plaintiff's cause of action arose and/or the tort against him was committed in New South Wales." 
Rather than the place of the happening of the damage being described as `quite fortuitous', the place of the IRFB's meetings might itself be said to be fortuitous and of little legal significance. The place where the Board held its meetings seemed to be a permanently moving feast, in part dependant on international tours and consequent opportunities for Board members to meet.
What if the board were to hold a meeting by teleconferencing? Where would the meeting take place? 
The cause of action should be regarded as having arisen where the relevant conduct had its natural and intended effects. In effect, the injunction of the
IRFB to play the game (in New South Wales) according to the laws it lays down, was in substance made at the place where it was received by the other defendants and required to be acted upon by them (Voth at 568.6). The conduct travelled through time and space from the meeting to New South Wales, where it was to be applied and observed.

Mason P disagrees, reading the pleadings as alleging against the IRFB defendants torts occurring exclusively at the place or places (in the United
Kingdom and France) where the identified meetings occurred at which the Laws of the Game should have been changed. That is where the IRFB Board deliberated and (ex hypothesi) failed to act. The Laws remained relevantly unchanged from the end of the meetings - throughout the rugby world. It was unfortunate, but relevantly fortuitous, that the application of those Laws in the games played by the appellants occurred in New South Wales. The distinction between negligent failure to warn and negligent "manufacture" is itself potentially illusory (see L Collins, Essays in International Litigation and the Conflict of Laws, 237).

Whichever view is correct, the Court is unanimously of the view that there is a good arguable case that the facts pleaded include a "local tort" in the sense discussed in Voth. This is sufficient to provide additional grounds for the re-exercise of the discretion by this Court, because it means that paras (a) and (d) are satisfied to the requisite standard. Indeed, it has been pointed out in the context of forum non conveniens that if "the substance of an alleged tort is committed within a certain jurisdiction, it is not easy to imagine what other facts could displace the conclusion that the courts of that jurisdiction are the natural forum" (The Albaforth [[1984] Lloyd's Rep 91] at 96 per Robert Goff LJ). Of course, satisfaction of the jurisdictional nexus and the favourable exercise of the discretion permitting the proceedings to go forward to trial in the Supreme Court of New
South Wales will not be the end of the issue, other than for jurisdiction. The respondents could still argue at the trial that in fact the tort was committed abroad and not in New South Wales. If the trial judge agrees then he or she will have to decide liability in accordance with conflicts of laws rules.
Cases, such as this, on issues of jurisdictional nexus must be treated with care when the issue is choice of law. (See eg Dicey & Morris The
Conflict of Laws (12th ed) London 1993, 1509-1510).

Once it is accepted that the appellants bring themselves within all four of the paragraphs of r1A that have been referred to, the case for the favourable exercise of the discretion becomes significantly stronger. If there were lingering doubts about forum non conveniens (and we have none in the light of the extent of the proceedings already triable in this State) they fall away. Furthermore, satisfaction of para (d) ("tort committed in the State") means that it would take quite exceptional circumstances for the Court to stay its hand in relation to discretion. Such circumstances are absent.

Limitation issues 
In declining to exercise his discretion in favour of the appellants, Grove J stated that restraint in the exercise of "exorbitant jurisdiction" was called for, especially in a context where the claim was statute-barred under the municipal law. He cited Leal versus Dunlop Bio-Processes Ltd [[1984] 2 All ER .] 
That the claim was prima facie statute barred is clearly a relevant discretionary consideration. However, it drives one to consider how the concurrent application to extend time might be determined. If one formed the view that time ought to be extended, then the weight to be attributed to the fact that the action was statute-barred would obviously diminish. Leal did not involve any application for extension of time under a [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/).

It is difficult to know what weight to attribute to the limitation issue as a discretionary factor under r2 without, at least, examining the respective applications to extend time for their merits or lack thereof. Grove J did not do this and that, in our view, is another basis upon which the discretion miscarried.

Re-exercise of the discretion 
These proceedings have languished for too long. This Court must re-exercise the discretion rather than remit.

In all the circumstances we are very comfortably satisfied that the discretion should be exercised in the appellants' favour. They have satisfied to the requisite standard four bases of jurisdiction, each of which represents a genuine and substantial link with the forum. Together they represent a formidable local connexion. The underlying causes of action have real difficulties. Indeed, the proceedings may ultimately fail on a number of grounds. But the tortious claims propounded against the IRFB defendants are not untenable. It could not be said that New South Wales is an inconvenient forum even if the claims against the IRFB defendants stood alone. They do not.
Indeed, it would be manifestly inconvenient to the proper administration of justice if the trial against the local defendants were to take place apart from the trial against the IRFB defendants. The possibility that the IRFB defendants might have unassailable limitation defences were proceedings now to be commenced in the United Kingdom is not irrelevant. (Neither is it a factor tending wholly in the respondents' favour on the present issues.) 
What weight is to be given to limitation of actions in the context of local proceedings against the IRFB defendants? If the claims against them were incontrovertibly statute-barred, then it would not be proper to exercise the discretion in the appellants' favour. But they are not, for the reasons which follow. Those reasons also make it appropriate that the discretion to extend time should be exercised in the appellants' favour.

Mr Hyde's cause of action arose on 23 August 1986. He sought to join the respondents in an amended Statement of Claim filed on 25 May 1994, approximately 21 months after the limitation period on his cause of action expired.

Mr Worsley's cause of action arose on 19 August 1987. The limitation period expired on 19 August 1993, the day on which he filed a statement of claim. An amended statement of claim which alleged liability against the respondents personally and purported to join the NZRFU Inc was filed on 4 August 1994, approximately 12 months out of time.

In June and September 1995, the appellants made application, pursuant to [s60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html), [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) for an extension of time, in which to join the respondents.
 [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) relevantly provides in relation to an ordinary action: 
Where, on application to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of action to which this section applies, it appears to the court that: any of the material facts of a decisive character relating to the cause of action was not within the means of knowledge of the applicant until a date after the commencement of the year preceding the expiration of the limitation period for the cause of action; ...
 the court may order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended so that it expires at the end of one year after that date and thereupon...the limitation period is extended accordingly.
 [Section
G(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) provides: 
If an application for an order under this section is made to a court by a person claiming to have a cause of action to which this section applies, the court, after hearing such of the persons likely to be affected by the application as it sees fit, may, if it decides that it is just and reasonable to do so, order that the limitation period for the cause of action be extended for such period as it determines. 
As the respective causes of action accrued before 1 September 1990, the appellants rely upon the transitional provisions contained in Schedule 5, cl 4 of the Act. Paragraph 4 of cl 4 provides: 
The court may make an order under [section
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) or [60H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60h.html), in relation to a cause of action referred to in this clause, if an application for such an order is made within: the period of 3 years referred to in [section
I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) ....

In order to obtain relief under the transitional provisions, the appellants must satisfy the court that they were unaware of one of the matters set out in [s
I(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) of the Act at the time the limitation period expired. [Section
I(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) relevantly provides: 
A court may not make an order under [section
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html) or [60H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60h.html) unless it is satisfied that: the plaintiff: ...
 was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omission, at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted; and the application is made within 3 years after the plaintiff became aware (or ought to have become aware ) of all 3 matters listed in paragraph (a) -(iii).

At issue is whether any of the material facts relating to the cause of action were not within the means of knowledge of the appellants at the relevant time.
Mr Hyde deposed, in an affidavit sworn 3 July 1996, that prior to the filing of the amended statement of claim on 25 May 1994 he was personally unaware of the identity of the respondents. In an amended statement of claim filed on 10
July 1991, Mr Ryan, solicitor for Mr Hyde, purported to join as a defendant the "unincorporated association which it was alleged made the rules". The rule-making body was not named. Mr Hyde has given evidence that he thought the
NSWRU was the body responsible for making the rules and that he had otherwise relied on his solicitors to make enquiries. In his affidavit of 31 March 1994,
Mr Ryan stated that he had joined the ARFU as first defendant as "representative of the International Rugby Football Board" stating that "by that expression I intended to identify the rule-makers of the `laws of the game of rugby football'".

As noted above, Mr Worsley filed his amended statement of claim on 4 August
It purported to join individual members of the IRFB and the NZRFU Inc.
It is clear from his affidavit of 7 September 1995 that Mr Worsley did not, at that time, have personal knowledge of the specific identities of the rule- makers of the game.

With regard to the NZRFU Inc, Mr Worsley did not become aware until August that it was incorporated at the material time. The limitation period expired on 20 August 1993 and he filed an application to extend time on 18
September 1995, within the 3 year time limit provided by [s
I.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) 
It is likely that both Mr Hyde and Mr Worsley were aware by mid-1991 of the connection between their personal injury and the alleged acts of the rule makers of the game. However, without precise knowledge of the identity of the actual rule-makers, the appellants were not in a position to proceed against them. Notwithstanding continued attempts, the appellants lacked personal knowledge of the specific identities of those who had power to make and amend the laws of the game until August 1993 at the earliest.

Although the technical defaults of Mr Hyde and Mr Worsley are different in that Mr Hyde was out of time by approximately 21 months and Mr Worsley by 12 months there is no material difference between them in terms of the consideration of an extension of time.

It must also be noted that the IRFB has had knowledge of the claim since 1991.
It retained lawyers to assist in resisting the claim. Indeed, without submitting to the jurisdiction of the court, the IRFB has actively participated in the proceedings since December 1991. It is difficult, therefore, to perceive any real prejudice to the respondents by reason of the late joinder.

In our opinion, [s
I(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) of the Act is satisfied and as the application has been made within three years the court has the power, under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html), to make an order extending the limitation period if it is just and reasonable to do so. In our view, it is just and reasonable to extend the time.

A plea 
Thus far the proceedings have resembled a forensic nightmare. These cases cry out for ongoing case management in the Common Law Division to bring them to trial without further delay.

ORDERS 
The orders which we envisage to flow from these reasons are:
Appeals upheld with costs.
Orders made by Grove J on 22 July 1996 set aside.
In the Hyde appeal, grant leave to proceed against the 1st, 8th and th defendants (other than against Mr Kendall-Carpenter and Dr Craven) and extend the limitation period up to and including 14 July 1995. Deem service to have been effected on those defendants on that date.
In the Worsley appeal, grant leave to proceed against the 2nd and th defendants (other than against Mr Kendall-Carpenter) and extend the limitation period up to and including 14 July 1995. Deem service to have been effected on those defendants on that date.
Order that the said defendants pay the appellants' costs of the motions to grant leave to proceed and to set aside service before Grove J.
Respondents to pay appellants' costs and to have a certificate under the
Suitors' Fund Act if qualified.

The parties may consider that alternative orders are appropriate. Accordingly, the only formal orders we make are:
Appeals allowed.
Direct parties to bring in Short Minutes within 7 days. If an agreed form of Short Minutes is not submitted to the Registrar within that time, direct the matter to be listed before the President at 9.30am on a date (within the following 7 days) to be fixed by the Registrar after consultation with the parties.
