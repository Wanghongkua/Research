JUDGE1
MAHONEY JA I agree with the substantive orders proposed by Meagher JA. In deciding this case at first instance, Badgery-Parker J was required to consider, inter alia, two questions: whether, as part of the verdict, interest should be awarded upon the Griffiths versus Kerkemeyer <case>; [(1977) 139 CLR 161] component of the verdict; and, if it was, how that interest was to be calculated. In
Marsland versus Andjelic (No 2) [(1993) 32 NSWLR 649], this Court held that interest was to be allowed upon a Griffiths versus Kerkemeyer component of a judgment given in respect of an accident to which the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) applied. The
Court did not deal definitively with the second question.
The decision in Marsland versus Andjelic was delivered on December 1993. By
Act No 27 of 1994 (assented to on 30 May 1994) the legislature altered the law in relation to the payment of interest and the principles referred to in
Marsland versus Andjelic. The principles established by that case no longer applied in respect of interest payments under the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/).
On 18 November 1994, the High Court of Australia granted leave to appeal against the decision in Marsland versus Andjelic but excluded from the grant of leave the question of interest on damages in respect of the provision of gratuitous services.
It was indicated by counsel in the present appeal that the principles established in this regard by Marsland versus Andjelic were not contested.
Accordingly, the present appeal is to be decided upon the basis that interest is payable upon Griffiths versus Kerkemeyer components of a damages verdict.
That concession does not, of course, extend to the second matter to which
I have referred. It remains for decision how such interest is to be calculated.
A Griffiths versus Kerkemeyer award is made, not for an amount paid by the plaintiff to another person.
It is an amount payable by the defendant to the plaintiff because the defendant has created in the plaintiff a need for the relevant services. If interest is to be paid upon a Griffiths versus Kerkemeyer amount, it is to be paid because such a need was created by (as is ordinarily the case) the injury done to the plaintiff at the time of the accident. It is, in principle, arguable that, if the need for services is created at the time of the accident and if interest is to be paid at all by reason of the creation of that need, interest should be paid upon the total amount payable to compensate for that need from the time when the need was created, namely, the date of the accident.
The alternative view is based upon the fact that the amount payable is calculated by a summation of the weekly or other periodic sums which notionally the plaintiff would have had to pay to a third party to procure those services from time to time. In this case, it is possible to calculate notionally what would have to be paid for such services each week. The suggested approach assumes the sum payable to have accrued period by period and that the award is to be a summation of the periodic amounts notionally so calculated. Interest is calculated by reference to the notional periodic amounts in the manner referred to in the judgment of Meagher JA.
Badgery-Parker J awarded interest calculated in the first manner. It is not clear whether the argument before him extended to these alternative approaches.
The view taken by this Court in Settree versus Roberts [(1982) 1 NSWLR 649], and by me in Marsland versus Andjelic, was that interest was not payable upon the Griffiths versus Kerkemeyer sum awarded to compensate for the creation of a need for services, supplied or unsupplied. In this appeal, that view must be put aside. If interest is to be paid upon the value of such services, even though not supplied, less damage is done to the assumptions which underlie the Griffiths v
Kerekemeyer principle and, I believe, common sense is best served if the basis suggested by Meagher JA in the present appeal is followed.
Accordingly, I agree with the substantive orders which his Honour has proposed.
In the circumstances, I agree with Clarke
JA that a certificate under the
Suitors Fund Act should be given to the respondent.
JUDGE2
CLARKE JA I agree with the reasons and orders of Meagher JA save insofar as I would not be disposed to the view that the respondent had forfeited the right to a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act.
I would, accordingly, agree with orders (1), (2) and (3) and I would add to order (4) a provision for a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act to the respondent.
JUDGE3
MEAGHER JA The plaintiff, Miss Greco, who is the present respondent, successfully sued the appellants for negligence. She obtained a verdict of $1,720,310. One component of that verdict was past care, which, on the findings of Badgery-Parker J, extended from 19 September 1984 until 24
February 1995, the date of the trial. His Honour calculated a precise figure for each of the nearly eleven years which constitute this period. The total of the eleven amounts is $114,137. None of the amounts is in dispute.
However, what is in dispute is the interest allowable on that sum. It is not in dispute that some interest is allowable. This court decided that in
Marsland versus Andjelic (No 2) [(1993) 32 NSWLR 649.] Nor is it in dispute that the rate of interest should be a commercial rate. Nor is it in dispute that the rate of 15% selected by the learned trial judge is a proper commercial rate.
The figure for interest at which his Honour arrived was $178,560. It can be demonstrated mathematically how that result was reached. His Honour took % of $114,137 and multiplied that figure by 10.43.
This, according to the appellant, is impermissible. It involves, inter alia, awarding nearly I I years interest on the value of the services provided the year before trial (or, to put the matter another way, giving interest at % for that year).

In my view, the appellant's argument compels acceptance.
In principle, interest on past care should run from the dates when the care was provided, or the need for care arose, whatever the case may be. In the present case, that would lead to the following calculations: $ 2,092.50    at15% x 10.43   years    $ 3,273 ,722.00          9.43         ,923 ,658.00          8.43          10,948 ,126.00          7.43          10,171 ,594.00          6.43          9,253 ,970.00         5.43          8,935 ,895.00 .43          7,904 ,402.00         3.43          6,381 ,402.00    .43          4,521 ,402.00         1.43          2,660 ,583.00        .43           940 ,290.00          .15            52 $75,961
As to costs, the respondent declined an invitation to amend the verdict, and therefore in my view forfeited the right to a certificate under the
Suitors Fund Act.
The orders which I propose are as follows:
Appeal allowed.
Verdict and judgment below set aside.
In lieu thereof, order and judgment in favour of the plaintiff below in the sum of $1,617,711.00.
Order that the appellant pay the respondent's costs of the trial, and the respondent pay the appellant's costs of the appeal.
