JA The Rangers Club of NSW Inc (the Club) is an association incorporated under the [Associations Incorporation Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) (the Act). The
Club's bank, St George Bank Limited (the Bank), began proceedings for relief by way of interpleader in relation to the proceeds of four accounts in the name of the Club. Pursuant to [Part 56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/index.html#p56) Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules, the trial judge, Santow J, made orders and directions for the determination of disputes between the appellants and the respondents, inter alia, about whether an adjourned Annual General Meeting at which the Club's Committee was elected was validly re- convened.
 
AGREED FACTS
The material facts as agreed can be stated shortly. On 16 September 1994 the
Club held its Annual General Meeting. Forty-nine members, including
Committee members, attended. When the meeting began the appellants held positions as President, Honorary Secretary and Advisers on the Committee constituted by cl 3 of the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) (the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)). From 7.45 until 10.50 pm the President, Mr Young, chaired the meeting. At about 10.50 pm he declared all offices vacant and another member, Mr Trevor Correy, not a party to these proceedings, took the chair as returning officer to oversee the election of the next
Committee. At about 11 pm, before the nominations for the various positions could be voted on, the members had to vacate the premises where they were meeting. Mr Correy advised them that the meeting had to be adjourned and re-convened after the requisite notice period and that "the old
Committee" was back until then. The parties accepted that the "requisite notice period" was the minimum period of thirty days cl 8 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) prescribed for the holding of an Annual General Meeting.
After the adjournment the Club Secretary, Ms Estelle Barboza, one of the respondents, organised for the public officer of the Club, Mr Terry Rodrigues, another respondent, to obtain an extension of time for holding the meeting from the Department of Consumer Affairs. The Committee did not meet to consider the date for resumption.
The Secretary organised a new date. On or about 22 and 23 September 1994 she sent letters to all the members of the Club informing them that the resumed meeting would be held on 28 October 1994 at .30 pm at the Wentworthville Community Centre. On 27 October 1994 the
Secretary received a letter from the President, Mr Young, purporting to cancel the resumed meeting. Forty members but none of the appellants attended the meeting on 28 October 1994. Six of the respondents were elected to the
Committee as President, Vice-President,
Treasurer, Social Secretary, Secretary and Public Officer. The President later resigned and was replaced by the
VicePresident. Another of the respondents was elected Vice-President.
The respondents contended that the meeting was, and the appellants that it was not, properly re-convened for 28 October 1994 and validly held. For reasons I need not go into, the dispute paralysed the operation of the Club and led to the Bank's interpleader proceedings.
 
JUDGMENT AT FIRST INSTANCE
In the interpleader proceedings the
Club was the first defendant, the respondents the second defendant, and the appellants the third defendant respectively. Santow J held that the Annual General Meeting, adjourned on 16
September 1994, was properly re-convened by the Club Secretary on 28 October
Before considering his Honour's reasons for this conclusion, which is the only matter the appellants challenge on this appeal, it is convenient to say something about the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
 
THE [CONSTITUTION](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) OF THE CLUB
The Club was formed to provide a common meeting place for people who had migrated to Australia from India. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) provides that the Club will consist of members duly elected to be called the General Body (cl 1), that the
General Body will have the final decision in all matters pertaining to the
Club (cl 2), that the Club will be administered by a Committee to be elected at each Annual General Meeting and that the Committee shall consist of the
Honorary President, the Vice-President, the Honorary Secretary, the
Entertainment Secretary, the Honorary Treasurer, at least five Committee members, with a maximum of seven Committee members, and three Advisers (cl 3).
Clause 3 (a) provides that the President shall be responsible for the overall supervision and running of the Club and cl 3 (b) that: "Under his direction, the Secretary will be the Chief Executive Officer and carry out all the instructions given to him or her by the Committee." Clause 8 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) is as follows: "The Annual General Meeting of the Club shall be held once a year, preferably as early as convenient in the month of April each year, but not more than 15 months after the previous Annual
General Meeting, on a date to be notified to all members at least 30 days prior to the meeting. Each financial member of the Club present at a General Meeting shall be entitled to one vote on each matter dealt with and the President or other person presiding shall be entitled to a casting vote. No unfinancial member of the Club shall make a motion.

At Annual General Meetings the Chair shall be taken by the
President, if present, or in his absence, the Committee shall elect one of the Vice Presidents or if no Vice President be present, the Committee shall elect as Chairman one of its members before any other business is taken up.

Order of business at Annual General Meetings shall be: a) Minutes of the previous Annual General Meeting b) Annual Report of the President,
Secretary and Social Secretary c) Treasurer's Annual Statement of Accounts d) Correspondence re AGM e) Changes in [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) f) General Business re AGM
Items for discussion under General Business must be submitted to the Secretary no less than the latest date set by the
Committee as laid out in the By-Laws for the receipt of nominations for the positions on the Committee.
g) Election of Committee members (as detailed in para 3 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/))."
Clause 9 provides that the officer bearers shall take office immediately after the election and cl 10 that at Annual General
Meetings twenty-five members shall form a quorum.
 
THE MODEL RULES
Section 3 of the Act defines "model rules" to mean the model rules prescribed under s73 and "rules" in relation to an association to include the constitution. Section 73 (1) enables the Governor to make regulations for or with respect to prescribing rules as model rules. Section 19 (3) provides that where in relation to any matter the model rules make provision but the rules of an association do not make provision, the provision of the model rules shall, in relation to that matter, be deemed to be included in the rules of the association.
Model rules described on their face as "According to the Association (sic)
Incorporation Act 1984 - Regulation 1994, Clause 8" have been treated by the parties as the model rules applicable at the relevant time. Rules 23 to 33, both inclusive, are found in Part IV under the heading "General Meetings".
Rule 23 is headed "Annual General Meetings - holding of", rule 24 "Annual
General Meeting - calling of and business at", rule 25 "Special General
Meetings calling of", rule 26 "Notice", rule 27 "Procedure", rule 28 "Presiding Member", rule 29 "Adjournment", rule 30 "Making of Decisions", rule "Special Resolution", rule 32 "Voting" and rule 33 "Appointment of
Proxies". Rule 24 (1) provides: "The Annual General Meeting of the association is, subject to the Act and to rule 23, to be convened on such date and at such place and time as the committee thinks fit."
Rule 29 is as follows: "Adjournment 
The chairperson of a general meeting at which a quorum is present may, with the consent of the majority of members present at the meeting, adjourn the meeting from time to time and place to place, but no business is to be transacted at an adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting at which the adjournment took place.

If a general meeting is adjourned for days or more, the secretary must give written or oral notice of the adjourned meeting to each member of the association stating the place, date and time of the meeting and the nature of the business to be transacted at the meeting.
 
Except as provided in clauses (1) and (2), notice of an adjournment of a general meeting or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting is not required to be given." 
RE-CONVENING THE MEETING
The appellants contended that model rule 24 mandated that the Annual
General Meeting could only be re-convened by the Committee and that the
Secretary acted without authority in purporting to re-convene it without the
Committee's approval. Santow J said: "... whilst clause 8 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) lays down no express requirement as to who shall determine the date, time and place of the annual general meeting, it is clear enough from clause 3 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) that the Secretary would have power to do so and indeed would be the natural person to do so. Under clause 3 (b) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) it is provided that 'under his (the President's) direction', 'the Secretary will be the Chief
Executive Officer and carry out all the instructions given to him or her by the Committee'. Thus the Secretary as the Chief
Executive Officer would clearly have authority to convene such a meeting as well as authority to determine in the Secretary's discretion its date, place and time. This is unless that discretion had earlier been curtailed either by a direction from the President or by instructions from the Committee. But there is no requirement under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) for the Secretary first to seek either a direction from the President or an instruction from the Committee, nor to await the initiative of either President or Committee, before the Secretary may elect to convene a meeting. Nor, given the senior executive status of the Secretary, would this be implied.
 ...

I am therefore satisfied that clause 8, read with clause (b), does make provision 'in relation to' the convening of annual general meetings by the Secretary and comprehends the power on the secretary's part to determine date, time and place in the absence of countermanding direction or instruction.
These provisions of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) therefore leave no gap for the model rules to fill in relation to that matter. The regime of the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) 'covers the field' in relation to that matter;..." [Section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s19.html) (3) contemplates that the model rules shall, in relation to any matter for which they make provision but the rules of an association do not, be deemed to be included in the rules of the association. His Honour's approach to the operation of this subsection would make its application very complex. Clause 8 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) provides for the Annual General Meeting to be held once a year, preferably as early as convenient in April, but not more than fifteen months after the previous Annual General Meeting and on a date to be notified to all members at least thirty days prior to the meeting.
It deals with voting power, who will chair the meeting and the order of business and proscribes any motion from an unfinancial member.
Clause 10 deals with the quorum and cl 10A with absentee and proxy voting. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) says nothing about who may convene an Annual General Meeting or determine where and when it will be held. Santow J thought that this gap in the express provisions of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) was filled by cl 3 (b) and that the Secretary as the Chief Executive Officer had authority to convene such a meeting as well as authority to determine in his or her discretion its date, place and time.
With the greatest respect I do not agree with this interpretation of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). Clause 3 (b) speaks of the Secretary being the Chief Executive
Officer under the direction of the President and carrying out "all the instructions given to him or her by the Committee". The paragraph is the opposite of a grant of power to make independent decisions.
In particular I do not think it enables the Secretary, contrary to the clear language of model [rule 24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s24.html) (1), to convene the Annual General Meeting, without the approval of the Committee, at such place and time as he or she determines.
His Honour's conclusion derived from an analysis which involved, amongst other things, holding, by analogy with the operation of s109 of the Federal [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), that the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) covered the field. The officers and members of associations making daily decisions about how the rules of the Club work should not be expected to engage in such analysis. The words of model [rule 24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s24.html) would lead the average reader to think that it dealt precisely with the convening of an Annual General Meeting subject only to the Act and to rule 23, if that rule applied. The inter-action of the model rules and the rules of an association must be governed, in the first instance, by consideration of the matters with which they expressly deal in direct terms, rather than by consideration of whether clauses in the rules, which do not directly deal with a matter the express subject of the model rules, could be said in some general sense to cover the field. Clause 24 (1) says that the Annual General Meeting of the association is to be convened on such a date and at such place and time as the committee thinks fit. In my opinion, pursuant to sl9 (3), that rule was deemed to be included in the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). However, again with the greatest respect, that is irrelevant to the resolution of the present problem. No one suggested the Annual
General Meeting had not been duly convened.
An officer or member of the Club concerned with the adjournment of a general meeting would find nothing said expressly about that matter in the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) but would find the matter addressed under the heading "Adjournment" in model [rule 29.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s29.html) Santow J held that, since cl 3 (b) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) enabled the Secretary to convene the Annual General Meeting, it also enabled the Secretary to re-convene it at such time and place as she considered appropriate. I can only reiterate that in my respectful opinion, an officer or member of the Club would be hard- pressed to derive such an independent power from the words of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). On the other hand model [rule 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s29.html) plainly deals with the matter. Pursuant to <case> (3) of the Act model rule 29 is deemed to be included in the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
This leaves the question whether the requirement that the Secretary not only may but must given written or oral notice of the adjourned meeting enabled her to determine the place and time it would be held. The appellants submitted that model [rule 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s29.html) (2) did not enable the Secretary to determine the time and date when the adjourned meeting should be held and relied upon such cases as In re Haycraft Gold Reduction and Mining Company [(1900) 2 Ch 230] at 436-7.
The decision to adjourn and re-convene after the "requisite notice period" of thirty days meant that the meeting was adjourned for more than fourteen days. I would infer that the majority of members present at the meeting on 16 September 1994 consented to its being re-convened after the expiry of the thirty day notice period and left it to the Secretary, the person model [rule 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s29.html) (2) made responsible for giving notice of the adjourned meeting stating the date, place and time, to arrange these matters. The Annual
General Meeting was held, not at the Club's premises, but at premises hired for the occasion. No doubt the obtaining of premises for the re-convened meeting was a matter that had to be arranged and the arrangement would have played a part in determining its date and time. As Santow J pointed out these arrangements were appropriately left to the Club's administrative officer, the
Secretary.
Accordingly, though for different reasons, I agree with Santow J that the meeting was duly re-convened.
 
ATTEMPTED CANCELLATION
The Secretary, in setting the place and time for the adjourned meeting was acting on the authority of a meeting of the General
Body which has the final decision in all matters pertaining to the Club. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) confers no power on the President or any other member to frustrate that decision.
Accordingly in my opinion for that reason, if no other, the letter received from the President on 27 October 1994 was ineffective to cancel the adjourned meeting on 28 October 1994.
 
CONCLUSION
I propose that the appeal be dismissed with costs.
