COMMON LAW DIVISION 
SCHMIDT AJ 
Wednesday, 10 June 2009 /08 DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION versus DESLEY SOONG 
JUDGMENT HER HONOUR: By statement of claim filed in July 2008, the plaintiff claimed the sum of $1,059,520.67 as penalties imposed under Division 9 of [Part
VI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/index.html#p6) of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth).
The penalties are sought in relation to the failure of Palmarac Pty Ltd ('Palmarac'), Entarmi Pty Ltd ('Entarmi') and Dimpara Pty Limited ('Dimpara') to comply with <case> of the [Income Tax Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/), which required them to deal with deductions made from employee salaries and wages (PAYG deductions), withheld for the purpose of Division 12 of Schedule 1 to the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (Cth).
It is claimed that the moneys withheld were not paid to the plaintiff on the due dates and that as a result, the defendant, as a director of Palmarac,
Entarmi and Dimpara, is liable to pay penalties under ss 222AOC and 222AOD of the [Income Tax Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/), in relation to those failures.
 It was not in contest that since the commencement of the proceedings, credits had accrued, which had reduced the amount of the claim to $1,049,384.17. The total penalties finally claimed in relation to Palmarac was $303,216.57, Entarmi $407,725.50 and Dimpara, $338,442.10. Interest and costs are also sought.

Issues The only issue lying between the parties was whether the plaintiff gave the defendant the notices required to be served upon him on the date on which the notices were posted, 29 November 2007, or on the date they were received, 1
December 2007. The defendant had fourteen days to comply with the notices.
There were four possible courses of action available to the defendant under s
AOB, which, if taken, would have had the result that the penalties were remitted. The defendant chose to appoint an administrator, one of those available avenues, but the appointment was not made until 14 December. On the plaintiff's case, the time for compliance with the notice expired on 13
December, the fourteen days running from the date of posting the notices, that being the date that they were 'given' to the defendant. On the defendant's case, the time ran from the date of receipt of the notices.

The parties' cases The plaintiff's case was that Palmarac, Entarmi and Dimpara did not make the payments due in relation to PAYG deductions withheld from employees' salary and wages, on the due dates. The [Income Tax Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) imposes an obligation on directors to ensure that such payments are made, or to take other specified action (see Div 9 of [Part
VI).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p6)
Non compliance automatically renders directors 'liable to pay to the
Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the company's liability' (s 222AOC(1)). There is a continuing obligation imposed by <case> to bring about compliance, if the payment required by s
AOB(1) is not made.
 Recovery of the penalty requires the Commissioner to give a director notice of the 'details of the unpaid amount of the liability' and the alternatives available (s 222AOE). If the company meets its obligations or takes other remedial action within fourteen days after the notice is given, the penalty is automatically remitted. This is the last chance a director has, to negate the liability for the penalty (see Kolistas versus DCT <case>; <case>.) In this case, the required notices were given, but the administrator was not appointed within fourteen days of the notice being posted on 29 November 2007, with the result that the penalties were not remitted.
 The plaintiff relied on both the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s255.html)-50 of Schedule 1 of the [Taxation Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) to establish a prima facie case and <case>-45 of Schedule 1 of that Act, to establish a prima facie case in relation to the matters stated in certain certificates, which were in evidence. There was no issue between the parties as to these matters, or as to the address to which the notice was posted, or that it was there received.
 As to service of the notices, the plaintiff relied on the provisions of s
AOF of the [Income Tax Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/), submitting that where service is so effected, a notice is deemed to have been given (see DCT versus Meredith <case>; [69 ATR 876.)]
Evidence of non receipt is irrelevant, as is evidence that the address obtained from relevant ASIC records is no longer current, or is inaccurate (see Kavanagh versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation [(2007) 157 FCR .)](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282007%29%20157%20FCR%20551 "View LawCiteRecord" )
 The defendant's case was that while the Court as presently constituted was bound by the judgment of the majority in Meredith, in this case, what was in issue was the date from which the fourteen day period specified in <case> commenced, a matter not in issue in Meredith. What arose for consideration in this case, namely the construction of <case>, that is, whether the period commenced from the date the notice was posted, or the date it was received, showed that the majority in Meredith had erred, by failing to have proper regard to the ordinary meaning of the word 'give' where used in <case>. When the factual circumstances which had here arisen were considered, it was apparent that the approach of Giles J, in dissent in Meredith, was correct, with the result that the notices were not given to the defendant until they were received on 1 December 2007. The appointment of the administrator on 14 December, was therefore within the time specified.

Consideration In evidence were letters dated 29 November 2007, enclosing notices also dated 29 November, which were posted that day to the defendant. The letters, entitled a 'Director Penalty Notice: PAYG Withholding Amounts', were in similar terms, enclosing the Notice and advising that: 
Please find enclosed a notice of your liability to pay a penalty equal to the amount(s)of certain specified PAYG withholding liabilities that DIMPARA
PTY LIMITED, ACN 113 484 076, (the company), that you are or were a director of at relevant times, failed to pay to the Commissioner. You automatically became liable to pay the penalty when the company failed to pay the amount(s) set out in the enclosed notice by the due date(s).
 
We will commence action for the recovery of the penalty without further warning unless, at the end of 14 days from the date the enclosed notice is given to you: the company's liability has been discharged; or an agreement relating to such liability is in force under section 222ALA of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/); or the company is under administration within the meaning of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); or the company is being wound up.

The penalty will be remitted if any one of these options is adopted within 14 days from the date the enclosed notice is given to you.
 
You should keep in mind that you will continue to be liable to a penalty if any one of the options has not been adopted at the end of 14 days after you are given the enclosed notice (that is, any agreement would need to be executed by both the company and the Commissioner before the expiration of the days).
 (The bolded words appeared in bolding in the letter.) The 'Notice of Director's Liability To Pay A Penalty To The Commissioner of
Taxation PAYG Withholding Amounts', given under <case>, were also each in similar terms, advising in each case of the amount of the outstanding liability and that: 'The penalty in respect of each unpaid amount of the company's liability as detailed in the above table will be remitted if, at the end of 14 days after this notice is given to you ...' (The bolded words again appeared in bolding in the notice.) One of the specified steps were taken by the defendant.
 The letters and notices were received by the defendant on 1 December. The defendant then took steps to have an administrator appointed to each of the companies. If the appointment was made within the time prescribed, namely 'within 14 days after the Commissioner gives the person such a notice', then the defendant was not liable for the penalties here claimed, they were remitted (s 222AOG). On the Commissioner's case, those steps were taken out of time, because the 14 days ran from 29 November, not 1 December.
 Patently, given how they were couched, the letters and notices sent to the defendant were open to misinterpretation. It was argued for the defendant that the ordinary meaning of the word 'give', comprehends receipt and that was what the defendant understood. There is some force in that submission.
 In the Online Macquarie Dictionary, the word 'give' is defined as: . (on official documents) executed and delivered as of the date specified In the Online Oxford English Dictionary it is defined as: 
B. Signification.
 
General sense: To make another the recipient of (something that is in the possession, or at the disposal, of the subject).
 Undoubtedly the defendant may have understood that the notices were only 'given' to him, as the letters and notices provided, once they were received and that accordingly, he had fourteen days from that date, to take action, so that the penalty would be remitted.
 For the plaintiff, however, it was argued that in the scheme of this part of the [Income Tax Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/), the word 'give' has a different meaning, as the majority in Meredith concluded.
The crucial sections are <case>, <case> and <case>, which provide: 
AOE Commissioner must give 14 days' notice before recovering penalty 
The Commissioner is not entitled to recover from a person a penalty payable under this Subdivision until the end of 14 days after the Commissioner gives to the person a notice that: sets out details of the unpaid amount of the liability referred to in subsection 222AOC(1), (1A) or (2) (whichever relates to the penalty); and states that the person is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to that unpaid amount, but that the penalty will be remitted if, at the end of 14 days after the notice is given: the liability has been discharged; or an agreement relating to the liability is in force under section 222ALA; or the company is under administration within the meaning of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); or the company is being wound up.

AOF How notice may be given 
If it appears from ASIC documents that a person is, or has been within the last 7 days, a director of the company, the Commissioner may give the person a notice under section 222AOE by leaving it at, or sending it by post to, an address that appears from such documents to be, or to have been within the last 7 days, the person's place of residence or business.

Note: [Sections
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) are also relevant to giving a notice under section 222AOE.

In this section: 
ASIC document means a return: lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission under [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s205a.html), [205B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s205b.html) or [346C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s346c.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); or lodged with a person under a law that, for the purposes of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), is a previous law corresponding to [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s205a.html), [205B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s205b.html) or [346C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s346c.html) of that Act.

AOG Remission of penalty if section 222AOB, 222AOBAA or 222AOBA complied with before notice period ends 
If: a penalty is payable by a person under this Subdivision; and section 222AOB, 222AOBAA or 222AOBA (whichever relates to the penalty) is complied with at a time when the Commissioner has not yet given the person a notice under section 222AOE, or within 14 days after the Commissioner gives the person such a notice; the penalty is remitted because of this section.
 The plaintiff argued that the notion of receipt is not comprehended in these sections. It is the act of posting the notice, not its receipt, which has the result that the notice has been given by the plaintiff, as the Act requires. As the defendant accepted, that is certainly the import of the judgment of the majority in Meredith.
 Nevertheless, while the advice given in the letters and notices sent to the defendant in this case, was undoubtedly advice given in accordance with the words used in the statutory scheme, in their terms the letters and notices did not clearly indicate to the defendant when the 14 day notice period expired.
Nor did they indicate that the 14 days had to be calculated from the date that the notice was posted, rather than the date on which it was received.
 Indeed, what date the documents were posted, would certainly not have been apparent to the defendant. They might have been posted when the letters and notices were dated, but it could have been later, although obviously, it must have been before they were received on 1 December. It is, it seems to me, understandable in the circumstances, that the defendant proceeded on the basis that the 14 day notice period ran from the date on which he received the notices. That, however, is not sufficient to dispose of what here lies between the parties.
 It was common ground that the Court as here constituted is bound by the decision in Meredith, with the result that the orders sought by the
Commissioner must be made. Nevertheless, it was argued to be relevant that the circumstances in Meredith were different to those which arose here for consideration. In that case, the defendant had led evidence that the notice had never been received. In this case, the evidence was that the notice had been received, with the result that the question to be decided is the date from which the 14 days specified in <case> must be calculated - the day that the notice was posted by the plaintiff, or the date on which it was received by the defendant.
 The meaning of words in issue are those appearing in <case>(b), namely if the applicable section is complied with 'within 14 days after the Commissioner gives the person such a notice'. It is in <case>, that the legislature has specified how a notice may be given and <case>, which provides that the
Commissioner may not recover a penalty until 'the end of 14 days after the
Commissioner gives to the person a notice'.
 It was argued for the defendant that in Meredith, in considering the meaning of <case>, no account was taken by the Court of Appeal of the ordinary meaning of the word 'give'. If that word, which is also used in s 222AOG, is given its ordinary meaning, which includes receipt, then the 14 days there specified would be calculated from the date that the notice was received by the defendant, not the date that it was posted by the plaintiff.
That this was a possibility, was hinted at by the majority in Meredith,
Basten AJ observing at [86]: 
In the present case, no issue arises in relation to the date on which notice was given. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s163.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) clearly envisages that the date on which a letter is "sent", as opposed to the date on which it was "received" - see [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) - may be critical. In this case [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s163.html) would have had no application because there was clear evidence as to the date on which it was sent. It is not necessary to consider how the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) may assist a person who is required to do things within a particular time based on a contemporaneous assessment of the period available. It is sufficient to dispose of the present appeal to conclude that the statutory precondition to recovery under <case> was satisfied by sending the notice by post to the relevant address. There was no challenge to the evidence adduced by the
Commissioner that it was so sent.
 Like in Meredith, in this case there was also no issue as to the date that the notice was posted. What was here in issue was the time available to the defendant to take the action provided for in <case>, if the penalty which flowed from <case>, was to be remitted.
 Despite what Basten JA observed at [86], given the conclusions his Honour earlier reached as to the meaning of <case>, it was accepted that the conclusion here urged for the defendant, as to the meaning of <case>, was not available. Nor could the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (Cth) lead to the result urged.
 Certainly, it is apparent that neither in the judgment of Basten JA, nor that of Giles JA, was any reference made to the ordinary meaning of the word 'give', where used in <case>, or how it was used in <case>. Presumably no submissions were directed at questions such as this, given the factual situation which arose for consideration in Meredith.
 For the plaintiff it was argued that the word 'give' was not used in its ordinary meaning in these provisions. Section 222AOF contemplated that the act of giving a notice was complete, once the notice was left at, or was sent by post to, a particular address. In that statutory context, the word 'give' did not permit of the concept of receipt, as the majority concluded in Meredith, even where used in <case>. While, undoubtedly, the statutory scheme was a harsh one, giving a director, in reality, less than 14 days in which to take one of the steps available under <case>, which would result in the remission of the penalty, if the notice was posted, rather than left at the relevant address, that was the consequence of the approach which the legislature had adopted.
 That outcome, it has to be observed, appears to be somewhat curious. It was accepted for the plaintiff that there was another means of service of a notice available to the Commissioner, namely service in accordance with the provisions of <case> and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth) (see the note to <case>). It was further accepted for the plaintiff that if the notice was served in accordance with those provisions, then the question of delivery would be relevant. In such a case, the time from which the 14 days provided in <case> ran, would be calculated from the date the notice was delivered to the relevant address.
 That result flows from the provisions of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/), which provide: 
A Service of documents 
For the purposes of any Act that requires or permits a document to be served on a person, whether the expression "serve", "give" or "send" or any other expression is used, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the document may be served: on a natural person: by delivering it to the person personally; or by leaving it at, or by sending it by pre paid post to, the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to the person serving the document; or on a body corporate--by leaving it at, or sending it by pre paid post to, the head office, a registered office or a principal office of the body corporate.

Nothing in subsection (1): affects the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth, or any law of a State or Territory, that authorizes the service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection; or affects the power of a court to authorize service of a document otherwise than as provided in that subsection.
 Meaning of service by post 
Where an Act authorizes or requires any document to be served by post, whether the expression "serve" or the expression "give" or "send" or any other expression is used, then unless the contrary intention appears the service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing prepaying and posting the document as a letter, and unless the contrary is proved to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.
 
This section does not affect the operation of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).
 That further highlights the difficulty with the advice here given by the plaintiff. It is difficult to see that this was a fair means of notifying the defendant of the time during which he had the opportunity to take one of the alternative steps available to him under <case>, if the penalties to which he was already exposed by operation of <case>, were to be remitted.
 Nevertheless, it was both parties' cases that the approach of the majority in Meredith is binding and must be applied. It is difficult to see how that conclusion may be avoided.
 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation versus Nercessian <case>; [(2006) 67 NSWLR 215], the Court of Appeal observed: Therefore, in terms of <case>, the relevant notices were "given" to
Raffie Nercessian by sending them by post to the address that "appears" from the ASIC documents (being the MASCOT database) to be his place of residence, as established by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation's search of that database. That satisfies the requirements of <case> in either form.
 In Meredith, the Court of Appeal was also concerned with the proper construction of <case>. By majority (Ipp JA agreeing with Basten JA), it was held that on the proper construction of <case>, the obligation to give notice is satisfied by sending the notice by post, to the director at an address which appears in the records of the Australian Securities and investments Commission (ASIC). In that case there was evidence that the notice had been sent, as the section required, but evidence, accepted by the trial judge, that it had never been received.
 Basten JA observed at [75] - [76]: Following that line of reasoning, it may be noted that the role played by s
AOE in the broader scheme of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p6),
Div 9 of the Assessment Act, is to allow a director an opportunity to have a penalty remitted, either by discharging the liability, entering into an agreement with the Commissioner or commencing winding-up of the company. It is clear that the allowance of only 14 days notice in which to take such steps is intended to impose a tight timetable with the real possibility of inflicting hardship on a director: see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation versus Saunig <case>; <case> (Heydon JA, Sheller JA and Gzell J agreeing). Nevertheless, <case> reveals a clear intention that the Commissioner will satisfy the precondition to the entitlement to recover the penalty if a notice is sent by post to the director's address as found in ASIC records. The risk of the notice going astray in the post has been treated as tolerable, in order to effect the policy underlying the scheme. The greater risk may be seen to lie in failure to ensure that ASIC records are up to date, but in that case the responsibility must be borne by the director and not by the Commissioner.
 The fact that the precondition may be satisfied merely by posting a notice to the required address, takes service a step further away from ensuring receipt by the individual recipient, than does <case>. Nevertheless, s was not concerned with receipt as such, but only delivery to the nominated address. Thus the potential hardship identified by the Opponent as resulting from reliance upon <case> without permitting a role for <case> may prove too much to the extent it depended upon absence of receipt. Section 29 in effect imposes on the intended recipient responsibility for ensuring that the document does not go astray after delivery to the postal address. A provision such as <case> also places the risk of loss within the postal system on the intended recipient. That risk may be extremely low, but it is not non- existent; the potential for unfairness arises because the intended recipient has no control over the postal service. Nevertheless, the intended result is clearly expressed and must be given effect: see McCallum versus Purvis <case>; [[1906] VLR 578] at 583 (Hood J), and In re 88 Berkeley Road, NW9;
Rickwood versus Turnsek [[1971] Ch 648] at 653-654 (Plowman J) applying R versus Westminster Unions Assessment Committee [[1917] 1
KB 832], approved in Fancourt at 96. No doubt a director can seek to challenge the
Commissioner's evidence as to sending by post to a relevant address - an exercise undertaken, unsuccessfully, in Forsyth: see <case>; <case>- <case>.
That was not attempted in this case.
 At [79], in relation to the effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/), his
Honour took the view that: It is apparent that Gruber provides only limited support for the
Commissioner in respect of the present argument. Indeed, Gruber is against the Commissioner's position in so far as it left open the possibility that the "Note" to <case> picked up [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) and [29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/). Section
AOF, with the note, was inserted in the Assessment Act by the [Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/iplaa1993511/) (Cth), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/iplaa1993511/s16.html)
Section 950-100 of the Income Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ("the 1997 Act") provides that "the notes and examples (however described) that follow provisions of this Act" form part of "this Act". The Dictionary to the 1997
Act defines "this Act" to include the Assessment Act: accordingly the note to s 222AOF of the Assessment Act forms part of the section, thus displacing the general rule to the contrary found in [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s13.html) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/). However, the note does not purport to qualify or affect the operation of <case>: it refers to a further means of giving notice under <case>.
 A similar view had been reached by the Court of Appeal in Nercessian, where Santow JA, with whom Mason P and McColl JA agreed, concluded at [36]: Because this mode of service was not relied upon in argument below beyond passing references to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth), and because this matter involves a factual dispute that could not now be resolved on appeal, I make no finding as to the application or otherwise of [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html)
Dealing only with the legal arguments for or against the potential application of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html),
I would express the provisional view that [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s28a.html) (and [s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) are capable of application as alternative modes of satisfying <case> of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth) where the notices are posted in conformity with those provisions to the last- known place of address.
 Support for the conclusion of the majority in Meredith was also found in the judgment in Kyogle Shire Council versus Muli Muli Local Aboriginal Land
Council <case>; [(2005) 62 NSWLR 361], which was also concerned with the question of whether service was effected by the act of posting a notice, there required by the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/).
 As I have noted, in this case, it is not a question of non receipt of the notices, but rather a question of the time from which the period specified in the notices ran, when the notices were posted, a mode of service contemplated by <case>.
 In Meredith, Basten JA referred to the provisions of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and their potential impact at [86], the relevant provisions providing: Postal articles 
It is presumed (unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced) that a postal article sent by prepaid post addressed to a person at a specified address in Australia or in an external Territory was received at that address on the fourth working day after having been posted.

This section does not apply if: the proceeding relates to a contract; and all the parties to the proceeding are parties to the contract; and subsection (1) is inconsistent with a term of the contract.

In this section: working day means a day that is not: a Saturday or a Sunday; or a public holiday or a bank holiday in the place to which the postal article was addressed.

Note: [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s182.html) gives this section a wider application in relation to postal articles sent by a Commonwealth agency.
 Proof of letters having been sent by Commonwealth agencies 
A letter from a Commonwealth agency addressed to a person at a specified address is presumed (unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced) to have been sent by prepaid post to that address on the fifth business day after the date (if any) that, because of its placement on the letter or otherwise, purports to be the date on which the letter was prepared.

In this section: business day means a day that is not: a Saturday or a Sunday; or a public holiday or bank holiday in the place in which the letter was prepared.
 letter means any form of written communication that is directed to a particular person or address, and includes: any standard postal article within the meaning of the [Australian Postal
Corporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/apca1989337/); and any envelope, packet, parcel, container or wrapper containing such a communication; and any unenclosed written communication that is directed to a particular person or address.

Note 1: The NSW Act has no equivalent provision for section 163.

Note 2: Section 5 extends the operation of this section to proceedings in all
Australian courts.
 Section 182, provides relevantly: 
Section 160 applies in relation to postal articles sent by a
Commonwealth agency as if that section applied to the extent provided for in section 5.

Section 5 provides: Extended application of certain provisions 
The provisions of this Act referred to in the Table apply to all proceedings in an Australian court, including proceedings that: relate to bail; or are interlocutory proceedings or proceedings of a similar kind; or are heard in chambers; or relate to sentencing.

Note 2: The NSW Act has no equivalent provision for section 5.
 Here, there was no question as to the date on which the notices were posted or received, so no questions under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) arose to be considered. If it applied, the presumption arising from [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s163.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) was here also displaced, given the evidence. Nevertheless, because of the view of the majority in Meredith, that the statutory scheme is not concerned with the receipt of the notices, they are given when they are posted, as <case> provides, then it follows that there is no work for [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s163.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to do, when the provisions of <case> arise for consideration, if there is evidence as to the date of posting. The question of receipt is not relevant to the provision made in ss 222AOE, 222AOF, or 222AOG of the [Income Tax Assessment
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/), once it is accepted that the Commissioner gives a notice, by posting it as <case> permits. The fourteen day period fixed by <case>, runs from the date of posting, that being when the notice is given.
 The defendant did not argue that the word 'give' is not used consistently in this statutory scheme. That is the ordinary view. (See the discussion in
Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed at [4.6] -[4.7]). The rebuttal of the presumption is difficult to see in this context.
The result of such a rebuttal, in the present case, would appear to have the consequence that in the case of a director who established that the notice posted by the Commissioner was never received, the 14 day period specified in s 222AOG, could not run. That seems to be a considerable difficulty standing in the way of the construction here urged for the defendant, given the views reached by the majority in Meredith as to the proper construction of s
AOF.
 In Meredith, Giles JA, in the minority took the view that <case> and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s29.html) of the [Acts Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) were not excluded from operation when a notice was given in accordance with <case>.
His Honour also concluded at [42] that: Turning then to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (C'th), there is no provision for a contrary intention whereby it does not apply (although that does not necessarily preclude inapplicability: Buresti v
Beveridge [1998] 1136 FCA; [(1998) 88 FCR 399] at 401). If there were room for a contrary intention, for similar reasons to those in the preceding paragraphs I do not think that <case> should be held to stand alone, unaffected by the rebuttable presumption in [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html)
If negation of service by posting can be available by force of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s160.html) instead of or as well as by force of the second limb of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s29.html), the result is the same.
 Arguably, his Honour's approach provides support for the view here urged for the defendant, namely that the fourteen days provided in <case> must be calculated from the date of receipt of the notice, but, as the defendant accepted, that view is not open, given that his Honour was in the minority.
 As I observed at the hearing, it would appear sensible for the plaintiff to revisit the terms of the notices given under these provisions. Nevertheless, it follows that despite the difficulties with the terms of the letters and notices sent to the defendant in this case, it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to the orders sought, as the defendant conceded.

Orders For the reasons given, there must be judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum specified in the certificate annexed to Mr Elmer's affidavit, together with interest. The usual order would be that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs as agreed or assessed. The parties should formulate the terms of the orders to reflect the judgment and if there is any disagreement as to costs, they should approach within 7 days.
