NEW SOUTH WALES GRAINS BOARD versus GARY ERNEST DAVIS 
JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: These proceedings come before the court by way of a case stated by his Honour Judge Christie QC pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1991 . 
Christie DCJ had before him appeals from a magistrate sitting in the Dubbo
Local Court. The proceedings before the Dubbo Local Court took the form of prosecutions for two alleged offences against the [Grain Marketing Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/). The prosecutor was Mr B S Robertson, an officer of the New South Wales Grains
Board. The defendant was Mr G E Davis, who carries on the business of dealing in grain.

The information in the case alleged contraventions by Mr Davis of [s87(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) and s[89](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s89.html)(1) of the [Grain Marketing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/).

The questions asked in the case stated to this court relate only to the prosecution in connection with [s87.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html)
In dealing with those questions it is convenient to confine attention to that section, noting at the same time that there was also before the magistrate, and before the District Court judge, a charge under [s89.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s89.html) 
The allegation against Mr Davis in relation to [s87(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) was that, following the making by an authorised officer of the Board of a demand for the production of documents relating to grain, Mr Davis refused to produce the documents.

The facts set out in the stated case do not in terms refer to the making of a demand for the production of documents. Rather they refer to the officer having "asked" for documents and having drawn attention to his powers "to request the production of records".

Since the central issue in the case appears to have turned upon what passed between the officer and Mr Davis by way of demand and response to that demand it is surprising that the stated case does not contain any specific finding in relation to the demand alleged to have been made. Under the heading "Decision" the judge recorded that the officer had made a demand to inspect relevant documents but the stated case does not record the terms or the nature of the demand.

We were informed by senior counsel for the Board that, although the stated case takes the form I have mentioned it was alleged by the prosecution that there was an oral demand for the production of all records relating to the purchase by Mr Davis at any time of grain.

The facts recited in the stated case record the response of Mr Davis in terms which may be summarised as follows.

Shortly before the authorised officer entered the premises of Mr Davis, which occurred at about twelve noon on a working day, Mr Davis had received a telephone call from his bank manager concerning a matter which required urgent attention. At the time the authorised officer entered the premises Mr Davis was making arrangements to leave the premises and have an urgent meeting with the bank manager about a matter of importance to his business. When the demand for production referred to above, was made, Mr Davis told the authorised officer that he had a pressing appointment to see his bank manager about a problem concerning his overdraft. The officer appears to have insisted that Mr
Davis should deal with the demand before he had his meeting with his bank manager. An argument developed between the two men, tempers flared and Mr
Davis ordered the authorised officer from the premises informing him that he was trespassing. That appears to have been the subject of the charge under s89 of the Act. It appears that documents were produced by Mr Davis to the Board the following morning.

The magistrate convicted Mr Davis of offences against s87(8), and s89, but dealt with the matter under the provisions of s556A of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . However, he made an order against Mr Davis for the payment of a substantial amount of costs, and Mr Davis appealed to the District Court.

Christie DCJ indicated in reasons for judgment that he was of a mind to find in favour of Mr Davis on the appeals. That prompted a request by the Board for a stated case. The purpose of the Board was to obtain the ruling of this court upon certain questions of general importance to the Board, relating to the meaning and effect of the [Grain Marketing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/) . That is of importance in relation to the order for costs which I intend to propose in relation to this matter.

The form of the stated case is unsatisfactory in two respects. The findings of fact are not expressed in terms of the provisions of the statute. The questions of law raised in the stated case appear to be questions concerning particular steps in the process of reasoning of Christie DCJ rather than a formulation of the ultimate questions or questions of law arising for decision in the case.

In one respect the Board's complaint concerning the process of reasoning of
Christie DCJ has been made good. His Honour appears to have identified the issue that arose for his decision at least partly in terms of an issue concerning the meaning and effect of sub-section (1) of [s87.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html)
I am unable to see that any such issue arose for determination in the facts of the present case.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) relevantly provides as follows: "87(1) A police officer or an authorised officer may, at all reasonable times, for the purpose of exercising any of the functions of an authorised officer under this section, enter any premises where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that any of the commodity is stored, or any accounts, documents, books or papers relating to any of the commodity are kept.................

The functions of an authorised officer under this section are as follows:.....................

To demand that the occupier of any premises or, as the case may require, the person in charge of a motor vehicle, produce any accounts, documents, books or papers relating to the commodity...............................

A person must not fail or refuse to produce any accounts, documents, books or papers referred to in sub-section (7)(b)." 
Sub-section (1) of [s87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) is the provision which confers upon an authorised officer a power of entry into premises. That power of entry is conditioned upon the requirement that the entry takes place at a reasonable time. In the present case the authorised officer entered the premises of Mr Davis at about twelve noon on an ordinary working day. There was no possible room for argument about whether the entry was made at a reasonable time. There was no other question about the reasonableness of the time at which the officer entered the premises.

Christie DCJ also expressed an opinion that the relevant provisions should be construed "against the Board". With that view I would respectfully disagree.
The relevant provisions should be read and understood according to their plain meaning. I am unable to discern any difficulty about the meaning of any of the relevant provisions of [s87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) insofar as they affect the present case.

The essential issue in the case, insofar as it involved a question of law, was correctly decided by Christie DCJ. Insofar as it involved a question of fact such question does not arise for the consideration of this court.

Whatever may have been argued before the magistrate and Christie DCJ, it is common ground in this court that, on the true construction of the Act, a person to whom a demand for the production of documents is made has a reasonable time to comply with the demand. That proposition is supported by abundant authority (eg R versus Skurray [(1967) 86 WN 1]; Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation versus Ganke [(1975) 1 NSWLR 252]; re
O'Reilly ex parte Australena Investments Pty Limited [(1984) 58 ALJR ];
Peace versus Button [(1985) 8 FCR 388] and Ace
Customs Services Pty Ltd versus Collector of Customs Pty Ltd [(1991) 104 ALR ).](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%20104%20ALR%20463 "View LawCiteRecord" )

In that part of the stated case that refers to his decision, Christie DCJ said: "...I also hold that the requirement to produce any documents pursuant to s87 of the Act is not a requirement to do so instantly but that the personal convenience of the person from whom a relevant demand for documents is made is to be taken into account..." 
The learned judge was right to hold that the requirement to produce documents pursuant to s87 of the Act is not a requirement to do so instantly. That is the corollary of the proposition just enunciated.

Insofar as his Honour held that the personal convenience of the person upon whom a demand for documents is made is to be taken into account, that is a proposition of mixed fact and law. Whether or not it is accurate in its application to any particular case would depend upon the circumstances of that case. In the present case, for example, the consideration that Mr Davis had an urgent appointment with his bank manager for a purpose of importance to his business was a relevant fact to be taken into account in working out what was a reasonable time to comply with the demand in terms of the demand made by the authorised officer. The officer had no right to insist that Mr Davis comply with the demand before keeping his urgent appointment with his bank manager.

It was open to Christie DCJ to find as a fact that the officer did not allow
Mr Davis a reasonable time to comply with his demand.

On the other hand it is not difficult to think of examples of cases where the personal convenience of the individual to whom a demand is made would not be of relevance to a determination of what was a reasonable time to comply with the demand. It would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the individual case, including the nature of the considerations of convenience involved.

I would propose that the questions raised in the stated case should be answered as follows: 
Question 1: Was I in error in my construction of [s87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) of the [Grain Marketing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/) ? 
Answer: Not insofar as it was held that on the true construction of [s87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/gma1991154/s87.html) a person to whom a demand for the production of documents is made has a reasonable time to comply with the demand.

Questions 2 to 5 inclusive: These questions do not arise.

The New South Wales Grains Board should be ordered to pay the costs of Mr
Davis of the stated case and the proceedings before this court. The matter should be remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law.

HANDLEY JA: I agree. 
GROVE J: I also agree. * * *
