JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application made by a successful applicant in a [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) application for security to be given for the legacy which he will receive as a result of a consent order made on 6 August 1998. The order was made after a successful mediation. 
Under the order the plaintiff was to receive, and has received, $40,000 before September 1998, and $160,000 by 6 February 1999. The plaintiff has found that the defendant is in the process of selling an asset at Randwick, which is one of the defendant's principal assets, and he is worried that he will not get his money.

On the other hand, the defendant is a person who is sixty years of age, born in Australia, educated here and has another property. There is no provision in the order for there to be any security. Accordingly, it is necessary for the court to consider whether this case is one where there is a greater than ordinary apprehension that the amount due under the order will not be paid, in which case the court should make some sort of injunction or, alternatively, order some security.

I do not consider that the material before the court goes that far.
Accordingly, the notice of motion must be dismissed.

As to costs, Mr Bizannes, solicitor, who appeared for the plaintiff, says with some force and some degree of truth that the order would not have hurt the defendant, and that he did give a full opportunity for some "reasonable" deal to be made without coming to court.

However, there was no obligation, to my mind, for the defendant to offer security, so the motion must be dismissed with costs.
