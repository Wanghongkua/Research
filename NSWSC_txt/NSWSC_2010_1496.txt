JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
TAMBERLIN AJ  DECEMBER 2010  /298835 plaza West Pty Limited versus Simon's earthworks Pty
Limited (NO 2) 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: In this matter the parties have presented me with Short Minutes of Order and submissions have been made in relation to several of the orders and the only remaining issue between the parties is whether costs on the cross-claim and/or on the principal claim should be ordered on an indemnity basis.
 I have been directed to the relevant authorities and rules and, in particular, to the decision and observations in Harrison versus Schipp; Cameron v
Schipp <case> at <case>- <case>, and also to the decision of Full Court in Huntsman Chemical Co Australia Ltd v International Pools Australia Pty Ltd <case>
Those cases emphasise that the making of an order for indemnity costs is exceptional even in cases where there have been serious allegations made in relation to fraud and other delinquent conduct. In particular, the principles are set out by Giles JA in his judgment in Schipp at the above paragraphs.
 In that case, the evidence of the party against whom the order was sought was not accepted and was found to have given false evidence and propounded false documents. Notwithstanding this the court expressed a view that that was not sufficient delinquency to justify a special order as to costs.
 In the present case, powerful submissions have been made on behalf of the plaintiff/cross-defendant, particularly in relation to the issues of discovery. There has also been reference to the abandonment of evidence and the conduct of the matter in such a way that a great deal of the evidence and cross-examination became irrelevant. Counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the fact that there was a late briefing of counsel in the matter which caused some disruption in the orderly hearing of the case. However, this latter point does not, in my view, carry any significant weight.
 The principal matter which concerned me on this application is the submission concerning discovery and the way in which fraudulent documents which were at the heart of the case were only discovered at a late period of the proceedings and as a consequence of the issue of a subpoena.
 However, in all the circumstances and weighing the submissions made by the parties in relation to the matter, I am not persuaded that the conduct of this case warrants an order of costs on an indemnity basis in relation to either the claim or the cross-claim and accordingly I make the orders as to costs which are set out in the plaintiff's/cross-defendant's short minutes, along with the other orders in the short minutes except that orders 4 and 6 as to costs are on a party-party basis and in lieu of the reference to "$150,000" there will be substituted "$150,000 plus accrued interest". In addition to the orders set out in the short minutes, I reserve liberty to apply on two days' prior notice.
