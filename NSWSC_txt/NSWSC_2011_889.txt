EX TEMPORE Judgment  
HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the liquidator of DGN Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) ACN 095 057 104 for an order under [s 488(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s488.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)") to distribute a surplus. It includes an application pursuant to [s 488(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s488.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to adjust the rights of certain contributories amongst themselves. The order for distribution assumes the adjustment. The order with respect to the surplus will take into account that adjustment. [Sections 488(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s488.html) and (2) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provide that: 
Provision may be made by rules or regulations for enabling or requiring all or any of the powers and duties conferred and imposed on the Court by this
Part in respect of:  the holding and conducting of meetings to ascertain the wishes of creditors and contributories; and  the paying, delivery, conveyance, surrender or transfer of money, property or books to the liquidator; and  the adjusting of the rights of contributories among themselves and the distribution of any surplus among the persons entitled to it; and  the fixing of a time within which debts and claims must be proved;  to be exercised or performed by the liquidator as an officer of the Court and subject to the control of the Court.  
Despite anything in rules or regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1), a liquidator may distribute a surplus only with the Court's special leave. 
The adjustment is required to equalise the loan accounts of the contributories and is apparently uncontroversial. It relates to $258 in respect of one of the contributories, Mr Nassar, and $322 in respect of another of the contributories, Mr De Oliveira (the fifth defendant), who today is represented by Mr E A Walker of counsel. 
The application is supported by two affidavits, one of the liquidator, Mr Hill, and another by his solicitor, Silvana Jovcevska. There is undoubtedly a surplus and that surplus is properly to be distributed to the contributories. 
The affidavit material establishes the rights of the contributories to share in the surplus which, after taking into account the costs of this application, amounts to $130,463.73. 
Relevant parties who have an interest in these proceedings have been given notice, none has appeared to oppose. However, the fifth defendant has drawn attention to the fact that Mr Nassar is a bankrupt. The payment to be made in respect of his interest must therefore be made to his trustee in bankruptcy. This will be noted in the orders which I intend to make.` 
In the circumstances I will make the orders which are contained in the document entitled "Order" which I have initialled, dated today's date and placed with the papers. * * *
