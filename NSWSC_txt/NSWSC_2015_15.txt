JUDGMENT
This matter is listed for sentence on 3 February 2015 before the Chief Judge at Common Law. Application is now made that the sentence hearing be vacated on that day for two principal reasons.
The first is that a pre-sentence report has not yet been prepared and will not in fact be ready for a number of weeks hence. This appears to have been a problem within Probation and Parole rather than something that can be attributable to the parties. An outstanding assessment needs to be undertaken and the relevant persons at Probation and Parole have been on leave. The report is necessary if parole conditions are to be imposed in relation to treatment or residence of the offender.
Secondly, in further explanation of events since those set out in the letter of 27 November 2014 in respect of the offender's wife, material in relation to mitigating circumstances under [s 21A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/s21a.html) of the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/) needs to be prepared and placed before the Court. There has been some difficulty in gathering this material.
The Crown does not oppose the adjournment of the sentencing hearing and in the circumstances I consider it appropriate to vacate the hearing on 3 February.
I will stand the proceedings over for mention before the Chief Judge at 2pm on that day.
Mr Hawi is excused from attendance on 3 February 2015 and bail is continued on the present bail conditions.
