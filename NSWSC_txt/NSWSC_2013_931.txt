JUDGMENT
By summons of 9 July 2013, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex parte, seeking orders pursuant to [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s33.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) ('the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/)') for a production order against Caroline Antwan, a person suspected of having possession or control of identified property-tracking documents of Peter Geoffrey Martin.
"Property-tracking document" is defined in [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) to mean: a document relevant to: identifying, locating or quantifying any interest in property of a person who might reasonably be suspected of being, or of having been, engaged in a serious crime related activity, or identifying or locating any document necessary for the transfer of an interest in property of a person who might reasonably be suspected of being, or of having been, engaged in a serious crime related activity, or a document relevant to: identifying, locating or quantifying an interest in property that might reasonably be suspected of being an interest that is serious crime derived property, or identifying or locating any document necessary for the transfer of an interest in property that might reasonably be suspected of being an interest that is serious crime derived property.
The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 10 July 2013 by Richard Laurence Oades, a forensic accountant and authorised officer under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). Annexed is an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the New South Wales Crime Commission's Director (Financial Investigations), as well as a statement of facts provided by the police in relation to Mr Martin and his involvement in clandestine drug laboratories; the manufacture of prohibited drugs and his arrest and charging with an offence under [s 24(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s24.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) in respect of the drug methylamphetamine, an offence falling within the definition of "serious criminal offence" under [s 6(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). That material was relied on in support of orders sought against Mr Martin under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), in matter number 2013/00013314.
On 15 January 2013 McDougall J made orders in those proceedings under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) in relation to Mr Martin, restraining him from dealing with specified property. 
Mr Oades deposed that he, too, suspected that Mr Martin has engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of 'serious criminal offences' in [s 6(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), namely: "the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s24.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/).
Mr Oades also deposed that he suspected that Ms Antwan, a solicitor, had possession or control of property tracking documents in respect of Mr Martin. That suspicion rested on the response of the ANZ Bank, to a notice to attend and produce documents, served on 28 February 2013 and computer searches which Mr Oades had undertaken, as the result of the response received.
I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.
Having considered that material I am satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex parte. I am also satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Oades has deposed he holds, that Ms Antwan has possession or control of property-tracking documents of Mr Martin, as provided in [s 33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s33.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). 
In those circumstances I have concluded that the orders sought, requiring the production of the property tracking documents to Mr Oades should be made. I make orders accordingly, in the terms sought.
