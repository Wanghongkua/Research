New South Wales  
Decision: 
The Conference Facilities Agreement was not property of Blue Sennar amenable to disclaimer. The Conference Facilities Agreement and Licence were not unprofitable contracts of Eye Plantain, and could not be disclaimed without leave. All the purported disclaimers were nullities and of no effect.

JUDGMENT
The plaintiff AAPC Management Limited is the manager and operator of a conference centre, comprising lots 3, 4, 6, 7 and 53 in the relevant strata plan ("the conference lots"), at the Sebel Manly Beach, under a Conference Facilities Agreement ("CFA") originally made between it (then known as Mirvac Management Limited) as operator, and the then registered proprietor South Steyne Hotel Pty Ltd as owner, on 11 May 2006 for a term of 80 years expiring on 11 May 2086. On or about 12 October 2007, South Steyne transferred the conference lots to Eye Plantain Pty Ltd, the transferee having agreed by a Deed Poll dated 13 December 2006 to comply with all of the obligations of the owner under the CFA. AAPC is also a party to a Conference Facilities Licence ("CFL"), dated 22 December 2009 and expiring on 10 May 2086, whereby Eye Plantain granted Sandarack Holdings Pty Ltd (as restaurant owner) a non-exclusive licence to use the conference facilities for conferences and catered events when not previously booked by another booking party under the CFL or the CFA, and Sandarack in turn granted a sublicense to Gazebo Manly Pty Limited (as restaurant operator).
On 14 May 2015, the defendant liquidator was appointed administrator of Eye Plantain (and also of Blue Sennar Air Pty Ltd, the proprietor of lot 5 which is adjacent to the conference facility but is not one of the conference lots referred to in the CFA, and which Blue Sennar had acquired from South Steyne also on 12 October 2007). He became liquidator of both those companies on 18 June 2015. On 21 August 2015, as liquidator of Eye Plantain, he lodged with ASIC[1] two notices of disclaimer, notice of which he also gave to AAPC[2]: one that he had disclaimed the CFA (and its associated Deed Poll), and the other that he had disclaimed the CFL. Contemporaneously, he also lodged and gave notice that he had disclaimed the CFA as liquidator of Blue Sennar. All the purported disclaimers were made without leave, in reliance on a liquidator's entitlement under (CTH) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 568(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html), to disclaim without leave unprofitable contracts. By summons filed on 4 September 2015, and amended at the hearing on 10 June 2016, AAPC seeks a declaration that leave was required to disclaim the CFA and the CFL, and that the disclaimers are null and void, on the footing that the contracts to which they relate were not "unprofitable contracts" within [s 568(1A).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) Alternatively, AAPC applies pursuant to [s 568B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html) to have the disclaimers set aside.
[Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 568](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html), provides that a liquidator of a company may disclaim property of the company that consists of a contract only with the leave of the Court, except in the case of an unprofitable contract or a lease of land: (1) [Property liquidator may disclaim] Subject to this section, a liquidator of a company may at any time, on the company's behalf, by signed writing disclaim property of the company that consists of: land burdened with onerous covenants; or  shares; or  property that is unsaleable or is not readily saleable; or  property that may give rise to a liability to pay money or some other onerous obligation; or  property where it is reasonable to expect that the costs, charges and expenses that would be incurred in realising the property would exceed the proceeds of realising the property; or  a contract;  whether or not:  except in the case of a contract -- the liquidator has tried to sell the property, has taken possession of it or exercised an act of ownership in relation to it; or  in the case of a contract -- the company or the liquidator has tried to assign, or has exercised rights in relation to, the contract or any property to which it relates.
 ...  [Restriction on disclaiming contracts] A liquidator cannot disclaim a contract (other than an unprofitable contract or a lease of land) except with the leave of the Court.
[Section 568B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html) provides that on application made within 14 days after notice of the disclaimer, the Court may set aside the disclaimer, but only if satisfied that the disclaimer would cause persons with interests in the property prejudice that is grossly disproportionate to the prejudice that would be occasioned to the company's creditors by setting aside the disclaimer: 
B(1) [Time limit to apply for court order to set aside disclaimer] A person who has, or claims to have, an interest in disclaimed property may apply to the Court for an order setting aside the disclaimer before it takes effect, but may only do so within 14 days after: if the liquidator gives to the person notice of the disclaimer, because of paragraph 568A(1)(b), before the end of 14 days after the liquidator lodges such notice -- the liquidator gives such notice to the person; or  if paragraph (a) does not apply but notice of the disclaimer is published under [subsection
A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568a.html) before the end of the 14 days referred to in that paragraph -- the last such notice to be so published is so published; or  otherwise -- the liquidator lodges notice of the disclaimer.
 [Court's powers] On an application under subsection (1), the Court: may by order set aside the disclaimer; and  if it does so -- may make such further orders as it thinks appropriate.
 [Where Court may set aside disclaimer] However, the Court may set aside a disclaimer under this section only if satisfied that the disclaimer would cause, to persons who have, or claim to have, interests in the property, prejudice that is grossly out of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the disclaimer would cause to the company's creditors.
Accordingly, the issues currently before the Court are: * (1) Did the CFA confer contractual rights and impose liabilities on Blue Sennar? If not, the contract was not property of Blue Sennar amenable to disclaimer under [s 568](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html);[3] * (2) Were the relevant contracts "unprofitable contracts" for the purposes of [s 568(1A)?](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) If not, they could not be disclaimed without leave, which was neither sought nor obtained, and the purported disclaimers would be of no effect;[4] * (3) If so, would the disclaimer cause persons with interests in the contracts prejudice that is grossly disproportionate to the prejudice that would be occasioned to the company's creditors by setting aside the disclaimer? If so, the disclaimer should be set aside under [s 568B.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html) 
Did the CFA confer contractual rights and impose liabilities on Blue Sennar? [Section 568(1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) authorises the disclaimer by a liquidator of onerous property, including "property of the company that consists of...a contract". It is to be observed that the disclaimer so authorised is of property, not of liabilities. For a contract to be amenable to disclaimer, the company must have contractual rights under it.[5] If the contract in question does not confer rights on the company, there is no property capable of disclaimer.
The purported disclaimer by Blue Sennar was of the CFA. Blue Sennar is not a party named in the CFA, and (unlike Eye Plantain, which acceded to it by Deed Poll) it has never acceded to the CFA. Blue Sennar is not a party to the CFA (which does not pertain to Lot 5, of which it is the owner). The CFA confers no rights on Blue Sennar, and there is therefore nothing under the CFA for its liquidator to disclaim.
Presumably, the liquidator has purported to disclaim lest it be held that some estoppel operates to bind Blue Sennar to the CFA, as it has been suggested in correspondence on behalf of AAPC that Lot 5 (which is referred to in the Deed Poll by which Eye Plantain acceded to the CFA, though not in the CFA itself) was omitted from the CFA by mistake. As Lot 5 is not one of the conference lots referred to in the CFA, and as the owner of Lot 5 (Blue Sennar) is a different entity from the owner of the conference lots (Eye Plantain), it is difficult to see how any such estoppel (or claim for rectification) would arise. But assuming that it did, and that Blue Sennar were somehow held estopped from denying that AAPC was entitled to use Lot 5 under the CFA, that does not alter the position that the CFA gives Blue Sennar no rights amenable to disclaimer.
As the CFA is not amenable to disclaimer by the liquidator of Blue Sennar, that purported disclaimer is a nullity.
In supplementary written submissions, which were inappropriately provided to my chambers without leave and without consent at 2.50pm on the eve of delivery of this judgment, the defendants submitted that in the absence of any argument by the plaintiff that the CFA applied to Blue Sennar and Lot 5, there was no basis for the plaintiff to apply to have this disclaimer set aside. However, the plaintiff does not (at least primarily) apply under [s 568B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html) to have that disclaimer set aside; rather, it applies to have it declared a nullity. In my view, as a party with rights under the CFA, AAPC plainly has standing to impugn a purported disclaimer of that contract by a liquidator claiming a right to do so. It was entitled to obtain clarification, by declaratory order, of the efficacy of the purported disclaimer, and was not obliged to leave it on the public record - for whatever it might be worth - with its effect on the CFA uncertain.

Were the CFA and CFL "unprofitable contracts"?
The term "unprofitable contract" in [s 568(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) is not the subject of any statutory definition, but has been elucidated by case law. An unprofitable contract is one under which the company has obligations or liabilities (such as to pay money, transfer property, or supply goods or services), the burden of which exceeds the benefits of the contract for the company, and the performance of which will impede the liquidator's ability to realise the assets and distribute the proceeds to the creditors and contributories.[6] The purpose of the provision is to facilitate the due administration of liquidations, not to enable the liquidator to increase the divisible property by clawing back property the company has previously disposed.[7] While the concept has not infrequently been expressed in terms that it is insufficient merely because performance of the contract will incur loss or that a better bargain could have been or could be made,[8] the qualifier "merely" has significance; it means that the element that the contract is one under which the company does not make a profit is a necessary but insufficient feature of an "unprofitable contract". It is not possible to see how a contract under which the company makes a profit can satisfy the concept of an "unprofitable contract". The circumstance that, with leave, even a profitable contract can be disclaimed, tells against giving wider scope to the words "unprofitable contract" than their ordinary meaning bears.[9]
The question whether a contract is unprofitable is one of fact. While it is necessary to identify from the contract the company's contractual obligations and liabilities, and compare them with its contractual rights and entitlements, it is the detriments and benefits that in fact flow from those obligations and entitlements that govern whether or not the contract is in fact profitable. Thus, it is necessary to have regard to the actual operation of the contract and the results its operation in fact produces.
The defendants did not suggest that the CFL standing alone - which in substance governs priorities for bookings for the conference centre - imposed any relevant onerous obligation on Eye Plantain. The case turns on the CFA. Under clause 3.1 and Schedule 1 of the CFA, the company is entitled to receive, as consideration for the grant of management rights to AAPC, 70% of the gross revenue generated by AAPC - AAPC retains the other 30%. The relevant obligations of the company are to pay: * (1) for all utility services (including electricity, gas and water) relating to the conference facilities, and any maintenance materials used for the conference lots (clause 1.3). This appears to have been conventionally approximated as $1,500 per month, which has been deducted from the amounts remitted to Eye Plantain. Offsetting that, the operator is responsible for any labour relating to minor repairs and maintenance, and for cleaning and tidying the facilities (clauses 1.4 and 1.5).
* (2) for its own property, machinery and contents insurances (clause 1.6). But it would be responsible for its own insurances in any event.
* (3) an amount reasonably determined by the operator to meet the costs of maintaining, replacing or redecorating the furniture, fittings and base contents, and any major refurbishment or changes to the conference lots considered necessary or desirable by the operator to keep the facilities at a 4.5 star standard (clause 4.4). However, all furniture, fittings and equipment so acquired are the property of the owner (clause 4.3).
The company may dispose of its interest in the conference lots, but must first cause the incoming owner to execute a deed poll agreeing to comply with all the owner's obligations under the CFA, whereupon the outgoing owner is released from all its obligations under the agreement.
In practice, the contract consistently produces net benefits for Eye Plantain: after deduction of utilities and FF&E contributions, Eye Plantain has derived net income from the contract over the last five years as follows: in 2012, $170,904; in 2013, $112,598; in 2014, $97,643; and in the first six months of 2015, $65,825.
The liquidator invokes a number of matters in aid of the contention that the contract is nonetheless an "unprofitable" one.
First, reference is made to the lengthy term. As it will not expire until 2086, the term is admittedly a very lengthy one. But while a long term contract from which a company cannot escape and under which it is making a loss might well be "unprofitable", a contract under which the company is making a profit is not rendered "unprofitable" by the length of its term. Moreover, in this case, the company can extricate itself from the contract by disposing of the conference lots and having the purchaser execute the requisite deed poll.
Secondly, it was said that the potential for the operator to make a call for a FF&E contributions under clause 4.4 left the company exposed to an uncertain and indefinite liability. That such a call might be made is not entirely speculative - there is some suggestion of a need for renovations. However, the ability to make such a call is limited by the parameters of maintaining the conference facility to its 4.5 star standard, and reasonableness. Moreover, under clause 4.3, the benefit of any such expenditure is to the benefit of the owner, not the operator. There is no reason for thinking that such expenditure, if required, would outweigh the benefits derived by the owner under the contract.
Thirdly, it was said that because the room rates were at the discretion of the operator, and could be reduced to attract customers to the accommodation apartments by delegates (clause 3.3), future benefits to the owner were effectively at the discretion of the operator. However, the remuneration structure (30% of gross revenue for the operator, and the balance for the owner) incentivises the operator to maximise gross revenue, from which the owner benefits even more (clause 3.3). Furthermore, the contract provides that if conference room rates are discounted to attract customers to the apartments, then the owner is entitled to be compensated at an appropriate market (not discounted) rate (clause 3.4).
Fourthly, it was argued that the CFA impacted adversely on the saleability of the conference lots. In particular, it was submitted that the valuation evidence of Mr Wotton indicated that the conference lots would be difficult to sell, more so with the CFA on foot, and that a better price would probably be achieved if the lots were unaffected by the CFA because they could then be used as food and drink premises. However, this argument fails on two bases. The first is that its factual basis was not made good: Mr Wotton assumed that the conference lots could be used for food and drink outlets; but under the strata plan bylaws, they can only be used as a conference centre (and only by AAPC). The second is that even if the lots could be sold more readily and at a higher price without the CFA, that does not render the contract unprofitable. If the conference lots cannot be sold (or readily sold), by reason of the CFA, then the liquidator can disclaim the conference lots under [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 568(1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) However, the liquidator (understandably) does not seek to do so, because the evidence indicates that the conference lots are realisable, if with some difficulty, for a not insubstantial value. In reality, the liquidator is seeking to use [s 568](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html), not to rid himself of onerous property, but to enhance the divisible property by ridding himself of a profitable contract. That he cannot do, at least without the leave of the Court. Leave has not been sought, let alone obtained.
The purported disclaimers by Eye Plantain are therefore without effect and nullities.

Should the disclaimers be set aside under [s 568B?](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html)
As I have concluded that all three purported disclaimers are nullities, it is unnecessary to consider whether they should be set aside under [s 568B.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568b.html) 
Conclusion and orders
The CFA confers no contractual rights on Blue Sennar, whose liquidator is therefore not entitled to disclaim it under [s 568.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) From the perspective of Eye Plantain, the CFA and CFL were not unprofitable contracts, and the defendants required the leave of the Court under [s 568(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html) in order to disclaim them. They did not obtain such leave. It follows that all three purported disclaimers are nullities.
Accordingly, the Court declares that: * (1) The Conference Facilities Agreement (for the Sebel Manly Beach) dated 11 May 2006 was not property of Blue Sennar Pty Limited, and the first defendant was not entitled to disclaim it.
* (2) The second defendant required the leave of the Court under (CTH) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 568(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s568.html), in order to disclaim the Conference Facilities Agreement (for the Sebel Manly Beach) dated 11 May 2006 and the Deed Poll dated 13 December 2006, and the Conference Facilities Licence (at the Manly Sebel Hotel) dated 22 December 2009.
* (3) The purported disclaimers, notices of which were filed by the defendants with ASIC dated 21 August 2015, are nullities and have no effect.
The Court orders that: * (1) The defendants pay the plaintiff's costs.
