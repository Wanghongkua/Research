The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In each of these matters the Plaintiff seeks an order pursuant to s.134 of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) requiring the Magistrate before whom committal proceedings are pending to reconsider applications made to him under [s.48E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). In each case the learned Magistrate has filed an appearance submitting to the orders of this Court but the relief sought is opposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
Some of the plaintiffs seek further forms of relief to which it will be necessary to return at a later stage.

On the 5th of September 1994 John Paul Newman the State member for the seat of
Cabramatta received two gunshot wounds while at the driveway of his home at 15
Woods Avenue, Cabramatta. Mr Newman died as a result of these wounds.

An inquest into Mr Newman's death was held and after some length of time the precise extent of which is not in evidence before me the inquest was terminated by the Coroner referring the papers to the Director of Public
Prosecutions.

The three plaintiffs now face committal proceedings in respect of the death of
Mr Newman and, as I understand it, each plaintiff is charged with murdering Mr
Newman and with other offences relating to the alleged murder.

The plaintiffs were served with copies of statements from those witnesses upon whom the prosecution relies; as I understand it in excess of 90 statements being so served. The Plaintiff Dao requested the attendance of three prosecution witnesses under [s.48E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). The
Plaintiff Ngo sought the attendance of forty two witnesses and the Plaintiff
Tran sought the attendance of eight witnesses. The purposes for which cross- examination was sought were varied and differed from witness to witness and outlines of the reasons put forward by the respective plaintiffs are annexed to the affidavits filed on their behalf in this matter.

The learned Magistrate refused the plaintiffs' applications but did direct that three witnesses proffered by the prosecution should attend and give oral evidence in the proposed committal proceedings which presently stand adjourned to the 22nd of this month. The decision of the learned Magistrate was handed down on the 30th of April 1998. Each applicant has attached what is described as an unofficial transcript of the Magistrate's decision as part of the material in support of their applications. With the consent of counsel for the
Director of Public Prosecutions the argument before me proceeded on the basis of annexure "D" to the affidavit of Michael Brian Joshua Lee, filed on behalf of the plaintiff Ngo. The versions filed on behalf of the other plaintiffs contain no significantly different material.

A number of authorities were referred to by the learned Magistrate but he did not have the advantage of the decision of Studdert J (unreported, 28 May 1998) in the matter of Nader Hanna v. Vincent Kearney and the Commonwealth
Department of Public Prosecutions and Boris Mileshkin v. Commonwealth
Department of Public Prosecutions and Anor. in which his Honour gave detailed consideration to the provisions of [s.48E(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) of the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) and reviewed the relevant authorities to date.

At page 3 of his Judgment, Studdert J referred to the limitations upon the nature of relief available under s.134 of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) and, in particular, to the Judgment of Priestley JA in Saffron v. The Department of
Public Prosecutions [(1989) 16 NSWLR 397] in which the principles stated by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire
Council <case>; [(1947) 47 SR 416] were discussed. Without repeating the detail set out in Studdert J's Judgment, suffice it to say that it was accepted by all parties before me that it was necessary for me to find a constructive failure on the part of the Magistrate to exercise jurisdiction before it would be appropriate to make an order under s.134.

The relevant provisions of [s.48E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) for the purposes of the present case are as follows:- "(1) For the purposes of committal proceedings, the Justices or Justices may give a direction requiring the attendance at the proceedings of a person who has made a written statement for the purposes of this Subdivision. The direction may be given on the application of the defendant or informant or on the motion of the justice or Justices.

The Justice or Justices may give the direction only if: ...
 in any other case - the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence." 
Studdert J went on to refer to the decision of Hidden J in Losurdo v. The
Director of Public Prosecutions (unreported, 10 March 1998); that decision was also before the learned Magistrate in the present case and indeed he referred to passages therein in his decision. It is to be noted that Studdert
J, in my view, quotes Hidden J's remarks with approval and also particularly refers to Hidden J's statement that it may be appropriate to allow cross- examination at committal with an eye to the exercise of a discretion to exclude evidence at a subsequent trial even though the Magistrate had no such discretion at the committal hearing.

The following passages from the judgment of Studdert J are, in my judgment, of particular significance and relevance to the present applications.
 "It seems to me that a consideration of the various applications made under [s.48E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) warranted discrete consideration of the content of each statement sought to be introduced by the prosecution. This is because the evidence to be found in the statements addressed different issues and prompted different reasons for the requirements advanced for cross-examination. It was not intended to pursue the same issues with each of the witnesses whose attendance on committal was sought." (p.9) "I have not exhaustively recorded the reasons advanced by counsel for all the applications made by the plaintiffs under [s.48E.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html)
On the contrary, I have referred to some objectives simply to emphasise the need for discrete consideration of what is behind the application to cross- examine each witness. Unless such discrete consideration is given, the task under [s.48E(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) cannot be properly addressed." (p.10) 
According to the transcript of the learned Magistrate's decision in the present case he did refer in general terms to each plaintiff and the application made on his behalf, see in particular p.3. There is further reference to a specific submission on behalf of the plaintiff Ngo at the foot of p.4. However, it seems to me that the essence of his decision is contained within the following passage at p.5.
 "In considering the history of this matter, particularly the fact that literally dozens and dozens of witnesses were called and examined and cross- examined in the context of proceedings culminating in their ultimately being referred for committal for trial, the service upon them of [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s19.html) notices in the context of the Coronial jurisdiction, the opportunity afforded at least to participate in the proceedings, whether availed of or otherwise and more especially the legislative intention of the section. Even accepting, as the Court must, on the most recent Supreme Court pronouncement or decision that substantial reasons could be shown in the majority of cases, even accepting all of that it would be the view of this Court that the reasons advanced by the applicants, the defendants to ground substantial reason to cross-examine or indeed to further cross-examine witnesses already subjected to that ordeal, that is of cross-examination are not sustained." 
It does not seem to me that in that paragraph in particular nor anywhere else in the transcript of his decision did the learned Magistrate conduct the exercise postulated by Studdert J.

I respectfully agree with Studdert J's approach to the interpretation of [s.48E(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) and accordingly on that basis alone in my judgment the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought in the present case.

However, as is apparent from the passage already referred to in his decision, the learned Magistrate appears to have attached weight to the fact that there have been lengthy proceedings before the Coroner. In those proceedings the plaintiff Ngo had been represented by counsel but the other plaintiffs were not represented except to some extent when they themselves were called to give evidence. There was dispute before me as to whether the transcript of proceedings at the inquest was before the learned Magistrate. Be that as it may, the fact that an inquest has taken place at which one of the plaintiffs was represented by counsel and the other two plaintiffs were not present and not represented (save as to the limited extent to which I have previously referred) cannot without more in my judgment be put in the scales generally against all the plaintiffs without distinction. It further reinforces in my judgment the need for discrete consideration of each witness from the point of view of each applicant seeking the attendance of that witness. For instance, it may be that a witness was cross-examined at the inquest on the issues sought to be covered at the committal. That fact would be capable of having some relevance in relation to the application under [s.48E(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) but would not in my judgment be conclusive as different considerations apply to the conduct of inquests and committal proceedings. In addition it is difficult to see how an issue of credibility could be assessed without physically hearing and observing a witness give evidence.

I was urged by counsel for all the plaintiffs to make some general remarks in support of their various applications. I decline to do this for the following reasons.

Firstly, I do not have available to me the material upon which properly to form a view about any particular witness, such material potentially including the witness's police statement as served and any relevant material from the inquest and any apparently relevant material contained in the other statements served.

Secondly, the mere fact that I may or may not have a different view from the learned Magistrate as to whether or not I would order the attendance of a witness has clearly been shown to be as irrelevant to the function which I am carrying out. See per Studdert J at p.16 of TS v. George (unreported, 14
April 1998). I do however adopt, with respect, the observations made by
Studdert J at pp 11 and 12 of his Judgment in the Hanna case: "1. [Section
E(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) plainly has a primary aim the limitation of the time occupied in committal proceedings. Such proceedings are not to provide the opportunity for a full dress rehearsal for the trial. Cross-examination is to be eliminated unless it is required in the interests of justice for reasons that are reasons of substance.
There can be no rigid or exhaustive definition of what constitutes 'substantial reasons' and it would be undesirable to attempt to give one.
Relevant issues inevitably vary from case to case. However, any statement served has to be considered with reference to the issues it addresses and the charge to which it relates. The application to cross-examine requires identification and consideration of the objective of the cross-examiner, and the framework of the prosecution case. To require a witness for cross- examination without a definite aim but in the hope of eliciting some evidence that might prove useful to the defence would not constitute 'substantial reasons'. It is for the applicant to clearly define the purpose or purposes of the cross-examination which he seeks.
It would be wrong to limit 'substantial reasons' to situations where cross-examination is likely to result in the discharge of the defendant or to establish grounds for a no bill application. Equally it would be wrong to limit 'substantial reasons' to situations where cross-examination is likely to substantially undermine the credit of an important witness. 'Substantial reasons' may well be found elsewhere.
On the proceedings under [s.48E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s48e.html) the fundamental objective of committal proceedings must be borne in mind, namely the objective of facilitating a fair trial in the event that the person charged is committed and later stands trial. This may mean that there are substantial reasons for requiring a witness for cross-examination for a proper understanding of the basis of a relevant opinion held by a witness. I do but give those instances, I certainly do not intend them to be exhaustive.
'Substantial reason' may be shown for cross-examination where this may lead to the narrowing of matters in dispute: see Goldsmith v. Newman (supra) at 411. This is a consideration of particular importance where the prospect exists of a lengthy trial, as it does in the present cases." 
It is for the above reasons and in the light of the authorities to which I have previously referred that I decline to make the declaration sought by the plaintiff Tran in paragraph numbered 1 of his Summons; nor do I regard the injunction sought in paragraph 3 of his Summons as appropriate or necessary.
For the same reasons, I decline to make the declarations or to grant the orders sought by the plaintiff Dao in paragraphs 1 to 4 inclusive of his
Summons.

I make the following orders:-
