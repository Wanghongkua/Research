Lightbody versus Muroa Pty Ltd Matter No 4306/96 [1997] NSWSC 513 (27 October )

Lightbody versus Muroa Pty Ltd /96 October 1997 
Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /96 LIGHTBODY versus MUROA PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT MOTION FILED 19 SEPTEMBER 1997 
HIS HONOUR: On 19 September 1997 Mr K O'Meara filed a notice of motion in these proceedings seeking orders restraining any person not constituting a court under the Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) from exercising the judical power of the Commonwealth. He also seeks a declaration that the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is void.
In argument, I understood him also to seek a declaration that the Corporations
Law was void. He also wishes to restrain his and his wife's examination under the Corporations Law until these questions are decided.

I put to Mr O'Meara that he had no standing to seek the principal orders. His reply was that I had already recognized his status in Muroa Pty Ltd v
O'Meara [(1997) 15 ACLC 1427.] This submission is incorrect. Further, I can see no reason why, under the law as to standing, Mr O'Meara has any special status to challenge the validity of that legislation or who can exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth.

As to an injunction to restrain the examinations pending the determination of the "constitutional point", the short answer is that the obligation to attend the examinations is, ultimately, a matter of an order of a superior court which is presumed to be valid unless set aside.

I accordingly dismiss this notice of motion.

JUDGMENT MOTION FILED 9 OCTOBER 1997 
HIS HONOUR: This is a motion filed by Mr O'Meara, a contributory of the company in liquidation, for the liquidation to be declared void and of no effect. The points raised by Mr O'Meara in the motion go either to: alleged procedural irregularities, or breach of undertakings given to him by the petitioning creditors when earlier proceedings were pending in the District Court at Newcastle.

Even if either or both of these matters were correct in fact, it would not have the result in law that the winding up order was void. Accordingly, the notice of motion of 9 October 1997 is dismissed with costs.
