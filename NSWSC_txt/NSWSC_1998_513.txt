David Kirby J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a matter with a long history. It arises out of certain agreements which are said to have been made in 1986, and which were the subject of a Statement of Claim issued on behalf of the plaintiff in 1991. 
Each of the defendants thereafter filed Statements of Defence. There has been correspondence relating to discovery, and other steps to prosecute the various claims which, I might say, include a cross-claim. However, on 8 February 1993, the plaintiff entered into a Deed of Assignment under Pt X of the Bankruptcy
Act. Mr Richard Brien was appointed Trustee under that Deed. This fact did not come to the notice of the solicitors acting for the various defendants until much later.

On 9 February 1998, Messrs Harper Watson, solicitors, wrote to the Trustee advising him of the action. Indeed, that letter included a copy of the
Statement of Claim, as well as a document which was titled Memorandum as to
Facts in Dispute, which was dated 12 December 1997. The letter called upon the Trustee to advise the solicitors, as soon as possible, of a number of things, including whether or not he was authorised to continue the proceedings or proposed to continue the proceedings.

Correspondence was then exchanged back and forth over the following months, and the matter was from time to time called over in this Court. Ultimately, on July 1998, a Motion was filed on behalf of the first, second and third defendants seeking a number of orders, including that the plaintiff's
Statement of Claim be dismissed or, in the alternative, the proceedings be stayed. I should have said that the action by the plaintiff was against a number of parties, the last of whom was, one gathers, a firm of solicitors which, it is said, was responsible for the drafting of certain documents.

The Notice of Motion was supported by an affidavit of Jacqueline Gabriel
Foord, which was affirmed on 17 July 1998. The affidavit annexed various letters, including a letter of 9 February 1998 to the Trustee. That Notice of
Motion nominates today, 23 September 1998, as the return date. Until an application was made by Mr Robinson, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff, that was the matter which was to be determined today.

However when the proceedings began this morning, Mr Robinson sought to file in
Court his own Notice of Motion, he acting on behalf of the plaintiff, Leslie
Mechtler, and also on behalf of the Trustee under the Deed of Assignment, that is Mr Richard Brien. The orders he sought were: first, that an extension of time be granted for the making of an election to prosecute the plaintiff's claim, pursuant to s33 of the Bankruptcy Act 1996, and costs.

The reason for Mr Robinson's action was, no doubt, the provision in the
Bankruptcy Act, s60(3), which provides that, if a Trustee does not make an election within 28 days after a notice is served upon him or her by the defendant or other parties to the action, he or she shall be deemed to have abandoned the action. That provision has been the subject of some litigation and a number of decisions. The issue arises whether the letter to the Trustee on 9 February 1998 was notice of the action for the purposes of [s60(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s60.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), and if it was, whether, after the elapse of twenty-eight days, the Trustee is deemed to have abandoned the action.

The harsh effects of [s60(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s60.html) have, to some degree, been ameliorated in two ways. First, the capacity of the
Court, under [s33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s33.html), to extend the time within which the Trustee can elect to prosecute an action, and secondly, the fact that, in certain circumstances, the Trustee may commence a fresh action. The latter right is only of use where an action is still within time. This action, however, relates to a certain document dated
September 1986, and therefore one imagines, without examining the issue, that there are time problems.

Mr Robinson having filed his Notice of Motion, Mr Aldridge appearing on behalf of the first, second and third defendants, raised a threshold question of jurisdiction. The [Bankruptcy
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) was amended in 1996 by Act No 41 of 1996 to vest the Federal Court with jurisdiction in bankruptcy, which is described in [s27(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s27.html) of the [Bankruptcy
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/), as exclusive of the jurisdiction of all Courts other than the jurisdiction of the
High Court under [s75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s75.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
The provisions of that Act, as they stood before that amendment, which gave the Supreme Court a companion jurisdiction in relation to bankruptcy, were repealed. There were, however, transitional provisions. These provisions related only to proceedings in bankruptcy which were then on foot, having begun in a Supreme Court of a State or the Northern Territory before the amendment came into operation.

The [Bankruptcy
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) provides, under [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s5.html), a definition of "bankruptcy" and a definition of "proceedings". It is plain that the proceedings which are before this Court, by virtue of the Statement of
Claim filed in 1991 by Anton Mechtler, or on his behalf, are not proceedings which are saved by the transitional provisions.

Accordingly, it seems to me that the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with any application for an extension of time under [s33.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s33.html) 
Having dealt with that issue in the course of argument, Mr Robinson foreshadowed that, were I to take the view which I have now announced, he would seek an adjournment of the Notice of Motion by Mr Aldridge's client. It is plain from the long history of the matter that the precise rights of the plaintiff, and indeed of the Trustee, had not been fully examined one gathers, until after the Notice of Motion by the first, second and third defendants was filed. It seems to me that the plaintiff and the Trustee ought to be given an opportunity to make their application under [s33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s33.html) of the [Bankruptcy
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) for an extension of time. If they succeed, the action before the Supreme Court may well be pursued. If they do not, it may put an end to that action. However, they ought to have that opportunity subject to the usual order, which is that they bear the costs thrown away by this application, that is by the Notice of
Motion of Mr Aldridge's clients.

I might say the fourth defendant, through Miss Newcombe, solicitor, has also appeared, and obviously her costs have likewise been thrown away.

I therefore grant the adjournment. I dismiss the Notice of Motion filed in
Court by Mr Robinson on behalf of the Trustee and Anton Mechtler, with costs.
In respect to Mr Aldridge's Notice of Motion, I order that the plaintiff should pay the costs of each of the defendants, that is the first, second, third and fourth defendants, thrown away as a result of the adjournment. So far as the adjourned date is concerned, it must clearly abide the outcome of the application to be made under [s33.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s33.html)
Therefore there is no point at this time in fixing any day. However, I give leave to Mr Aldridge to approach the list judge to restore his Notice of
Motion once the [s33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s33.html) application has been dealt with, or within a period of one month if that application is not duly prosecuted. The defendants are at liberty to assess and seek payment of their costs after a period of twenty-eight days.
