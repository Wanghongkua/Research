Application of Feastys Family Restaurants P/L [1996] NSWSC 157 (27 May )

APPLICATION OF FEASTYS FAMILY RESTAURANTS PTY LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION) /96 
MONDAY 27 MAY 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application under <case> of the Corporations Law by a company in liquidation. There are pending proceedings against some of the previous directors of the company but the liquidator is short of funds to prosecute those proceedings. The liquidator is able to finance those proceedings by entering into an insured litigation finance agreement whereby funds provided by a bank and insurance provided by an insurance company will fund the litigation provided that there is a charge given over the fruits of the litigation. Because the litigation may continue for more than three months the agreement cannot be entered into without the sanction of the Court or the approval of the creditors or a committee of inspection. In the instant case there is no committee of inspection and some significant creditors are the defendants in the litigation so that, commercially speaking, it is not feasible to obtain the consent of the creditors.

From what I have seen of the insured litigation finance agreement, it is a perfectly proper arrangement whereby the liquidator does not have personal liability. The company's risk if the litigation fails is minimal and I think it is perfectly proper for the liquidator to enter into it.

Indeed, I would say that where there is a good reason for creditors not to be approached, the Court should make an order under <case>(2B) with insured litigation finance agreements almost as of course.

Accordingly, I make order 3 in the summons and order that costs of this application be costs in the liquidation.
