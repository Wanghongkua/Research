REGINA versus MARIA SOLEDAD BALBI /98 June 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: After the commencement of a bail application that I had been informed was ready to proceed, Mr. Lloyd, QC., appearing for the applicant, having seen the material tendered in evidence as Exhibit A on behalf of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and having referred to the material in his own application, was confronted with the realities of the case law under [s.8(A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/s8.html) of the [Bail Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/) which appeared to preclude his client from obtaining a grant of bail on the grounds that Mr. Lloyd had opened to me. He had however informed me in that opening that relatives of the applicant and persons who had personal knowledge of the applicant would be arriving in Australia from the Argentine in the near future. 
Essentially the application is made on the basis that although the Crown has a case on the offence charged, viz. possess prohibited import, it is not a strong case and it is said the applicant suffers from a psychological or psychiatric condition of agoraphobia, thus rendering the circumstances of her confinement most onerous.

I have been informed that it is the intention of the applicant's relatives to obtain and maintain secure flat accommodation for her with a 24 hour a day escort provided from amongst the family members. Nonetheless, it would appear that it is most unlikely that Mr. Lloyd would be able to make good a submission that bail should be granted. Realising this, Mr. Lloyd has sought that the matter stand adjourned until after succour arrives from the Argentine in the hope that it may assist the application. He has done this having regard to the provisions of the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ba41/) as to the consequences of a failed Supreme Court bail application for the future notwithstanding the prosecution brief has not yet been served and there would remain a considerable time before the matter were to go to trial.

Although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions opposes the application that the matter be stood over, I am reluctant to preclude Mr.
Lloyd from obtaining such material as might assist the reconsideration of this application and as to whether it should proceed or not.

In those circumstances, I stand the matter over to 8 July 1998.
