JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . This section enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending, in this case, for an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the Act.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 21 January 2015. In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity, namely, knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime intending to conceal that it is proceeds of crime, contrary to [s 193B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . That offence is a serious criminal offence pursuant to [s 6(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in para 4 of the affidavit. In short, he has read a fact sheet obtained from the New South Wales Police, which he has annexed to his affidavit. He made enquiries of the police to determine the correctness of the matters contained in the fact sheet and if that fact sheet was prepared as a result of the investigation described in it. Although the particular police officer who prepared the fact sheet was not available to answer those enquries, Mr Spark received answers which identified that the matters contained in the fact sheet were true and were prepared as a result of that investigation. In addition, Mr Spark has made enquiries and ascertained that the defendant has been charged with the offences described in the fact sheet.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) requires an order to be made by the Court if the Court is of the view that Mr Spark's suspicion is reasonably held. I have read the fact sheet and the other documents annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit and I am satisfied that his suspicion is reasonably held.
I am satisfied, further, as [s 10A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) requires that the defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is situated in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to the defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of and transferred, I do not consider that the defendant should be given notice of this application before the order is made. I am satisfied that Mr Spark has the necessary experience and knowledge to express that opinion. In any event, the applicant has rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to apply to the Court.
Leave to file in court the summons, the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 21 January 2015, together with the statement of facts and circumstances.
I note the usual undertaking is given.
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the draft order.
I grant the leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 3 and 6.
The orders may be taken out forthwith.
