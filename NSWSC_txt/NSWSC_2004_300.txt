EQUITY DIVISION  
GZELL J  
THURSDAY 15 APRIL 2004  /99 JEFF JOHN KEVERN versus GARRY MARSHALL  
EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT  Before the court is a notice of motion filed by the plaintiff seeking to enforce orders of the court made in the proceedings on 28 February 2001.  The [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p42) r 2 deals with enforcement of orders for the payment of money. It does not create substantive rights in the parties that do not otherwise accrue from the orders (Abigroup Ltd versus Abignano <case>; [(1992) 39 FCR 74] at 85). Here the only order made was to vacate all previous orders as to costs.  An undertaking to pay money is not a judgment or order and does not fall under the rule (Spindler versus Balog [(1959) 76 WN 391] at 393). An undertaking given to the court and embodied in an order, even as to payment of money, is enforceable as a judgment or order like an injunction by committal under r 6 (Biba Ltd versus Stratford Investments Ltd [[1973] Ch ] at ). Here no undertaking was given to the court, let alone it being embodied in an order of the court.  The [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) provides that the court shall grant all such remedies as any party may appear entitled to so that as far as possible all matters in controversy may be completely and finally determined and multiplicity of legal proceedings are avoided. It has been held that this provision grounds jurisdiction to enforce a settlement or compromise by motion in the original proceedings (Darling
Downs Investments Pty Ltd versus Ellwood [(1988) 18 FCR 510] at 526) at least in simple cases (Roberts versus Gippsland Agricultural & Earthmoving
Contracting Co Pty Ltd <case>; [[1956] VLR 555] at 557).  This course should not, however, be adopted where there are substantial matters in controversy that go beyond the ambit of the proceedings as originally constituted or where in the interests of justice, disposition of the matter as on summary judgment, is inappropriate (Phillips versus Walsh [(1990) 20 NSWLR 206] at 210).  Here the plaintiff agreed to give the defendant title and possession to bee- keeping and associated equipment at various locations. The agreement was that, provided he complied fully with those requirements, the defendant would pay him $52,500 by equal instalments over 5 years.  The plaintiff failed to comply fully with the requirements. For example a truck, forklift and charger had been removed by a landlord of the plaintiff and at least one of those items had been sold by him to discharge partially rent owed by the plaintiff. The defendant has paid the plaintiff nothing notwithstanding that he took possession of some equipment.  The relief the plaintiff seeks is rectification of the agreement between the parties or a claim for unjust enrichment. They stand outside the ambit of the terms of settlement and raise substantial matters of controversy. In my view it is inappropriate to deal with these issues in summary determination.  I dismiss the plaintiff's motion. In my view costs should follow the event.
I order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs.
