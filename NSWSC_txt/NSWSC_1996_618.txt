REGINA versus Kerry Neil ORROCK /96 
Friday 13 December 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES CRIMINAL DIVISION 
HUNT CJ at CL 
HIS HONOUR: 
The applicant has not been brought in today. The reason why will become apparent in a moment.

Although it is the law that a convicted person cannot be sentenced in his absence,[1] the applicant has already been sentenced, and my task is not to sentence him; rather, it is to determine a minimum and an additional term to replace the sentence of penal servitude for life imposed upon him on 27 May .

For the same reason, it is not, in my view, necessary to state orally my reasons for the terms which I propose to set, as it would be - either as a matter of principle, practice or precedent - if I were imposing a sentence.

Accordingly, I set a minimum term of eight years and seven months (which commenced on 26 April 1988 and concluded on 25 November 1996) and an additional term of seventeen days (which expired at midnight last night). I direct that the applicant be released from custody forthwith. I publish my reasons.

I should now explain that the reason why the applicant was not brought in was in order to avoid the logistical problems which would necessarily be involved in returning him to the gaol and in processing his release in time for him to be released today. With the consent of the Crown prosecutor, I have already arranged with Det Insp Inkster for an officer of the witness protection programme to attend at the gaol today so that the applicant may be entered into that programme immediately, and in accordance with his undertaking.
