REGINA versus ALAN SIU LUN LI /98 July 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: In the matter of Alan Siu Lun Li, I am of the view that bail must be refused. Mr. Li was arrested on 3 June and was charged with being knowingly concerned in the importation of a most substantial commercial quantity of heroin. There is a presumption against bail. 
The Crown case is, as usual, a strong case against certain of the persons who have been charged. In respect of this application, there is material proved in the Crown case that the applicant was party to the payment to one of the figures involved in the importation of a sum of $1,000, which it could be inferred was expenses money. There was a conversation recorded to which the applicant was party which would allow a conclusion that the applicant was giving directions as to the disposition of the heroin imported and as to avoiding apprehension.

The test under s.8A is such that before bail can be granted, it is necessary that I be satisfied, at the least, that there is a reasonably strong, indeed some cases put it as high as certain, chance that the applicant will be acquitted before I would grant bail. I am not satisfied in this case this application meets that test.

Although Mr. Lloyd, QC. has addressed me on the case being a weak circumstantial case, the charge is a charge of being knowingly concerned. The role the applicant, it is contended, played was one that could easily be accepted by a jury as evidenced by the material on which the Crown rely.

In those circumstances, I refuse bail.
