REGINA versus JASON HEATH ROBINSON /98 May 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: Application for bail has been made by Jason Heath Robinson in respect of a number of matters including four counts of aggravated armed robbery, armed with a shotgun, counts including armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, assault, aggravated assault with intent to rob and subsequently another two serious matters, kidnapping and possess shortened firearm. There is no presumption of bail for these offences and some nine of these offences, including the serious offences to which I have referred, were committed whilst on bail for offences due for mention on 15 July 1998 at the Fairfield Local Court of goods in custody and break, enter and steal. 
There are matters in a very extensive record which indicate a deleterious involvement with drugs and occasions on which he, not having appeared, warrants under s.80AA of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) had issued.

There has been provided in evidence material from the Drug and Alcohol Unit in the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater to indicate that
Mr. Robinson has become aware of his drug problem and has a keenness for gaining a better understanding of the issues. Arrangements were made with the
Westside Mission Rehabilitation Centre at Ebenezer to provide him with a bed and an opportunity for rehabilitation in the event that the court were minded to grant him bail, but looking at the seriousness of the offences in this matter and notwithstanding the evidence generously given on his behalf and the offer to go surety of Mrs. Robinson, I am of the view that the offences alleged against him are of such seriousness, particularly in the context of his involvement with drugs, that I could not reasonably grant him bail on this material.

The matters involving his rehabilitation are matters that no doubt will receive the proper attention of any sentencing court. In the circumstances bail is refused.
