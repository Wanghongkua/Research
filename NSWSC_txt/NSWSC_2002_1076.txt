DRAGO JAMBRECINA  
JUDGMENT  In matter number 20019 of 2002 the plaintiff, Mr Drago Jambrecina, filed a
Statement of Claim on 21 January. On 25 March he filed a Notice of Motion seeking leave to sue the defendants in liquidation. On 28 October leave was granted to the plaintiff (with the consent of the defendants) to file an
Amended Statement of Claim. Between January and October 2002 the matter has been before the Court on several occasions and the delay has principally been accounted for by the reference of the plaintiff who appears in person to the
Bar Association for pro bono legal advice. In these proceedings the defendants, by Notice of Motion filed on 25 March, have sought to have the proceedings stayed or dismissed and the Amended Statement of Claim struck out.  In proceedings 10820 of 2002 the plaintiffs (the defendants in the other proceedings) move the Court pursuant to s84(2) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to have the defendant, Mr Jambrecina, declared a vexatious litigant within the meaning of that section.  As part of the evidence in support of Pyramid's motion and summons is a document marked exhibit B which is a communication from Mr Hugh Marshall of counsel to the Chief Executive Officer of this Court consequent upon the pro bono referral. The communication does not disclose the substance of the advice which was given to Mr Jambrecina by Mr Marshall and also Mr Justin Young of counsel. However, it is clear that Mr Jambrecina has chosen to continue to appear in person, notwithstanding, one can readily infer, the general nature of advice he must have received.  The "history" of this litigation is founded in transactions dated 17
September 1987 when Mr and Mrs Jambrecina, as co-mortgagors, entered into a mortgage with an entity known as Combined Mortgage Services Pty Ltd, now known as Farrow Mortgage Services Pty Ltd, in relation to seven properties in
Queanbeyan. This, as the starting point is quite clear from the evidence tendered by Pyramid in the form of an affidavit in support of the summons, sworn by Brigitte Sandra Markovic on 27 March 2002. Exhibit BSM1 to that affidavit is a folder of documents that readily disclose the history of these proceedings.  I permitted Mr Jambrecina to rely upon a document described as an affidavit but which is in fact not sworn by him, which bears a date of 29 April 2002, to which he annexes a body of material a lot of which is in common with that contained in BSM1. That material was marked as exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is the transcript of proceedings which took place before Master Malpass on 13 July , to which tangential reference is made in the material tendered by
Pyramid. This material had to be admitted by me in the light of complaints made orally by Mr Jambrecina as to the alleged impropriety of conduct in those proceedings by counsel for Pyramid, Mr S T White, which allegations I hasten to state forthwith are without foundation, and at the very least represent a complete misconstruction on the part of Mr Jambrecina of the role of Mr White and the submissions he was making to the learned Master.  To facilitate the resolution of both proceedings the legal representatives of Pyramid have been good enough to construct, based upon the material in
BSM1, a chronology. That chronology is appended to these reasons and marked "A"  
Pyramid's Motion in relation to Amended Statement of Claim   On 17 December 1992 orders were made by consent that Pyramid obtain possession of the properties, having instituted proceedings therefor in that year. That judgment was entered on 2 March 1993. It is to be observed that the current Amended Statement of Claim represents the fourth occasion in which Mr
Jambrecina has initiated proceedings of this kind after the entry of judgment pursuant to consent orders in the original possession action. By reference to the chronology it can be seen that the first of those proceedings (23/7/1996) was instituted in the Supreme Court of the ACT. Thereafter the proceedings have been in this Court.  The Amended Statement of Claim is properly exposed as one, on any view, which discloses no reasonable cause of action (SCR [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p13) r 5(a)) and constitutes an abuse of process (r 5(c)) and is amenable to being struck out thereby and the proceedings dismissed (see SCR [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p15) r 26(1)(a), (b) and (c)).  The pleading, which is founded, so it clearly appears, in the same properties that have generated litigation hitherto, contrary to what underpins the relationship between the parties years ago, seeks to artificially advance some limitation period by reference to a deed. Clause 20 of the mortgage, clearly gave the mortgagee a discretion to accept partial discharge: this is simply ignored by the plaintiff. The defendant is embarrassed, to say the least, by allegations that raise both express and implied terms, without a hint as the source of the express term, let alone as to what facts and matters and circumstances give rise to any implication.  Allegations as to the application of the proceeds of partial discharge otherwise than to reduce arrears of interest are made. Nothing could support that. Nothing derogates from the right of the mortgagee to apply such finds as against the total outstanding balance.  Allegations which could be understood as ones of breach of duty and misrepresentation are time-barred.  Allegations as to the mortgagee unreasonably delaying sales is supported by no relevant particulars that provides any basis for the defendant understanding the nature of the allegation made against it.  The same rules apply to a litigant in person in terms of compliance with requirements as to pleading as to any other litigant. Nothing Mr Jambrecina was able to say in oral submissions derogates from the force of the attack made upon the Amended Statement of Claim by the defendant. It is a hopeless pleading and as far as it can be understood at all, points to an outcome that is hopeless in terms of what the plaintiff might be seeking to achieve.  Accordingly, I strike out the Amended Statement of Claim and dismiss the proceedings (20019 of 2002).  
S84(2) - vexatious litigant   S84(2) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is in the following terms:  (2) Where any person (in this subsection called the "vexatious litigant") habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground institutes vexatious legal proceedings against any person (in this subsection called the "person aggrieved"), whether in the Court or in any inferior court, the Court may, on application by the person aggrieved, order that the vexatious litigant shall not, without leave of the Court, institute any legal proceedings against the person aggrieved in any court and that any legal proceedings instituted by the vexatious litigant against the person aggrieved in any court before the making of the order shall not be continued by the vexatious litigant without leave of the Court.  It can be observed that the person against whom the order is sought must be shown to have "habitually and persistently" instituted the relevant proceedings without reasonable grounds (see Attorney-General versus Wentworth [(1988) 14 NSWLR 481]; Jones versus Skyring <case>; [(1992) 109 ALR 303]; [66 ALJR 810).]  For the purposes of this section: "relevant" proceedings are confined to those in this Court or inferior State courts, however, similar proceedings in other jurisdictions may bear upon the characterisation of the proceedings as "vexatious": Ramsay versus Skyring <case>; [(1999) 164 ALR 378] at 380 per Sackville J. It is, of course, also essential that the substance of the proceedings must be the same. As to this latter requirement there can be no doubt in this case. The examination of all the proceedings instituted (including those in the Supreme Court of the ACT) points to relief in some way being sought by the defendant in relation to the mortgages the default in which led to the consent orders for possession on It seems, on the authorities, that mere frequency of the bringing of proceedings is not enough (eg Valassis versus South Sydney Council [(1996) 92
LGRA 275]; Attorney-General versus Wentworth, above, at 492)  It also appears that the absence of reasonable grounds for the bringing of proceedings is not a prerequisite for the making of an order under s84(2) (Attorney-General versus Solomon [(1987) 8 NSWLR 667] at 673).  Whilst I am in no position to find, for example, that the proceedings have been bought by the defendant to annoy or embarrass the plaintiffs (though no doubt they have had that effect) I am in a position in relation to steps taken by the defendant in the Federal Court of Australia (Bankruptcy Division) in
March 2001 and February 2002 which can be characterised as seeking to add frustration to the litigation's course. The bankruptcy proceedings were an inevitable consequence of the plaintiffs having succeeded generally and persistently against this defendant. Whilst the steps taken by the defendant in the Federal Court's Bankruptcy Division cannot in any way be determinative of the plaintiffs' present application, when viewed in the context of the history of the actions they provide evidence that goes to a persistence and a collateral purpose in relation to the proceedings in this Court, namely to forestall the determination of the proceedings in the Bankruptcy Jurisdiction, and indeed, as was submitted by the plaintiffs, to defeat the Creditor's
Petition. Thus, I am prepared to hold that this defendant has gone beyond but "mere frequency"; he has persisted in proceedings of the same substance and with a purpose alien thereto, namely, to frustrate the plaintiff's proceedings in the Bankruptcy Jurisdiction, which proceedings themselves flow from unsuccessful proceedings by this defendant against the plaintiffs (the pursuit of orders for costs). Further, by reason of the hopelessness of the action the defendant seeks to bring as a plaintiff to which I have referred in my observations in relation to the Amended Statement of Claim, the orders that the plaintiffs seek must, in my view, inevitably be made.  As Sackville J remarked (at 389) in Ramsay versus Skyring, above, a statutory provision of this kind must be applied having regard to a fundamental principle of our legal system, namely, that every person has right of access to a court to seek remedies in consequence of an alleged infringement of rights. It is an "extreme" remedy. It may be "extreme" but it is not "general". The Court is constrained by the terms of s84(2) seriously to consider the matters to which it must attend. S84(1) is the more general power but it can only be exercised upon the Court's jurisdiction having been enlivened by an application by the Attorney-General.  An application of the kind with which I am concerned gives rise to a substantial tension. A tension between the right of a litigant to have access to justice and the right of the justice system itself to operate effectively in the community in relation to each and every other litigant, for example, in the Supreme Court. Resources are as strained as they are precious and the
Court must jealously guard its authority to deal with the rights of parties in circumstances where the rights of one have (consensually) been determined in its favour but are sought to be challenged, in the same way, again and again, without reasonable cause, by the initiation of proceedings by the other (which includes appeals; see Sackville J in Ramsay versus Skyring at 391 paragraph [59]).  The persistence of the defendant has, of course, bought it about that proceedings (by way of Notice of Motion to dismiss) have been imposed upon the plaintiffs, even though with success at the hands of the plaintiffs as the moving party. Such process by the plaintiffs have been provoked by the persistence in a hopeless cause by the defendant. Mr Jambrecina, doing the best he could, as I appreciate, and in an acceptable and unremarkable way, merely informed the Court to the effect that "the more time goes on the more he learns". When one considers the merits of the actions purported to be pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim by themselves, and in the context of the history set out in the chronology, it is quite clear that "time going on" must come to an end. As I have remarked, the remedy sought by the plaintiffs is an extreme one and it is by no means common (see for example,
Valassis versus M D Nikolaidis & Co, Simpson J, <case>  Accordingly, I make the following orders: 
In matter number 20019 of 2002 I strike out the Amended Statement of
Claim, dismiss the Notice of Motion filed 13 March2002 and dismiss the proceedings; and 
I order the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs. 
In matter number 10820 of 2002 I declare that the defendant is a vexatious litigant within the meaning of s84(2) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/); and 
I order that pursuant to s84(2) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) that the defendant shall not, without leave of the Court, institute any legal proceedings against the first or second plaintiff in any New South Wales court; and 
I order, pursuant to s84(2) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), that legal proceedings instituted by the defendant against the plaintiffs in any
New South Wales court prior to the making of orders 1 and 2 shall not be continued by the defendant without leave of the Court; and 
The defendant is to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the plaintiffs' summons. 
The exhibits are to be returned.
