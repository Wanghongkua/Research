Jls versus Jes [1996] NSWSC 217 (21 June 1996) 
JLS v. JES /96 
FRIDAY 21 JUNE 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
BRYSON J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I heard these proceedings on 3 May 1996 (in a Closed Court) and thereafter in Private Chambers and there is no transcript record.
 
The plaintiff is the mother of the child JES, a girl aged 14 years, who is the defendant. The plaintiff has applied to the Court for consent to carry out special medical treatment under s.20B of the [Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/capa1987250/). The treatment proposed is abdominal hysterectomy, which would render the child permanently infertile. 
Section 20B is in these terms: 
B. 
A person shall not carry out special medical treatment on a child who is under the age of 16 years otherwise than in accordance with this section.

Penalty on indictment: imprisonment for 7 years.

A registered medical practitioner may carry out special medical treatment on a child who is under the age of 16 years if: the medical practitioner is of the opinion that it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to carry out the treatment on the child in order to save the child's life or to prevent serious damage to the child's health; or the Supreme Court consents to the carrying out of the treatment.

Consent to the carrying out of special medical treatment on a child who is under the age of 16 years shall not be given unless the Supreme Court is satisfied that it is necessary to carry out the treatment on the child in order to save the child's life or to prevent serious damage to the child's health.

In this section: `medical treatment' includes: any medical procedure, operation or examination; and any treatment, procedure, operation or examination that is declared by the regulations to be medical treatment for the purposes of this section; `special medical treatment' means: any medical treatment that is intended, or is reasonably likely, to have the effect of rendering permanently infertile the person on whom it is carried out; or any other medical treatment that is declared by the regulations to be special medical treatment for the purposes of this section." 
As appears from subs.(2A), the consent asked for cannot be given unless the
Court is satisfied that it is necessary to carry out the treatment in order to prevent serious damage to the child's health. (On the facts the child's life is not at risk.) 
The child does not have the capacity to consent to the operation because she is quite unable to understand what the operation is or what its consequences would be. In any event an effect of s.20B is that, no matter what the understanding of the child, consent of a child under the age of 16 years does not make special medical treatment referred to in s.20B lawful.

The test stated in subs.(2A) means that the consent of the Court under s.20B cannot be given on grounds related only to views about the child's management and social integration, or to perceptions of the child's well-being that are not related to the prevention of serious damage to the child's health. A perception that there was some broad interest of society as a whole related to the control of reproductive capacity of mentally retarded persons would be entirely extraneous to the matters to be decided, even if it were to be supposed that there was some scientific basis on which such a perception should be held. If there is a basis for that perception, the evidence does not deal with it and in my understanding it is not a matter of common knowledge of which the Court can take notice under [s.144](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s144.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

The circumstances in which sterilisation operations may be carried out, and in which courts may authorise them to be carried out on children or other persons in a state of dependency have repeatedly come before the courts in recent years and have been the subject of published academic studies. Significant recommendations, supported by a collection of important material were contained in the report of the Family Law Council "Sterilization and other
Medical Procedures on Children" published by the Australian Government
Publishing Service in November 1994. For materials relating to sterilisation for eugenic reasons see particularly that report at p.47, para.4.29 and note
That report contains a comprehensive review of the subject and modern sources. In the law of New South Wales, and for this Court in the exercise of its powers under s.20B, the subject is a narrow one and the test to be applied is stringent. Perceptions of wider interests of society are not relevant for the question of necessity in subs.(2A). Considerations of the convenience of management and amenity of the child's life and circumstances cannot lead to a consent under subs.(2A) and at the most they may form context and circumstances within which to appraise the child's health and possible causes of damage to it. Concerns have recurringly been expressed to the effects that sterilisations may come to be authorised as a matter of routine without close attention to the facts relating to particular persons, or may come to be regarded as normal treatment for women with intellectual disabilities and that a judiciary composed largely of men may not be sufficiently advertent to the significance of sterilisation of women. If subs.(2A) is administered in a careful way there should be no reasonable ground for these concerns in relation to decisions under it.

The exercise by the Court of its power under s.20B is in my opinion subject to the general principle of law in which the welfare of the infant is the first and paramount consideration in decisions of Courts affecting welfare. This general principle is declared, not always comprehensively, in legislation; see [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/icasa1899354/s17.html) of the [Infants' Custody and Settlements Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/icasa1899354/) and s.64(1) of the [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) . Any legislation conferring power on Courts to make orders affecting the welfare of a child should in my opinion be interpreted so as to operate consistently with this general principle unless its terms clearly show otherwise. Under this principle the interests of the child are the paramount consideration. They are not however the sole consideration.

The jurisdiction relating to children conferred on the Family Court of
Australia by s.63 of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), and the powers relating to children in Pt.VII of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) were considered in Marion's Case <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 218], with effects authoritatively stated in the majority judgment (Mason CJ Deane Toohey and Gaudron JJ) in P. v. P. <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 583] at 598 as follows: "It was held in Marion's Case that since 1983, [Pt
VII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/index.html#p7) of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) has invested the Family Court with a welfare jurisdiction in respect of a child of a marriage which encompasses the substance of the traditional parens patriae jurisdiction freed from the preliminary requirement of a wardship order (ibid., at pp. 256, 294, 318). Marion's Case also established that, putting to one side the effect of any valid and applicable State or Territory legislation, the welfare jurisdiction of the Family Court extends, in the case of an incapable child of a marriage, to the authorization of medical treatment, including a medical procedure involving planned sterilization, where such treatment is necessary in the best interests of the child (ibid., at pp. 254-260)." 
The welfare jurisdiction under [Pt
VII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/index.html#p7) is also invested in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by [s.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s4.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) (and is no longer attributable to its earlier sources in the inherent jurisdiction of the Court and the Charter of Justice). I was not asked to exercise that welfare jurisdiction and I do not intend to do so. The terms in which the plaintiff's case were presented confined what I was asked to do to an exercise of the powers under s.20B.

In P. v. P. question 4 of the case stated required consideration whether the [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) by virtue of [s.109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) invalidated the [Guardianship Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) to the extent that the latter Act purports to prohibit or authorise a medical procedure to be carried out on a child of the marriage that is intended, or is reasonably likely, to have the effect of rendering the child permanently infertile; see 181 CLR at 592. The [Children (Care and Protection)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/capa1987250/) relates to medical treatment for children under the age of 16 years, and the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) relates to the treatment of patients of and above the age of 16 years; both State Acts could operate in relation to persons whose medical treatment or welfare had been or might be the subject of orders under Pt.VII of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/). The relevant provisions of Pt.5 of the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) deal with medical and dental treatment of patients in a much more comprehensive way than s.20B deals with the medical treatment children. [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/index.html#p5) of the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) also regulates "special treatment", that is, treatment intended or reasonably likely to have the effect of rendering permanently infertile persons on whom it is carried out, and that special treatment is regulated in a very similar way to the controls imposed on special treatment by s.20A of the Children Care and Protection Act. The provisions of the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) which were addressed by the High Court are set out at [181 CLR 593] to 596. They differ from s.20B in their comprehensiveness, and comprehensiveness was a significant aspect of the legislative scheme, and was commented on in the judgment of the majority at 596. In my opinion the reasoning which led the majority in P. v.
P. to uphold the validity of [s.35(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/s35.html) of the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) is applicable to s.20B, and the validity of s.20B is not reasonably open to question having regard to the views expressed in P. v. P. and the authority which must be attributed to the majority judgment.

The conclusions in the majority judgment were expressed thus at 606: "It follows that the general prohibition of `medical or dental treatment' of an incapable person imposed by [s.
(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/s35.html) of the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) is inconsistent with the provisions of [Pt
VII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/index.html#p7) of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) conferring welfare jurisdiction upon the Family Court to the extent that that general prohibition would preclude or render ineffective an order by the
Family Court authorizing such medical and dental treatment of an incapable child of a marriage aged sixteen years or more. To the extent of that inconsistency, [s.
(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/s35.html) of the [Guardianship
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ga1987136/) is rendered invalid by [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
That does not, of course, mean that [s.
(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s35.html) is generally invalid in so far as it applies to children of a marriage. The invalidity under [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) is, like the inconsistency, confined to the purported operation of the State Act to prohibit treatment authorized by the Family Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction validly conferred upon it by the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/). As a practical matter, that invalidity will only be significant in a case where the
Family Court exercises its jurisdiction to authorize particular medical treatment and then only in respect of that treatment." 
As the orders of the Family Court have not dealt with medical treatment in any way, the validity of the proposed orders of this Court does not come under consideration under [s.109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).

I felt that I ought to address the interaction of the welfare provisions of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) and s.20B, even in the absence of any contention that there was invalidity, but I am now satisfied that there is no room for any such contention.

It should in my opinion be taken to have been established by Marion's Case that the authorisation of a medical procedure involving sterilisation falls outside the ordinary scope of parental powers, but that this is so of a sterilisation which is not a by-product of surgery appropriately carried out to treat some malfunction or disease; see the majority judgment in P. v. P.
at [181 CLR 598.]
Dicta in Marion's Case also seem to establish that an infant may give an effectual consent to surgery which results in sterilisation, and that this may even be so for some infants who have intellectual disability. See 181 CLR at , 239. However these conclusions and dicta do not relate to the law of New
South Wales, which is established in quite a different way by s.20B so that the special medical treatment to which it refers is unlawful except when carried out in accordance with its provisions.

The child is a child of the marriage of the plaintiff and PSC; the marriage took place in Australia on 21 April 1979. The child was born on 11 August 1981 in New South Wales and has always lived in this State. Her parents separated in 1983. There have been proceedings in the Family Court of Australia at
Sydney relating to custody of the child, access and maintenance. Orders dealing with those subjects were made in proceedings No. S3689/83 on 17 June , 19 September 1983 and 11 February 1986. None of these orders dealt with medical treatment of the child. There would be no inconsistency between any order which I am asked to make in these proceedings and any of the orders which have been made by the Family Court of Australia relating to the child.
Under the first order the plaintiff was given custody of the child and her husband was given access at defined times on two days each calendar month and was ordered to pay maintenance. Arrangements for access were varied by later orders, and the Court accepted undertakings relating to arrears of maintenance and furnishing medical and other information relating to the child to the husband.

In fact the husband has not availed himself his right of access since about
The plaintiff has had sole responsibility for the care of the child since then. So far as appears, the marriage has not been dissolved.

There were earlier proceedings No. 2638/94 in this Division in which the same persons as now were parties. I have taken notice of the Summons, affidavits, exhibits, reasons for decision and orders in those proceedings. On 15 June the Court made an order giving consent under the same legislation to administration by intra-muscular injection of the drug Depot-Provera in dosages and at intervals which were specified.

The child is extremely severely handicapped, as my later findings show, and it is not possible for her to understand or participate in the proceedings.
Service of the Summons or delivery of other papers to her would have no meaning or effect. The Department of Community Services of the State and the precursor departments which exercise responsibility for legislation and the prerogatives of the Crown relating to the welfare of children have not been involved in the care or supervision of the child, and it would appear that they have no knowledge of her circumstances. I brought the proceedings to the attention of the Department soon after they were commenced and asked that the
Department intervene in the proceedings if that was regarded as appropriate, but there has been no intervention. The litigation falls to be decided then on the material brought forward on behalf of the plaintiff. That material appears to me to be full and clear, well considered and presented by the plaintiff and by persons who have sincere regard to the child's interests.

Evidence shows that the child has manifold severe disabilities, as well as being severely mentally retarded. She was assessed by Mr G.A.F, a qualified and registered psychologist on 22 December 1993 when she was aged 12 years and months; he used the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and the Personality Inventory for
Children. His significant conclusions were: "In intellectual terms, it is clearly apparent that she falls into the seriously limited population, equivalent to an IQ rating below 50. Under those conditions, one would have to describe her as ineducable beyond some of the more routine and simple social skills." "... she is unable to retain complex associations, and relatively unable to integrate what she has stored to the constantly changing environment to which she has to adapt. In simpler terms, she lacks the essential instruments of reasoning. However, she is able to respond to simple patterns of stimuli with which she is very familiar. (She) is well aware of her world, but she lacks the ability to use her `mental processes' to accurately predict the future. She lives in a perpetual present." "I see no hope that (she) would ever achieve functional independence. If her mother were to become incapable of caring for her, she would become the responsibility of another relative, or of the welfare system. However, she would probably be a very co-operative and conforming person within a caring environment. Outside of that environment, she would be grossly prone to abuse by any malevolent and manipulating individual or group. She would be mostly incapable of defending herself against any male who deliberately set out to abuse her through sexual behaviour. The effects of such abuse on her would be serious. Were she ever to conceive, she would be incapable of providing essential maternal care." 
The psychologist's conclusions were reviewed by Dr TE, Consultant Neurologist in January 1994; he expressed the view that it was clear that she had severely impaired mental function, uttered only a few words and understood only extremely simple instructions. Dr TE said "Therefore, I do agree, especially as she is an attractive girl, that she is at great risk of pregnancy and also of pelvic infection as she develops sexual maturity." 
In 1993 the child was seen several times by Dr WHP, a Physician. Dr WHP initiated steps which led to psychological testing by Mr GAF. In April 1994, when referring the child to Dr GBW, a Gynaecologist, Dr WHP gave a number of matters of history then known to him. These included a diagnosis at the age of of Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy; current therapy with Intal and Becotide after
Petit Mal attacks; that she had always been incontinent of urine at night and during febrile illnesses was frequently incontinent of urine and faeces and tended to vomit frequently; that she could walk but was very unstable and fell readily. She could not use elevators or public transport and was extremely sensitive to noises which agitated her enormously; she had recently had three Grand Mal seizures and she was absolutely inaccessible to explanation about menstruation or reproduction. He also found that she had had two menstrual periods which were both severely heavy and associated with extreme terror and frantic response on her part and that Primolut N had been prescribed to counteract severe menstrual loss.

On that referral she was seen by Dr GBW, a Consultant Obstetrician and
Gynaecologist. He reported on having been given a history that at the age of her menstrual periods commenced in March 1994 and that she was experiencing extremely heavy and prolonged bleeding with each cycle. The first period lasted six days and the second period commenced 19 days after expiration of the first. "Menstrual cycles have been catastrophic with the need to change pads hourly." He reported that she bled for up to 7 days consecutively.
"Attempts to control this with oral tablets of Progesterone were unsuccessful as this medication caused nausea and vomiting, resulting in a failure to absorb the medication and subsequently a failure to control menstruation.
Because of (her) neurological problems, she is regrettably absolutely inaccessible to explanation about menstruation or reproduction." Dr GBW advised that the most acceptable plan of management would be to start the child on Depot-Provera. "This should result in absence of menstruation, and coincidentally, with contraception should sexual abuse occur (despite the protection offered by her family)." 
In an affidavit Dr GBW set out his reasons for the view that injection of
Depot-Provera as he recommended would prevent serious damage to the child's health. In summary these were that continued prolonged and heavy menstruation could result in haemorrhage and ultimately in anomaeia due to iron and folic acid deficiency, itself requiring treatment and in the extreme case hospitalisation for blood transfusion. There would be psychological distress, illustrated by the child's reaction during menstruation narrated by the plaintiff. Dr GBW said "It is my opinion that the symptoms displayed ...
during periods of menstruation result in an emotional crisis in her life which puts her more at risk in hurting herself and making it more difficult for (her mother) being her sole provider and carer, to properly care for her. It also in my opinion reduces her already severely limited ability to cope with what is to her an inexplicable experience." It would prevent a pregnancy, to the risk of which the child might become exposed in more social environments such as Respite Care, out of continual supervision by her mother. Having regard to her mental retardation she was incapable of communicating any symptoms relating to pregnancy. An epileptic episode during pregnancy would increase three or four times the risk of foetal abnormality. She would suffer psychologically in that she does not have the capacity to comprehend the concept of pregnancy and would not have the capacity to mother a child. As caring for the child is a full time occupation, the mother's capacity would be overstretched and this would ultimately put the child's welfare and health at risk.

Upon this evidence given by the plaintiff and some further material obtained to deal with specific inquiries made by the Court, Hodgson J made the order of June 1994 to which I earlier referred.

In the present proceedings further evidence of Dr GBW, Gynaecologist, deals with the administration of Depot-Provera in accordance with the Court's earlier consent and with the child's medical history since then. Dr GBW administered Depot-Provera by intramuscular injection on 16 June, 28 July, 16
September and 1 November 1994. The administration of the drug did not effectively control irregular and intermittent bleeding during menstruation.
Dr GBW then recommended examination by a physician able to give a view on whether re-introduction of the drug would aggravate the child's neurological problem. Dr CES, a Physician, saw the child for review in December 1995. The plaintiff gave a history that the child had quite odd turns, usually at the supermarket relating to loud noise. "Apparently she suddenly bends forward, her head forward, she latches on to mother and takes small, shuffling steps.
Unfortunately, (her) communication is not sufficient to relay to mother what it has been that has troubled her. There is certainly no loss of consciousness or anything to suggest any seizure activity. This never occurs at home, although when there is quite a loud noise in conversation at home, mother feels that (she) gets somewhat agitated." An EEG showed an essentially normal picture with no epileptogenic activity recorded. Dr CES felt at a loss to explain the nature of the disturbance and suggested some further observations which might produce information which could assist in understanding it. She also expressed the view that re-exposure to Depot-Provera would most likely cause choreiform movements.

Dr WHP also saw the child again, in January 1996. He was given history that since she had been on Depot-Provera cyclical control had not been achieved and it appeared that her neurological problems had worsened. She had had more seizures and vomiting and fatigue attacks and seemed to be lethargic also.
There was an enhancement of her choreiform movements and she had also suffered breakthrough bleeding. Dr WHP advised "... I don't believe there is any purpose in persisting and feel that she should cease the preparation and alternative measures looked for for the control of her menstrual disorders."
He referred to earlier difficulty in taking oral medicine including vomiting which defeated oral hormone therapy and said "I feel that this brings us to a surgical method of coping with her distressing menstrual periods. I have suggested that ... you may discuss endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. My feeling is that whilst endometrial ablation is wonderful in concept, it doesn't always live up to the hopes and expectation of the procedure and it may well be that an abdominal hysterectomy would be the prudent surgical option for achieving a better quality of life for this unfortunate adolescent." 
On having these reports Dr GBW saw the plaintiff and the child again in
February 1996. He expressed the view that the preferable course to eliminate the intermittent and irregular bleeding during menstruation was for the child to undergo the operation advised by Dr WHP. He regarded endometrial ablation as inappropriate because the procedure is not reliable in that the symptoms of bleeding reappear in an unacceptable percentage of patients. He regarded the injection of the drug as unsuccessful and was of the view that any re- introduction of the drug may have an adverse effect. His view was "The most effective way to prevent the ongoing intermittent and irregular bleeding during menstruation is for (the child) to undergo operation." He expressed the opinion that the operation would prevent serious damage to the child's health and stated grounds, which are those which he put forward in his evidence in the earlier application; that prolonged and heavy menstruation could amount to haemorrhage, the elimination of psychological distress, enhancement of quality of life and prevention of pregnancy. He was of the view that it was unacceptable to have her exposed to the risk of becoming pregnant having regard to her mental retardation, epilepsy and condition generally. Use of
Tegretol as an anti-convulsant created risks of birth abnormality. Dr GBW also referred to a fear that the child would suffer psychologically in that she does not have capacity to comprehend concepts of pregnancy and would not understand the changes occurring to her and would not have the capacity to mother a child. He also referred to the difficulties for the plaintiff in the event that the child became pregnant and the implication of this for the child's welfare and health. The operation of abdominal hysterectomy does not involve the removal of the child's normal and healthy ovaries and she would retain normal hormonal bodily function.

The plaintiff in affidavit evidence set out in detail the circumstances of the child's daily living and management. The whole picture is one of unremitting demand for care, not contributed to by any understanding on the part of the child herself. There are manifold disabilities. The child is asthmatic. There is no other carer day by day. The plaintiff says and it is obviously true that at the age of 46 years she is finding it extremely difficult to look after the child by herself and that her ability to cope with the child would be made easier if the child were not subject to the trauma of menstruation; and that this would improve the plaintiff's ability to continue to care for her.

The plaintiff's evidence describes the symptoms and effects of the child's retardation. She has poor eyesight and finds it difficult to maintain clear focus; she finds it difficult to chew and swallow, to control tongue movement, to speak intelligibly, to maintain erect posture and balance, to walk without assistance; she falls readily; she finds it difficult to carry objects, sit up straight, hold a pencil or write and to control motion of limbs and head. She has a tendency to vomit frequently, for example if feeling anxious and whether or not she is ill. She requires a wheelchair outside her home environment, depends on her mother almost totally to make all choices in day to day living, is unable to interpret moods of other people or to discriminate between strangers and persons known; she is unable to read, to play by herself, for example to entertain herself with dolls or other toys independently of being entertained and supervised by the plaintiff. She is extremely sensitive to touch and resists the touch of doctors and therapists by growling, kicking and hitting. She is extremely sensitive to noise, for example in public environments such as shopping centres and busy roads, where she shows signs of great distress when there is noise. She is unable to feed herself, to shower, dress or groom herself; she is always incontinent of urine. She requires full time care. She is unable to comprehend menstruation and reacts in a most adverse way when it occurs, requiring much time and attention to calm her and to enable her mother to attend to her and clean her. She is terrified at the sight of menstrual blood and becomes panicky, angry and aggressive; this continues during menstrual bleeding, which occurs over 7 days, recurring every days, and there are adverse affects on her behaviour during the periods of bleeding. Depot-Provera had little if any effect on the bleeding and she reacted adversely to the drug, exhibiting fatigue, fluid retention, rash and acne, dizzy spells and sudden vomiting, disruption of sleep, long periods of bleeding, leg cramps, depression and other unusual symptoms. These symptoms led to a decision by Dr GBW to cease administration of the drug. The plaintiff has expressed concern at the possibility of the child becoming pregnant through sexual abuse while out of the plaintiff's direct supervision, as would increasingly occur as she approaches adulthood. The mother expresses a moral opposition to the concept of abortion except where termination of a pregnancy would remove a threat to the mother's life. The child has continued to have seizures, in 1994, 1995, 1996 and three in March 1996. She takes Tegretol, an anti-convulsant drug.

The test which is posed by the terms of subs.(2A) of s.20B is stringent. It is a test of necessity to carry out the treatment, and there must be a necessity to carry it out to prevent serious damage to the child's health. The evidence of Dr GBW, when considered in the setting of the child's disabilities, in my opinion shows that there is a necessity of that kind. The effects of menstruation constitute serious damage to the child's health and there is a necessity to carry out the operation because the other available measure of control has been tried with authorisation by the Court, and has not been effective.

In the workings of s.20B the test in subs.(2A) of satisfaction about necessity is not the only matter for the Court to consider. It is also for the Court to decide whether it should consent to the carrying out of the treatment. In coming to that conclusion the Court should in my opinion review the available material relating to the interests of the child, which are paramount, and other relevant interests, and come to a conclusion on the question whether or not consent should be given. In so deciding, when satisfied (as I am) that it is necessary to carry out the treatment to prevent serious damage to the child's health, that necessity is the most prominent consideration; but it is not the only consideration. The surgery under consideration is drastic and final; irreversible. It has to be brought under attention that the result of the Court's consent will be that the child will permanently lose her reproductive capacity. The result is an extreme one. However the child's mental retardation and manifold disabilities are so great that it is in my judgment not possible that, if the operation does not take place, the child could ever exercise her reproduction capacity with any understanding of what was taking place, still less with any of the self-realisation which comes with such understanding. With high likelihood, indeed with fair certainty there would be no more than a series of distressing, uncomprehended and disrupting events and circumstances. The burden would fall very heavily on the plaintiff, who is the child's only carer day by day, without any discernible advantage in terms of any value of which the child could know. In my view consideration of the interests of the child, which are paramount, requires that the consent of the Court be given. The same conclusion is supported by consideration of the interests of the plaintiff. The interests of the child which are involved are not only those closely related to her medical condition. Her interests and well-being will also be enhanced by reduction or containment of the degree of difficulty of the management of her life, including the basic tasks of daily living, and the availability to her of assistance in such management, provided as they now are by her mother but a lifelong necessity to be provided for her by some persons.

In my opinion I should give the Court's consent as asked.
