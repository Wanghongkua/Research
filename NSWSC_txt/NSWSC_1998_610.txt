The [Family Provision Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/)") provides for orders for provision in favour of eligible persons to be made out of the estate or notional estate of a deceased person. The Court may order that costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to proceedings under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) may be paid out of the estate or notional estate, or both, in such manner as the
Court thinks fit - [s33(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html)

Where provision is ordered out of an estate, the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) provides that the Court may specify that the whole or any part of a sum shall bear interest at such rate as the Court thinks fit for such period as the

Two errors in the assessment of the value of the estate in the judgment below led the Court to re-exercise the discretion in the light of fresh evidence adduced at the appeal. However, the appellant was not permitted to resile from a concession made below that she had no financial need standing in the way of the making of proper provision in favour of the respondent.

HELD, allowing the appeal and cross-appeal; 
The legal personal representative of the estate has a duty to assist the
Court by identifying as fully and early as possible the actual and notional estate, its condition and value at date of trial, and the exact burden of the costs order likely to fall on the estate.

In an ordinary case, a successful plaintiff will be awarded costs out of the estate and the defendant will be awarded costs on an indemnity basis out of the estate. However, the size of the estate and the conduct of a party may justify a departure, especially where the Court is of the view that the litigation has been prolonged unnecessarily.

Where the "executor's year" had passed and where the appellant had had the benefit of the distributed estate, interest should be payable from a date shortly after the date on which a proper order should have been made below. In the present case, this should be at the rate applicable to legacies from time to time, although the court is not confined to that rate.

Sandra Anne FIORENTINI versus Sonja O'NEILL 
JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: In proceedings under the [Family Provision Act 1982](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/)"), Cowdroy AJ ordered that the plaintiff receive a legacy of $110,000 to be paid out of the estate or notional estate of the deceased. It was also ordered that the costs of the plaintiff be paid out of the estate or notional estate and that the costs of the defendant executrix on an indemnity basis be paid or retained out of the estate or notional estate of the deceased. 
This appeal is brought by the defendant, who is also the sole beneficiary of the estate. She submits that the provision made in favour of the respondent (the plaintiff below) was too generous. The respondent cross-appeals. She submits that more specific orders should have been made by way of designating the items of notional estate that should bear the burden of any legacy ordered to be paid. His Honour identified three items of notional estate sufficient in value to carry the legacy, but he did not formally designate them.

Family history 
The deceased first married Kunigunde Box in 1960. The respondent was the only child of that marriage, having been born in 1961. In 1978 the deceased married the appellant. There was no issue of the second marriage. The deceased died in aged 61. By his last will dated 4 May 1983 he appointed the appellant his executrix and, in the events which happened, left his entire estate to her.

The marriage between the appellant and the deceased, which lasted 15 years until the deceased's death, was a happy and mutually supportive one. The appellant and the deceased worked together in the family business ("Quixspede
Service Station") with the appellant undertaking tasks relating to financial and accounting matters. The learned trial judge accepted that the appellant was a loving and supportive wife.

The respondent was in the care of her maternal grandparents for most of the first nine years of her life. She returned to her parents' custody in 1970.
When they separated in 1977 she first went with her mother, residing with her for the next year until she completed her Higher School Certificate. She lived with the deceased and the appellant between about 1980 and 1982, and she worked in the business for a period up to 1983.

In 1982 the respondent met and commenced to live with Barry O'Neill. They married in 1985 and (by the date of trial in 1996) had had two children, a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in 1989. The respondent and her family maintained a reasonably close relationship with the deceased and the appellant until the deceased's death in 1993.

Mr O'Neill worked in the business from 1983 until 1995, initially in the spare parts department. Gradually he moved into more senior roles as he acquired additional qualifications and experience. The trial judge found that he played an important role in the business. In 1990 Mr O'Neill was offered more lucrative employment by a Hornsby motor dealer. But he was persuaded to pass up this opportunity by the deceased, who effectively promised to transfer or bequeath the business to his son in law. It was found that, were it not for the deceased's statements, coupled with a sense of family loyalty, Mr O'Neill would have accepted the more lucrative position and that consequently both the respondent and he may have been better placed financially than they now are.
Mr O'Neill managed the business during the deceased's terminal illness between and 1 August 1993.

The family business 
The business to which reference has been made was at all material times vested in a company, Fiorentini Enterprises Pty Ltd. It traded under the name of
Quixspede. During his lifetime, the deceased held 9999 shares in the company and the appellant the remaining one share. Each of them drew wages. For fiscal year of 1990 the company's net profit after tax was $39,709. Thereafter profitability declined rapidly. There were losses in the order of $18,000 per annum for the fiscal years of 1992 and 1993.

After the deceased's death in 1993, the business continued to be operated by the appellant and Mr O'Neill. They worked cooperatively, and were able to secure the return of the Alfa Romeo parts dealership which had been lost earlier. The appellant advanced some personal funds to the company. Mr O'Neill continued with the day to day management of the workshop. He continued to receive his salary (which in December 1993 was $44,000 plus use of a motor vehicle).

The appellant became the sole shareholder of the company in consequence of the deceased's death and her inheritance of his whole estate. She transferred 100 shares to Mr O'Neill, but this was a token stake in the company and the transfer was apparently due to the perceived need to have at least two shareholders. Profitability continued to fall and the business was declining.

In January 1995 these proceedings were instituted and the appellant thereupon summarily dismissed Mr O'Neill. An outstanding liability of $28,918 owing by the company to Mr O'Neill for long service and annual leave entitlement has not been met.

Value of the estate 
At the time of the probate application the assets of the estate were valued as follows: 
Moneys held to the deceased's credit with 
Commonwealth Bank $ 84,258 
Shares in Fiorentini Enterprises Pty Ltd (9,999 shares) 352,954 
Loan account with the company 52,000 
Cabin cruiser 30,000 
Gun collection 5,000 
An additional asset of the deceased, a bulldozer, was later disclosed. No liabilities were disclosed.

It became clear at trial that the shares in the company did not have the value estimated in the probate application.

The trial judge summarised his findings as to the actual estate as follows: 
Sale of business 65,000 
Bank credit 84,258 
Sale of guns 1,000 
Sale of boat after repairs 16,500 
Value of bulldozer after repairs 5,300 $172,058 
The appellant submits that the judge erred in treating the value of the business realised on its sale ($65,000) as an asset of the estate. We agree.
The business belonged to the company. The estate owned the shares, not the business, and the liabilities of the company outstripped its assets. The value of the estate asset should have been nil. Earlier in his judgment, Cowdroy AJ had found that the company's liabilities were extensive and well in excess of its assets, which were the automotive mechanical workshop business known as "Quixspede Service Station" and the stock of spare parts. The business was sold in 1995 for $65,000. Counsel for the respondent submitted that the only error was the description of $65,000 as "sale of business". He submitted that the trial judge intended to hold that $65,000 was the true value of the shares. Despite the reference to "creative accounting", we do not read the passage relied upon (at AB 772) as supporting this contention, especially in the light of the reference to the value of the stock of spare parts which the judge estimated to be worth $30,000. The evidence as a whole does not indicate that the shares had any value when allowance is made for the debts of the company, which included moneys due to the deceased, Mr O'Neill and the appellant. This means that the true value of the actual estate as realised was in the order of $107,000.

It was also found that the deceased's notional estate (which passed to the appellant) included: 
Deceased's superannuation $142,000 
Bank credit $ 9,642 
One half share of sale of property at Euchareena [land owned jointly with the appellant and sold for $50,000 in August 1994] $ 25,000 
The appellant submits that the figure of $142,000 for superannuation should read $119,000, because the appellant lent back $23,000 of the superannuation moneys payable to her by the company which the company used (as to $22,303) in repaying a pre-existing loan by the superannuation fund to the company. The insolvency of the company means that the $23,000 advance has been lost. In our view this point is well taken.

With these adjustments, and taking the respondent's case at its highest, the actual and notional estate was worth approximately $260,000. Unfortunately, the trial judge was not given an estimate of trial costs and he made no express allowance for the costs of both parties which he was to order to be paid out of the estate. The hearing had lasted 6 days. (Evidence tendered in the appeal suggests that the combined trial costs could be as high as $130,000.) 
These errors, as well as the failure to address the discretionary requirements touching an order for designation of notional estate (discussed below), were in part contributed to by the way the case was fought at trial. It will be seen that the appellant did not give the Court the assistance she was obliged to provide as legal personal representative; and that there was effectively a concession that the appellant had no financial need standing in the way of the making of proper provision in favour of the respondent.

This Court must determine the respondent's claim afresh and, if necessary, exercise the judicial discretion to designate notional estate.

Why provision was ordered in respondent's favour 
The trial judge's reasons for making an order in the respondent's favour were summarised as follows:
The plaintiff was the only child of the deceased. I am satisfied there was no conduct disentitling the plaintiff to an order and that on the contrary, there was, as explained above, a close relationship with the deceased. It was usual for the plaintiff to see the deceased about once every six weeks, on birthdays and other occasions. I reject the defendant's contentions that the visits were infrequent during the deceased's illness. The one occasion relied upon by the defendant relating to the plaintiff's inability to attend because of a tennis commitment is trivial.
The plaintiff, through the family business which the deceased operated was financially dependent on the continued viability of the family business by virtue of her husband's employment in the business. Both the plaintiff and her husband had placed themselves in debt to their bank at a time when they had reason to believe that the income derived through Mr O'Neill's employment at the family business would continue.
The plaintiff's husband would have ceased employment at the family business and accepted the higher paid position which he was offered with the motor dealer at Hornsby had it not been for the statements made by the deceased to the effect that the business would one day be owned by them.
The deceased should have paid regard to the financial position of the defendant as compared to the means of his only daughter. The plaintiff and her husband have only one asset of value, namely, the interest in their residence, which is mortgaged.
The deceased made statements on numerous occasions to the effect that the business conducted by Fiorentini Enterprises Pty Limited would become the property of the plaintiff and her husband. He took no steps to honour this promise and the defendant has not done so either.
The plaintiff should have been the "natural object of the testamentary bounty of the testator" (per Churton versus Christian [(1988) 13 NSWLR ]
at 252-253. The deceased had not been a responsible parent in the earlier years of the plaintiff's life, having effectively entirely neglected her until she was a teenager. Accordingly, the deceased owed a special duty to her:
Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith versus Scales <case>; [(1962) 107 CLR 9] at 18; Gorton versus Parkes [(1989) 17 NSWLR 1] at 10.

The judgment makes plain that the learned judge fully appreciated that the onus rested upon the respondent to establish her claim under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/). The appellant bore no onus. She was the deceased's widow. She had contributed extensively to his business. And, most importantly she was his chosen beneficiary. However, she was also the executrix and defendant in the proceedings. As such, she should have given the Court more assistance than she did in identifying as fully and early as possible the actual and notional estate, its condition and value at date of trial, and the exact burden of the costs order likely to fall on the estate. See [Supreme Court
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p77) r59, Vasiljev versus Public Trustee [[1974] 2 NSWLR 497] at 503 and
Dijkhuijs (formerly Coney) versus Barclay [(1988) 13 NSWLR 639] at 654.

In an early affidavit (AB 14) the respondent made it clear that she was advancing the case that the appellant's needs did not operate to diminish her own claim upon the deceased's bounty. A notice to produce was served on the appellant in relation to her financial position. Very early in the trial, the judge indicated that it appeared that there was no evidence as to the assets of the appellant. This produced the response from the appellant's counsel that there was no dispute that the appellant had substantial assets and that she did not run her case on the basis that her financial position was such that it would be a competing claim situation (AB 274). Counsel for the appellant foreshadowed an application to set aside the notice to produce.

On the following day counsel for the appellant informed the judge that there had been discussions in relation to the subpoena issues. He indicated that he was having an affidavit prepared from his client which set out her assets, liabilities, income and outgoings, to show that the appellant was asset- wealthy but not wealthy in terms of cash flow. The affidavit would show that many of the assets were acquired before she was married to the deceased. The transcript records that his Honour was informed that, to the extent that this was a relevant factor in the exercise of his Honour's discretion, although there was "a change in tack. It will not show her a competing complainant" (AB 276). The following day the appellant swore an affidavit which was read in the proceedings (AB 264ff). This indicated that her income consisted of approximately $500 per week, most of which was rent from properties in which she had an interest. Approximately the same amount was spent on itemised outgoings. The affidavit also disclosed assets valued in excess of $1.5m the bulk of which consisted of interests in real estate acquired prior to the appellant's marriage to the deceased.

Based on this material and additional evidence that emerged during the hearing, the trial judge correctly inferred that any order which the Court might make in the respondent's favour would not detrimentally affect the appellant. The concessions about the appellant not standing as a competing claimant, together with the fact that the deceased's notional estate passed entirely to the appellant, seem to be the explanation for the somewhat casual approach adopted by the parties in relation to the formal orders relating to notional estate which were made below, apparently without objection.

The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in failing to address the discretionary requirements of a designation of notional estate. In particular, it is submitted that the factors which s27 requires to be considered before making an order designating property as notional estate were not taken into account. The "reasonable expectations" of the appellant in relation to the property passing to her in consequence of the death of the deceased meant, it is submitted, that virtually the whole of the actual and notional estate should not have been consumed in the provision ordered in favour of the respondent and the costs of the proceedings (cf s27(1)(a)). In our view this submission foundered on the concession to which reference has already been made. But the point is academic because the discretion has to be exercised afresh in this Court.

For the reasons given, the appellant has demonstrated error in the trial judge's assessment of the size of actual and notional estates available (after allowing for costs) to bear the burden of a proper provision in the respondent's favour. The parties join in asking this Court to determine the matter afresh, and they have put before the Court updated material to enable this to be done.

Not all of this fresh material is relevant if, as we would hold, the appellant should be held to the stance she adopted at trial. She conducted the case below on the basis that she advanced no claim of a financial nature in competition to the respondent's position. It would be unjust to allow departure from this position at this stage in the proceedings. Moreover, the additional material filed in the appeal shows that the appellant's financial position remains a comfortable one. Her financial position as at the appeal stands at approximately $1.8m, represented by investment property interests, a sizeable share portfolio and other invested savings.

In case it turns out to have relevance to unargued issues of the costs of the trial that were foreshadowed in address before us, we would record that in our view the trial judge was (a) unduly generous in determining that the respondent's "need" as demonstrated at trial called for a legacy in her favour in the sum of $110,000; and (b) erred in not stipulating that the legacy should bear interest.

In elaboration of (a), we have an initial difficulty in determining the basis upon which a legacy of $110,000 was thought appropriate. The learned judge merely stated: 
Taking all the circumstances into consideration, the plaintiff, in the absence of receiving the business, is entitled to a legacy out of the estate of the deceased. The plaintiff's home, which is modest, is heavily encumbered and is in need of repair, although the evidence does not quantify the amount of expenditure required. Had the deceased responsibly considered his testamentary obligations and weighed the competing claims he would have made appropriate provision for the plaintiff.

It is well nigh impossible to spell out the reasons justifying a particular sum and we are not saying that the judge erred in failing to do so. But the paucity of reasons added to the objective facts convinces us that $110,000 was an unduly generous provision in the light of the evidence at trial. Such a legacy represented well over one half of the available estate if the total of actual and notional estate is $260,000 and the costs of a 6 day hearing have to be deducted.

If the judge intended to provide a legacy sufficient to allow the respondent to discharge the existing mortgage over her family home ($100,000 principal outstanding at trial) with a small additional sum for house repairs, this was unduly generous in the circumstances. It may be appropriate in some cases, although it cannot generally be said that a parent has an obligation to provide an adult child with a home. Here it was relevant that $24,801 of the mortgage sum had been advanced (long after acquisition of the home) to enable the respondent and her husband to purchase a motor cruiser whose value at trial was $40,000. Doing the best we can in resolving what will probably turn out to be a purely historical issue, we would indicate that had the evidence stood as it did at trial $80,000 would have been an appropriate provision (although, as will be seen, it is not the figure which this Court should now award). In doing so, we also have regard to our comments about costs which follow later in this judgment.

As to (b), this was a ground of cross appeal. In our view the primary judge should have ordered that the legacy bear interest from a date one month after his order in a case where well over a year had elapsed since the death of the deceased. There was nothing to indicate that the making of an order would be the end of the litigation, as events have proved. If interest had been ordered, then the pendency of this appeal would not have operated to the prejudice of the respondent in the event of the status quo being maintained during its pendency. Again it should be recorded that it is unclear whether this matter was raised below.

Reassessing the respondent's claim 
We return to the adjudication of the respondent's claim in the light of a correct understanding of the size of the available estate (actual and notional) and of the relevant competing claims.

The assets now owned by the respondent and her husband, and their joint liabilities, are estimated as follows: 
ASSETS 
Two-thirds interest in home at Clareville (one-third being owned by the respondent's grandfather) $266,666 
Bank accounts $ 1,239 
Motor vehicle $ 3,000 
Furniture and household effects $ 6,000 
Motor cruiser $ 37,500 
Mr O'Neill's superannuation entitlement (gross) $ 26,150 
Respondent's superannuation entitlement (gross) $ 2,137 
Total: $342,692 
LIABILITIES 
Mortgage $152,480 
Credit cards $ 8,566 
Total: $ 161,046 
The respondent owes over $60,000 with respect to legal costs. Much of them are payable out of the estate pursuant to the orders made below.

The reasons which moved Cowdroy AJ to order a legacy in favour of the respondent remain effectively unchallenged. They are summarised in the numbered paragraphs set out on pp9-10 above. And the respondent's financial position has worsened since trial. The respondent has ceased employment as a teacher consequent upon the birth of a third child in March 1998. She currently receives a gross weekly income of about $250 for bookkeeping work plus family allowance of $35. Her husband's gross weekly income is about $636.
This income is currently absorbed in family expenses (about $25 per week being spent in relation to the boat). The expenses include $335 in mortgage payments.

The respondent's home (owned as to two thirds jointly with her husband and as to one third by her grandfather) remains heavily encumbered and in need of repair. The family is not in exiguous circumstances by any means, but neither is there any real surplus of income after the discharge of the ordinary living expenses of an expanding family. Fiorentini Enterprises Pty Ltd has been ordered to pay almost $19,000 to the respondent's husband in respect of wrongful dismissal and outstanding long service leave entitlement and costs.
The insolvency of the company means that these orders will remain unsatisfied.

It remains the case that the respondent's claim is based not only on the filial and familial relationship with the deceased but upon present need that stems, in part, from financial sacrifice in the deceased's favour made by the respondent and her husband. That sacrifice was no doubt itself a reflection of the filial and familial relationship between the respondent and her father.
Having regard to the assets at his disposal and the relative comfort (financially speaking) of his widow, the deceased ought to have made provision in the respondent's favour.

The difficult issue is to determine the size of appropriate provision. This turns largely upon the impact of the burden of costs of the proceedings on the available estate.

Costs in [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) proceedings 
The Court may order that the costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to proceedings under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) in relation to the estate or notional estate of a deceased person be paid out of the estate or notional estate, or both, in such manner as the Court thinks fit [(s33(1)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html)
The special provisions in [s33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html) and (3) relating to applications by those who are "eligible persons" by reason only of paras (c) or (d) of the definition may be left aside in the present case. However, [s33(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html) also stipulates generally that the Court shall not award costs in favour of an applicant just because he or she has been successful in the application.

In the ordinary case, a successful plaintiff will be awarded costs out of the estate and the defendant will be awarded costs on an indemnity basis out of the estate. However, the size of the estate and the conduct of a party may justify a departure. The discretion conferred under [s33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html) is broad. Either party, including the defendant legal personal representative, may be deprived of all or part of his or her costs if the circumstances justify it (Re Kennedy (Deceased) <case>; [[1920] VLR 513]; Re Klease [[1972] QWN 44]; Re S J
Hall [(1958) 59 SR 219] at ; Heuston versus Barber [(1990) 19 NSWLR 354] at 363).

Leaving aside the impact of unaccepted settlement offers, the usual costs order may be modified if the Court is of the view that the litigation has been prolonged unnecessarily. The Court should set its face against litigation in which an estate is unnecessarily consumed in costs. Neither party should assume that the usual order will follow as of course. Both plaintiffs and defendants should be encouraged to make open offers as early as practicable in the litigation. The plaintiff who fails to do so promptly may find that none or only part of his or her costs will be ordered to be paid out of the estate.
Of course a defendant is also well placed to make open offers and should do so in cases (like the present) where only the quantum of the plaintiff's claim is seriously in issue.

If the defendant is entitled to the residue of the estate, the litigation is really inter partes, if only for the practical reason that any order for costs out of the estate is effectively an order that the defendant pay them.
This may be relevant to the exercise of the costs discretion. The possibility of extravagant or wasteful conduct by a plaintiff in such a situation is the very reason why [s33(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s33.html) stipulates that success does not guarantee an order for costs. Conversely, the defendant's conduct in such litigation may preclude the defendant from seeking to reduce an otherwise proper order in favour of the plaintiff because the estate is depleted by costs.

There is also no reason why the costs order which might otherwise be made could not be displaced in a proper case in consequence of an unaccepted "Calderbank" offer made by either plaintiff or defendant. Cf [Supreme Court
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Part
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a) r22. In a case such as the present, where the litigation is effectively inter partes, there is no reason why these principles should not apply with full force against a defendant. But even where the defendant lacks a substantial interest in the estate, it may be appropriate to leave that party bearing out of his or her own pocket all or some of the costs of the proceedings if it appears that it was unreasonable to have rejected a suitable offer from the plaintiff. At the very least, the onus should rest on the defendant to demonstrate that unreasonable conduct flowed from express instructions from those interested in the estate before the usual consequences of rejecting a Calderbank offer are applied.

The present is a classical example of how family provision litigation can run hopelessly off the rails. It does not appear to have been seriously disputed at trial that the respondent was entitled to "an appropriate legacy". And it was established virtually at the outset of the trial that the deceased's widow was not advancing her financial needs as a basis for diminishing whatever proper order should be made in the daughter's favour. It beggars belief that the case went beyond one day in these circumstances, let alone for six days.
At whose door should the responsibility be laid? Regrettably it is difficult to apportion blame at this stage of the proceedings. The parties appear to have acquiesced in the trial judge making the usual order as to costs. At the very least, neither complains of these orders in the appeal.

This said, we do not think that the appellant can now complain that the estate is so denuded by the impact of costs that an otherwise proper order should not be made in the respondent's favour. As the legal personal representative, she knew or ought to have known of the true impact of the litigation upon the estate. It was her obligation to inform the Court about the quantum of costs and its impact upon the fund to meet an otherwise appropriate legacy in the respondent's favour. The respondent could at any time in the litigation have been put at risk as to costs by the making of an open offer to submit to an order for a particular legacy. In a situation where the appellant was the residuary legatee who had made the concession mentioned above, the onus lay squarely with her to take control of the litigation, or alternatively to conduct it in such a way as to put the respondent at risk as to costs or otherwise. Failure to have done so means that it now lies ill in the mouth of the appellant to contend that the available fund is so diminished that an otherwise appropriate legacy in the respondent's favour should be reduced by reason of the fact that its payment would leave the widow without otherwise appropriate provision out of the actual and notional estate passing to her.

These remarks have been stated in terms of the conduct of the parties. Of course parties are usually represented by solicitors and barristers. The conduct of the lawyers is attributed to the client for better or for worse.
The Court is seldom able to ascertain whether waste or delay was attributable to the lawyer or to the client upon whose express instructions the lawyer acted.

Interest 
Where provision is ordered out of an estate, the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) provides that the Court may specify that the whole or any part of a sum shall bear interest at such rate as the Court thinks fit for such period as the
Court thinks fit [(s11(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s11.html); see also [s15(3)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s15.html)
To avoid confusion, and preclude debate about the status of a lump sum provision as a legacy, it is advisable that the Court should address the question of interest expressly. Cf Davern Wright, Testator's Family
Maintenance 3rd ed, 1974, pp162-4.

It was submitted in argument, very much en passant, that s95 of the [Supreme
Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) might apply to certain orders for provision under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/).
Without expressing a definitive view, we are inclined to reject this proposition. Section 95(1) provides that where judgment is given or an order is made for the payment of money, interest shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be payable at the prescribed rate from the date when the order takes effect on so much of the money as is from time to time unpaid. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s14.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) provides that an order for provision out of the estate of a deceased person shall, except in so far as the Court otherwise directs, take effect as if the provision has been made: where the deceased died leaving a will - in a codicil to the will; or where the deceased died intestate - in a will of the deceased person.

Nevertheless, an order for family provision remains in essence a court order.
This said, we incline to the view that the mandatory terms in which s95 of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) is expressed are displaced by the discretions to order interest under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/). The discretion under [s11(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s11.html) requires the taking of a positive step by the Court. Indeed, [s15(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s15.html) goes further in relation to what its side note describes as consequential and ancillary orders by stipulating that interest is not payable unless the Court specifically provides that the money shall bear interest. In these circumstances it is difficult to see that there is any room for s95 to operate.

Until 1 September 1998 the prescribed rate of interest on a legacy was 8% per annum (Wills Probate and Administration Regulation 1993, reg 7). Since then it has been 6% (Wills Probate and Administration [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/)
Regulation 1998, reg 7). There is of course no reason why the Court is restricted to ordering interest at the rate applicable to legacies. The discretions under [ss11(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s11.html) and [15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s15.html)(3) are not so confined. There is no reason why a Court in the exercise of its discretion to award interest under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/) could not choose the prescribed rate appropriate to a judgment or order as applicable under s95 from time to time.

In a situation where the "executor's year" has long passed and where the appellant has had the benefit of the distributed estate, interest payable at least prospectively from a date shortly after the date on which a proper order should have been made below is appropriate. This should be at the rate applicable to legacies from time to time as distinct from any higher rate, having regard to the fact that the appellant has put some of the money received from the estate back into the failed company.

What order should now be made? 
In the light of the foregoing discussion, we would summarise the position facing this Court as follows:
In consequence of the death of the deceased, the appellant received the benefit of actual estate of $107,000 and notional estate of $153,000. With the exception of $25,000 realised upon the sale of the land in Euchareena in
August 1994 she has had the benefit of this money in cash since the death of the deceased on 1 August 1993.
However, she has had to outlay her own legal costs. Those costs must be taken to have been properly incurred, because there is no cross appeal against the trial judge's order as to costs. The appellant's estimated costs and disbursements of the trial were over $57,500.
Taking into account the considerations stipulated in [s27(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s27.html), it is appropriate to make an order designating property as notional estate. We are satisfied that the estate of the deceased is insufficient to allow the making of provision that should be made (cf [s28(1)(a)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s28.html)
While the appellant's claims on the deceased's bounty are far from minimal, her concession as to the priority of the respondent in relation to financial need means that no injustice is done by designating such property as is sufficient to meet an otherwise proper legacy. But what is proper must take into account the size of the distributable estate as well as the appellant's own claims stemming from the contribution she herself made, materially and otherwise, during the lifetime of the deceased to his welfare and estate (cf [s27(2)(e)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s27.html)
An order designating notional estate should not be made in relation to property in excess of that necessary to allow the making of such provision as should be made (cf [s28(2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s28.html)
The fact that the estate has been distributed to a party does not preclude a designating order [(s24).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s24.html)
Indeed, the order may designate any property held by or on behalf of the party, whether or not that property is the property distributed (ibid).
The findings in the respondent's favour, summarised in the numbered paragraphs set out at pp9-10 above, justify provision being made in the respondent's favour out of the estate. Her claims are heightened by the worsening of her financial position since trial. The real question is the size of an appropriate legacy. In Eggler versus Mitchellmore (CA unreported 11
November 1992) Sheller JA adopted the remarks of Cleland J in Re Harris <case>; [(1936) SASR 497] at 501: 
Proper maintenance is (if circumstances permit) something more than a provision to keep the wolf from the door - it should at least be sufficient to keep the wolf from pattering around the house or lurking in some outhouse in the backyard - it should be sufficient to free the mind from any reasonable fear of any insufficiency as age increases and health and strength gradually fail.

We would order that a legacy of $90,000 be paid with interest at the rate prescribed for legacies from time to time, to date from 17 January 1997, one month after the date of the orders appealed from.

Because the Court is not confined in the present case to designating property distributed from the estate (see [s24)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fpa1982209/s24.html), and because there is some uncertainty about the precise form in which the appellant holds the items of notional estate derived in consequence of the deceased's death, we propose designating an asset of the appellant which she undoubtedly still owns. In case there is any difficulty, we would reserve liberty to apply.

The costs order at trial should stand. There should be no order as to the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal. Each has succeeded, but only in part.

We make the following orders:
Appeal and cross appeals allowed.
Set aside order 1 made by Cowdroy AJ.
In lieu thereof make orders that: the respondent receive a legacy of $90,000.
 the legacy is to bear interest as and from 17 January 1997 at the rates applicable to unpaid legacies from time to time.
 designate as notional estate of the deceased the appellant's interest in the property at 93 Cammeray Road, Cammeray such interest to bear the burden of the said legacy and of the costs order in favour of the respondent at trial (if necessary).
 the appellant has liberty to apply in relation to the designating order, and the respondent has liberty to apply for further orders designating notional estate if necessary.
Costs order at trial is to stand.
Each party to bear own costs of appeal and cross appeal.
