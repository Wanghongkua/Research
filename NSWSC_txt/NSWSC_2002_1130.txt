IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
EQUITY LIST  
CAMPBELL J  DECEMBER 2002  /00 DESMOND MORTON HORE versus ALBURY RADIO TAXIS CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY LIMITED  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: Mr Hore is, now, the only plaintiff in this proceeding. He seeks an order that the proceeding be transferred to the Federal Court of
Australia (Victorian District Registry) pursuant to [sections (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s5.html) and/or 6 of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) . In the alternative, he seeks an order that this proceeding be stayed until the determination of proceeding number V410 of 2002 in the Federal Court of Australia (Victorian District Registry).  This proceeding is one which was commenced on 26 June 2000. On 4 July 2000 the same plaintiff began proceeding number V410 of 2002 in the Victoria
Registry of the Federal Court of Australia. All the defendants in the present proceeding are also named as respondents in the Victorian proceeding, though the Victorian proceeding has one additional respondent.  
The Allegations in the New South Wales Proceeding  The New South Wales proceeding originally had two plaintiffs. However, the second plaintiff died after the proceedings were begun, and his executors, by consent, discontinued their involvement in the proceeding.  The plaintiff alleges, in his statement of claim, that he operated a taxi business in Albury, and was a member of the first defendant. The other defendants are alleged to be members of the board of the first defendant, or members of the first defendant. The plaintiff complains about conduct which occurred over a period from June 1999 to February 2000. The plaintiff alleges that he agreed to sell his taxi licence, his taxi vehicle, and the shares he held in the first defendant, to Mr Mitchell (who was originally the second plaintiff). The first defendant is alleged to have first deferred making a decision about registration of the transfer of shares, and then refused to approve the transfer. The plaintiff alleges that:  the refusal to approve the transfer was outside the powers of the first defendant;  the refusal to register was a decision made for improper, collateral or ulterior purposes or motives, connected with keeping Mr Mitchell out of the taxi industry in Albury;  the refusal to approve the transfer amounts to oppression, contrary to section 96(c) and 99(b) of the [Co-Operatives Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1992157/)  a particular rule of the first defendant, which says that the first defendant is entitled to refuse to register a transfer to a person of whom the first defendant does not approve, is void either at common law or under the [Restraints of Trade Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/) , or that the refusal to register the transfer was otherwise an unlawful restraint of trade;  the first defendant provided various services to its members, that various of the defendants were in competition with each other, and that their acting together to refuse to approve the transfer of the shares involved a contravention of section 45(2)(a)(i) and/or section 45(2)(b)(i) of the
Competition Code;  the first defendant had a substantial degree of power in the market of providing booking services, and certain other services, to the owners of taxi cab licences in Albury, that its refusal to consent to the transfer of the shares was taking advantage of that degree of power contrary to section 46 of the Competition Code; and  the natural person defendants aided, abetted, counselled and procured the contraventions of the Competition Code, and were otherwise knowingly concerned in or party to those contraventions.  
The Allegations in the Federal Court  The proceeding in the Victorian District Registry of the Federal Court make exactly the same allegations, but also make some additional ones. As well, the
Federal Court proceeding alleges that:  the conduct, which the New South Wales proceedings allege amounted to a contravention of section 45 of the Competition Code, also amounts to a contravention of section 45 of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth);  the conduct, which the New South Wales proceedings allege to amount to a contravention of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s46.html) of the
Competition Code, also amounts to a contravention of section 46 of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth);  the conduct amounts to a breach of contract;  the conduct involves the tort of interference with contractual relations;  liability attaches by reason of section 75B of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth);  liability attaches by reason of section 1094 of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth);  the conduct amounts to unconscionable conduct within the meaning of section 51AA, section 51AB, and section 51AC of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth), and  there has been a contravention of section 51AD of the [Trade Practices
Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) .  While the Federal Court proceeding plead many causes of action, those causes of action all arise from the circumstances in which the first defendant came to refuse to transfer the plaintiff's shares to Mr Mitchell. Counsel for the defendants accepts, it seems to me correctly, that if the present proceeding were to be transferred to the Victorian Registry of the Federal Court of
Australia, all the causes of action pleaded in the present proceeding would be within either jurisdiction expressly granted by the Federal Parliament to the
Federal Court, or within the accrued jurisdiction of that Court.  
Relevant Provisions of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/)   The [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) contains the following relevant provisions:  (1) In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires:  special federal matter has the same meaning as in the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) of the Commonwealth.  (1) Where:  a proceeding (in this subsection referred to as the "relevant proceeding") is pending in the Supreme Court; and  it appears to the Supreme Court that--  (Repealed)  having regard to--  whether, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, apart from any law of the
Commonwealth or another State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction and apart from any accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court or the Family Court, the relevant proceeding or a substantial part of the relevant proceeding would have been incapable of being instituted in the Supreme Court and capable of being instituted in the Federal Court or the Family Court;  the extent to which, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the matters for determination in the relevant proceeding are matters arising under or involving questions as to the application, interpretation or validity of a law of the Commonwealth and not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court apart from this Act and any law of the Commonwealth or another State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction; and  the interests of justice,  it is more appropriate that the relevant proceeding be determined by the
Federal Court or the Family Court, as the case may be,  (Repealed)  the Supreme Court shall transfer the relevant proceeding to the Federal Court or the Family Court, as the case may be.  .(1) If:  a matter for determination in a proceeding that is pending in the Supreme
Court is a special federal matter; and  the court does not make an order under subsection (3) in respect of the matter,  the court must transfer the proceeding in accordance with this section to the
Federal Court or a court mentioned in subsection (2)(b).  
However, the court must only transfer so much of the proceeding as is, in the opinion of the court, within the jurisdiction (including the accrued jurisdiction) of the Federal Court, or the court mentioned in subsection (b), as the case may be.  
If the court orders that a proceeding or part of a proceeding be transferred, the proceeding or part of the proceeding must be transferred:  if the matter for determination in the proceeding is a matter mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of special federal matter in section 3(1) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) of the Commonwealth -- to the Federal Court; or ..."  [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s6.html) permits the New South Wales court to retain a "special federal matter" if there are special reasons for doing so, and after notice has been given to the
Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of the State.
Neither party submits that this is a case where, if [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s6.html) were applicable, there would be special reasons for retaining the matter in this Court. As well, no notice to the Attorneys-General has been given. Hence, it is not necessary for me to consider [section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s6.html) any further.  
Does the New South Wales Proceeding Involve a "Special Federal Matter"?  The first question which arises is whether the New South Wales proceeding involves a "special federal matter" so that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s6.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) is attracted, by reason of the New South Wales proceeding including allegations of breach of sections 45 and 46 of the Competition Code.
Consideration of this question will involve tracing some of the history of the introduction of the Competition Code, and of both the Federal and the
State cross-vesting legislation.  When the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) was first introduced, it had the same definition of "special federal matter" as it now contains. It also contained a [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s6.html) which, while it differed in wording from the present [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/s6.html), still required the transfer of "special federal matters" to the Federal
Court unless there were special circumstances justifying a different course.  The [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) of the Commonwealth, when originally enacted, contained a definition of "special federal matter" as follows:  "(a) a matter arising under [Part
IV](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/index.html#p4) (other than section 45D or 45E) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/);  a matter involving the determination of questions of law on appeal from a decision of, or of questions of law referred or stated by, a tribunal or other body established by an Act or a person holding office under an Act, not being a matter for determination in an appeal or a reference or case stated to the
Supreme Court of a State or Territory under a law of the Commonwealth that specifically provides for such an appeal, reference or case stated to such a court;  a matter arising under the [Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review)
Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/adra1977396/);  a matter arising under section 32 of the [National Crime Authority Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ncaa1984270/); or  a matter that is within the original jurisdiction of the Federal Court by virtue of section 39B of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), being a matter in respect of which the Supreme Court of a State or Territory would not, apart from this Act, have jurisdiction."  The [Competition Policy Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/) introduced a new [part
XIA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/index.html#p11a) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth).
The [Competition Policy Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/) was explained by Senator Crowley, when making the second reading speech in the Senate on 29 March 1995, as being "the central element of a new national competition policy". Senator Crowley explained that:  "... the origins of the Bill may be traced to 1991 when the Commonwealth and the States and Territories agreed to examine a national approach to competition policy. In 1992, the Government commissioned the National
Competition Policy Review, chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer. The Hilmer Report was completed in August 1993. Since then the Government has been engaged in extensive consultations with State and Territory Governments on implementation of the Report ...  
The vision of the Hilmer Report was for a national competition policy in which the Commonwealth, States and Territories co-operated to ensure that universal and uniformly applied rules of market conduct apply to all market participants regardless of their form of ownership."  Later in the second reading speech Senator Crowley referred specifically to the Competition Code saying:  "Part IV of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) prohibits various forms of anti-competitive conduct, such as contracts which substantially lessen competition, misuse or market power and mergers and acquisitions which substantially lessen competition. One of the main features of the Bill is that it extends the operation of these competitive conduct rules to currently exempt businesses, and facilitates their further extension by State and Territory legislation.  
Limitations on the Commonwealth's constitutional power have meant that unincorporated business operated solely in intra-State trade are currently not covered by the competitive conduct rules in the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/). This sector of the economy includes major businesses, such as those operated by some legal firms. This Bill is part of a co-operative legislative scheme, involving the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, which will apply the competitive conduct rules to these businesses. To achieve coverage of these businesses, the Bill creates a form of text to be known as "the
Competition Code". The Competition Code contains the rules set out in Part IV of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), modified to refer to "persons" rather than "corporations". The text of the Competition
Code is to be made operative by State and Territory laws which will apply the
Code within each jurisdiction. It is envisaged that the State and Territory legislation will commence within 12 months of the commencement of this Bill.  
In order to ensure that there are no gaps in coverage, there will be overlap between Part IV and the Competition Code. Most businesses will be subject to both. However, it will not be possible to award penalties under both Part IV and the Competition Code in respect of the same conduct. There will only be one enforcement agency, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and all enforcement action will be brought in the Federal Court. The draft intergovernmental Conduct Code Agreement indicates a commitment to maintain consistency between the prohibitions in Part IV and the prohibitions in the
Competition Code."  The new Part XIA of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), while it defined what counted as the text of the Competition Code, did not itself purport to require compliance by anyone with the text of that Competition
Code. Clearly, Federal Parliament envisaged that it would be legislation of the States and Territories which would require compliance with the Competition
Code, by the individual States and Territories enacting an "application law" which applied the Competition Code, either with or without modifications, as a law of that jurisdiction. However, consistently with Senator Crowley's announced intention that all enforcement action concerning the Competition
Code would be brought in the Federal Court, a new section 150D of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) provided:  "The Federal Court may exercise jurisdiction (whether original or appellate) conferred on that Court by an application law with respect to matters arising under the Competition Code."  With a view to making it quite clear that the States and Territories were authorised by a law of the Commonwealth to confer jurisdiction on the Federal
Court in this way, Schedule 2 of the [Competition Policy Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/) (Cth) added a new [section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/s3.html) to the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) (Cth) reading:  "Jurisdiction conferred on the Federal Court by an application law (as defined in section 150A of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/)) is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as if that jurisdiction were Federal jurisdiction."  As well, Schedule 2 of the [Competition Policy Reform Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/) (made applicable by [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cpra1995292/s32.html) of that Act) amended the definition of "special federal matter" in the
Commonwealth's [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) by inserting a new paragraph, as follows:  "(aa) A matter arising under the Competition Code (as defined in section 150A of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/))."  To give effect to the Competition Code, the New South Wales
Parliament passed the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995. Section of that Act applied the Competition Code text, as in force for the time being, as a law of New South Wales. Section 6 made provision for future alterations, made by Commonwealth law, to the text of the Competition
Code to apply in New South Wales only after a lag of two months (unless a proclamation appointed an earlier date), and not at all if a proclamation excluded that amendment from operation in the State.  Part 5 of that New South Wales Act (which ran from section 18 to section 33 inclusive) included the following:  "18 Object  
The object of this Part is to help ensure that the Competition Codes of the participating jurisdictions are administered on a uniform basis, in the same way as if those Codes constituted a single law of the Commonwealth.  
Division 3  Jurisdiction of Federal Court  
Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia with respect to all civil and criminal matters arising under the Competition Code of this jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction of courts of this jurisdiction  
Subject to section 23, the courts of this jurisdiction do not have jurisdiction with respect to the matters referred to in section 21.  Exercise of jurisdiction under cross-vesting provisions  
This Part does not affect the operation of any law of this jurisdiction relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction."  These sections were all consistent with the policy, which both Federal and
State legislatures shared, that enforcement of the Competition Code would occur only in the Federal Court.  That policy was shown to be unworkable when the High Court delivered its decision, on 17 June 1999, in Re Wakim; ex parte McNally <case>; [(1999) 198 CLR 511.] That decision held, amongst other things, that a State legislature could not confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court.  In response to Wakim, the New South Wales Parliament passed the [Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/). That
Act retrospectively validated decisions of Federal Courts given in the purported exercise of jurisdiction purporting to have been conferred on the
Federal Courts by a various State Acts. Relevantly for present purposes, though, section 15 amended the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 by omitting section 22. Section 17 provided:  "(1) Any provision of a relevant State law that purports to confer jurisdiction on a federal court is taken not to have that effect.  
Any provision of a law applied by a relevant State Act that excludes or limits the jurisdiction of any or all State courts is taken not to have that effect.  
This section does not operate:  so as to prevent a federal court from exercising jurisdiction (such as accrued jurisdiction) in connection with a relevant State law to the extent to which, but for subsection (1), that court could validly do so, or  so as to prevent a relevant State law from conferring jurisdiction on a federal court to the extent to which, but for subsection (1), a State Act could validly do so.  
Nothing in this section limits section 16.  
In this section, relevant State law means a relevant State Act, or a law as applied by a relevant State Act, and includes a Commonwealth administrative law."  The Explanatory Note to the [Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Bill ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/bill/fcjb1999364/) included an overview of the Bill, which referred to the decision in Wakim, and continued:  "This decision has implications not only for the cross-vesting schemes (where provision is made for the cross-vesting of jurisdiction in a wide range of cases ...), but also for certain of the applied law schemes (where laws of another jurisdiction are applied as State law, and under which State jurisdiction has been conferred on the Federal Court).  
The objects of this Bill are: ...  to enable State courts to deal with matters that arise under applied law schemes and that would otherwise have been dealt with by a federal court."  The Explanatory Note explained clause 15 as follows:  "Clause 15 repeals section 22 of the Competition Policy Reform Act . That section provides that state courts do not have jurisdiction with respect to matters arising under the Competition Code. That section is repealed because it is intended that State courts will be able to exercise that jurisdiction in the future, following the High Court's decision that
State jurisdiction cannot be conferred on federal courts.  The next year the New South Wales Parliament passed the [Federal Courts (Consequential Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/fcpa2000443/).
That Act further amended the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 by omitting the whole of Part 5 division 3 (which, by that stage, consisted of sections 21 and 23.) As the Explanatory Note to the Bill for that Act stated, the object of this legislation included "to remove from State Acts any provisions that purport to confer jurisdiction on a Federal Court."  The Federal Parliament also passed legislation aimed at ensuring that the enforcement of the Competition Code occurred in a manner consistent with what Wakim had held to be constitutionally permissible. The [Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joclaa2000461/) , Schedule 1 clause 58 cut down the scope of paragraph (aa) of the definition of "special federal matter" in the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) , so that thenceforth it read, "a matter arising under the
Competition Code (as defined in section 150A of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/)) of the
Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory".  From this history, it can be seen that when the New South Wales Parliament first enacted the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/), and adopted a definition of "special federal matter" which incorporated by reference the definition of that term in the Commonwealth's cross-vesting legislation, there was no mention in the Commonwealth's definition of that term of any matter arising under the Competition Code. Later, the
Commonwealth legislation's definition of "special federal matter" was altered to include a matter arising under the Competition Code, and when the Competition Code was made applicable in New South Wales it was by legislation which contemplated that all enforcement of that Code would occur in the Federal Court. However, following the decision in Wakim, the New
South Wales legislation adopting the Competition Code no longer contemplates that enforcement of the Competition Code will occur exclusively in the Federal Court, and neither does the definition of "special federal matter" in the Commonwealth's cross-vesting legislation include a matter arising under the Competition Code of New South Wales.  Through all these changes, the wording of the definition of "special federal matter" in the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation has remained unchanged. However, in applying that wording, there is a question of whether it should be regarded as picking up the definition in the Federal cross- vesting legislation of "special federal matter" at the time that the New
South Wales cross-vesting legislation was enacted in 1987, or whether the definition should be treated as one which has an ambulatory meaning, so that it expands, and contracts, over time, as the scope of the Federal definition of "special federal matter" expands, and contracts, over time. In my view, the latter view is the correct one. There are four strands of principle of statutory construction which lead to this view.  The first is section 68 of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) , which says:  "(1) In any Act or instrument, a reference to some other Act or instrument extends to the other Act or instrument, as in force for the time being. 
Subsection (1) applies to a reference to an Act or instrument:  whether or not the reference includes a reference to subsequent amendments of the Act or instrument, and  whether or not the reference is to a mode of citation that includes 2 calendar years. ... 
In this section:  a reference to an Act includes a reference to:  a Commonwealth Act, ..."  Section 68 of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) is similar to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s10.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth) (which in turn was introduced in 1976, replacing a somewhat similar, but narrower, provision which had been contained in [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/s10a.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth) - this history is traced by Gummow J in Austereo Ltd versus Trade Practices
Commission <case>; [(1993) 115 ALR 14], at 22-23.)  Prior to the enactment of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) there was no New South Wales legislation analogous to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), or [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s10.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/) (Cth).
In consequence, where a New South Wales statute A adopted the provisions of another statute B, statute B was adopted in the form that it took at the date of being adopted; any subsequent amendments to statute B were not incorporated by reference: Commissioner for Government Transport versus Deacon <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 535], at 546.
Section 68 of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) has the effect of reversing that mode of construction.  However, one needs to go further than [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) to conclude that "special federal matter" in the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation should be given an ambulatory meaning, because [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s5.html) [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) says, "This Act applies to an Act or instrument except insofar as the contrary intention appears in this Act or in the Act or instrument concerned." There is nothing in section 5(2) which requires that a contrary intention which appears in the Act concerned should be one which appears in express words - it could equally "appear" as a matter of necessary implication in that Act.
Hence, one needs to construe the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation to see whether there is anything in it which manifests an intention that the mode of construction which section 68 propounds, is not intended to apply. It is in carrying out that construction of the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation that the additional principles of construction come into play. (As to the need to find a contrary intention, before section 68 does not apply, see eg, Promenade Investments Pty Ltd versus State of New South Wales [(1991) 26 NSWLR 203] at 223-224.)  The second principle of construction is that contained in section 33 of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), whereby  "... a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the
Act ... (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act ...) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object."  The provisions of the Federal cross-vesting legislation and the cross- vesting legislation of the various States, taken together, have the effect of conferring on all State Supreme Courts in Australia, and on the Federal Court, all the jurisdiction which is exercisable by any State Supreme Court, or by the Federal Court. Notwithstanding that completely general conferral of jurisdiction, there are also provisions requiring, or permitting, a matter commenced in one court to be transferred to another court. The purpose or object of the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation is stated explicitly in the preamble to the Act, as follows:  "WHEREAS inconvenience and expense have occasionally been caused to litigants by jurisdictional limitations in federal, State and Territory courts, and whereas it is desirable:  to establish a system of cross-vesting of jurisdiction between those courts, without detracting from the existing jurisdiction of any court,  to structure the system in such a way as to ensure as far as practicable that proceedings concerning matters which, apart from this Act and any law of the Commonwealth or another State relating to cross-vesting of jurisdiction, would be of the Federal Court or the Family Court or the jurisdiction of a
Supreme Court of a State or Territory are instituted and determined in that court, whilst providing for the determination by one court of federal and
State matters in appropriate cases, and  if a proceeding is instituted in a court that is not the appropriate court, to provide a system under which the proceeding will be transferred to the appropriate court."  This contemplates that, apart from cross-vesting legislation, there will be some matters which are entirely within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, and that the purpose of the legislation includes ensuring that such matters will continue to be actually heard by the Federal Court even though jurisdiction to hear them is conferred on State courts. Section 86 of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) had, when originally enacted, conferred on the Federal Court jurisdiction in all matters arising under the Part of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) concerned with enforcement, which was exclusive of the jurisdiction of any other court, other than the jurisdiction of the High Court under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s75.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
The [Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/jocaa1987502/) (Cth) (an Act passed by Federal Parliament as part of the same package of legislation as the Federal cross-vesting legislation, and assented to on the same day as the Federal cross-vesting legislation) amended section 86 of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) to permit courts of the States or Territories to exercise jurisdiction with respect to a matter arising under Division 1 or 1A of [Part
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p5) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/). Given that the Federal Court is a statutory court, and has jurisdiction in such matters as Parliament confers on it [(section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s19.html) [Federal Court of Australia Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/)) it was completely predictable that the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, which the Federal Parliament wished it to exercise exclusively, might change in other ways at some time after 1987. It would not be a very workable scheme of legislation if the definition of "special federal matter" (and hence the type of matter which the State court was required, prima facie, to transfer to the Federal Court) remained frozen as at 1987.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/s4.html) of the Federal cross-vesting legislation, as originally enacted, provided:  
Where--  
The Federal Court ... has jurisdiction with respect to a civil matter, whether that jurisdiction was or is conferred before or after the commencement of this Act; and  
The Supreme Court of a State ... would not, apart from this section, have jurisdiction with respect to that matter,  then--  in the case of the Supreme Court of a State ... - that court is invested with federal jurisdiction with respect to that matter  this section does not apply to a matter arising under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 or under section 45D or 45E of the [Trade
Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/)."  Thus, section 4 of the Federal Act explicitly contemplated that jurisdiction would be conferred on State courts in all matters in which the
Federal Court then had jurisdiction, or might in the future come to have jurisdiction. It is hardly to be expected that this indiscriminate conferral of jurisdiction by the Federal legislature would have occurred if the Federal legislature was not to have power, on an ongoing basis, to be able to decide that there were some matters which were special federal matters, and hence were expected to be transferred to the Federal Court if begun in some other
Court.  Further, section 6 of the Federal cross-vesting legislation, as originally enacted, said:  "(1) Where a matter for determination in a proceeding that is pending in the
Supreme Court of a State ... is a special federal matter, that Supreme Court shall transfer the proceeding to the Federal Court unless that Supreme Court makes an order that the proceeding be determined by that Supreme Court."  Section 6 of the Federal cross-vesting legislation would be interpreted so as to pick up, from time to time, any changes which there might be in the federal legislation's definition of "special federal matter". It is hardly to be expected that the obligation on a State court arising under section 6 of the State cross-vesting legislation would be different in scope to the obligation on the State court arising under section 6 of the Federal cross- vesting legislation. Giving effect to the purpose of the State cross-vesting legislation favours, it seems to me, conferring an ambulatory meaning on the definition of "special federal matter".  The third relevant principle of construction is one whereby schemes of legislation consisting of more than one statute should be interpreted in a way which makes the overall scheme workable; "... it is proper for courts to endeavour to so construe interrelated statutes as to produce a sensible, efficient and just operation of them in preference to an inefficient, conflicting or unjust operation": Commissioner of Stamp Duties versus Permanent
Trustee Co Ltd [(1987) 9 NSWLR 717] at 722 per
Kirby P. This principle applies when legislation of two different legislatures is intended to operate together: Abdi versus Release on Licence Board [(1987) NSWLR 294.] This strand of principle is probably just a particular application, to the circumstances of a scheme of legislation consisting of more than one statute, of the more general requirement that the purpose of the legislation be given effect to.  The fourth strand of principle is that, for some statutes, the way of giving effect to Parliament's intention in enacting them is to regard those statutes as "always speaking".  Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 5th edition, paragraph 4.7, explain one reason behind this approach to statutory construction:  "A problem that is more germane to legislation than to other documents is that of changes that occur in the meaning and scope of words with the passage of time. Most documents are read within a relatively short period after they have been written. The reader can assume that the writer has used words in accordance with their current meaning. But Acts continue to operate for many years after they are passed and while it might be considered desirable for them to be amended to bring them up to date all the time, this simply cannot be done. Consequently, courts find that they are frequently asked to determine whether things or activities not known when the legislation was passed fall within the scope of the Act. The assumption which is adopted by the courts in dealing with these problems is summarised in the expression "an Act is to be deemed to be always speaking", that is to say, words in an Act are to be interpreted in accordance with their current meaning. The alternative approach that can be adopted is to hold that each word in an Act retains the meaning that it had at the time when it was enacted. This can obviously lead to considerable difficulties when circumstances occur that clearly fall within the necessary intendment of the Act but which could not have been contemplated at the time when the Act was passed."  The principle is also explained by Sir Rupert Cross, Statutory
Interpretation, 3rd edition (1995), at 51-52, in a passage quoted by Lord
Steyn in McCartan Turkington Breen (a firm) versus Times Newspapers Ltd <case>; [[2001] 2 AC 277] at 296:  "The somewhat quaint statement that a statute is 'always speaking' appears to have originated in Lord Thring's exhortations to drafters concerning the use of the word 'shall': 'An Act of Parliament should be deemed to be always speaking and therefore the present or past tense should be adopted, and "shall" should be sued as an imperative only, not as a future.' But the proposition that an Act is always speaking is often taken to mean that a statutory provision has to be considered first and foremost as a norm of the current legal system, whence it takes its force, rather than just as a product of an historically defined Parliamentary assembly. It has a legal existence independently of the historical contingencies of its promulgation, and accordingly should be interpreted in the light of its place within the system of legal norms currently in force. Such an approach takes account of the viewpoint of the ordinary legal interpreter of today, who expects to apply ordinary current meanings to legal texts, rather than to embark on research into linguistic, cultural and political history, unless he is specifically put on notice that the latter approach is required."  Examples of the application of this principle of statutory construction are given in the Appendix to this judgment. However, some caution must be applied in the exercise of this principle. There is still a question of construction which needs to be decided, about whether a particular expression ought to be construed, in the context of the particular legislation in which it occurs, as actually extending to some new state of affairs to which it might arguably extend. Thus, an exemption from stamp duty of a hiring arrangement relating to "a motion picture film" did not extend to exempt from stamp duty a hiring arrangement relating to a video cassette: Wilson versus Commissioner of Stamp
Duties [(1988) 13 NSWLR 77.]  The "always speaking" approach to statutory construction is one which is consonant with the express provisions of section 68 of the [Interpretation
Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/).
Indeed, [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) can be seen as a particular application of that principle, to the circumstance where one Act incorporates a reference to another Act.  There is no express provision in the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation which leads to the conclusion that section 68 of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) ought not apply to the definition of "special federal matter" in that legislation.
Nor is there anything in the overall structure or purpose of the New South
Wales cross-vesting legislation which leads to a conclusion that there is an intention implicit in the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation, that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) should not apply to the definition of "special federal matter". Indeed, the principles of construction to which I have referred all support the conclusion that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) ought apply to the definition of "special federal matter" in the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation.  I conclude that the fact that the Supreme Court proceeding makes a claim under the Competition Code does not result in it being a special federal matter. Nor is there any other claim made in the Supreme Court proceeding which amounts to a special federal matter. It follows that section 6 of the
New South Wales cross-vesting legislation does not require that the proceeding be transferred to the Federal Court inVictoria.  
Discretionary Transfer Under Section 5  The defendants oppose any discretionary transfer of this proceeding under section 5 of the New South Wales cross-vesting Act. They have instructed
Sydney solicitors to act for them in this proceeding. Those solicitors have been involved in the matter since July 2000, and have obtained advice from
Sydney counsel. The defendants have incurred approximately $25,000 of legal fees to their Sydney solicitors and counsel. It was only after the New South
Wales proceeding had been on foot for of the order of two years that the plaintiff commenced the Federal Court proceeding. The defendants submit that if the proceeding were to be transferred to the Federal Court in Victoria, or stayed so that the Federal Court proceeding became the active proceeding, it would be necessary to duplicate much of the work which has already been done.
The defendants say that if this proceeding was to be transferred it would then become more efficient for them to instruct Melbourne solicitors and counsel, rather than to continue to instruct Sydney solicitors and counsel. The plaintiff, for his part, submits that the defendants are exaggerating the extent to which preparation will be wasted if the proceedings are transferred to the Federal Court. The plaintiff's counsel did not attempt to put on evidence, or cross-examine, to lay an evidentiary foundation for that submission.  Section 5(1)(b)(ii) of the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation (quoted in paragraph 7 above) requires this Court to have regard to the three matters, listed in sub-paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) in deciding whether it is more appropriate that these proceedings be determined by the Federal Court. A statutory requirement to "have regard to" certain matters requires those matters to be given weight as a fundamental element in decision-making: R v
Hunt; ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd <case>; [(1979) 180 CLR 322] at 329 per Mason J; Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd versus Yelnah
Pty Ltd [(1986) 5 NSWLR 254], at 260;
R versus Toohey; ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd <case>; [(1982) 158 CLR 327] at 333; Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd versus Minister for Transport and Communications [(1989) 86 ALR 119] at 145;
Queensland Medical Laboratory versus Blewett <case>; [(1988) 84 ALR 615] at 623).  There is also authority, though, that a statutory direction to "have regard to" certain matters in reaching a decision does not always and necessarily, require that those matters be the basis of the decision - R v
Police Board; ex parte Madden [[1983] 1 WLR 447], at 471 - or the only matters which are taken into account - see cases collected by Handley
JA in Wallace versus Stanford [(1995) 37 NSWLR 1], at 19-20, but cf Evans versus Marmont <case>; [(1997) 42 NSWLR 70] at 79-80, 85, 95-96, 97-98. In the present case all of the matters it has been submitted I should take into account fall under the heading "the interests of justice", so it is not necessary to decide whether it is possible to take into account matters beyond those enumerated in sub- paragraphs (A), (B) and (C) in making a decision for the purpose of section (1)(b)(ii).  In applying section 5(1)(b)(ii), the "relevant proceeding" is this
Supreme Court proceeding.  Considering first sub-paragraph (A), there is nothing alleged in the
Supreme Court proceeding which (apart from any cross-vesting legislation, and apart from any accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court) would have been incapable of being instituted in the Supreme Court and capable of being instituted in the Federal Court. In particular, for the reasons which I have earlier given, the allegations of breach of sections of the Competition
Code are within the jurisdiction of this Court. Thus, no reason for transferring the proceeding arises under sub-paragraph (A).  Considering sub-paragraph (B), it might possibly be the case that the
Supreme Court proceeding is one which involves questions as to the application or interpretation of a law of the Commonwealth. This element of sub-paragraph might be satisfied because of the fact that the Competition Policy
Reform Act 1995 adopts the text of the Competition Code, which is itself part of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) of the
Commonwealth. However, regardless of whether that is right, the element of sub-paragraph (B) which requires that matter to be not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court apart from the New South Wales cross-vesting Act, and any other cross-vesting Act, is not satisfied, as matters arising under the
Competition Code have, since the enactment of the [Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/), been within the jurisdiction of this Court. No reason to transfer the proceeding arises under paragraph (B).  I now turn to paragraph (C) in [section (1)(b)(ii).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/s5.html)
It would be strongly opposed to the interests of justice for both the proceeding in this Court, and the proceeding in the Federal Court, to remain active. The Federal Court proceeding contains matters arising under [Part
IV](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fcja1999354/index.html#p4) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), and thus contain a "special federal matter". While there is nothing in the
Commonwealth's cross-vesting legislation which actually prohibits the Federal
Court from transferring, to a State court, proceedings which contain a special federal matter, there is a clear policy in the Commonwealth's cross-vesting legislation, articulated most clearly in [section (6)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s6.html), where the legislation refers, in the context of circumstances where a State court might decide to not transfer litigation which contained a special federal matter, to "the general rule that special federal matters should be heard by the Federal Court ...", which would favour the Federal Court declining to transfer the Federal Court proceeding to this Court. I say this even though, in the context of the present case, the content of the allegation which is made, in the Federal Court proceeding, of a breach of [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s45.html) and [46](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s46.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) is no different in substance to the content of the allegations which are made, in both the Federal Court proceeding, and in the proceeding in this Court, of a breach of [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s45.html) and [46](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s46.html) of the Competition Code. It is likely that the Federal Court would decline to transfer the Federal Court proceeding to this Court, if asked. Further, when the Federal Court proceeding contains a more extensive range of allegations than does the Supreme Court proceeding, and is brought against an additional respondent, it seems unlikely that the Federal Court would stay the
Federal Court proceeding with a view to ensuring that the Supreme Court proceeding was the only active one.  There seem to be no considerations dependent upon the location of parties and witnesses which favour Sydney rather than Melbourne as a forum, or vice versa. All the defendants who are natural persons live in the Albury area, so there would be no substantial difference in the convenience, for them, of a trial being in Sydney rather than Melbourne, or vice versa. Neither party put on evidence going to the convenience of any witnesses who were not parties.  Apart from the matter of the defendants possibly having been put to unnecessary expense through the plaintiff having started proceedings in this
Court, and then decided he preferred to litigate in the Federal Court in
Victoria, the interests of justice seem to me to favour the transfer of this proceeding to the Federal Court.  The position concerning the possibility of there being wasted expense for the defendants, as a result of the transfer occurring, is not enough, in my view, to lead to a different result. If the proceeding is transferred to the
Federal Court, the Federal Court will have full power to deal with the costs of the transferred proceeding. Section 12 of the New South Wales cross-vesting legislation says:  "Where a proceeding is transferred or removed to a court, that court may make an order as to costs that relate to the conduct of the proceeding before the transfer or removal if those costs have not already been dealt with by another court."  Thus, if there are costs thrown away in consequence of the transfer, it will be open to the Federal Court, if it thinks appropriate, to make a special order requiring the plaintiff to pay those costs thrown away. It would, of course, be entirely a matter for the Federal Court as to whether such an order should be made, and it might possibly depend on factors like whether, as the proceeding in fact turned out, there was any significant wastage of costs as a consequence of the transfer. When the position of the defendants concerning costs can be protected in this fashion, and other factors relevant to whether the proceeding should be transferred either favour a transfer or are neutral,
I am of the view that it is more appropriate that the present proceeding be determined by the Federal Court.  The need for the present application was brought about essentially because the plaintiff changed his mind about where he wanted to litigate, and with respect to what causes of action. In these circumstances it is appropriate for the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs of the motion seeking transfer of the proceeding.  
Orders  I order: 
These proceedings be transferred to the Federal Court, Victoria Registry. 
Plaintiff to pay costs of the defendants of the Notice of Motion seeking transfer.  
Appendix of Cases Giving Examples of "Always Speaking" Construction 
Section 1(2) of the Copyright Act 1912 defined "copyright" as including the sole right to perform a work in public, and to authorise such performance. Section 35 defined "performance" as meaning any acoustic representation made by means of any mechanical instrument. Section 2(1) provided that an infringement was deemed to take place where a person does anything the sole right to do which is conferred by that Act on the owner of the copyright. A radio station was held to have breached the copyright in musical works by broadcasting them. This conclusion was reached even on the assumption that in 1912 broadcasting was unknown. Cussen J said, at 361:  "... it was not disputed that if things not known at the time of the coming into operation of an Act fall on a fair construction within its words, they should be held to be included. The things such as motor cars, now held to be included in the word "vehicle", afford a good illustration. And so here the general expressions such as "does anything", "performance", "acoustic representation", are sufficiently wide in their natural meaning to apply to the present case."  
Cussen J, at 361-362 quoted with approval from a decision of the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals in Remick & Co versus The American Automobile
Accessories Company, a passage which included:  "While the fact that the radio was not developed at the time the Copyright Act was enacted in 1909 may raise some questions as to whether it properly comes within the purview of the Statute, it is not by that fact excluded from the
Statute. In other words, the Statute may be applied to a situation not anticipated by Congress; if, fairly construed, such situation comes clearly within the intent and meaning of the Statute ... . A performance, in our judgment, is no less public because the listeners are unable to communicate with one another and are not assembled within an enclosure or gathered together in some open stadium or park or other public place. Nor can a performance, in our judgment, be deemed private because each listener may be alone in the privacy of his home. Radio broadcasting is intended and in fact does reach a very much larger number of the public at a moment of the rendition than any other medium of performance. The artist is constantly addressing a great and widely scattered audience, and is therefore participating in a public performance": Chappell & Co Ltd versus Associated
Radio Co of Australia Ltd <case>; [[1925] VLR 350] 
In 1958 section 418(1)(b) of the Local Government Act 1919 conferred on local councils powers relating to the supply of gas and the supply and installation of gas fittings and appliances. By a proclamation made in 1958 there was delegated to the Aberdare County Council, "all powers and duties under sections 416 to 419 of the Act relating to the supply of gas and the supply and installation of gas fittings and appliances." In 1961 local councils were given an additional power by section 418(1)(l) Local
Government Act, relating to the supply of liquefied petroleum gas and the supply and installation of pipes, fittings apparatus and appliances used for or designed for use in the conveyance or consumption of such gas. A county council levied a rate for the purpose of supplying liquid petroleum gases and pipes, fittings, apparatus and appliances connected with liquid petroleum gas.
Barwick CJ (with whom Menzies J agreed, and Windeyer J agreed with some reservations) referred, at 331, to an argument that "gas" in the 1958 proclamation, was confined to coal gas. Three predecessors of the Local
Government Act, which referred to powers concerning gas, were so confined.
Barwick CJ continued:  "It may be granted that "gas" in these statutes denoted coal gas. In the earlier of three Acts that clearly appears from the various provisions of the
Acts themselves, and no doubt in 1906, gas denoted coal gas, because no other form of gas for lighting and heating was in common use. Nonetheless the connotation of the word "gas" may not be so described. The Act here speaks of "gas", not of coal gas. In my opinion, it thus selects the genus, and not any particular species of gas.  
I can see no reason why, whilst the connotation of the word "gas" will be fixed, its denotation cannot change with changing technologies. Indeed, in my opinion, it would be odd that in granting trading powers, including the power to supply gas for heating and lighting, the Act should intentionally close the door on access by the local government bodies to developing methods of trading in gas for heating and lighting.  
But in my opinion the question need not be resolved on any such general considerations. It is to my mind plain that the word "gas" in the paragraph in section 418 cannot be limited in its denotation to coal gas ...  
In my opinion, throughout the reference in section 418(1)(b) and the proviso is to the genus gas which will apply to them as new species of gas are made available. That meaning is not to be altered, in my opinion, by the addition of par (l) which, it seems to me, was simply inserted for more abundant caution": The Council of the Shire of Lake Macquarie versus Aberdare County
Council <case>; [(1969) 123 CLR 327] 
A tax deduction was available for certain expenditure made by a taxpayer in connection with the carrying on of "mining operations". ICI claimed a tax deduction for expenditure involved in drilling into particularly concentrated subterranean pockets of brine, bringing it to the surface and, through evaporation, producing salt. The Commissioner submitted that this technique was comparatively new, and hence not within the meaning intended by parliament. Walsh J, at 43, said:  "I think it would be a mistake to say that the question is as to the meaning which the relevant provisions of the Act had at the time when they were enacted and that therefore no regard can be had to anything that occurred afterwards. When the Act was passed there were no works in Australia of the kind which ICI subsequently established. It was not until such works were established that any question could arise as to whether they were or were not works to which the general expression "mining operations" used in the Act applied. When it was raised in this case, the question was whether the expenditure then recently incurred by ICI was incurred in connection with the carrying on of mining operations. In my opinion it must be legitimate to ask whether in the sense in which the words were then used or understood, they applied to the operations of ICI": Imperial Chemical Industries of
Australia & New Zealand Limited versus Commissioner of Taxation of the
Commonwealth <case>; [(1971) 46 ALJR 35. (An] appeal to the Full Court, The Commissioner of
Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia versus ICI Australia Limited <case>; [(1972) 127 CLR 529] did not consider this point.) 
The Abortion Act 1967 of England made provision for there to be no offence committed under the law relating to abortion when a pregnancy was terminated in certain circumstances, one of which was that the "pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner". At the time of enactment of the legislation, the only methods used to produce abortions were surgical methods, all significant steps in which were carried out by medical practitioners. After the enactment of the legislation a method of abortion became available which involved a medical practitioner inserting a catheter into the womb of the pregnant woman, and a cannula into one of her veins.
Thereafter, prostaglandin was gradually administered through the catheter, and oxytocin through the cannula. It was the administration of these chemicals which was the effective cause of the foetus ultimately being expelled. The administration of these chemicals was carried out by nursing staff, though in accordance with directions from a medical practitioner. The House of Lords held, by a 3:2 majority, that this new method of achieving abortions amounted to a pregnancy being "terminated by a registered medical practitioner". Lord
Wilberforce, one of the dissentients, stated the principle as follows, at 822:  "In interpreting an Act of Parliament it is proper, and indeed necessary, to have regard to the state of affairs existing, and known by Parliament to be existing, at the time. It is a fair presumption that Parliament's policy or intention is directed to that state of affairs. Leaving aside cases of omission by inadvertence, this being not such a case, when a new state of affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on policy, comes into existence, the courts have to consider whether they fall within the Parliamentary intention.
They may be held to do so, if they fall within the same genus of facts as those to which the expressed policy has been formulated. They may also be held to do so if there can be detected a clear purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled if the extension is made. How liberally these principles may be applied must depend upon the nature of the enactment, and the strictness or otherwise of the words in which it is expressed. The courts should be less willing to extend expressed meanings if it is clear that the Act in question was designed to be restrictive or circumscribed in its operation rather than liberal or permissive. They will be much less willing to do so where the subject matter is different in kind or dimension from that for which the legislation was passed. In any event there is one course which the courts cannot take, under the law of this country; they cannot fill gaps; they cannot by asking the question "What would Parliament have done in this current case - not being one in contemplation - if the facts had been before it?" attempt themselves to supply the answer, if the answer is not to be found in the terms of the Act itself":  
Law Lords in the majority in the House of Lords regarded the new procedure as coming within the legislative words by reason of the legislation contemplating that termination of pregnancies would take place in hospitals, where treatment by teams of doctors, nurses and other professionals was routine (828), and the pregnancy would be "terminated by a registered medical practitioner" if a medical practitioner accepted responsibility for all stages of the treatment, himself carried out all parts of the procedure which in accordance with accepted medical practice were done only by qualified medical practitioners, gave specific instructions for carrying out those parts of the procedure ordinarily carried out by other members of the team, and was available to be consulted or called on from beginning to end of the treatment (828, 835) 
A statute of 1861 forbade the bringing about of "grievous bodily harm", in certain circumstances. In R versus Ireland <case>; [[1998] AC ] one of the questions for decision was whether psychiatric injury counted as "grievous bodily harm". Lord Steyn said, at 158:  "... although out of considerations of piety we frequently refer to the actual intention of the draftsman, the correct approach is simply to consider whether the words of the Act of 1861 considered in the light of contemporary knowledge cover a recognisable psychiatric injury. It is undoubtedly true that there are statutes where the correct approach is to construe the legislation "as if one were interpreting it the day after it was passed:" "The Longford [(1889) PD 34.](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281889%29%2014%20PD%2034 "View LawCiteRecord" ) Thus in The Longford the word "action" in a statute was held not to be apt to cover an Admiralty action in rem since when it was passed the
Admiralty Court "was not one of His Majesty's Courts of Law:" see pp 37, 38.
Bearing in mind that statutes are usually intended to operate for many years it would be most inconvenient if courts could never rely in difficult cases on the current meaning of statutes. Recognising the problem Lord Thring, the great Victorian draftsman of the second half of the second century, exhorted draftsmen to draft so that "An Act of Parliament should be deemed to be always speaking:" Practical Legislation (1902) p 83; see also Cross,
Statutory Interpretation, 3rd ed (1995) p 51; Pearce and Geddes, Statutory
Interpretation in Australia, 4th ed (1996), pp 90-93. In cases where the problem arises it is a matter of interpretation whether a court must search for the historical or original meaning of a statute or whether it is free to apply the current meaning of the statute to present day conditions. Statutes dealing with a particular grievance or problem may sometimes require to be historically interpreted. But the drafting technique of Lord Thring and his successors have brought about the situation that statutes will generally be found to be of the "always speaking" variety ...  
The proposition that the Victorian legislator when enacting sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Act of 1861, would not have had in mind psychiatric illness is no doubt correct. Psychiatry was in its infancy in 1861. But the subjective intention of the draftsman is immaterial. The only relevant inquiry is as to the sense of the words in the context in which they are used. Moreover the Act of 1861 is a statute of the "always speaking" type: the statute must be interpreted in the light of the best current scientific appreciation of the link between the body and psychiatric injury." 
A defence to defamation, of being a fair and accurate report of the proceedings at any public meeting, was available in relation to reporting the contents of a press statement made available at a press conference. This was so notwithstanding that the defence could be traced back to a statute of 1881, at which time press conferences were unknown: McCartan Turkington Breen (a firm) versus Times Newspapers Ltd <case>; [[2001] 2
AC 277], at 290-292, 295-296.
