REGINA versus Barry John MORRIS /96 October 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
DAVID HUNT CJ at CL 
RESULT:Application granted 
CATCHWORDS:Criminal law and procedure - Access to sound recording of summing up in order to challenge the accuracy of the transcript approved by the trial judge.

The appellant sought an order for the production of the sound recording of the summing up at his trial. He claimed that it should be made available as of right to the parties upon request. In the alternative, he asserted that the transcript provided as approved by the trial judge omitted a direction which had been reported in the media and which those present recalled hearing.

Held The sound recording of a summing up is not available as of right to the parties upon request. A party seeking access to the recording must demonstrate an appropriate need for its production, as must any party who seeks to challenge a transcript which has been approved by the trial judge. An order will probably be made for the production of the sound recording of a summing up more readily than a shorthand note, because of the fallibility of the latter.

The statutory framework and practice in relation to challenging the accuracy of trial transcripts discussed.

JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
The appellant (Barry John Morris) was found guilty by a District Court jury of making statements which he knew to be false and which were likely to cause the person to whom each was made fear for that person's safety[1] and, without lawful excuse, of making a threat to damage property with the intention of causing the person to whom it was made to fear that the threat would be carried out.[2] Judge Shadbolt imposed an effective total sentence of three years and four months, consisting of a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of ten months.

A Notice of Appeal against conviction was filed on 6 June (that is, prior to sentencing) in which the grounds of appeal complain (in very general terms) of inadequate directions as to the nature of the defence case and as to circumstantial evidence and of the admission into evidence of "voice identification post dating 12 April 1994". A further Notice of Appeal was filed on 9 July (that is, after sentencing) in which the only ground of appeal nominated was directed to the length of the sentence imposed. Amended grounds of appeal were filed on 13 September, which omit the complaints concerning the admission of voice identification evidence and the directions as to circumstantial evidence, but which add grounds directed to the validity of the count based on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s199.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) and complaining (again in very general terms) of the directions given as to the intention which had to be found (presumably in relation to the same count).

Following the supply of the transcript of the evidence and the summing up, a request was made by the appellant to the Reporting Services Branch of the
Attorney General's Department for the sound recording made of the summing up.
No appropriate need for its production was demonstrated in the request. A further request was made, this time nominating the apparent inaccuracy of the transcript provided, in that it was alleged to have omitted a direction which had been reported in the media and which (it was said) counsel and the instructing solicitor as well as some members of the public recalled hearing.
This request was relayed to the judge, who declined permission for the sound recording to be released. An application was then made to the Court of
Criminal Appeal for leave to issue a subpoena for the production of the sound recording.

The [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), by [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s12.html), permits an order to be made for the production of any document or other thing connected with the proceedings if thought to be necessary or expedient in the interests of justice,[3] and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s22.html) permits that power to be exercised by any judge of the Court of Criminal
Appeal sitting alone. The application was heard by me as such a judge. Before turning to the particular application, it is necessary to refer briefly to the statutory framework and the practice which has existed in relation to challenging the accuracy of trial transcripts.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s21.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) requires, if practicable, shorthand notes to be taken of the proceedings at every trial of any person on indictment and, when there has been an appeal, a transcript of those notes is to be made if the Registrar so directs and furnished to the
Registrar for the use of the trial judge and of the Court of Criminal Appeal.
Such transcript takes the place of the judge's notes of the trial.[4] A transcript is to be provided to any person interested upon payment of the prescribed charges.[5] The transcript must be certified as correct by the person making it,[6] but no copy of the summing up is to be furnished to the
Registrar until it has been submitted to the trial judge and copied in accordance with his or her revision.[7] 
The rule that the trial judge must be permitted the opportunity to revise a summing up before it is provided to the Registrar recognizes the problems peculiar to summings up (and to ex tempore judgments) which arise in relation to transcripts. There are necessary differences between taking a shorthand note of a summing up (and of an ex tempore judgment) and taking such a note of the evidence. Not only is there an obvious difference between taking short questions and answers and taking a long and continuous monologue, there is also a difference (more marked in relation to some judges than others) in the speed with which the words are delivered, and a further difference (depending upon the geography of the particular courtroom) in the physical position of the shorthand reporter and the source of the words being recorded. There is also an understandable difference in the opportunity for a shorthand reporter to make the source of the words aware that something has been missed.

The inevitable result is that in the shorthand note of a summing up (and of an ex tempore judgment) there are often words lost and words misheard. After more than seventeen years of checking transcripts of summings up and ex tempore judgments which I have delivered, and even with the most skilled of shorthand reporters taking a note of what I had said, I can certainly attest to that fact. It is a fact which is recognized alike by judges and by the highly skilled shorthand reporters themselves.[8] 
The judge is entitled to make corrections to the transcript of a summing up prepared by the shorthand reporter. (The position in relation to ex tempore judgments is somewhat different, and I will leave them to one side.) Sometimes there is a document from which the judge was reading during the summing up which makes it plain that an error has occurred, and the transcript may be corrected accordingly. Similarly, the judge may have a memory of what was in fact said, and is able to make the necessary corrections. It is sometimes obvious that a passage is a corrupt transcription of what was said; in those cases, the task of the judge is to correct it so that, so far as possible, it conveys the sense of what the judge believes was in fact said. The judge is also entitled to make minor amendments to the transcript of a summing up to remove any grammatical solecisms (such as the use of a plural noun with a singular verb), provided that the amendments do not alter the sense of what was conveyed to the jury, but the judge is not permitted to substitute something completely new for what was in fact said.

Where it is clear that, when delivering the summing up, the judge has commenced to say something but has, in effect, withdrawn what was said and started again, it is permissible to delete that part of the statement which was so withdrawn, again provided that the sense of what was conveyed to the jury is not altered, but the judge is not permitted to delete from the transcript whole passages from what was in fact said. That is not to say that deletions may not be made of immaterial statements (such as a salutation to the jury in the morning or a farewell in the afternoon) if the judge wishes to do so. Obviously enough, the judge is entitled to alter the punctuation and paragraphination so that it accords with what was intended; it is quite extraordinary how both can alter the sense of what was in fact conveyed.

The law was long ago stated that the judge's version of what was said in court is conclusive against the version put forward by anyone else. In Ex parte
Fairhall,9 no transcript had been kept and the judge's notes made no reference to a particular question having been asked and rejected, one in relation to which it was sought to have a case stated. An affidavit was filed by counsel who had appeared at the trial asserting that the question had been asked and rejected. In his report, the judge said that he had no recollection of the question. The Full Court held[10] that the report of the judge was conclusive. In Rex versus Tucker,11 there was a conflict between the transcript made by the shorthand reporter and the judge's report. The Court of Criminal
Appeal said[12] that the courts acted upon the rule that the judge's report is to be adopted as a true statement of anything which occurred at the trial,[13] although it was made clear that such rule may have to give way in cases where the purposes of justice dictate.

In Bromley versus Bromley,14 the appellant sought to have the uncorrected version of the transcript of an ex tempore judgment looked at for comparison with the transcript as approved by the judge, because it was arguable from an asserted inconsistency in the latter that the former must have been altered.
The Court of Appeal said[15] that such an application had to be supported by cogent evidence (such as a note taken by someone at the time) which demonstrated that the transcript approved by the judge was substantially different to what was actually said.[16] In Cannon Industries Ltd v
Edwards,17 it was held that affidavits as to what had been said, contradicting what had been asserted in a Stated Case, were inadmissible. In
Thompson versus Andrews,18 no shorthand note had been taken. A note taken by a solicitor, which expanded upon the Official Referee's own note, was rejected by the Court of Appeal,[19] and it was said[20] that, in the absence of agreement, the judge's note would be accepted as far as it went.

In GIO versus Fredrichberg,21 the transcript was silent as to a discussion asserted to have taken place between counsel and the judge as to a limitation which (so it was said) had been placed upon counsel for the plaintiff in the way in which his client's case could to be put to the jury. Barwick CJ said[22] that, had the Court of Appeal not already accepted it, the High Court would not have received material from the parties as to what had been said where the transcript was silent, but this view was expressed in relation to matters which counsel could have requested the judge to record in the next day's transcript if they had not been recorded at the time. That is obviously not applicable to the transcript of a summing up. The Chief Justice said that it may be otherwise if the parties agreed upon the supplemental material, but he said that, even in that case, considerable caution should be exercised before accepting that material. Owen J also said[23] that it is only in very unusual circumstances that an appellate court should have regard to material which does not appear in the transcript, but again noted that it is the duty of counsel to have rulings to which objection is taken noted in the transcript.

That case was followed by the Court of Appeal in relation to somewhat similar situations in Builders Licensing Board versus Mahoney,24 and in Vakauta v
Kelly,25 and by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina versus McGarvey.26 All of those cases were concerned with matters in relation to which counsel could have requested the judge to have a record made in the transcript. They were not concerned with transcripts made from a shorthand note of a summing up where no such opportunity exists.

It will be seen, therefore, that there is no inflexible rule (or, perhaps, that there is no longer any inflexible rule) that the parties may not in any circumstances challenge the accuracy of the transcript of a summing up made from a shorthand note and approved by the trial judge, but there remains throughout the cases the expressed need for caution before permitting such a challenge to what the trial judge says is a correct record.

The appellant does not seek to disturb the law and practice in relation to the transcript of a summing up made from a shorthand note as approved by the trial judge, but he says that there is no need for such caution before permitting a challenge to such a transcript where it is made from a sound recording, and thus that the sound recording itself should be available as of right to the parties upon request. The existing need for caution is explained, the appellant says, because of the fallibility of shorthand notes, but a sound recording is infallible. The shorthand reporter's note was said to be the "best evidence" available of what was in fact said, whereas the sound recording now is,[27] and it is admissible as evidence of what was said.[28] I do not, however, accept that the rules as to the admissibility of evidence determine what is to be regarded as the official record of the proceedings in court for the purposes of an appeal.[29] 
The sound recording of a trial has occasionally been played in the Court of
Criminal Appeal where an issue has arisen as to the tone in which the trial judge asked questions or gave directions. In Fondfield Pty Ltd versus Pham,30 the Court of Appeal heard the sound recording of part of the proceedings in the Compensation Court, apparently in order to judge the tone in which the judge intervened in the cross-examination of the applicant, where the issue was whether the judge had conducted himself in such a way as might reasonably give rise to an apprehension of bias. So far as I am aware, however, a sound recording has not previously been used in order to challenge the accuracy of the transcript of either the evidence or the summing up.

The appellant nevertheless points out that technological progress in the recording of court proceedings has not been overlooked in the cases. In
Vakauta versus Kelly, when stating that an appellate court should not permit evidence to supplement the transcript unless both parties agreed, McHugh JA said[31] that, where sound recording equipment exists, no problems should arise. In Lasaitis versus Email Ltd,32 the Court of Appeal mentioned the possibility of the sound recording of argument in the Compensation Court being produced to resolve a dispute as to whether counsel had made a particular submission, but it did not discuss the matter further. In Regina versus Ioan
Ritter,33 when stating that the report of the trial judge should be accepted as a correct account of what occurred during the addresses of counsel (which were not recorded) unless the interests of justice would warrant a different course, Gleeson CJ said that some of the older authorities on this issue, decided before the development of modern methods of recording trial proceedings, may require reconsideration in a proper case.

Those of us who have had experience of transcripts made from sound recorded trials may not feel so confident that the sound recording will resolve disputes between the parties as to what was said. The incidence of the phrase "(not transcribable)" in such transcripts is sufficiently regular as to suggest that the recordings are not always easily interpreted. And that phrase appears not only in relation to evidence where what is said by counsel and by the witness may sometimes be lost because one is overspeaking the other. I have often seen it in the transcripts of judgments which are provided in the
Bails Court of the Supreme Court, now sound recorded.[34] 
The disputes which arise during trials as to the accuracy of transcripts made of electronically recorded interviews of suspected persons (ERISP) by police are legion, and similar difficulties of interpretation frequently arise in relation to recordings made with the use of authorized listening devices.
Indeed, such are the difficulties in interpreting sound recordings that a field of expertise has now developed by which such recordings are "enhanced", although it is fair to say that the circumstances in which court proceedings are recorded are considerably superior to those in which conversations overheard with the use of listening devices are recorded.

It may well be that such technological progress in the recording of court proceedings will eventually overcome many of the reservations previously expressed by the courts as to the efficacy of transcripts made from shorthand notes. In DPP versus Alexander,35 I swept away such reservations formed over one hundred years ago when I ordered the evidence of the principal Crown witnesses in that case to be taken on commission in the United States where the evidence was to be recorded by audio-visual equipment, so that the jury would have the opportunity of seeing the demeanour of such witnesses, and of observing the way in which various questions put to them in cross-examination are answered.

But I do not accept that the sound recording of a summing up should be made available as of right to the parties upon request. The caution previously expressed by the courts was not based solely upon the fallibility of shorthand notes of what was said.[36] There is a practical limit to the number of collateral issues which should be permitted in an appeal, and to give free access to the sound recording is likely to do little more than to encourage disputes about minor matters which are immaterial to the needs of justice. It was submitted by the appellant that the availability of the tape recording as of right would ensure that judges are not tempted to alter transcripts in order to disadvantage one party or the other in an appeal. I do not accept that such a consideration warrants the availability of the tape recording as of right.

It should not be overlooked that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s12.html) of the [Criminal Appeal
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) limits the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to make an order for the production of the tape recording to the situation where its production is thought to be necessary or expedient in the interests of justice. I am satisfied that a party who seeks access to a sound recording must demonstrate an appropriate need for its production, as must any party who seeks to challenge a transcript which has been approved by the trial judge - in other words, to demonstrate that the sound recording is not required merely for a fishing expedition, in the sense that the party cannot demonstrate that fish of a particular kind are in the pool but wish to drag it for the purpose of finding out whether there are any there or not.[37] Because of the fallibility of shorthand notes, however, it is fair to say that the Court of Criminal Appeal will probably make an order for the production of the sound recording of a summing up more readily than a shorthand note.

The alternative basis of the appellant's present application is the same as that put by him to the Reporting Services Branch - that the transcript of the summing up provided as approved by the judge omitted a direction which had been reported in the media and which those present recalled hearing. The Crown neither supported nor opposed the application.

Under a heading "Morris jury told to trust their ears", the report of the summing up in the "Daily Telegraph" newspaper says this: "In summing up, Judge Kenneth Shadbolt encouraged the jury members to trust their ears on the contentious issue of voice identification because experts in the field `are notoriously open to mistake'." 
The solicitor in court instructing counsel for the appellant has sworn an affidavit that he recalled the judge directing the jury in relation to voice identification evidence that they should "trust your own ears", or words to that effect. Another affidavit records the willingness of a number of people who were present in court during the summing up to give evidence of the same recollection that such words or words to that effect were used by the judge in the context of directions relating to expert or scientific evidence. Counsel for the appellant before me - who had appeared as his junior counsel at the trial - frankly admitted that he had not heard the judge use the expression.
The "Daily Telegraph" reporter (one Alasdair McMillan) told the solicitor that he did not believe that he could assist.

It is conceded that there is no significance to the appeal in the fact that the expression "trust your own ears" were used - if they were - but it is submitted that their absence from the transcript indicates that a passage has been deleted from the transcript, so that the appellant should be entitled to see whether any other passages which are of significance have been deleted.

The precise expression quoted in the newspaper report - "notoriously open to mistake" - does appear in the transcript, at an early stage where the judge introduces the subject of voice identification. According to the transcript, the judge said this: "Identification by voice is notoriously open to mistake. We have all had personal experiences of picking up the telephone and having someone mistake us for someone else in the family. Or we have ourselves, mistaken someone at the other end for someone else in another family. It is because it is notoriously open to mistake that you must be very careful with voice identification evidence." 
There is no reference at all at that stage to expert evidence. The judge continued with the warning as to the usual dangers of voice identification evidence, and he then turned to specific deficiencies in that evidence - apparently in accordance with the analogous requirements for visual identification evidence.[38] The next part of the summing up is concerned with the ingredients of the offences which the Crown had to establish, and then the judge turned to the facts of the particular case. The evidence of the lay witnesses was summarised in these terms: "Seven witnesses, including his campaign director, his electoral officer, and his personal secretary, all people who know his voice well, say that it was definitely his voice. Eight others with perhaps less familiarity, say that it is like his voice." 
It is only then - and considerably after the references to "notoriously open to mistake" - that the judge turned to the expert or scientific evidence.
According to the transcript, the judge said this: "The Crown concedes that Mr Jones' evidence was much diminished by cross- examination, but says that Mr Moody only said that you couldn't really accept
Mr Jones' evidence, his own results were quite inconclusive, and Professor
Butcher's evidence remains unmoved and Professor Butcher agrees with, I think, a Dr Fraser, another authority, that the best test for all of this is the human ear." 
It seems to me that that last phrase "that the best test for all of this is the human ear" may well have been the source of the "Daily Telegraph" reporter's reference to "trust your own ears". That expression did not appear in quotation marks in the report, and the nature of the report - compressing as it does the general warning as to voice identification evidence with the details of the experts' evidence and ascribing it all as advice given by the judge - is such that the reporter appears to have been more concerned to state his own inferences from what was said than - as was his obligation - merely to record a fair summary of what was said.[39] The error - apart from the effect of the compression - is to ascribe to the judge a direction given by way of advice to the jurors as to how they should treat the evidence when all that he was doing was outlining for them the evidence which the experts had given.

However, this is at best surmise on my part. In the face of the evidence tendered in this application, and in the absence from the transcript provided of any reference to the expression "trust your own ears" or to any words which may confidently be said to have been the source of the report and of the recall of the witnesses, I am satisfied that the appellant is not on a fishing expedition, and that he is entitled to the order which he seeks. Accordingly,
I order the Director of the Reporting Services Branch, by his proper officer, to produce to the Registrar within seven days a true copy of the sound recording of the summing up by Judge Shadbolt in Regina versus Barry John
Morris delivered on 27 May 1996.

Postcript 
Because this was the first application of this type, and in fairness to the judge, I have had the transcript checked against the tape recording. That check reveals that the expression "trust your own ears" was in fact never used by the judge, and that the three passages from the transcript which I have quoted are an accurate record of what was said - other than that "We have" in the first passage has been substituted for what sounds like "we've", and the reference to Dr Fraser in the third passage may have been to "Miss" Fraser. I regard such alterations as well within what a judge is entitled to make.

It was conceded that the solicitor instructing at the trial and those present during the summing up had all read the "Daily Telegraph" report. That report was obviously an incompetent one. Their belief that they had heard the phrase "trust you own ears" would therefore appear to be a good example of the displacement effect well known in photo-identification, where a witness has been shown a photograph of the accused and the memory of that photograph has displaced the witness's original memory of the offender.[40] The solicitor and the others were, it would seem, clearly wrong in their recollection.
