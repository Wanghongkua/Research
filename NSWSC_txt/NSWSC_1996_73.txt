John Edwin Sommerville versus State Bank of New South Wales Ltd [1996] NSWSC 73 (18 April 1996) 
JOHN EDWIN SOMERVILLE versus STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES LTD /91 
THURSDAY 4 APRIL 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a matter where the cross-claimant seeks to enter judgment by default against the cross-defendant. The cross-defendant was served in the United States of America, but there was no provision of a form in form 13A of the Supreme Court Rules notifying him of his rights.

Furthermore, the facility agreement has not been tendered in evidence. The affidavit of default is insufficient and the pleadings do not satisfactorily plead the facility agreement or the default.

There is also a claim for damages for non payment of money, which would seem to be contrary to all authority.

The court, accordingly, is not prepared to make the order at this stage. The matter is stood over to the Registrar's list on 18 April 1996.
