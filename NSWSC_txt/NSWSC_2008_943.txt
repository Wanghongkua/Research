JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ROTHMAN J SEPTEMBER 2008 /02 Christopher George Murtough versus Adrian John Betham & Anor 
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: On 3 April 2008, the Court, as presently constituted, dismissed the plaintiff's motion to set aside default judgment of 5 February
The Court dissolved all stays on the entry and execution of the default judgment, together with the stay on the second defendant's judgment on the cross-claim.
 Directions made on 26 October 2007 had specially fixed the plaintiff's motion for hearing over two days commencing 3 April 2008. Those days were chosen to meet the convenience of the plaintiff (Mr Murtough). It is necessary to set out a selective history of the litigation and I attach to these reasons a chronology prepared on behalf of the first defendant (Mr Betham) upon which
I will expand and some aspects of which I will correct.

History of Litigation The plaintiff was a legal practitioner, formerly practising in both New
South Wales and England. He is a resident of New South Wales. On 21 February , the plaintiff issued proceedings in this Court against two defendants, one resident of the United Kingdom and one resident of New South Wales. It is alleged that the law of England and Wales is applicable to the proceedings.
 After some early skirmishes, during which Mr Murtough obtained default judgment and all parties filed amended pleadings, the second defendant (Mr
Ram) moved for summary dismissal of the proceedings. Mr Murtough, in the amended statement of claim, claims three causes of action: malicious falsehood; collateral abuse of process by the commencement of County Court proceedings in England; and a further count of collateral abuse of process by the making of a complaint about the alleged professional misconduct of Mr
Murtough to the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors of the Law Society of
England and Wales. At the hearing of that motion, Mr Ram conceded that the action on the third cause could not be the subject of summary dismissal.
 On 18 August 2004, Buddin J dismissed Mr Ram's motion for summary dismissal of the proceedings: see Christopher George Murtough versus Betham and Anor <case> On 10 September 2004, the Court ordered Mr Murtough to give discovery by serving paginated bundles of certain documents by 8 October 2004. The Court also ordered service of expert reports by 5 November 2004 and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/index.html#p33)
Particulars by 1 October 2004.
 Mr Murtough did not comply with those orders. The matter of discovery (and other incidental orders) returned to this Court on 10 September 2004, 1
October 2004, 8 October 2004, 11 October 2004, 18 October 2004, 21 October , 8 November 2004, 11 November 2004, 15 November 2004, 19 November 2004, November 2004, 2 December 2004, 4 March 2005, 23 May 2005, 27 May 2005, 29
July 2005, 24 August 2005, 26 August 2005, 5 December 2005 and 9 December
At the hearing dates on 2 December 2004, 27 May 2005 and 26 August 2005, the same or similar orders were made as were originally made on 10 September , summarised at [6] above.
 On 9 December 2005, Mr Ram was given leave to file and serve, by 9 December , a notice of motion for default judgment. The notice was filed and referred to me for hearing on 14 December 2005.
 On 14 December 2005, the then legal representative of Mr Murtough informed the Court of difficulties in obtaining instructions and proceeding with the work necessary to comply with the Court's previous directions. On the application of Mr Murtough's representative, the Court adjourned until 17
February 2006 the hearing of the motions for judgment for want of prosecution, notice of which had been given by both Mr Betham and Mr Ram on or about 8 and December 2005.
 On 14 December 2005, the Court also directed Mr Murtough to file and serve, by 30 January 2006, any affidavit or other evidence upon which he relied.
These orders were made on the application of Mr Murtough.
 On 17 February 2006, when the matter was heard, Mr Murtough's legal representative once more sought an adjournment: see Murtough versus Betham (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Rothman J, 17 February 2006, unreported).
Mr Murtough had filed no material in relation to the motions by 30 January or at all. At the hearing, Mr Murtough's representative relied on two medical opinions of which no notice had been given. The opinions referred to
Mr Murtough's cognitive impairment, his inability "to make important decisions" and his depression, and expressed the view that, at least since 1
October 1997, he had been under a "legal disability" and "was never medically fit to represent himself ... without a guardian [or] tutor": ibid, p 3.
 The Court adjourned the motion, made orally on behalf of Mr Murtough, for the appointment of a tutor and ordered the filing and service of updated medical opinions. The Court stood the matter over for argument, if any, on the issue of the tutor and the appointment, by the Court if necessary, of an appropriate expert to give evidence on the issue.
 Subsequently, the motion was adjourned on a number of occasions, each time on the application of Mr Murtough's representative. The motions were listed before me to be heard on 26 April 2006. On that date, a further adjournment was granted on strict conditions, one of which related to the tutor proposed by Mr Murtough. Material before the Court established that the proposed tutor was a client (or former client) of Mr Murtough and had his own issues relating to capacity. Significant debate occurred on this issue. The Court adjourned the proceedings for some period in order to allow compliance by Mr Murtough with the Rules and in order to allow Mr Murtough to obtain material that would demonstrate the capacity of the proposed tutor, or, alternatively, to obtain the consent of another person to act in that capacity. On 26 April 2006, the proceedings were stood over until 10 July 2006.
 On 10 July 2006, a different legal representative appeared for Mr Murtough and an application was reiterated for the appointment as tutor of the same person identified on the last occasion. The material required in support thereof had not been filed. The motion was adjourned until 14 August 2006. On that date, the defendants were permitted short service of subpoenas on the proposed tutor because the required documentation had still not been provided.
The matter was stood over, once more, until 14 September 2006, at which time there was no appearance for Mr Murtough. As the matter had been listed for mention only (in order to obtain a date for hearing), it was fixed for hearing on 10 October 2006.
 On 10 October 2006, Mr Murtough was once more represented. The proceedings were once more adjourned on the application of Mr Murtough. Liberty was given to file a notice of motion. There were further directions on 19 October 2006 and the matter was stood over to 6 November 2006. On 2 November 2006, at the request of Mr Murtough, the listing for 6 November was vacated and the matter listed for 17 November 2006.
 On 17 November 2006, Mr Murtough once more appeared for himself. He submitted, contrary to earlier evidence, that he had the capacity to conduct the proceedings himself and sought an adjournment to deal with the defendants' motions. The adjournment was granted and strict orders were issued requiring
Mr Murtough to file and serve, by 29 January 2007, a written submission dealing with his capacity and with want of prosecution and requiring, by 14
December 2006, Mr Murtough to file any further affidavit or motion seeking to "regularise" the proceedings. Mr Murtough sought and obtained extensions of time from 14 December 2006 to 21 December 2006.
 Mr Murtough filed no submission, notice of motion or affidavit as directed.
The motions were called for hearing at 10.00am on 5 February 2007 (in accordance with the directions of 17 November 2006) and there was no appearance for, or by, Mr Murtough. The Court had been hearing other matters prior thereto. The Court adjourned these proceedings after a few minutes, for a short time, and reconvened at 10.20am. At that time, by default, the court issued orders to the effect of those then sought in the defendants' motions.
 At 10.30 am, on return to Chambers, the Associate first received emails from Mr Murtough sent to her between 9.00am and 10.00am, the last of which was sent at 9.53am. Those emails purported to contain a draft affidavit, a draft submission and a note that Mr Murtough will be attending court. At 10.40am, Mr
Murtough arrived for the 10.00am hearing. The other parties were notified and the Court reconvened. The Court refused the application, made instanter, by
Mr Murtough to set aside the default judgment and gave leave to file a notice of motion with affidavit by 20 February 2007. Other directions were made and entry and execution of the default judgment was stayed.
 Notwithstanding non-compliance with the directions of 5 February 2007, the stay was continued on 26 March 2007. Self-executing orders were made by which the stay on entry and execution of judgment would lapse unless, by a certain time, Mr Murtough had complied with particular directions. The motion to set aside the default judgment was listed for hearing on 7 and 8 May 2007.
 On 7 May 2007, Mr Murtough sought and obtained a further adjournment. The matter was listed for 20 July 2007, a date set to meet the convenience of Mr
Murtough.
 On 18 July 2007, the Court, at the request of Mr Murtough, vacated the hearing date. At a telephone directions hearing on 13 August 2007, the matter was set down for 26 October 2007.
 On 26 October 2007, there was no appearance for Mr Murtough. A solicitor, purporting to act as amicus, informed the Court of certain matters and the proceedings were adjourned until 3 April 2008 for hearing. 4 April 2008 was also reserved. The Court issued, inter alia, the following direction: "2. If the Plaintiff on the date to which this matter is stood over is not represented by a legal practitioner, I will require evidence from him and evidence from an appropriately qualified medical practitioner that he is capable of conducting these proceedings.
 . If the Notices of Motion of the Plaintiff and the Defendants are not heard at the time for which they are set down due to default on the part of the Plaintiff, the Notice of Motion of the Plaintiff to set aside default judgment will, at the conclusion of that day, lapse, as will the stay of the judgment in the principal proceeding and the stay on the cross claim." No documentation was received from Mr Murtough between 26 October 2007 and April 2008. On 3 April 2008, at 9.27am, the Associate received an email from
Mr Murtough to the effect that he was in Orange, was unable to attend court due to illness, and he requested the Court to telephone him in order to hear his submissions. The email was read to the Court, and orders were made dismissing the notice of motion and dissolving all stays on the entry and execution of the judgment of 5 February 2007.

Principles The exercise of the discretion of the Court is informed by the provisions of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html), [57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s57.html), [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s58.html) and [59](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s59.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/). In exercising any discretion conferred on the Court, effect must be given to the purpose of facilitating the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings. In giving effect to that purpose, the Court is required to manage proceedings so as to allow for their just determination, efficient disposal, efficient use of available resources, and timely disposal.
The provisions of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s58.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) expand on the relevant considerations in determining the "dictates of justice", some mandatory and others not.
 Further, the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s59.html) of the Act require the Court to implement a practice and procedure, the object of which is the elimination of any lapse of time between the commencement of the proceedings and their final determination beyond that which is reasonably required for the fair and just determination of the issues in dispute.
 These objects, while codified in the Act, are not novel. While delay is not simply the passage of time, the passage of time beyond that which is reasonably required for the fair and just determination of the issues in dispute between the parties must, to the extent that justice can still be given effect, be avoided.
 The balance, between giving to a party a further opportunity (by way of amendment, adjournment, or other indulgence) and the injustice to another party caused by any such delay, is often difficult. In the present proceedings, were it not for the evidence and other material relating to the physical and psychiatric disabilities purportedly suffered by Mr Murtough, the balance would be more than obvious. The Court has indulged Mr Murtough, for the foregoing reasons, in a manner that is extraordinary.
 Dealing with an adjournment application, the High Court of Australia has, relying upon Maxwell versus Keun [1928] 1 KB 841, reiterated that, while an appellate court would only exceptionally interfere with the discretion to refuse an adjournment, it will do so when the failure to adjourn results in a denial of justice and the adjournment would not otherwise result in any injustice to other parties. Thus, "an adjournment which, if refused, would result in a serious injustice to the applicant should only be refused if that is the only way that justice can be done to another party in the action." (Sali versus SPC Ltd <case>; [(1993) 116 ALR 625]; [(1993) 67 ALJR 841] at 843.) Likewise, in Queensland versus J L Holdings Pty Ltd <case>; [(1997) 189 CLR 146], the High Court said: "Sali versus SPC was a case concerning the refusal of an adjournment in relation to which the proper principles of case management may have a particular relevance. However, nothing in that case suggests that those principles might be employed, except perhaps in extreme circumstances, to shut a party out from litigating an issue which is fairly arguable. Case management is not an end in itself. It is an important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of litigation. But it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times, that the ultimate aim of the court is the attainment of justice and no principle of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim." (At 154, per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.) This, however, is "an extreme circumstance". Mr Murtough has been granted indulgence upon indulgence. One of the reasons that so many indulgences have been granted is the suspicion that these very proceedings may be a cause of some of the difficulties under which he suffers. The refusal to grant an indulgence, of the kind here sought, can constitute a failure to give a party the opportunity of adequately presenting his case. Every party, including Mr
Murtough, is entitled to a proper opportunity to prepare and present his case.
In that regard, the Court has a responsibility to ensure that a party is given every reasonable opportunity to prepare and present the case it brings to the
Court. But there is no duty, nor could there ever be, to ensure that the party takes advantage of the opportunities given to him and to which he is entitled: Sullivan versus Department of Transport [(1978) 20 ALR 323] at 343, per
Deane J.
 The principles to be applied require the Court to balance the injustice of preventing Mr Murtough from pursuing his claim against the injustice to the defendants in the further delay. In the extraordinary circumstances now before the Court, that balance falls against Mr Murtough. In these particular circumstances, the matter having been specially fixed on a number of occasions, Mr Murtough was, he alleged, unable to attend Court because he was unwell and in Orange. The most likely scenario is that Mr Murtough was in
Orange and unwell before 3 April 2008 and has, once more, failed to notify the
Court or the parties of his indisposition. The lack of simple courtesy, if this be the case, is consistent with prior conduct.
 If, on the other hand, Mr Murtough became unwell when he awoke on 3 April , it necessarily follows, from the travelling time from Orange to Sydney, that he must have been aware of his indisposition well prior to the time he notified the Court, or, that he had no intention of attending Court.
 The Court has now given Mr Murtough more than enough opportunity for him to prepare and present whatever case he wishes. The delays that he has occasioned by his inability or unwillingness to take advantage of those opportunities has created an injustice and prejudice for the defendants, which injustice and prejudice is incapable of being overcome. Certainly, an order for costs cannot sufficiently address these issues.
 For the above reasons, I refused the implicit application (by email) for an adjournment, refused the application for a telephone hearing (for which resources not presently available would have been required) and made the orders of 3 April 2008.

 April 2006 
Proceedings before the Court. Mr Byrnes appeared for Murtough. Proceedings further adjourned to enable compliance with the Rules with regard to appointment of tutors and for further evidence to be adduced to show that Dr
O'Sullivan had legal capacity to act as a tutor or alternatively another person to act as tutor. The Court commented in a judgment delivered that date in the context of an application to appoint Dr O'Sullivan as tutor "As a result of directions and orders earlier made, there is agreement and if there was not agreement, there would be an order of the Court - that a tutor be appointed in relation to the Plaintiff. The issue that has been agitated today, the identity of the tutor. The Plaintiff has proposed that Dr
O'Sullivan - being Dr Brendan O'Sullivan - be appointed as the Tutor; that application is opposed...I am not yet convinced, given the material that is before me, that Dr O'Sullivan is a person not under a legal incapacity, and I have no doubt that there is a residual discretion reposed in the Court as to the appointment of a tutor. In those circumstances, what I intend to do is allow an adjournment for two purposes: Firstly, for compliance with the Rules to occur; and secondly, for material to be adduced that would show a legal capacity to act as tutor; or alternatively, another person to act as the tutor. I intend that to be a substantial adjournment to allow compliance with those terms." July 2006
