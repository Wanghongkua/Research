JUDGMENT -- ex tempore  October 2000 
INTRODUCTION Essentially the issue before me concerns whether the Land and Environment
Court has jurisdiction to the exclusion of this Court in relation to the adjudication of an application by the Plaintiff for relief of various kinds, including damages, in relation to a claimed right-of-way. What raises that issue is the fact that, if the right-of-way exists, it exists now in a
National Park though on the Plaintiff's case the right-of-way pre-dates the declaration of that National Park.

MATERIAL FACTS These can conveniently be taken from the Plaintiff's written submissions of October 2000 which, so far as relevant, are set out below:
By Notice of Motion dated 12 October 2000, the defendant seeks an order pursuant to [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s72.html) of the [Land and Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) transferring to the Land and Environment Court or alternatively in order that the proceedings be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiff opposes the application.
The point in issue is whether the present proceedings are within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in light of [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s72.html) of the [Land and Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/).
The plaintiff's claim is set out in the statement of claim filed in the proceedings. The relief claim includes a declaration to establish the existence of a general right of way over Crown land, orders in the nature of mandatory injunctions and an enquiry before the Master as to the damages suffered by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff's land is land-locked by unalienated Crown land which became part of the Nattai National Park in 1991. The defendant argues that the operation of s153(3) of the National Parks & Wildlife Act deems the right of way alleged by the plaintiff to be granted under s153. It was first enacted in 1974 (Act No. 80, 1974). The provisions are in the following terms: "(1) The Minister may upon such terms and conditions as the Minister thinks fit grant for joint or several use easements or rights of way through, upon, or in a national part, historic site, state recreation area, regional park, nature reserve, state game reserve or karst conservation reserve for the purpose of providing access to any area included in any lease or licence within the park, site, area or reserve, or for the construction of pipelines, or for the erection of standards, posts, wires and appliances for the conveyance or transmission of electricity, or for any other purpose deemed necessary.

The Minister may from time to time revoke or vary any grant under this section.

Any easement or right of way over lands in the National Park historic site, state recreation area or regional park reserved under this Act, which was in force immediately before the lands were reserved as, or as part of, the park, site or area, as the case may be, shall continue in force and shall be deemed to have been granted under this section.

Any easement or right of way over lands in a nature reserve, state game reserve or karst conservation reserve dedicated under this Act, which was in force immediately before the land was dedicated as, or as part of, the nature reserve, state game reserve or karst conservation reserve shall continue and shall be deemed to have been granted under this section." 
RESOLUTION OF LEGAL QUESTION It is convenient that I first set out those sections of the [Land and
Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/)") which are relied upon by the Defendant as excluding the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court and vesting that jurisdiction exclusively in the Land and Environment
Court, save possibly as to damages, as to which I deal later.
 "71 Proceedings in Supreme Court 
Subject to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s58.html), proceedings of the kind referred to in [section (1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) may not be commenced or entertained in the Supreme Court.
 (Repealed)" Under [s20(1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) the Land and Environment Court is expressed as having jurisdiction "to hear and dispose of ..... proceedings referred to in subsection (2)" Subsection (2) relevantly provides as follows: "(2) The Court has the same civil jurisdiction as the Supreme Court would, but for [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s71.html), have to hear and dispose of proceedings: to enforce any right, obligation or duty conferred or imposed by a planning or environmental law or a development contract, to review, or command, the exercise of a function conferred or imposed by a planning or environmental law or a development contract, to make declarations of right in relation to any such right, obligation or duty or the exercise of any such function, and whether or not as provided by [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s68.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/)-- to award damages for a breach of a development contract." 
Pausing there, one might have thought "the same civil jurisdiction" would thus at least impliedly embrace the Supreme Court's jurisdiction inter alia to award damages. But the absence of express reference to that jurisdiction proved fatal to that proposition, when put on the basis of pendent jurisdiction, though whether that case can be distinguished from the present claim remains to be considered; see National Parks and Wildlife Service &
Anor versus Stables Perisher Pty Ltd in [(1990) 71 LGRA 286] at 292 per
Gleeson CJ discussed in 12 and 13 below.
 Section 20(3) provides that "for the purposes of subsection (2), a planning or environmental law is: "(a) ....
 [National Parks and Wildlife Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/) .... " It is long established as a principle of statutory construction that a superior court of law such as the Supreme Court will not be deprived of jurisdiction except by express words or necessary implication; see Law
Society of New South Wales versus Weaver [[1974] 1 NSWLR 271] where the
Court of Appeal so found.
 The critical question is whether the earlier cited legislative provisions do provide the necessary express language or necessary implication. This is in a context where, as the Defendant presses, the subject matter of the application is a claimed right-of-way in a National Park which the legislation allocates to the specialist expertise of the Land and Environment Court. Thus the
Defendant contends that the scheme of the [Land and Environment Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) in [ss71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s71.html) and [72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s72.html) is for such jurisdiction to be exclusive to that specialist court.
 The effect of [s153(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s153.html) of the [National Parks and Wildlife
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/) would in the case of an actual Ministerial grant of a right-of-way, be clear enough.
Depending as it does not on a deeming provision but on an actual grant of a right-of-way by the Minister, there could be no doubt that the privative provisions of [s71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s71.html) read with [s20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) would vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Land and Environment Court.
 In those circumstances such a "right" would be "conferred" by a "planning or environment law" within [s20(2)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html)
It would be clearly capable of being made the subject of a declaration of right as well as enforcement of that right, leaving aside the question of damages, exclusively in the Land and Environment Court.
 However, when it comes to a right-of-way which is by statutory fiction deemed to "continue in force" and "deemed to have been granted under this section", is there sufficient ambiguity in that deemed conferment of a right as to take it outside the subject matter of [s71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s71.html) insofar as defined by [s20(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) and (c)? That is to say, is the expression "conferred ... by a planning or environment law" in [s20(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) sufficient in the way of express language as to include a right the subject of deemed grant under the relevant planning or environmental law, namely [s153(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s153.html) of the [National Parks and Wildlife
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/)? The Plaintiff presses upon me that one strongly countervailing consideration to an affirmative answer to that question is that the Land and
Environment Court would not have jurisdiction on existing Court of Appeal authority binding upon me to award damages; see National Parks and Wildlife
Service & Anor versus Stables Perisher Pty Ltd (supra) at 294. That case concerned a claim for a declaration in which the Land and Environment Court held that it had pendent jurisdiction to entertain claims for damages for negligence and breach of statutory duty in granting the relevant consent in relation to a subject matter within [s20(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) of the [Land and Environment Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/). The
Court of Appeal concluded that the Court did not have such jurisdiction, the
Chief Justice concluding (at 294): "However, where it is [s20(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) that is the basis of the application to the court, then the available powers to grant relief are to be found in the terms of the subsection, read together with [s22.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s22.html)
In this connection [s22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s22.html) is not to be understood as extending the jurisdiction of the court, but as conferring on it full power to exercise a jurisdiction that is granted elsewhere. There may be cases in which a question will arise as to where to draw the line between a proper exercise of the power conferred by [s22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s22.html) and an impermissible excursion beyond jurisdiction. The present case, however, presents no such difficulty. The resolution of a claim for damages for negligence or breach of statutory duty is well beyond the jurisdiction of the
Land and Environment Court. The appeal on the principal issue should succeed." The Defendant whilst attempting to distinguish that decision on the basis that here the claim for damages is merely incidental to the principal subject matter of the claim, being one for a declaration while in Stables Perisher it was the main claim, conceded that the question of jurisdiction to award damages in the Land and Environment Court must be a matter of doubt. That concession was rightly made, though it is not for this Court in the present interlocutory proceedings to attempt any determination of that important question beyond noting the broad ambit of the decision in Stables Perisher.
 The Defendant essentially says that even if it be right that the Land and
Environment Court would lack jurisdiction over that part of the Plaintiff's claim as seeks damages, the quantum of that claim according to the affidavit evidence of the Plaintiff must inferentially be an insignificant aspect of the litigation given that the Plaintiff has been prevented from accessing his property on but two occasions and there is currently an arrangement allowing the Plaintiff to get a key from the Park Ranger and return it to him. Though interlocutory, that arrangement in the absence of contemplated sale would appear such as to diminish a claim for damages. Nonetheless one could not reach any firm conclusion as to whether a claim for damages might still be substantial, including diminution of potential sale value.
 While the apparent inability of the Land and Environment Court to award damages were it to have exclusive jurisdiction, is an argumentum ab inconventi, it is not to my mind the kind of ambiguity which would deprive the otherwise express words of their effect. Those express words I believe inescapably drive one to the conclusion that the expression "conferred" in [s20(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) include the situation where a right is deemed to be conferred by a planning or environmental law, even if it be the case that the pre-existing right is not entirely subsumed by s153(3) but continues to exist also in some parallel or inchoate form. However, I prefer the view that the right is entirely subsumed, consistent with the mandatory language of s153(3) ("any easement or right of way" "shall be deemed to have been granted under this section" and the creation of the statutory fiction by the word `deemed'"). The opposite construction has its own problems including the deprivation of a specialist court of a matter which must be central to its expertise, namely the adjudication of rights-of-way in National Parks. It would create an anomalous situation between pre-existing rights-of-way which, on the Plaintiff's construction, were outside that exclusive jurisdiction. Also by a similar logic it would anomalously preserve from revocation or variation such pre- existing grants, notwithstanding [s153(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s153.html) of the [National Parks and Wildlife
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/).
 Whilst such grandfathering is not unknown in other contexts, the clear thrust of [s153(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s153.html) appears contrary to any such preserved privilege here. There are, as the
Defendant says at least four reasons why the contrary construction should not be accepted: "(a) First, if the common law or equitable basis remained in force, there would be no need for the deeming provision.

Secondly, the contrary construction is inconsistent with the evident purpose of vesting exclusively in a specialist court jurisdiction in relation to all rights concerning land in National Parks.

Thirdly, this construction gives rise to an immediate inconsistency, in that the exercise by the Minister of his or her power to revoke or vary under [s153(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s153.html) would apply only to the deemed statutory right of way, but not to the equitable or common law right.

Fourthly, the construction was expressly intended by the Minister for
Lands when the provision was first introduced in 1967. Contrary to what was suggested by the plaintiff in Court, [s153(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/npawa1974247/s153.html) was not altered or amended following Packham versus Minister for the Environment [(1993) 31 NSWLR 65.] The section remains in relevantly identical form as it took when first enacted in 1974. That enactment was, as its short title indicates, a consolidation of certain previous legislation, including the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1967. Section 31(3) of the 1967 Act was identical to s153(3) of the 1974 Act. When introducing the legislation into the Legislative
Assembly in 1967, the Minister for Lands said: `The Minister will also be empowered to grant revocable easements or rights of way in a national park, state park, historic site or nature reserve for any purpose deemed necessary. Any existing easement or right of way will be deemed to have been granted by the Minister and will continue in full force and effect unless subsequently revoked" (Parliamentary Debates, Legislative
Assembly, 16 August 1967, p503.'" That of course still leaves the difficulty that if the Land and Environment
Court has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of rights of way in a National
Park, whether they pre-date or post-date the declaration of that park, that court if lacking jurisdiction to award damages would leave the parties in the position where this Court, if any court, would have to adjudicate the claim for damages once any declaration of right had been made. There may even be an argument that the deprivation of this Court's jurisdiction has left damages in a black hole with neither court having jurisdiction, though I do not consider that argument correct.
 The short answer to that argument is that were it to be determined that the
Land and Environment Court lacks jurisdiction to determine damages in the present context, the principle to which I have earlier referred (7 above) concerning the deprivation of jurisdiction of a superior court of record would come into play. This Court would have the jurisdiction to award damages, though not for the balance of the proceedings. It would mean that s20(2)(a) would operate with s71 to give exclusive jurisdiction for only such enforcement proceedings excluding damages as were within the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court by express conferment.
 Thus it follows that it will be for future determination whether the damages claim can be entertained with the other claims in the Land and
Environment Court or whether that damages aspect of the Plaintiff's case will be remitted here. It must also be for future determination whether, as the
Plaintiff suggests, s153(2) would produce the result that revocation of a pre- existing right of way would be without compensation. This is on the basis that the compensation provisions of the National Parks & Wildlife Act (Part ) which import the [Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) do not extend to a revocation of an easement under s153(2). Even if true, it does not overcome the effect of the express deprivation of jurisdiction here.
 Finally I should simply note that [s72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/s72.html) of the [Land and Environment Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) gives this Court the discretionary jurisdiction to transfer proceedings from the
Supreme Court to the Land and Environment Court. If I am correct in my earlier conclusion that the Land and Environment Court already has exclusive jurisdiction (save as it may be for damages), then the power to order that the relevant proceedings be transferred to the Land and Environment Court would be available simply as a machinery provision to facilitate those proceedings being heard in the court with exclusive jurisdiction. But if I were wrong in my earlier conclusion as to these privative provisions, I would exercise my discretion to transfer the proceedings to the Land and Environment Court. In either case this would be without prejudice to either party to make a future application for damages to be dealt with in this Court after the Plaintiff's other claims were adjudicated in the Land and Environment Court.

CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
The Plaintiff's proceedings in No. 4143 of 1999 are transferred to the
Land and Environment Court, being of the opinion that such proceedings commenced in this Court could or should have been commenced in the Land and
Environment Court.
I give leave to the Plaintiff to make application following the adjudication by the Land and Environment Court of the Plaintiff's claims for any outstanding claim in relation to damages to be dealt with by this Court.
Costs of the Defendant's application before me should follow the event and the Plaintiff pay the Defendant's costs, though noting that the matter may be referred to the Minister to see whether in view of the public interest in clarifying this issue involving public policy any ex gratia concession may be made in that regard.
