Bush versus Hanlon and Anor Matter No 4806/92 [1998] NSWSC 300 (6 July 1998) 
Last Updated: 28 August 1998 `GEOFFREY RAYMOND BUSH versus DAVID THOMAS HANLON & ANOR` `4806/92` `6 July 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
RULING 
HIS HONOUR: As a general rule the Court does not give leave to amend a defence to rely on the Statute of Frauds at the last moment. Such a defence, if it is to be relied on, is to be pleaded as early as possible. 
In this case the first and second defendants, the first defendant by his defence and the second defendant by her reply to the cross-claim, now seek to raise the Statute. The case was commenced in 1992 and at least once before was fixed for hearing and the hearing vacated. The present amendment was not notified before last Thursday, two working days ago. Mr Martin for the first defendant, says that the general principles set down in cases such as
Queensland versus J L Holdings Pty Ltd <case>; [(1997) 141 ALR 353] apply and the amendment should be allowed. That case does not address the general principles of amendments of this nature, which as far as I am aware, apply to fraud cases (see Bentley & Co (Limited) versus Black [(1893) 9 TLR 580)] as well as cases where the defence is the Statute of Frauds.

Mr Martin says that the words of Hope J in May versus Gibson [(1970) 71 SR ] at 87 tell against that. I respectfully disagree. His Honour there merely says that an amendment to plead the Statute should not be permitted after the evidence is closed.

However, applications for amendment are not to be dealt with on the basis of some rule of thumb. The general principle does apply. But one must consider in each case, whether it should be applied. In the instant case, it would seem that the real issue between the parties and the significance of the piece of paper, which is said to be a confirmation of the transaction, are already well in the ring.

It may be that at the end of the defendants' case, there will need to be an adjournment for the plaintiff to consider his position and it may be that if I can see that that is a fair application, I will grant it. But it seems to me that I should allow the amendment to the defence, as handed up this morning and also should permit the reply to the cross-claim filed last Friday to stand.
