EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (REVISED)
Mr Clarke, on behalf of Mr Kalal, seeks to ask this question at the conclusion to a series of questions about the fact that his client was acting essentially at the direction of Jamil Qaumi: "In your mind, who were you doing the shooting for?"
Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi objects to that question. He submits that the evidence is not relevant to any issue in the trial.
Mr Clarke has indicated that he is not seeking to elicit the answer to establish the truth of the answer. If that be the case, there seems to be no relevance to the answer. The question is directed to the witness's belief and I cannot see any use for the evidence if it is not because the witness genuinely held the belief [presumably that he was "doing the shooting for" Farhad Qaumi].
Going beyond that, ultimately what this witness believed that he was doing does not rationally impact upon the probabilities concerning the issues that arise in Mr Kalal's case. In particular, establishing that somebody else may have believed that they were doing the shooting for Farhad Qaumi, who was the leader or the "general" of the group, does not establish that Mr Kalal held the belief. That is so even if it is accepted - although it was not articulated in argument - that if an order came from Farhad Qaumi there was more reason to be terrified and to act upon the order because of his reputation and earlier actions instilling fear and intimidation in the group.
Having regard to the provisions of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) as to relevance, I do not find the evidence to be relevant. Even if it does have some peripheral relevance, I would exclude it under [s 135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) because of its potential prejudicial effect in the case of the co-accused Farhad Qaumi.
There is ample material adduced in Mr Clarke's cross-examination (without objection) in the past short while upon which he may be able to found certain submissions in respect of the issues to which he says this question goes. An answer to that last question, particularly if not directed to the truth of the witness' belief, will not advance that cause in any meaningful way, so its probative value is slight and its danger of unfair prejudice to Mr Qaumi is significant.
The question is disallowed.
