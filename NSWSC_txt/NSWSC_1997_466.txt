JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is the final hearing of the claim made by the cross claimant, John Raymond Copeland, in his cross claim filed 10 July 1995. 
The cross claimant is the current trustee of a trust, which can shortly be described as the Street Family Trust. The previous trustee of the trust was a company, Jancollyn (1980) Pty Limited, to which I will refer to in these reasons simply as Jancollyn.

Jancollyn entered into various transactions with the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. In the course of those transactions, it gave to the bank three [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) mortgages over properties at Bowral over which it was the registered proprietor, namely, mortgages X627724, Z328963 and Z538176. It gave those mortgages between 20 May 1988 and 4 January 1991. It also gave the
Commonwealth Bank an equitable mortgage dated 22 September 1989 over all its assets and undertaking.

The cross claimant seeks to have a declaration that those mortgages were entered into in breach of trust and should be set aside.

The Street Family Trust was constituted by deed of settlement made 4 September
The trust fund was the usual $50 and the objectives of the trust, the powers of the trustees and the ability to add beneficiaries was in accordance with the form customarily used by persons setting up discretionary trusts. The beneficiaries under the trust were those named in the Schedule as the first beneficiaries, as well as persons who might be added by Mr or Mrs Street.

Jancollyn was involved with various businesses, which required finance from both the ANZ and the Commonwealth Banks. Those businesses included a business known as Terry's Sound Lounge Pty Ltd and the Pumpkin Boutique. It would seem that those businesses were businesses in which both Mr and Mrs Street senior were then involved. The banks lent considerable monies to Jancollyn on the basis of the mortgages and for the purposes of those businesses. Two of the beneficiaries under the discretionary trust, being grandchildren of Mr and Mrs
Street, have given evidence that they knew nothing about the borrowings that were made from the banks and which were secured over the trust assets.

Jancollyn had a receiver and manager put into it and later was put into liquidation. On 5 June 1995 the persons having power to appoint a new trustee under the settlement, namely, Mr and Mrs Street senior, executed and delivered a deed appointing the present cross claimant as new trustee. Although that deed was duly stamped, it was not registered until 7 October 1997, namely, during the hearing of the proceedings. However, in a previous stage of these proceedings before Brownie J on 10 July 1995, his Honour appointed the present cross claimant as the new trustee of the Street Family Trust under [s70](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s70.html) of the [Trustee Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/).

The cross claimant says that the mortgages were in breach of the trust because the former trustee, Jancollyn, was using the trust assets for its own purposes and that the banks knew that Jancollyn was a trustee, that the properties were trust assets and the advances were for non-trust purposes. He says that under authorities such as Fouche versus The Superannuation Fund Board <case>; [(1952) 88 CLR 609] and my unreported decision of Ishac versus David Securities Pty
Ltd (No. 9) 5 June 1992, the trustee for the time being is entitled to have the mortgages set aside notwithstanding that a former trustee for the time being was involved in a breach of trust or wrongful act towards the beneficiaries when the transactions were instituted. That proposition is not disputed.

The cross defendant came into the picture because of a deed which was entered into between it and the Commonwealth Bank on 7 September 1994. That deed is
DX34 in the present proceedings. By that deed, the Commonwealth Bank assigned to the cross defendant, inter alia, the four mortgages that are the subject of the cross claim. There is no need to dwell in detail on the provisions of the deed, though I do need to deal with annexure "A" to it. Annexure "A", which I have not seen even though both counsel indicated they did not mind me seeing it, was an advice given to the Commonwealth Bank by its legal department. It is referred to in the deed as "the Bank's internal memorandum" and is dated 1
September 1994. In clause 8 of the deed, the bank gave certain warranties, one warranty being that its security was fully valid, binding and enforceable, subject to the matters disclosed in annexure "A".

The documents including DX34 were initially exhibited to an affidavit made by the solicitor for the cross defendant, which presumably she intended to use on the claim. The affidavit was, however, read by Mr P Neil SC for the cross claimant in his case. In the solicitor's affidavit, she had said in clause 6 that the deed which she exhibited: "is a photostat copy of a Deed of Assignment save for Annexure 'A' thereto (the Annexure 'A' referred to in the aforementioned Deed of Assignment having been removed on the basis that it is subject to legal professional privilege)." 
Having tendered and read that affidavit and tendered the exhibits in his own case, senior counsel for the cross claimant then called for annexure "A" with a view to tendering it also. Mr B Coles of Queen's Counsel for the cross defendant objected on the basis that it could not be adduced in evidence because of [s118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). That section provides that evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of the contents of a confidential document prepared by the client or a lawyer.

Discussion ensued and I ruled that the document could not be placed in evidence, and I also considered that it would not be proper for me to see it unless I had to, because it is inexpedient for judges to see material which is not going to be put in evidence unless the other factors in the case operate to the contrary. The only matter that was relevant and which was written onto the transcript by consent was that annexure "A" was signed by a Mr Armstrong, who has been on the Roll of New South Wales Solicitors since 1979 and is still on that Roll.

The first problem with [s118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) is to work out who is the client. In the instant case, Mr Armstrong was the lawyer for the Commonwealth Bank. He has never been the lawyer for the cross defendant. To this Mr Coles QC said that [s117(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html) defines "client" as including: "(f) a successor to the rights and obligations of a client, being rights and obligations in respect of which a confidential communication was made." 
Mr Coles QC puts that where one has an assignment of a mortgage and legal advice is given by a lawyer to the assignor, then the assignee must be considered as a successor within the meaning of [s117(1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html) and, accordingly, is a client under [s118.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) 
Mr Neil SC said that that was reading "successor" far too widely; that the mere fact that a person had taken an assignment of a mortgage did not mean that he was a successor of a client.

There is no definition of the word "successor" in the legislation and it is a peculiar word to find in this sort of statute. If one looks at Stroud's
Judicial Dictionary see eg, 4th edition at page 2661, one can see a simple definition: "A successor is 'he that followeth or cometh in another's place'." 
That is a wide definition, but it tends to be the sense in which the word is used in the cases, though none of the cases that I have found are in pari materia. There are the pawnbroker cases, R versus Commissioners of Inland
Revenue; Ohlson's case [[1891] 1 QB 485] and R v
Commissioners of Inland Revenue Ex Parte Silvester [[1907] 1 KB 108.] Under s39 of the English Pawnbrokers' Act of 1872, a person could obtain a pawnbroker's licence only upon production of a magistrate's certificate unless, as at 1872, he was a licensed pawnbroker or was a successor to a licensed pawnbroker. The
Act was construed as meaning that a person who acquired a shop which was in existence in 1872 was a successor to a pawnbroker and so did not need a magistrate's certificate.

In United Starr-Bowkett Co-operative Building Society (No. 11) Ltd versus Clyne [(1967) 68 SR 331], the defendant appears to have worked out a scheme for removing protected tenants from property by simply purchasing property that was tenanted, mortgaging the property and then not paying his mortgage. The mortgagee would then do the work for the defendant by removing the tenant. However, under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/), the rights of a short term tenant were protected against a successor in title from the mortgagor, and the Full Court held that in those situations a mortgagee was a successor in title to the mortgagor.

So the word "successor" tends to be used in legislation in a fairly wide sense and this makes it probable that Mr Coles QC's argument is correct. If one approaches [s117(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) from the other angle, that is the purposive approach rather than the semantic approach, one can see that the legislature is intended to cover not only the situation where legal advice is given to "X" but also to people who are in the same plight as "X", being "X"'s employees, agents, legal personal representatives and then we get [s117(1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html), "A successor".

Again, it seems that the purpose of the legislature was to protect a document that had been prepared under legal professional privilege in the hands of not only the person who paid for it to be produced or who retained the lawyer, but also for all those who were claiming under that person. Again, this tends to support a wide approach as to who is a successor.

The only matter really that can be put in favour of Mr Neil SC's approach is the decision of RD Nicholson J in Times Properties Pty Ltd versus Challenge Bank
Ltd [(1996) 18 ATPR 41-455.] In that case, his Honour appears to have defined the word "client" very narrowly for the purpose of [s119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) so that a receiver was not entitled to claim legal professional privilege in respect of a document in which the company had been given legal professional advice.

It seems to me, with respect, that that approach was a little too narrow.

Of course, even if a person is a client under [s117](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html), so that that person is entitled to take an objection under [s118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) (or s[119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html)), the problem is what is meant by "the client" in [s118(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html),(b) or (c). Has the "client", who makes the objection, got to be the same client for whom the document was prepared? 
That is a question that RD Nicholson, J answered "No", and it does not seem to me that his Honour was taken to the consequences that flow from the wide definitions in [s117.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html)
Indeed, the only way in which one can read [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html), [118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) and [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) sensibly together is if the words "the client" in (a), (b) and (c) of [s118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) and (a) of [s119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) are read in ambulatory fashion, that is, "client for the time being".
Otherwise, if, for instance, the original client had died and his executor was the litigant, then the intended protection given by [s117](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html) to the executor would count for absolutely nothing if it could be said that that particular client, namely, the executor, was not the person for whom the document was prepared.

Accordingly, in my view, the document is one which is excluded by [s118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) and it is proper for the cross defendant to take the objection.

There was then an argument put as to whether the cross defendant's solicitor, in filing her affidavit deploying the deed, minus annexure "A", had been deploying the deed either in evidence or, as was jocularly put during argument, deploying the document in trade. Deploying the document in trade could also refer to the obvious point that when the deed was delivered by the bank, it was delivered including annexure "A". There does not appear to be anything in [s122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) which would operate to expose the deed to tender because the provisions of [s122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) show that this is a situation where the confidential communication was only passed on to the assignee and the protection was not lost.

Mr Neil SC then said that [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) operated. He said that it was impossible to understand the deed unless annexure "A" was also tendered. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) reads: "If, because of the application of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s121.html), [122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html), [123](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s123.html), [124](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s124.html) or [125](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s125.html), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a communication or the contents of a document, those sections do not prevent the adducing of evidence of another communication or document if it is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the communication or document." 
Mr Neil SC says that as the deed was in evidence minus annexure "A" (because he had tendered it), one could not understand the warranty under clause 8 unless annexure "A" was also tendered and, accordingly, [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) operated so as to expose annexure "A". However, as Mr Coles QC pointed out, so to construe [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) gives no semantic significance to the words "because of the application".
There is nothing in this case that invokes [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s121.html) through 125 and, because that is so, [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) cannot give any assistance.

It does not seem to me, in any event, that just because it is necessary to understand a particular part of a document, which is not the part in issue before the court, that [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) automatically brings in all other communications. Either because of the operation of [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) itself or because of the provisions in the Act which give the judge a discretion to limit use of evidence, such as [s135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) and s[136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html), it would only be if the otherwise privileged material was germane to understanding the part of the document that the court needed to understand that the section would apply.

I should note, unless it be thought that I had overlooked it, that ordinarily this problem cannot arise because if one is to tender a deed, one must tender the whole deed. However, both counsel recognised this rule and did not seek to have it stand in the way of a determination of this particular point.

I return, at long last, to the merits. The basic points made by Mr Coles QC were: 
That his client had become the indefeasible registered proprietor of
Torrens system mortgages. It was not alleged against his client that it had been guilty of any fraud and, accordingly, no matter what had happened between the Commonwealth Bank and Jancollyn, the mortgages could not be set aside.

In any event, there was no evidence that the bank knew that the then trustee was using trust assets for its own purposes.

As to (a), Mr Neil SC conceded that there was no material to show that the cross defendant had any knowledge of anything amiss. His submission was that the cross defendant could not be in any better position than the Commonwealth
Bank. However, that represents the law outside the Torrens system and under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/), once a person has, without fraud, obtained a registered title then that title is indefeasible. As no fraud is alleged against the cross defendant, its title is indefeasible.

The next question is whether there is any personal equity against the cross defendant. A personal equity means a right to apply to a court of equity for relief, though it includes a situation where a person can apply at common law for deceit; see, for instance, Grgic versus ANZ Banking Group Ltd [(1994) 33
NSWLR 202], 222-3. In the instant case, I cannot see any equity that binds the cross defendant. There is no evidence that the cross defendant was involved in any active participation in a breach of trust, such as would bring it within the principles of Barnes versus Addy [(1874) LR 9 Ch App 244.] 
Accordingly, the cross defendant must succeed.

It is thus not necessary for me to go too deeply into the assessment of the evidence as to the circumstances in which the Commonwealth Bank took its mortgages. The present trustee is in an awkward position because, although he has some material, he apparently does not have access to all the documents of the trust and, accordingly, he is not able to put to the court material in bulk which would support his case. If such material exists, that is unfortunate because the court can only deal with the matter on the material which it has.

The material which the court has includes statements made to the bank at the time when the advances were made that the assets and the borrowings were not being made in any breach of trust. It may be that someone told untruths to the bank at the time but it would seem, from material such as PX270, that the bank was told by solicitors that present and future borrowings in the name of
Jancollyn would be in its own right and not in its capacity as the trustee of the Street Family Trust and that the security would be in the name of
Jancollyn and not in its capacity as trustee for the Street Family Trust.
There is no material to show that the bank knew that the Bowral properties were trust assets. The cross claimant sues under the principle in Barnes v
Addy [(1874) LR 9 Ch App 244.] 
The degree of knowledge to which a person being attacked in a Barnes v
Addy situation is required to have in order to be liable has been extensively discussed in recent authorities, for instance, in Equiticorp
Finance Ltd versus Bank of New Zealand [(1993) 32 NSWLR 50] at -105. It would not seem to me that the evidence in the instant case shows that there was, in any event, in the Commonwealth Bank the requisite degree of knowledge which would entitle the cross claimant to have the mortgages set aside against it with the corruption passing through to the cross defendant.

Only two other matters need to be mentioned. First, I have not dealt with the equitable mortgage in detail because if that mortgage were against the assets and undertaking of Jancollyn, which is now in liquidation, and a new trustee has been appointed to the trust, it cannot affect the trust assets.

Secondly, there is the question as to when the deed of appointment of new trustee took effect. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s6.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) provides that a new trustee may be appointed by registered deed. In some situations, such as the situation where a power of attorney is to be used to convey land, the power of attorney may be registered after the document dealing with land has itself been executed. Thus, in an appropriate case, one can apply to the court for an injunction to prevent registration of the power of attorney; see s163 of the Conveyancing Act and Williams versus Marac Australia
Ltd (1985) 3 BPR 9638. However, [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s6.html) of the [Trustee
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) does not appear to me to be in the same mould. It specifically says that the new trustee may by registered deed be appointed and it would seem to me that until the deed is actually registered the appointment does not take effect.

I have not found any authority on the point but it seems to me that that is the plain meaning of the section. It follows, accordingly, that the deed could not have taken effect before 7 October 1997, so that as at the date of filing of the cross claim in 1995, Mr Copeland, the cross claimant, was not the trustee of the trust. However, he became the trustee by virtue of the order made by Brownie J and it must also follow that because he was already a trustee by virtue of that order, the registration of the deed on 7 October should make no difference.

As the law takes no account of any part of a day, the filing of the cross claim and the order of Brownie J on 10 July, 1995 means that Mr Copeland was a trustee on that day and so the cross claim was actually made by a person who was the trustee.

However, for the other reasons I have given, the cross claim must be dismissed with costs. The exhibits can be returned on the usual undertaking.
