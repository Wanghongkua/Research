BATHURST CITY COUNCIL versus PWC PROPERTIES PTY LIMITED /96; LEC 40026/96 April 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
SHELLER, COLE JJA, STUDDERT AJA 
CATCHWORDS: TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES - constructive trusts - land vested in council for public car park - whether held subject to a trust for public purpose - community land 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Allowed 
The respondent is the owner of a shopping centre, which is adjacent to a car park owned or controlled by the appellant Council. By resolution dated 18 May the Council purported to resolve, pursuant to the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/), to classify land which included the car park land, as operational land.

On 21 December 1979 the Council had granted development consent for the shopping centre to the appellant's predecessor in title. Approval was granted subject to a number of conditions, including the provision of 60 off-street car parking spaces by the developer, with credit for the spaces being granted on evidence being furnished of the conveyance to the Council of the fee simple of two lots owned by Gurdon Motors Pty Limited and Permewan Wright
Consolidated Limited. The developer was to pay a cash contribution for the remaining car spaces not already credited. The two parcels of land were transferred to the Council, and became part of the car park, and on 8 August the cash contribution was paid to the Council.

On 21 February 1996 the respondent brought a class 4 application in the Land and Environment Court, seeking declarations that the whole of the car park land, which consisted of twenty-two lots, was subject to a trust for car parking purposes, and that any resolution by the Council purporting to classify the land as operational land under Sch 7, cl 6(3) of the Act was invalid. Two of the twenty-two lots were those mentioned above. The trial
Judge declared the land was classified as community land in accordance with
Sch 7 cl 6 (2) (b), and ordered the respondent be restrained from dealing with the land in a manner otherwise than in accordance with [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s35.html)-[47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s47.html) and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of Sch 7.

The Council appealed against this decision, and the respondent cross-appealed.
The cross-appeal was relied upon as a notice of contention to support the trial judge's declaration and orders, and in particular to submit that the trial Judge erred in not finding a constructive trust of the land constituted by the two lots. The issue was whether within the meaning of cl 6(2)(b), the car park land was "subject to a trust for a public purpose" 
Held: 
The material before the Court did not demonstrate any express trust, ie, any express declaration of intention by any party to create a trust. There are present here the elements of subject matter, trustee, and personal obligation attaching to the property, namely the obligation of the Council to use the two lots to provide off-street car parking spaces. There is no reason why the availability of the remedy of a constructive trust should be limited to cases where a beneficiary can be identified. It follows that the two lots are held on constructive trust for the purpose of providing a car park for members of the public. Such is a trust for a public purpose. The tendency of the trust was to benefit the public, a condition that is satisfied if it tends to the benefit of the public at large, or a class or section of the public. Accordingly, the trust falls within cl 6 (2)(b) of [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of Schedule 7 of the Act. In respect of the two lots of land, the trial Judge's orders were correct.

The line of reasoning which runs from the imposition on the Council of an obligation, as essential to the validity of the condition of the development consent, to the existence of a trust for a public purpose does not apply, so far as the evidence reveals, to any of the other twenty lots in the car park which are embraced by the trial Judge's orders. It was not open to the trial
Judge to conclude that any of the land, other than the two lots, was held by the Council on trust for a public purpose

JUDGMENT 
SHELLER JA: 
INTRODUCTION 
In the [Local Government Act 1993](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) (the Act) "public land" means any land (including a public reserve) vested in or under the control of the council of an area subject to exclusions not presently relevant. Chapter 6, [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of the Act provides that all public land must be classified as either "community" or "operational", the former being land which should be kept for use by the general public and the latter land which need not be so kept. Clause 6 of [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of Schedule 7 of the Act, which has effect pursuant to [s749](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s749.html) of the Act, and is headed "Savings, transitional and other provisions consequent on the enactment of this Act", provides for the classification of existing public land, and applies to all public land within a council's area as at the commencement of [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of Chapter 6 (the relevant commencement). Paragraphs 6 (2) (b) and (c) provide that on the relevant commencement, land subject to a trust for a public purpose and land dedicated as a condition of a development consent under [s94](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s94.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) (the EPA Act) that is vested in or under the control of a council, is taken to have been classified as community land. Subclause 6 (3) provides that within one year after the relevant commencement, a council may, by resolution, classify, as community land or operational land, any public land that is vested in it or under its control and that is not classified by subclause 6 (2).

COUNCIL RESOLUTION 
The respondent, PWC Properties Pty Limited (PWC), is the owner of a shopping centre at 208-218 Howick Street, Bathurst, known as the Payless Plaza Shopping
Centre. A two hundred space car park is provided on an adjacent bitumen surfaced ground floor area of land comprising approximately 8,600 square metres owned or controlled by the appellant, Bathurst City Council (the
Council). The car park is in the centre of the block bounded by William,
Howick, Bentinck and Russell Streets, Bathurst, with a vehicular ingress and egress available to the car park and the loading dock in the shopping centre from Bentinck and Russell Streets.

By resolution dated 18 May 1994 the Council purported to resolve, pursuant to s34 [sic] of the Act, to classify land which included the car park land, as operational land.

DEVELOPMENT CONSENT 
On 21 December 1979 the Council granted PWC's predecessor in title, Tortuga Securities Pty Limited, development consent for the shopping centre at 208-218 Howick Street, Bathurst. Approval was granted subject to a number of conditions, including: "(11) The developer is to provide 60 off-street car parking spaces - 
A credit of 41 car parking spaces will be granted upon being furnished with evidence that the fee simple of Lot 21 in D.P. 258221, comprising 1199 square metres, has been conveyed to Council by the owner, Gurdon Motors Pty
Limited of Bathurst.

A credit of 12.6 car parking spaces will be granted upon being furnished with evidence that the fee simple of Lot 22 in D.P. 258221 comprising 370 square metres, has been conveyed to Council by the owner Permewan Wright
Consolidated Limited.

The developer is to pay a cash contribution of $4,160 being 6.4 car spaces at $650 per space, in lieu of provision of the 6.4 spaces not credited in (a) and (b) of this condition." 
Pursuant to a contract dated 29 February 1980, and by transfer dated 5
November 1981 and registered on 10 January 1986, Gurdon Motors Pty Limited transferred the land referred to in (11) (a) to the Council. Condition (11) was satisfied by the owner of the land therein referred to and then being
Lot 12 in DP 609772 directing the Registrar General to issue the certificate of title to the Council. These two parcels of land I shall refer to as the development consent credit land. They became part of the car park. On 8 August the Council received the cash contribution referred to in (11) (c).
 
In July 1985 PWC paid $12,000 to the Council on account of the elimination of six car parking spaces on the car park land in order to facilitate access to PWC's loading dock. Despite the Council's submission to the contrary, I do not think that this has any bearing on the question for decision in this appeal.

CLASS 4 APPLICATION 
On 21 February 1996 PWC began a class 4 application in the Land and Environment Court, which in the amended points of claim sought declarations that the whole of the car park land, which consisted of twenty-two lots referred to in a schedule to the points of claim, was subject to a trust for car parking purposes and that any resolution by the Council purporting to classify the land as operational land under cl 6 (3) of Schedule 7 to the Act was invalid. Two of the twenty-two lots were the development consent credit land. 
Talbot J heard the application and, on 5 July 1996, declared that: "1. On the commencement of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) the land referred to in Annexure A to the Amended Points of Claim was classified as community land in accordance with clause 6 (2) (b) of Schedule 7 to the [Local
Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/)." and ordered that: "2. The Respondent is restrained from dealing with the land in a manner otherwise than in accordance with [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s35.html)-[47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s47.html) and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2) of Schedule 7 to the [Local Government Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/).
The question of costs is reserved." 
APPEAL 
The Council appealed against Talbot J's decision, and PWC cross-appealed. PWC did not press its cross-appeal, but sought to rely upon it as a notice of contention to support the declaration and orders, and in particular to submit that the trial Judge erred in not finding a constructive trust of the development consent credit land.

In his reasons for judgment, Talbot J found that at the time between mid-1980 and 1986 when it acquired by private treaty, for nominal and valuable consideration, resumption and dedication, the various parcels of land which make up the car park, the Council expressed its intention to do so for a public car park to accommodate the increased demand for parking created by the surrounding commercial development. His Honour said: "In those cases where the council acquired land from private owners, it offered a nominal sum as consideration or compensation taking account of the enhancement to the value of the residual land following construction of the car parking area. It appears that, in most cases, the council paid all legal and survey fees and the cost of fencing. In a form of `standard' letter to owners of the land to be acquired, the council expressed its desire to acquire the land which, `when amalgamated with similarly zoned adjoining lands and developed as a Council owned car park, will bring tangible benefits to your property'.

In at least one case, namely the purchase from the Bank of New South Wales, the council formally agreed to provide public car parking facilities on the land sold so long as the vendor remained the proprietor of the retained land.
During negotiations, the council had informed the bank that it desired to obtain the fee simple without restrictive conditions believing, inter alia, that if it became feasible to expand car parking in association with development within the car parking area, the adjoining lands would appreciate in value and also would benefit from such development. The ultimate agreement made with the bank pursuant to the formal contract for sale appears, therefore, to have been a compromise between the parties.

Where land was acquired by way of resumption, there is evidence to show that the council intended to provide for payment of compensation and costs in respect of the resumption from funds available for the construction of the car parking area.

During negotiations with some owners, the council undertook to provide a car park credit for future car parking space contributions calculated at the then present rate." 
The issue in the case was, whether within the meaning of Division 7, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p2), paragraph 6 (2) (b), the car park land was "subject to a trust for a public purpose". At an early stage in the hearing of the appeal, this Court voiced its concern about whether, having regard to the want of interested parties and the limited evidence, it was appropriate to determine any question in respect of any land other than the development consent credit land. I shall return to this matter of concern.

TRUST 
In the Land and Environment Court, PWC sought to establish that the whole of the car park land was held on an express trust for car parking purposes.
Alternatively, PWC argued that the land was held on a constructive trust for car parking purposes. Car parking purposes were said to be a public purpose. A good deal of attention was given to the elements essential to establish an express trust and to the requirements of [s23C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). In support of PWC's argument on constructive trust, Muschinski versus Dodds <case>; <case>; [(1987) 164 CLR 137] were referred to. Talbot J said: "What the present applicant is seeking to do is to attribute a trust obligation whereby the council is precluded from dealing with the land other than in purported strict compliance with terms of a trust which were never specifically spelt out. It cannot be read out of any of the documents or the actions of council that parking was to be provided to serve the Payless Plaza in the particular way claimed by the applicant, namely that it be at ground level to facilitate an effective and economical use of shopping trolleys.
There was nevertheless a general intention that the land acquired from the predecessor to the applicant and others would be used for the purpose of public car parking. It does not follow that the applicant, or any other former owner, have any proprietary rights which, according to the applicable principles of the law of equity, require the council, as the owner of the common law title, to hold it to the use or for the benefit of those former owners." 
His Honour went on to refer to condition (11) of the development consent and quoted the following passage from the judgment of Glass JA in Rockdale
Municipal Council versus Tandel Corporation Pty Limited [(1975) 34 LGRA 196] at 206: "It will no doubt be impossible to justify the collection of money with which the Council intends merely to augment its revenue or which it proposed to spend on certain purposes without any obligation to do so. But I consider that a council may arguably claim that it has imposed a valid condition in circumstances where residential development in a given area will create a need for additional open space if the amenities of the neighbourhood are to be preserved, the provision of open space on the development site is not commercially feasible, money collected from each developer is to be expended on the provision of such open space, the money is impressed with a trust which would prevent its expenditure for any other purpose and the space to be provided is proximate enough to the site to present a reasonable connexion with the needs generated by development on it." 
What Glass JA said in this passage was obiter. Samuels JA agreed in the judgment of Glass JA. Moffitt P left the question open; 199. In that case, a council had been prepared to approve final plans and specifications for the erection of a residential flat building, subject to payment of a contribution of $3,000, in lieu of providing 400 square feet of open space per unit within the site. The developer paid this sum to the council and later sought to recover it on the basis that the council had no power to require the payment of money in connection with the granting of any development consent. In the
District Court, the developer obtained a verdict on findings which all members of the Court of Appeal regarded as insufficient to support it. At 203 Glass JA said that to succeed in the action it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove, amongst other things, that the demand was made without lawful justification. This led his Honour to consider cases concerned with whether, as a condition of its consent, a council might require the payment of money to be used by it for the provision of the facility the developer could be required validly to provide.

In Allen Commercial Constructions Pty Limited versus The Council of the
Municipality of North Sydney <case>; [(1970) 123 CLR 490] at 499-500, Walsh J said that a clause in a planning scheme ordinance, which enabled an authority to grant an application for consent unconditionally or subject to such conditions as it might think proper to impose, ought to be understood, "not as giving an unlimited discretion as to the conditions which may be imposed, but as conferring a power to impose conditions which are reasonably capable of being regarded as related to the purpose for which the function of the authority is being exercised, as ascertained from a consideration of the scheme and of the Act under which it is made. This purpose may be conveniently described, in accordance with the expression used by Lord Jenkins in Fawcett
Properties Limited versus Buckingham County Council [[1961] AC 636] at 684 as being `the implementation of planning policy', provided that it is borne in mind that it is from the Act and from any relevant provisions of the Ordinance, and not from some preconceived general notion of what constitutes planning, that the scope of planning policy is to be ascertained." 
It follows from this, that to be valid, a condition of a development consent which requires a contribution of money must carry with it an obligation by the authority to apply the money for the related purpose. This consequence is now reflected in s94 of the EPA Act which came into force on 1 September 1980 after the Council had granted the development consent, and so does not apply to it. Section 94 (1) enables a consent authority, subject to subs (2) and its satisfaction that a development, the subject of a development application, will or is likely to require the provision of or increase the demand for public amenities and public services within the area, to grant consent to that application, subject to a condition requiring the dedication of land free of cost, or the payment of a monetary contribution, or both. Subsection (2) provides that a condition referred to in subs (1) shall be imposed only (b) to require a reasonable dedication or contribution for the provision, extension or augmentation of the public amenities and public services mentioned in that subsection. As originally enacted, s94 (3) provided that the Council should hold any monetary contribution "in trust for the purpose for which the payment was required". In 1985 and 1991 the subsection was amended to provide that the consent authority should hold any monetary contribution "paid in accordance with the condition referred to in subsection (1) ........ for the purpose for which the payment was required". Until the reference to "trust" was removed in , the subsection displayed a legislative intent to confirm the concept, of which Glass JA spoke, that a consent authority holds money paid, in accordance with a condition of consent, impressed with an obligation of trust not to apply it for some unrelated purpose.

CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST 
I am not persuaded that the material before the Court demonstrated any express trust, that is to say, any express declaration of intention by any party to create a trust.

Argument was addressed to whether the obligation of the Council to apply the land or the money it received in consequence of the fulfilment of the condition of the development consent was an obligation imposed by a trust for a public purpose, and if so, a constructive trust. The Council's argument that there cannot be a constructive trust for a public purpose was really directed to making the point that the land conveyed to the Council was not subject to any trust.

The learned authors of Scott on Trusts, 4th ed, Volume 5 at para 462.4 say of the expression "constructive trust": "The word `constructive' is derived from the verb `construe', not from the verb `construct'....... So in the case of a constructive trust, the court finds from the circumstances that some of the consequences that would follow from the creation of an express trust should also follow." In Hospital Products Limited versus United States Surgical
Corporation <case>; [(1984) 156 CLR 41] at 125, Deane J, with whom Mason J agreed, referred to the imposition of a constructive trust as the appropriate form of equitable relief "in circumstances where a person could not in good conscience retain for himself a benefit, or the proceeds of a benefit, which he has appropriated to himself in breach of his contractual or other legal or equitable obligations to another".

An important feature of a constructive trust is that it arises by operation of law without reference to the intention, actual or implied, of the parties concerned; Muschinski versus Dodds at 613; Bryson versus Bryant [(1992) 29 NSWLR ]
at 217. In Muschinski versus Dodds at 613-4, Deane J said: "The constructive trust shares, however, some of the institutionalized features of express and implied trust. It demands the staple ingredients of those trusts: subject matter, trustee, beneficiary (or, conceivably, purpose), and personal obligation attaching to the property......" There are present here subject matter, trustee (the Council), and personal obligation attaching to the property, namely the obligation of the Council to use the development consent credit land to provide off-street car parking spaces. Despite the Council's insistence in argument, though not in its pleading (see para 6 of its points of defence), that the transfer of the development consent credit land was not pursuant to a condition of the development consent, quite plainly the intention was that sixty car parking spaces were to be provided by the developer or by the Council and, if by the Council, forty-one on Lot 21, 12.6 on Lot 12 (formerly Lot 22 in DP 258221) and 6.4 elsewhere, for which the developer paid $4,160, being the product of the multiplication of $650 by the number of spaces.

Deane J did not exclude the concept of a constructive trust fixing upon land where there was no beneficiary, but a purpose for which, in accordance with the personal obligation attaching to the land, it was to be held. Despite Mr
Davison SC's arguments, I can see no reason why the availability of the remedy should be limited to cases where a beneficiary can be identified. It follows, in my opinion, that the development consent credit land is held on trust for the purpose of providing a car park for members of the public. Such is a trust for a public purpose. The tendency of the trust was to benefit the public, a condition that is satisfied if it tends to the benefit of the public at large, or a class or section of the public. "The trusts may be limited in their operations by reference to locality, to conditions of people, to their disabilities, defects or misfortunes and by reference to many other attributes of men and things, yet the trusts may retain their `public' character.";
Thompson versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1959) 102 CLR 315] at 321 per Dixon CJ, with whom Fullagar and Kitto JJ agreed.
See generally Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia, 6th ed, para 1053.
Accordingly, the trust falls within cl 6 (2) (b) of Part 2 of Schedule 7 of the Act. In respect of the development consent credit land, the trial Judge's orders were correct.

THE OTHER TWENTY LOTS 
The line of reasoning which runs from the imposition on the Council of an obligation, as essential to the validity of the condition of the development consent, to the existence of a trust for a public purpose does not apply, so far as the evidence reveals, to any of the other twenty lots in the car park which are embraced by the trial Judge's orders, and in respect of which PWC also claims there to be a trust for a public purpose. Section 674 (1) of the
Act, which enables any person to bring proceedings in the Land and Environment
Court for an order to remedy or restrain a breach of the Act, conferred standing on PWC to bring the proceedings in respect of all the car park land.
Quite simply, PWC contended that the Council had resolved to classify the land as operational land when it had no power to do so, because it was subject to a trust for a public purpose.

In the passage which I have quoted, Talbot J made findings which enabled him to be satisfied, "[h]aving regard to the whole of the circumstances and the manner in which the land became vested in the council, ...... that the car park land was dedicated to, acquired by or vested in the council subject to an obligation in the form of a trust to provide a car parking facility for the general public including the adjoining land holders." 
As I have said, at an early stage in the argument of the appeal, the Court expressed concern about trying to deal with all the lots of land referred to in the annexure to the amended points of claim in this global fashion. PWC conceded that an expression by the purchaser to the vendor at the time of sale or transfer of an intention that the purchaser will use the land in a particular way cannot, standing alone, impose upon the purchaser an obligation so to use the land.

The evidence about the twenty lots other than the development consent credit land was as follows: * 86 William Street. This land belonged to the Bank of New South Wales. Part of it was sold to the Council on the conditions and in the circumstances described by Talbot J in the passage from his judgment which I have quoted.
 * 94 William Street. Part of this land was acquired on the basis that the vendor would make no further claim on the Council for compensation, providing access was guaranteed at all times from the car park to the residual area of the property. There was evidence of a Town Planner's recommendation that such a guarantee be given. * 96-98 William Street. According to the contract for the sale to the Council of part of this land, Lot 8, it was made pursuant to conditions imposed upon the vendors by the Council with respect to the Council's approval of a development application for the remaining property. The correspondence indicated that the Council had agreed to dedicate Lot 8 in an enclosed plan of sub-division to the Council for car parking purposes. * 84 William Street. This land was purchased by the Council from Esquire Mercers Pty Limited. A condition of the contract was that the Council undertake, after completion of the car park, to allocate three parking spaces on the land for the use of the employees of the shop. * 108 William Street. The Council wrote to the owners that it was understood that they would be prepared to convey to the Council the fee simple of the rear land of the premises for a nominal sum, so as to enable the Council to construct an off-street car park. The Council desired to expedite acquisition of the land which, when amalgamated with similar zoned adjoining lands and developed as a Council car park, would bring tangible benefits to their property.
 * 100 William Street. The Council wrote to the owners indicating its desire to acquire the rear of their land to be used as part of the car park, and requesting a conveyance of the fee simple in the land free of charge, or for a nominal sum, on the basis that the acquisition of land by the Council for its last car park was by negotiating with the majority of owners. "The consideration was only nominal in most instances, as the land was unimproved. Where improvements are existing they are naturally reflected in the valuation." * 82 and 80 William Street. Similar letters were written to the owners of these lots. The Council agreed that the acquisition of the land was conditional upon the Council giving a credit for a number of car parking spaces, and providing access to the premises from the William Street car park. * 92 William Street. A valuation was obtained for the rear land. The valuer considered the enhancement factor, which included car parking facilities at the rear of the property, off-set the apparent loss incurred through severing the back land, and recommended the Council purchase the land for a nominal sum of $100. * 76 William Street. There was evidence of proposals to resume part of the land to provide car park facilities. * 81 Bentinck Street. The Council resolved that, if it could not negotiate the purchase of this land or part of it, it was prepared to resume it to enable it to be exchanged for other land required for off-street car parking.
 * 91 Bentinck Street. In evidence was a letter from the Council to the Perpetual Trustee Company Limited, responding to a claim for compensation for land resumed for off-street car parking facilities.
 * Correspondence was in evidence from the solicitors for Southern Mitchell County Council that it had proceeded with the construction of an office building upon the express understanding that the car park would be completed, and minimum parking space made available to it by the Council.

From time to time, the Council wrote to the Commissioner of Stamp Duties confirming that parcels of land were being acquired for off-street car parking purposes, and not in connection with any trading undertaking within the meaning of the Local Government Act 1919.

I have examined the material to which counsel for PWC has taken us in support of the orders that his Honour made in relation to land other than the development consent credit land. This material does not appear to pertain to all the lots. However this may be, its variety points against the validity of a global approach to all the lots. In some cases, the vendors to the Council may have had contractual rights. But, in my opinion, on the material put in evidence, it was not open to his Honour to conclude that any of the land, other than the development consent credit land, was held by the Council on trust for a public purpose. At its highest, the material evidenced an expressed intention by the Council to use the land acquired for the purpose of establishing a car park, and suggested that sometimes the creation of the car park was a factor taken into account in determining the price. I am not satisfied that this evidence supports the conclusion that these lots were held for a public purpose.

CONCLUSIONS 
In the result, the Council's appeal succeeds in part, but PWC was entitled to succeed in part in the Land and Environment Court. In these circumstances, I think it appropriate that each party pay its own costs in the Land and Environment Court and in this Court.

ORDERS 
I propose the following orders:
Appeal allowed;
