JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex-parte for a restraining order which remains in force while there is an application pending for an order under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 14 July 2015. Mr Spark deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in serious crime related activity or activities, namely the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) . Both of those offences are serious criminal offences as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Mr Spark's suspicion is based chiefly on the reading of a facts sheet prepared in relation to the investigation and arrest of the Defendant. Mr Spark emailed the officer who prepared the facts sheet to obtain confirmation from him that he had in fact drafted the facts sheet, that to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief the contents of the facts sheet were true, and that the facts sheet was prepared based on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation set out in the facts sheet. The police officer concerned provided an email to Mr Spark containing affirmative answers to Mr Spark's question.
I have read the facts sheet and I am satisfied from the material contained in it that Mr Spark's suspicion of serious crime related activity is held on reasonable grounds. I am further satisfied under [s 10A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act that the Defendant is both domiciled in New South Wales and that the property sought to be restrained is in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made, if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred, I do not consider that the Defendant should be given notice of this application before an order is made. The Defendant has rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to a review of these orders.
I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given. I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 of the draft Order provided to me. I grant the leave contained in paragraph 4 and liberty is granted pursuant to paragraph 6 of those orders. The orders are to be entered forthwith.
