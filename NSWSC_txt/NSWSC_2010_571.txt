JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
FULLERTON J JUNE 2010 /14587 MARIA FOKAS versus DR JEFFREY STACK & ORS 
JUDGMENT HER HONOUR: By notices of motion dated 14 December 2009 and 15 December 2009 each of the four defendants to proceedings commenced by summons in this Court on 24 September 2009 seek a vexatious proceedings order under [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/index.html#p2) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) ("the Act"). The defendants, Drs Stack, Christou, Saadi and Lee practice as dental practitioners. At various times since 1991 the plaintiff has been a patient of each of the defendants.   The notices of motion were listed before me for hearing together with a notice of motion filed by the plaintiff on 23 November 2009 in which she sought various orders, both in respect of the proceedings commenced by summons in this Court and various of the proceedings that were commenced against the defendants in the District Court in 2007, 2008 and 2009 each of which have since been dismissed.
 The plaintiff cited her appearance in respect of her own notice of motion and that of the defendants.
 Given that the application for vexatious proceedings orders under the Act concerned both the proceedings in this Court and the various proceedings commenced by the plaintiff (and since dismissed) in the District Court, I resolved to hear and determine the plaintiff's notice of motion first. This was at the plaintiff's urging and with the concurrence of counsel for the defendants.
 The plaintiff relied upon an affidavit in support of the orders sought by motion. She also advanced oral submissions. I delivered an ex tempore judgment dismissing the motion whereupon the plaintiff collected her materials from the bar table and left the courtroom in a manner which clearly signalled her intention not to participate further in the proceedings.
 After satisfying myself that the plaintiff was properly served with the defendants' notices of motion in accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure
Rules (UCPR), I am of the view that she was made aware of the nature of the proceedings brought against her by the defendants under the [Vexatious
Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) and, accordingly, although I have not heard from her as to her attitude to the orders they seek, I am satisfied that she has been afforded the opportunity to be heard as provided for in [s (1)(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the Act.
 Each of the defendants has standing to bring an application under the Act if
I am satisfied, as provided for in [s (4)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html), in that they are each individuals against or in relation to whom another person has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings. A vexatious proceeding is defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s6.html) of the Act to include the following: proceedings that are an abuse of the process of a court or tribunal, and proceedings instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for another wrongful purpose, and proceedings instituted or pursued without reasonable ground, and proceedings conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose.
 On the present application, the defendants place particular reliance on paragraphs (a) and (c) of the definition, namely proceedings that are an abuse of process and/or were instituted or pursued without reasonable grounds. In so far as proceedings that are an abuse of the process (of either a court or tribunal) I am guided by the many examples in the authorities, usually in the context of an application under the UCPR to strike out the proceedings, where proceedings have been held to give rise to an abuse of process, in particular, the pursuit of proceedings that have no prospect of success; the pursuit of concurrent proceedings for substantially the same causes of action and the pursuit of proceedings involving the re-litigation of matters already determined in prior proceedings.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the Act provides that a vexatious proceedings order in relation to a person may be made where the Court is satisfied that the person has frequently instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in Australia. In undertaking that enquiry I am entitled, under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html), to have regard to the proceedings in any Australian court or tribunal, and orders made by any Australian court or tribunal (including proceedings instituted or conducted and orders made before the commencement of the section).
 The evidence relied upon by the defendants was voluminous, consisting of affidavits from the defendants' solicitors together with materials exhibited to those affidavits including a vast number of reported decisions. Although the defendants have narrowed the terms of the orders they seek, such as to prohibit the plaintiff only from instituting fresh proceedings involving any of them and/or making any application in any legal proceedings involving any of them without first obtaining leave under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) of the Act, it is still open to me to consider the vast number of cases between and 2008 either commenced by or involving the plaintiff (but not involving any of the defendants) in the Land and Environment Court, the Social
Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal
Court, this Court and the High Court. (A schedule of these decisions is attached to this judgment.) In each of the fourteen actions the decision was adverse to the plaintiff whether at first instance or on appeal. After close consideration of each of the decisions, the relevant portions of which have been conveniently summarised and analysed in Mr Sheldon's submissions, I am satisfied that the actions commenced by the plaintiff variously against Municipal Councils, State or Federal government departments or other instrumentalities may, at least on some occasions have been instituted on disclosed grounds, they were almost exclusively pursued unreasonably, in the sense of being as persevered or persisted with on appeal in the face of there being no proper basis to challenge the decision.  More significantly for the purposes of the present application were three sets of proceedings commenced against various of the defendants in the
District Court between October 2007 and May 2009. By October 2009 each of those proceedings were dismissed either as a result of a persistent or continuing failure on the part of the plaintiff to comply with the UCPR under the Court's direction or because it was ultimately determined to be "frivolous, vexatious and without a reasonable basis". In respect of instituting and pursuing each proceeding the plaintiff's conduct is demonstrative of a pattern of conduct where she persistently filed motions that were either incompetent or designed to challenge or seek leave to have set aside interlocutory decisions that issued for the orderly preparation and conduct of the proceedings. This conduct on the plaintiff's part is caught by the extended definition of both "proceedings" and "institute" in relation to proceedings in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/index.html#p1) of the Act.
 What follows is a chronology of the course of proceedings in the District
Court, including those matters to which I have referred, and the futile attempt to reinstate or revive the District Court proceedings in this Court to which my earlier judgment refers.

Proceedings 14587  May 2010 
Fullerton J dismissed motion to set aside the orders of Harrison AsJ and in respect of proceedings in the District Court  On the evidence tendered before me I am satisfied that the plaintiff has frequently instituted vexatious proceedings (in particular against each of the defendants in the District Court and more recently in this Court) such as to justify the orders sought by them. Although I have also come to the considered view that her conduct as a litigant in other proceedings set out in the attached schedule reflects a persistent, even a deliberate, failure to appreciate that the unwarranted usurpation of the Court's time and the resources of the court system is productive of waste and undermines the efficient dispatch of the business of courts and tribunals, the orders I make are in the limited terms that each of the defendants seek and not of wider application.
 Accordingly, the orders I make are as follows: 
The plaintiff is prohibited from instituting fresh proceedings in any court against any of the defendants without first obtaining leave under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) of the Act.
The plaintiff is prohibited from making any application in any legal proceedings involving any of the defendants without first obtaining leave under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) of the Act.
The plaintiff pay the defendants' costs as agreed or assessed of the defendants' motions and of the plaintiff's motion.
