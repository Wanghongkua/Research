JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a motion brought by a person who has made a claim under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) against an estate. The estate is of relatively humble size. The defendant executor has got leave to appear at the inquest of the deceased. The plaintiff fears that this will involve too much expenditure of money, so she seeks to restrain the defendant. The defendant has indicated, at least today, that he is not going to spend much money on the inquest unless he gets Legal Aid and if he does get Legal Aid, he will no doubt get advice. 
As far as I am aware, no judge has ever made an order at the suit of an applicant under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) to restrain proper expenditure of estate monies. Prima facie the law gives the executor the right to decide what are proper expenses in the estate and if the executor is wrong then the beneficiaries of accounts taken in probate can object. If, whenever an executor proposes to make some expenditure, he can be challenged in court by any beneficiary or potential beneficiary, relatively small estates, particularly, will get out of hand. The practice of repeated challenges to executors by claimants has to cease. It is proper to discourage the practice by making the order for costs, that the plaintiff pay the costs of the notice of motion, which is dismissed. Those costs to be assessed and taxed forthwith.

I will have the papers noted that it may well be that in due course, this matter should be transferred as a small claim to the District Court.
