McINERNEY AJ /1998: TOUFIK OMAR-v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS.

JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The Plaintiff by way of summons seeks declarations in the following terms: ) A declaration that, when the second Defendant convicted the Plaintiff on th March 1998, at Bidura Children's Court of offences pursuant to ss.154A and s.527C [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) and [s.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s4.html) and s.6 of Traffic Act 1909, those convictions were invalid and seeks an order that the convictions be quashed.
 On 29th December 1997 the Plaintiff was arrested and charged at Mascot
Police Station with offences pursuant to ss154A and 527 C of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) (Illegal use of motor vehicle and goods in custody) [ss (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s4.html) & 6(1) (a) of the Traffic Act 1909,( driving in a manner dangerous and unlicensed driver). He was initially refused bail, but conditional bail was granted at the Police Station on 30th December 1997. He signed a bail undertaking to attend Bidura Children's' Court on 20th January 1998.
 On 20th January 1998 at Bidura Children's' Court the Plaintiff did not appear and Mr. Scarlett, S.C.M. adjourned the matters to 18th February 1998.
The bench papers indicate the purpose of the adjournment was ex P. Bail was continued and the papers were marked R to N.(Registry to notify).
 A notice of continuance of bail addressed to the Plaintiff at his home address notifying him of the adjourned date was signed by a prescribed officer, certified that this form was given to the child "by delivering it to the person personally", the Clerk of the Local Court also signed a notice of adjournment addressed to him at his home address.
 On 18th February 1998 the Plaintiff did not appear, and the matter was adjourned to 11th March 1998. A notice of a continuance of bail was sent to the Plaintiff at his home address notifying him that the matter was adjourned to that date. A notice of adjournment, addressed to the Plaintiff at his home address was also signed by the Clerk of the Local Court.
 On 11th March 1998 the Plaintiff did not appear, the second Defendant, a
Children's Court Magistrate, heard the matter, on that day, he found the offences proved beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the Plaintiff and ordered s.80 AA warrants to issue for the arrest of the Plaintiff. On 22nd
September the Plaintiff applied for an annulment of the convictions under s100A of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) on the basis that he was not notified of the adjourned date. That application was dismissed, the Magistrate taking the view that the convictions were not pursuant to [ss.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html), [75A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html), [75B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html) or [76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).
 Prior to amendments which commenced in August 1998 the power of a Magistrate to hear a matter ex parte was governed by [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html),[75A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html), [75B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html) and 76 of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). The
Justice Act applies to criminal proceedings before the Children's' Court subject to Part 2 of the Children's ( Criminal Proceedings ) Act,1987, the rules of the Children's' Court s. 27.2 of the Children's (Criminal
Proceedings) Act, there is nothing in the rules or Part 2 of this Act which prohibits a Children's' Court Magistrate from hearing a matter ex parte.
 S.12.1 of the Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act provides that the nature of any allegations and the facts that must be established before a child can be guilty, are to be explained to the child. Subsection 2 provides that until those matters are explained to the child the Court shall not proceed further, however, s.12.2A provides if (a) the child fails, apparently without reasonable excuse, to appear in criminal proceedings or before the Court and (b) those matters have not been explained to the child, subsection (2) does not, in the child's absence, prevent the Court from proceeding further.
 S.75 and 75A of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) , as they then were, applied only where a summons or attendance notice had been issued, [s.75B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html) only applied to prosecutions of the Public Service Act or other prescribed
Acts. However, s.76.(1) applies to the hearing of information's and complaints. This section gives a power to Magistrates to hear or further hear a matter in the absence of either or both of the parties, if the matter has been adjourned.
 Information may be in any form as long as it is sufficiently states the offence the laying of the information invests a Magistrate with jurisdiction, it is not necessary for the existence of jurisdiction of the person charged to be present when that information is laid, see ex-parte Walker; Re
Goodfellow,(1944),45SR 103 at 106/108 Young -v- Kenny & Ors SC unrep. 1992 Abadee J.  The Plaintiff was charged by the Police on 27th December 1997 the information's were laid 20th January 1998 when these charge sheets were placed before the Magistrate in the Children's Court, the Magistrate was invested with jurisdiction and the power to adjourn the matters, once the matters had been adjourned the second Defendant had power to hear the matters ex-parte and proceed to conviction, R-v-Hodder,(1988) 33A Crim R 295. There was material before the second Defendant to indicate the Plaintiff had been notified of the adjourned date, he had power under s.76 to hear and determine the matters and he had a discretion to record convictions as the
Plaintiff was over 16 years of age, s. 14.1(b) of the Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act, therefore it is submitted the convictions are valid.
 The learned Magistrate before whom an application was made pursuant to s.100(A) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) for an application to annul the convictions under that section came to the conclusion for some reason not really clear to me to conclude that she had no power to do so [s.100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100.html) is in the following terms: 
Subject to this section, application may be made by or on behalf of any person ( in this part referred to as the applicant): (a) against whom, in his absence, a conviction has been made upon the hearing and determination of his case under [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html),[75A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html) or 76 or (b) - for the annulment of that conviction or penalty.
 It appears the learned Magistrate having concluded that she had no power dismissed the application. The matter now comes before me by the Plaintiff to seek a declaration in the terms that the convictions recorded are invalid.
 [S.76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) of the Act as it then was has been subject to consideration by the Court of
Criminal Appeal in R-v-Hodder, (1988) 33 A Crim R at 295. In that case it was held that as a matter of construction of the relevant provisions in the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) NSW [ss.74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s74.html), [75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html), [75A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html),[76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html), permitted the Magistrate to convict and sentence in the absence of the
Defendant. The Court held to construe 76 in that way does not import any risk of injustice in as much as the hearing from which the adjournment arose would have in itself have been a validity constituted hearing, either with the
Defendant present or else with proof of service having been presented.

Street CJ said at 298: "The specific phrase in [s.76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) authorising the Court to proceed with the hearing as if such party or parties were present appears to me to confer on the Court all the powers available to it, if the parties were present at the hearing including the power to convict and to sentence." Attached to an affidavit of Mr. Peter Bruckner, the Plaintiff's solicitor is a copy of the transcript of the proceedings before Children's Court
Magistrate J.A. Huber, I must say that I have had some difficulty in understanding exactly and why it was that Her Worship came to the conclusion that she did not have power to deal with these matters. Her Worship noted it was an ex parte hearing : "Which she said which isn't a 75 application", and then she said: "I don't have the power", the reference was made to [s.75B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html).
 The learned Magistrate in argument referred to the application as being an ex parte hearing, which she said: "Isn't a [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html) application." Mr. Bruckner who then appeared for the Plaintiff, stated the determination was made pursuant to [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html), which the learned Magistrate replied, that section was based upon a summons or attendance notice, noting that he was refused bail and then entered bail, (see
T.6), then for some reason the Police Prosecutor seemed to accept that the matter was governed by the provisions of [s.75.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html) The Police Prosecutor in argument referred to [s.100A(3)(b](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s100a.html)) which enabled a Magistrate to annul a conviction or penalty where the hearing of the information was adjourned because the Defendant would not have been aware of the adjourned date. The learned Magistrate accepted that provision enabled her to deal with the matter. She recognised she had the power to annul the convictions, she recognised she only has the power to annul the convictions if the convictions falls within sections 75,75A,75B and . She then referred to the provisions of s.80AAA, which forbids an order that a person be imprisoned unless that person was present at the time the order of imprisonment was made.
 The transcript of the proceedings in the Children's Court before Mr.
Lalley, SM, are annexed to the affidavit of Ms. Scheepers, (28.05.99). It appears whilst His Worship recorded convictions on each of the matters, he did not proceed to make an order for imprisonment, and authorise the issue of s.80AA warrant for the apprehension of the Plaintiff for the purpose of sentencing.
 The learned Magistrate in the present matter concluded because it was a s.80AA matter, that she did not have the power to deal with the application then before the Court, and went on to say he was not convicted by means of [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html).
As I have stated previously, the Police Prosecutor appeared to agree with that statement. His Worship noted the various charges which he referred to, related to s.80AA, and then went on to say that these matters were all dealt with in the Plaintiff's absence and they do not fall within [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html).
She then dismissed the application.
 It is not disputed between the parties that a summons or attendance notice had not been served on the Plaintiff and therefore [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html) did not apply. S.76, however, applies to hearings of information's and complaints and enables a Magistrate power to hear a matter in the absence of either party.
 There was no reason, therefore, to prevent the original Magistrate from hearing and determining in the action in the absence of the Defendant, I see no valid reason why pursuant to s.100AA(3)(b) to have prevented the
Magistrate from hearing the application based on the Plaintiff being unaware of the adjourned date. In my view the learned Magistrate was in error in determining she had no such power.
 It is now submitted that in the light of that decision it would be an abuse of process for the first Defendant to argue that the convictions were pursuant to either [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75.html),[75A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75a.html),[75B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s75b.html) or 76 of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). It is submitted that would involve re-litigation of an issue already decided. The authority quoted is Rogers -v- The Queen, (1994)181 CLR 251. That was a case that related to records of interview or other records of interview made at the same time that had previously been held by a Court to be involuntary or not, on the base of that judgment it is submitted that Her Worship's finding was a final determination and consequently that an argument should not be allowed in this respect, on the basis of res judicata or issue estoppel.
 I cannot accept that submission, the question here to be determined is whether the local Magistrate, who originally dealt with the matter ex parte, was exercising a jurisdiction conferred by [s.76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). The conclusion reached by Magistrate Huber relates to a possible error of law, in my view there is nothing to prevent the Plaintiff from seeking an order of this Court correcting that error. In my view there is no basis for the submission, it is not necessary in these circumstances to consider in detail the ambert of raised res judicata and issue estoppel. In my view it was clear that the section that the matter was dealt with pursuant to [s.76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) and I cannot understand why that was overlooked by the Magistrate in her determining that she had no power.
 Alternatively it is submitted the convictions were not pursuant to [s.76](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html), no oral argument was addressed to this matter, it only arose when the
Plaintiff's Counsel volunteered that he would make written submissions. If it was being relied on, I should have had oral submissions on the matter.
 It is now submitted, however, that pursuant to [s.76(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html), that the proceedings must be determined on the date in which they were adjourned. It is submitted that under those circumstances the local Court does not have the power to adjourn the matter for ex parte hearings and thus the convictions are ultra vires.
 The Defendants submits whilst it is conceded that the papers were marked ex
P. by Scarlett SM on 20th January 1998, it was also noted that the Plaintiff's bail was to continue and the Registry was to notify the Plaintiff of the adjourned date. A notice of continuance of bail was served on the Plaintiff and a notice of adjournment addressed to the Plaintiff at his home address was completed by the clerk of the local Court. A similar procedure was carried out on the adjournment of 18th February 1998.
 Quite clearly the purpose of the adjournment was to notify the Plaintiff of the date for hearing of the matter and had he attended Court the matter could be heard in his presence. When the matter was called on, the Plaintiff's name was called outside the Court, and that being the case, there was no expectation the matter would proceed automatically in his absence.
 In my view, in the circumstances, the second Defendant had the power under [s.76(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s76.html) to deal with the matter, in those circumstances a summons will be dismissed.
