CRIMINAL LIST 
JOHNSON J July 2007 /93 Regina (Cth) versus Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias (No. 23) 
JUDGMENT (On further claim of Client Legal Privilege arising from
Subpoena directed to Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions - see T1067) JOHNSON J: On 29 June 2007, I published my reasons for upholding a claim of client legal privilege arising from a subpoena directed to the Commonwealth
Director of Public Prosecutions ("CDPP"): R (Cth) versus Petroulias (No. 22) <case> In that judgment, I considered a claim of privilege with respect to a group of documents, being notes taken during conferences in 2007 between counsel and/or CDPP solicitors and fourteen nominated Crown witnesses (MFI11).
 As I observed in that judgment at [7] and [79], it remained necessary for the CDPP to produce all documents caught by the subpoena, in addition to the conference notes contained in MFI11. I have been provided with copies of conference notes pre-dating 2007 which are caught by the subpoena (MFI27). In support of the claim of client legal privilege, an affidavit of Karen
Wildermoth sworn 5 July 2007 (MFI26) has been read. Ms Wildermoth was not required for cross-examination.
 The conference notes contained in MFI27 relate to conferences with each of the fourteen nominated persons referred to in the subpoena. In her affidavit,
Ms Wildermoth states that the conference notes record communications for the dominant purpose of a pending Australian proceeding within the meaning of [s.119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and that a claim of client legal privilege is made in relation to the conference notes.
 Ms Wildermoth states that she assumed carriage of the prosecution of the
Accused in about mid-November 2006. Before then and since March 2001, the CDPP instructing solicitor was Ms Caroline Dobraszczyk. Ms Wildermoth states, on information and belief from Ms Dobraszczyk, that the conference notes sought in the subpoena were previously reviewed pursuant to the CDPP "Statement of
Prosecution Disclosure" and found not to contain any material coming within that Statement. It was therefore decided that there was no requirement for disclosure of that material to the defence.
 In R (Cth) versus Petroulias (No. 22), I outlined the submissions made with respect to the privilege claim for the documents in MFI11. I expressed my conclusions with respect to the matters falling for determination.
 After publishing my reasons on 29 June 2007, I observed that counsel for the Accused may consider whether any issue arises with respect to any further class of documents produced in answer to the subpoena, given that the process of production in answer to the subpoena had not been completed (T692). When the documents in MFI27 were produced to the Court, I inquired whether there was any further submission from the Accused on the question of waiver with respect to those documents. Mr Sutherland SC stated that no further submission was to be made, in view of my judgment in R (Cth) versus Petroulias (No. 22) .
 Accordingly, counsel for the Accused were content to leave the resolution of the present claim, including any question of waiver, to the general submissions advanced on 21 and 22 June 2007.
 I have adopted the same approach to that taken with respect to the documents in MFI11. I have inspected the documents in MFI27 for the purpose of determining whether they are conference notes falling within the subpoena. In addition to my own inspection of the documents, I have had regard to the affidavit of Ms Wildermoth with respect to their purpose.
 I am satisfied that client legal privilege attaches to the documents contained within MFI27. I reach this conclusion by application of [s.119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), although the same result would flow from application of common law principles. It has not been demonstrated that privilege has been waived in accordance with [s.122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) or by application of relevant common law principles.
 I propose to uphold the claim of client legal privilege with respect to the documents contained in MFI27.
 In R (Cth) versus Petroulias (No. 22) at [78], I noted that prosecuting counsel undertook to examine conference notes produced in answer to the subpoena for the purpose of determining expressly whether any material contained in those notes ought be disclosed to the Accused pursuant to the
CDPP's duty of disclosure. Prosecuting counsel has informed me that this task has been completed with respect to the documents contained in MFI11 and MFI27.
Prosecuting counsel has stated that, having discharged that responsibility, there is no material contained in the notes which ought be disclosed in accordance with that duty (T1065). I have no doubt that counsel approached that task with an understanding of the duties and responsibilities of prosecuting counsel in a criminal trial: Subramaniam versus The Queen [(2004) 79
ALJR 116] at 127 - 128; <case>.
 With respect to the documents contained within MFI27, I uphold the claim for client legal privilege. I decline the Accused's application to inspect the documents.
