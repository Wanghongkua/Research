JUDGMENT 
INTRODUCTION
The proceedings before the Court are the latest round in recurrent litigation concerning a child I will identify by the pseudonym "Ellen" to mark out a new phase of the litigation. She has been known by various other pseudonyms from time to time: Louise versus Director General of Community Services <case>; Re Felicity  <case>; Director General, Family and Community Services Re Felicity <case>; Re Felicity <case>; Director General of the Department of Family and Community Services versus Amy Robinson Peters [2012] NSWChC 3.
The litigation has occupied the attention of the Children's Court of NSW, the District Court of NSW, the Equity Division and the Court of Appeal.
By a summons filed in the Equity Division on 4 September 2013, the plaintiff (the mother of Ellen) seeks both interim and final relief relating to other proceedings (in the District Court, on appeal from the Children's Court pursuant to [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s91.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/) NSW, and in the Children's Court) affecting the child.

CONTEXT
Ellen (who was born in 2003) has been living with her father since 2006. It is common ground that she is settled there.
The contest that has absorbed attention is confined to the question whether the plaintiff should have unsupervised contact with the child.
Ellen's father, her Independent Legal Representative and the Director General all agree that, as Ellen's mother, the plaintiff should have contact with the child, in Ellen's best interests. However, they are not prepared to agree to anything other than contact on a supervised basis and the plaintiff is not prepared to accept supervised contact.
In 2009 the Children's Court made final Care Orders under [Part 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/index.html#p2) of Chapter 5 of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/), including: 
An Order under <case>(b) of the Act that parental responsibility for
Ellen be allocated to the Minister for Community Services until she attained the age of eight years.

An Order under <case>(b) of the Act that parental responsibility for contact be allocated solely to the Minister until Ellen attained the age of eight years.

An Order under <case>(a) of the Act that parental responsibility for all aspects except contact be allocated to the father until Ellen attained the age of eight years.

An Order pursuant to <case>(a)(i), that, upon the expiry of the first three orders, Ellen be placed under the parental responsibility of her father until she attains the age of 18 years.
Incorporated in the Children's Court's formal "Minute of Care Order" was a notation that has subsequently caused controversy. It is the fourth of four notations and bears the designation "Notation D".
It is to the following effect: "[Note] that upon the child attaining the age of eight (8) years ... the contact [between mother and child] move to an unsupervised arrangement and occur at a frequency and for a duration based on the child's expressed wishes".
Since Ellen turned eight years of age in 2011 her mother (the present plaintiff) has been engaged in forensic battles designed to secure contact with Ellen on an unsupervised basis, relying largely on Notation D.
The father, the Director General and Ellen's Independent Legal Representative have lined up against her, thus far successfully.
In 2012 the Director General made an application to the Children's Court, pursuant to [s 90](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/), for leave to apply, under that section, for a variation of the 2009 Care Orders, limited to the question of contact.
The Director General's foreshadowed application for a variation was designed to secure an order that Ellen be placed under the parental responsibility of the Minister, as to contact only, until she attains the age of 18 years, with all other aspects of parental responsibility to be retained by the father.
On 17 September 2012 the Children's Court granted the Director General leave to apply for a variation of the 2009 orders, and made interim orders for parental responsibility for Ellen to be shared between the Minister and the father until further order.
Although the plaintiff subsequently (in the District Court) withdrew her consent to a grant of leave to the Director General, on 17 September 2012 she consented to such a grant.
The Director General's [s 90](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html) application for variation of the 2009 orders was heard, by a children's magistrate, on 2-4 April 2013 and determined by final orders made on 26 April 2013.
By those orders, the Children's Court ordered that all previous Care Orders be discharged and made fresh Care Orders, including orders to the following effect: 
An order, pursuant to [s (1)(a)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s79.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/), that
Ellen be placed under the shared parental responsibility of the Minister of
Family and Community Services and the father until she attains the age of 14 years, such parental responsibility to be exercised as follows: (i) pursuant to [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s81.html) of the Act, that parental responsibility for contact be allocated solely to the Minister until Ellen attains the age of 14 years.
 (ii) pursuant to [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s81.html) of the Act, all other aspects of parental responsibility be allocated to the father until Ellen attains the age of 14 years.

An order, pursuant to [s (1)(a)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s79.html) of the Act that, upon the expiration of that order, Ellen be placed under the sole parental responsibility of the father to the exclusion of the mother [the present plaintiff] until Ellen attains the age of 18 years.
On 29 April 2013 the mother (the plaintiff in this Court) commenced proceedings in the District Court by way of an appeal to that court, pursuant to [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s91.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/), against: the order made by the Children's Court on 17 September 2012 that the
Director General be granted leave, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html) of the Act, to apply for a variation of the 2009 Care Orders; and the orders made by the Children's Court on 26 April 2013, on the
Director General's application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html), for variation of the 2009 Care Orders.
By virtue of [s 91(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s91.html) of the Act, an appeal under [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s91.html) does not affect the operation of the order appealed against or prevent the taking of action to implement that order.
Consequentially, unless and until set aside, the orders made by the Children's Court on 26 April 2013 continue to be operative.
An appeal under [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s91.html) is determined by the District Court by way of a new hearing, not constrained by a need for the appellant to demonstrate error in an order under appeal.
The District Court has evidently determined to hear the plaintiff's appeal to it in two stages: the first dealing with whether the Director General should be granted leave to apply for a variation of the 2009 Care Orders; the second, dependent on a grant of leave, dealing with the Director General's substantive application for variation of the 2009 orders.
On 7 August 2013 a judge of the District Court determined that the Director General's application for leave be granted.
The Director General's substantive application for variation of the 2009 Care Orders, required to be the subject of a new hearing by reason of [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s91.html), is listed for hearing by the District Court on 18 November 2013 and ensuing days.

THE PLAINTIFF'S APPLICATION FOR FINAL RELIEF
By the summons filed in this Court, the plaintiff seeks final relief to the following effect: 
A declaration that the legal effect of the 2009 Care Orders, incorporating Notation D, is that, Ellen having attained eight years of age, there is no need for the plaintiff's contact with her to be supervised.

A declaration that the Director General's applications to the Children's
Court under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/s90.html) of the [Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caypapa1998442/), for a grant of leave and for a variation of the 2009 Care Orders, is an impermissible attempt to re-litigate the Children's Court's determination of that contact between the plaintiff and Ellen should move to an unsupervised arrangement.

An order (pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) NSW), in the nature of a Writ for Certiorari, that the decision made by the District
Court on 7 August 2013 (that the Director General be granted leave to make an application for variation of the 2009 Care Orders) be quashed.

Orders (pursuant to [s69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/)), in the nature of a Writ for Certiorari, that the following decisions of the
Children's Court be quashed: (i) the decision of 17 September 2012 that the Director General be granted leave to apply for a variation of the 2009 Care Orders; (ii) the decision of 26 April 2013 that the 2009 Care Orders be varied; and (iii) a decision made on 17 July 2013 that the plaintiff mother pay costs of the father associated with those two decisions.
The plaintiff contends that the District Court decision of 7 August 2013 is based on an error of law, on the face of the record, because: at pp 6-7 of the Court's Reasons for Judgment, the presiding judge found that "the absence of an order for contact since [Ellen turned eight on]
November 2011 is a significant change in a relevant [circumstance]".
 the absence of an order for contact cannot, in the context of the 2009
Care Orders and Notation D, be characterised as a "significant change in any relevant circumstances since the Care Order was made or last varied" within the meaning of <case>.
 it was not open to the Court, consistently with <case>, to find that "the absence of an order for contact since November 2011" is, of itself, a significant change in a relevant circumstance as contemplated by <case>.
I leave aside, for the moment, the fact that the passage of the District Court judgment the subject of the plaintiff's criticism needs to be read in the context of a judgment that, before and after the extracted passage, considers a broader range of <case> factors.

THE PLAINTIFF'S APPLICATION FOR INTERIM RELIEF
By her summons, the plaintiff applies for an order that the proceedings pending in the District Court be stayed until determination of her application for final relief.
In short, more particularly, she seeks to have the proceedings presently listed before the District Court for hearing on 18 November 2013 stayed.
She seeks, by such means, to persuade this Court that: the Care Orders made by the Children's Court in 2009 subsist; the orders made by the Children's Court (on 26 April 2013) purporting to discharge those orders and to make fresh orders are invalid; and the order made by the District Court, on appeal from the Children's
Court, for the Director General to have leave to apply for a variation of the Care Orders is also invalid.

THE RESPONSES OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL, THE FATHER AND THE CHILD'S INDEPENDENT LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE
The Director General contends (and both Ellen's Independent Legal Representative and her father support the Director General's contention) that: the plaintiff's application for a stay of the District Court proceedings should be dismissed.

Because the plaintiff seeks an order, by way of judicial review, that an order of the District Court be quashed, the proceedings in this Court should be removed into the Court of Appeal, to which such business is assigned by the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s48.html) 
Directions should be given requiring the plaintiff to comply with the requirements of rules 59.3 and 59.4 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) NSW, and to apply (pursuant to UCPR r 59.10) for an extension of time within which to apply for orders quashing the decisions made by the Children's Court on 17
September 2012 and 26 April 2013.
In aid of these contentions the Director General submits that, in accordance with established precedent (Boral Gas Pty Limited versus Magill <case> per Barrett JA.
Although the plaintiff's application for judicial review of a decision of the District Court is assigned, by [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s48.html), to the Court of Appeal, the Director General contends that it would be open to me as a Divisional judge to dismiss the stay application or, indeed, otherwise to deal with the application generally. That is because any step taken, order made, judgment given or other thing done in any proceedings in any Division of the Supreme Court (including the Court of Appeal) is as valid in every way as if taken, made, given or done in the Division to which the proceedings are assigned by the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) or the Supreme Court Rules: [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) [ss 38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s38.html), [40](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s40.html), [51](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s51.html), [54](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s54.html), [55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s55.html); Registrar, Court of Appeal versus Collins [[1982] 1 NSWLR 682] at 9F and 20D-E.

CONSIDERATION
In my opinion, the contentions advanced by the Director General are, in substance, correct.
However, it is not necessary for me to dismiss the plaintiff's application for a stay of the District Court proceedings and, in deference to [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s48.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), I do not do so. It is sufficient for me, simply, to refuse to grant a stay.
I make that decision for three reasons.
First, having regard to the assignment of business within the Supreme Court governed by [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s48.html), it would not be appropriate for me as a Divisional judge, in the absence of necessity, to entertain an application for judicial review of the order made by the District Court on 7 August 2013 or to order that the District Court proceedings be stayed pending consideration of an application for judicial review by the Court of Appeal.
Secondly, independently of considerations of that character, I am in any event disinclined to order that the District Court proceedings be stayed at this stage.
That disinclination is based on an opinion that, absent exceptional circumstances, the Court should not interfere with ordinary appeal processes laid down by statute: Re Allegra  <case> at <case>- <case>.
I am not satisfied that the present circumstances are sufficiently exceptional to justify interference with the District Court's deliberations, especially as that Court has allocated time to hear the plaintiff's [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s91.html) appeal "on the merits" within the next month and, if the plaintiff is ultimately correct in her challenge to decisions of the District Court, the Court of Appeal can intervene at that time.
Thirdly, as a variation of the same point, recognition needs to be given to the fact that the order of the District Court presently under challenge (that is, the order of 7 August 2013) is, in character, an interlocutory order, on a question of practice and procedure, not a final judgment.
A general policy applied in appellate courts, and not inapplicable to judicial review proceedings, is to hasten slowly in the conduct of review proceedings referable to primary decisions of that character: Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Limited versus Phillip Morris Incorporated <case>; [(1981) 148 CLR 170] at 177.
I record the second and third of these reasons for such, if any, assistance they may afford the Court of Appeal in the event that the plaintiff agitates her application for a stay in the Court of Appeal.
In any event, should the plaintiff persist in proceedings for judicial review, she should comply with the requirements of UCPR, [Part 59](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p59), governing such proceedings.
Having regard to [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s48.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), the proceedings should be removed into the Court of Appeal to permit the Court of Appeal to become seized of the plaintiff's application for judicial review of the District Court's decision of 7 August 2013, and any ancillary decisions leading to the further conduct of those proceedings.
I propose to order that, at this stage, the whole of the proceedings be removed into the Court of Appeal, rather than only that part of the proceedings relating to the District Court proceedings, because there appears to be no present utility in fragmenting the proceedings.
I anticipate, however, that, once the plaintiff's claim for judicial review relief relating to the District Court proceedings comes within the control of the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal may decide to remit the proceedings, in whole or part, to the Equity Division. That is a decision within the province of the Court of Appeal to make, or not, as it sees fit.

ORDERS
I make the following orders: 
Order that the plaintiff's application for a stay of the proceedings numbered 131697 of 2013 in the District Court of NSW be refused.

Order, subject to any order that might be made by the Court of Appeal or a Divisional judge, that these proceedings be removed into the Court of
Appeal.

Order that the plaintiff be granted leave to file an amended summons for the purpose of complying with [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p59) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) NSW.

Order that any amended summons filed by the plaintiff pursuant to that grant of leave be filed no later than 5 November 2013.

Order that the plaintiff pay the costs of these proceedings to date.
I have expressed the second of these orders as being subject to any order that might be made by the Court of Appeal in deference to the possibility that the Court of Appeal may, in the regulation of its own business, decide that the plaintiff's applications for relief should, in whole or part, be determined in the Equity Division in the first instance.
