JURY TRIAL - Contributory Negligence - Whether sufficient evidence of contributory negligence for issue to be left to jury - whether jury entitled to make finding on evidence 
APPEAL AND NEW TRIAL - Grounds for - Whether trial judge failed to discharge jury after expiration of statutory time limit for deliberation upon verdict.

The first respondent sustained injuries in the course of his employment as a strapper with the appellant horse-trainer. The appellant had requested the first respondent to ride an ex-trotter around one of the training tracks at
Rosehill Racetrack, in the course of which the first respondent lost control of the horse and injured his left knee. By jury verdict, the respondent was awarded damages for those injuries, however the award was reduced by 20% for contributory negligence on the part of the respondent.

On 22 September 1992, during the hearing, following the trial judge's summing up, Smart J issued the jury of four with a list of nine questions to consider.
The jury, after indicating that they could not reach agreement on answers to the questions, were permitted to separate for the day. The jury was retired for about 2 hours. The following day, 23 September 1992, at 11.06 am, the trial judge directed the jury to consider a list of verdicts which he had given them. At 3.21 pm that day, the trial judge recalled the jury and informed them that it was possible to take their verdict or to accept the decision of 3 out of 4 of them as the verdict under [s57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s57.html) [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/). At 3.34 pm, the trial judge took the jury's majority verdict.

The appellant submitted that the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) [Jury Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) are mandatory, and that as the jury had retired to consider its verdict for more than six hours, the trial judge should have discharged the jury and order a new trial.

The first respondent cross-appealed against the finding of contributory negligence, on the basis that there was no evidence of contributory negligence such as to warrant leaving that issue to the jury, or alternatively, that the jury's verdict was excessive.

HELD: (1) In considering questions, the jury was not deliberating upon its verdict, and time under [s58(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) had not started to run: Morosi versus Mirror Newspapers Ltd [[1977] 2 NSWLR 749] applied.. As the jury was not charged with considering its verdict until 11.06am on 23 September 1992, it was retired for only slightly longer than 4 hours. The trial judge was required to accept, pursuant to [s57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s57.html) [Jury Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/), the agreement of 3 out of 4 jurors as the verdict of all.

The difference in wording between [ss. 57](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s57.html) and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) of the [Jury Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) and s. 66 of the Jury Act 1912 involves no substantive change in the law. Both sections apply to the circumstance where the jury is out of the court room and considering its verdict. (Obiter) The phrase "for more than six hours" does not refer to any time beyond six hours. After a jury has been retired for six hours, the trial judge must reassemble the court. If the jury has not decided upon a unanimous verdict or a verdict under s57, the jury must be discharged. (Obiter) Even if a verdict is taken in circumstances inconsistent with the requirements of s. 58, the verdict is not a nullity.

There was evidence capable of supporting the allegations of contributory negligence which were left to the jury.

The jury's apportionment of contributory negligence was not one against which the evidence preponderated so strongly that it should not stand: Calin v Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 33] at 41 applied.

Cross-appeal dismissed with costs 
JUDGMENT 
MAHONEY P: The plaintiff was employed by the defendant-appellant Mr Sutherland in Mr Sutherland's racing stables. The plaintiff was, inter alia, to learn to ride horses. Mr Sutherland sent the plaintiff to ride a horse on a race track controlled by the Sydney Turf Club ("STC"). While he was riding the horse, it veered near a gate and the plaintiff was injured. The plaintiff sued Mr Sutherland and the STC in negligence. His case was heard before Smart J and a jury of four. At the end of a trial lasting some 18 days, the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff against Mr Sutherland. It found the plaintiff to have been guilty of contributory negligence and assessed his contribution at twenty per cent. Judgment was entered for $367,000. The jury found STC not negligent.

Mr Sutherland has appealed to this Court against the judgment. His submission has been: that the jury deliberated for more than six hours before arriving at their verdict; that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) of the [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) requires that, after six hours, the jury should have been discharged; that accordingly the verdict and judgment were null and void or at least there should be a new trial; and that the new trial should involve both defendants, Mr Sutherland and STC.

The plaintiff has cross-appealed in respect of contributory negligence: he has submitted: that there was no evidence of contributory negligence to go to the jury; and (if there was) the assessment of his contributory negligence at twenty per cent was appealably wrong.

I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Beazley JA. Her Honour's statement of the facts enables me to go to the two main points at issue in the appeal to which I shall refer, for brevity, as the jury point and the contributory negligence point.
THE JURY POINT: 
In order to understand this point, it is necessary to determine two things: what happened at the trial; and the operation of the [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/).

The trial: 
At the end of the addresses, the trial judge Smart J did not ask the jury to consider a verdict. He posed questions for them to answer and asked that they answer those questions. I infer that his Honour did this having regard to what had been decided by this Court in Morosi versus Mirror Newspapers Ltd [[1977] 2
NSWLR 749.] As appears from what he is recorded to have said, he was of the opinion that that case held that, while a jury was considering questions and not verdicts, the time that it took was not to be taken into account for the purposes of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s57.html) and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/).

The jury considered these questions for (as it is agreed) about two hours. It then notified the judge that there was no chance of it giving a unanimous answer to any of the questions. After some discussion the judge released the jury for the day.

On the following day the Court resumed at 10 o'clock. The judge then gave further directions to the jury and then directed them to consider their "verdicts". They retired at approximately 11.06 am.

At approximately 3.23 pm the jury was brought back and his Honour informed them that he was entitled, four hours having elapsed, to take a majority verdict. The jury indicated that it was in a position to give majority verdicts. The jury adjourned briefly and at 3.34 pm returned and gave majority verdicts. The jury was then discharged.

The judge, after making relevant adjustments, entered judgment for $354,145.
 [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/), ss 57and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html): 
The judge acted upon the basis that, for the purposes of these sections, the jury had deliberated only for four hours or somewhat more. On this basis he was entitled, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s57.html), to receive majority verdicts.

Mr Sutherland has submitted that the jury deliberated not for approximately four hours but for over six hours. That submission was based, and based only, upon the contention that the two hours deliberation of the previous day were to be counted in determining the period for which the jury had deliberated within [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html)
Relevantly, no other points were taken in this regard: Mr Donohoe QC, for Mr
Sutherland, made clear that having regard to the course taken at the trial his submissions were so confined. He indicated that he did not seek to argue that the relevant conclusions of this Court in Morosi were incorrect; the argument proceeded upon the basis that they were correct. But, he submitted,
Morosi was decided under the Jury Act 1912 and should accordingly be distinguished: it did not, he submitted, apply to ss 57 and 58 of the 1977
Act.

As Mr Cassidy QC, for STC, pointed out, the argument for Mr Sutherland involved: that Morosi did not require that the two hour period of the first day not be taken into account; that (if that two hour period should be taken into account) the judgment of the Court was null and void; and that, the judgment being null and void, there must be a new trial.

Morosi held that the time spent by a jury in considering questions was not to be taken into account for the relevant sections of the Jury Act 1912. If that be correct, I see no reason why the same principle should not be applicable for the purposes of ss 57 and 58 of the 1977 Act. Mr Donohoe QC, who put his submissions with appropriate clarity and brevity, relied I think essentially upon the use in the 1912 Act of "deliberate". The suggestion was, or involved, that a jury, when considering questions, does not deliberate; that it deliberates only when considering its verdict. I do not see this as an appropriate distinction. If the decision in Morosi is to be accepted - and it has stood as an explanation of the practice in this State since 1977 - I think it is applicable to the 1977 Act. It was suggested or inferred in argument that, if this be so, the statutory limits placed upon the deliberations of civil juries may readily be defeated. I do not think that it should be assumed that a judge would ask the jury to consider questions rather than verdicts for the purpose of avoiding the time limits imposed by the statute. If a judge sees fit to direct a jury to consider questions rather than verdicts, he will do so because the dictates of justice are best served by his doing so. But this does not, of course, completely avoid the thrust of what has been put. The result will be that, in some cases, a jury may be required to deliberate for a period in excess of the six hours specified.
That, in my opinion, is not a sufficient reason for refusing to apply the decision in Morosi to the 1977 Act. The considerations which would warrant such a decision under the 1912 Act would warrant a similar decision under the Act.

However, I shall, in view of the submissions made, consider whether, if the jury were deliberating for more than six hours, the verdicts and judgment can and should be set aside.

Section 58(2) requires that in such a case the jury "shall" be discharged and a new trial held. In argument, inter alia two questions arose: whether verdicts and judgment given such six hour period are null and void; and whether the Court and the parties together may, by election or otherwise, avoid the effect of <case>.

It is, in my opinion, settled law that, special provisions apart, no order or judgment of a superior court such as the Supreme Court of New South Wales is null and void: see generally Cameron versus Cole <case>; [(1944) 68 CLR 571] at 585, 599. The position is different where what is involved is an order or judgment of an inferior court or a court of limited jurisdiction: see generally Posner versus Collector for Inter-State Destitute
Persons (Vic) <case>; [(1946) 74 CLR 461]; Botany Municipal Council versus Jackson [(1985) 2 NSWLR ];
Schipp versus Herfords Pty Ltd [(1975) 1 NSWLR 412.] 
In my opinion, the sections of the [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) do not operate to render null and void verdicts of judgments given in circumstances inconsistent with [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) It is, of course, clear that the legislature intended that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) is to be obeyed: by the use of the term "shall" [(s (2))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) the legislature clearly intended that, at the expiration of the relevant period, the judge should do what the section requires. But that does not mean that action taken in circumstances inconsistent with the section is a nullity.

In some at least of the earlier decisions, it was I think assumed that if the terms of a section were mandatory - if "shall" was used in its primary sense: see Julius versus Lord Bishop of Oxford [(1880) 5 App Cas 214]; [(1874-80)
All ER 43]; Ward versus Williams <case>; [(1955) 92 CLR 496]; Finance Facilities Pty Ltd versus The Federal Commissioner of
Taxation <case>; [(1971) 127 CLR 106] - what was done contrary to the section was void. The effect of the decision of this Court and of the High Court in Hatton versus Beaumont [[1977] 2 NSWLR 211] at 214 et seq and 226; [(1978) 52 ALJR 589] at 591; was in my opinion to establish that the breach of a mandatory provision did not necessarily produce invalidity. It is for the Parliament to indicate whether breach of such a provision is to have such an effect. As was subsequently pointed out by McHugh JA in Woods versus Bate [(1987) 7 NSWLR ]
at 567, the Court must look to the purpose of the legislation and the purposes to be served by invalidating the acts in question to determine what effect is to be given to the statute.

In my opinion, a breach of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) of the kind here in question does not cause verdicts and judgment given inconsistent with the section to be void. I cannot think that it was the legislative intention that, if all parties at a trial overlooked the existence of the provision or were misled by a slow clock, verdicts and judgment given would be void. The breach of it is likely to occur by oversight or by misconstruction of what has taken place. The sanction of invalidity would, I think, be unlikely to achieve the purpose of the section. It is not to be expected that a judge, appreciating the effects of the section, would yet refuse to discharge the jury in accordance with its requirements. In this case, if the section was breached, it was because the judge and, it would appear, the parties involved at the trial adopted an incorrect construction of the section. To invalidate what followed would not be apt to secure observance of the section.

I have referred to the possibility that, by election or otherwise, parties may avoid the necessity of the discharge of a jury in accordance with the section.
At first sight it would appear strange if, in a case where the parties, for good reasons, desired the jury to continue to deliberate and the judge thought that would serve the interests of justice, the section should require that the jury be discharged. I am conscious that the interests of the jury are to be considered and no doubt were considered in enacting the legislation. In view of the conclusions at which I have arrived, it is not necessary to express a final view in this regard.

If what occurred does not invalidate the verdicts and judgment but is an irregularity, it lies in the discretion of the Court to determine whether the judgment should be set aside and a new trial ordered. Nothing of substance was urged to warrant a new trial. Mr Cassidy QC for STC pointed to matters which would involve prejudice to his client on a retrial: he referred to the fact that two of the witnesses were dead. Whether or not their evidence could otherwise be adduced at the trial, they would not be present before the jury.

The point taken, though of course available to be taken, is a technical point.
It does not go to the merits of what occurred at the trial. It cannot be suggested that any prejudice resulted to the defendants by reason of the omission to discharge the jury. Accordingly, I do not think that the irregularity, if it was such, should result in a retrial. This ground of appeal should not succeed.
THE CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE POINT: 
The trial judge left to the jury an issue of contributory negligence by reference to only two things: the failure of the plaintiff to tell Mr
Sutherland that he had previously had trouble with the horse in question; and the fact that, as it was suggested, he was riding the horse too fast when the accident occurred.

Mr Toomey QC, for the plaintiff, submitted: that there was no evidence to support a finding of contributory negligence in respect of either of these matters; and that in any event the finding of twenty per cent responsibility was appealably excessive.

I do not think the judge erred in leaving contributory negligence to the jury in respect of these matters. It is important to recall, in relation to the cross-appeal, that the plaintiff's submissions must be considered upon the basis that the jury made all such findings of fact in support of what it did which were open to it. See Polycarpou versus Australian Wire Industries Pty Ltd [(1995) 36 NSWLR 49] at 60.

The plaintiff's claim in negligence was based, at least in part, upon the failure of Mr Sutherland properly to instruct or to supervise him in riding the horse. The suggestion for Mr Sutherland was that, having regard to his previous experience with the horse, the plaintiff knew that he was apt to have difficulty in controlling it and that such a difficulty contributed to what occurred. The suggestion was that, inter alia, if the horse was ridden at too fast a pace, there was a danger that it would become out of control, veer as it did and thrust the plaintiff against the gate or rail. It was open for a jury so to find and to find that that is what occurred.

Mr Toomey QC referred the Court to passages in the evidence of the plaintiff upon the basis of which, he submitted, the jury could and should find only a small contribution by the plaintiff to his injuries. It is in this regard that it is important to approach the question upon the basis to which I have referred, namely, that the jury is to be assumed to have dealt with the matter upon findings most favourable to the defendants in the sense to which I have referred. The fact, if it be such, that particular claims of the plaintiff or other witnesses were not the subject of cross-examination does not mean that the jury could not, in the context of the whole of the evidence, put such statements aside or at least give qualified acceptance to them.

The occasion in question was the first occasion on which the plaintiff had ridden a horse on the training track of STC. The day had been wet. The jury could I think take the view that to ride the horse with which he had had trouble previously at a pace faster than was to be expected constituted a significant lack of care for his own safety.

The principles by reference to which these matters are to be judged are not in question: see Bus versus Sydney City Council <case>; [(1989) 167 CLR 78] at 90; Polycarpou versus Australian Wire Industries Pty Ltd [(1995) 36 NSWLR 49] at 68-69. I am not satisfied that the verdict which the jury gave was beyond the scope of a sound discretionary judgment.

For these reasons I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA.
 
MEAGHER JA: I agree with Beazley JA.

BEAZLEY JA: This is an appeal and cross appeal from a jury verdict against the appellant (Sutherland), in which the first respondent (Zalakos), a strapper, was awarded damages for injuries sustained in the course of his employment with Sutherland, a horse trainer, but which award was reduced by 20% for Zalakos' contributory negligence. Zalakos had also claimed damages from the second respondent, Sydney Turf Club Limited (the STC). The jury returned a verdict for the STC on that claim.

The sole issue on the appeal was the proper construction of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) of the [Jury Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) (the 1977
Act). Counsel for the appellant submitted that <case> required that the jury be discharged 6 hours after it had retired As the trial judge had failed to do so, the jury verdict must be set aside and there must be a new trial. Zalakos supported this submission. It was opposed by the STC.

On the cross appeal, Zalakos submitted that there was no evidence of contributory negligence and that therefore that issue should not have been allowed to go to the jury. Alternatively, it was submitted that the jury's assessment of contributory negligence at 20% was excessive such that it was one which reasonable jurors could not reach: Calin versus Greater Union
Organisation Pty Limited <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 33] at 41.

All other grounds of appeal were either formally abandoned or not argued.

Facts 
Zalakos was a 16 year old youth who commenced employment as a strapper with
Sutherland on 6 February 1984. He hoped to become an apprentice jockey. On 23
April 1984, Zalakos was requested to ride trackwork on a horse at Rosehill
Race Course, which was owned and occupied by the STC. Zalakos had not previously done any trackwork, but had ridden this particular horse previously, in an area called the lane, a strip of approximately 150 metres near the Sutherland's stables. The horse was about 5-6 years old and an ex- trotter. Sutherland alleged the horse was very quiet. Zalakos alleged however, that he had had problems with the horse. Zalakos was instructed to trot the horse around the track 3 times and to then take it at a steady canter twice around the A cinders track. The A cinders is one of several training tracks at the STC's racecourse at Rosehill.

To get onto the track, it was necessary for horses to pass through a permanent gap in the rails. The horses also exited through the same gap. After Zalakos had finished riding the horse around the inner track, known as the "dam", he took it onto the A cinders. As he was approaching the gap on the first time round the A cinders, the horse pulled towards the gap. Zalakos fell from the horse, entangling his knee around the post at one side of the gap. He sustained serious injury to his left knee.

The [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/)
Issue 
The trial commenced before the trial judge, Smart J, and a jury of four on
Monday 31 August 1992. After the jury was empanelled there was a short adjournment and thereafter counsel for the STC applied for and was granted an adjournment to 10 am the following day. The jury was excused until 10.30 am that day. The trial then proceeded on each successive court day and concluded on Wednesday 23 September 1992. His Honour commenced summing up to the jury on
Monday 21 September 1992. The summing up concluded at 12.45 pm on Tuesday 22
September 1992. During the course of the summing up, the trial judge handed to the jury a list of nine questions and gave directions in respect of each of the questions. At the end of the summing up, his Honour said to the jury: "Ladies and Gentlemen, would you now like to retire and consider your answers to the questions. Do not hesitate to call on us if we can be of any help?" 
Whilst the transcript records: "JURY RETIRED TO CONSIDER THE VERDICT AT 12.45 PM", the trial judge made no statement to that effect. His direction was as set out above. At some stage during the course of the afternoon, the trial judge received the following note from the jury: "Your Honour, it is evident the jury never (sic) give a unanimous decision on questions 1, 2 3(a) and 7(a)." (foreman's name and signature) "PS: This has been based on our individual convictions." 
The trial judge brought the note to the attention of counsel. His Honour then said to counsel: "I think what I should do is inquire of the jury whether this note means that they would not come to a unanimous decision on any of those questions or just some of those questions. I think I should ask them that question first. With questions I do not think there is any time limit. This has always been my understanding of it. And the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s57.html) (Jury
Act) only applies to individual questions.
. .
 
The power to leave questions comes under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s90.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). The real question is whether I should redirect the jury and instead of asking them to answer questions to ask them to bring in a verdict." 
His Honour recalled the jury and asked the foreman whether his note meant the jury would not be able to give an unanimous answer to some or to all the questions. The foreman replied: "We are finding it an absolute impossibility coming to an agreement on any of those questions as a unanimous agreement." 
The jury again retired and the trial judge raised with counsel the appropriate course to take, given the foreman's statement. His Honour raised two possibilities: that he direct the jury that he could accept the agreed answers of 3 out of 4 of them as a special verdict; alternatively, that he give a supplementary summing up in which he relieved the jury of the "need to answer questions but just direct them to bring in a verdict". The question of the time before which the jury could be discharged then arose. His Honour stated he considered that time had not yet started to run for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s57.html) as he had not yet charged the jury to consider a verdict. He considered ,therefore, that he was entitled to allow the jury to separate. He thus directed the jury to return the following day at 10 am. Although the transcript does not record what time this occurred, there was agreement between counsel that at least 2 hours had elapsed by that time, (making the time approximately 2.45 pm) although counsel for Zalakos submitted that the jury was told to go home at about 3.30 pm. Counsel for Zalakos again raised the question of time and stated to the trial judge that it was his view that: "the jury having been directed, any redirections should only have been for the purpose of clarifying the initial direction in that event, time would not restart for the jury but continue and that your Honour would be able to direct the jury as to majority verdicts after 4 hours has elapsed, whenever that occurs tomorrow morning." 
On Wednesday 23 September 1992, the trial judge provided to counsel copies of the verdicts he proposed to give to the jury in place of the questions given to them during the course of the summing up.

Counsel for Zalakos objected to the judge adopting any course other than giving to the jury any redirection on the existing questions. His Honour however proceeded with his proposal of giving a list of verdicts to the jury and gave a supplementary summing up. His Honour concluded the supplementary summing up by stating: "I now propose to ask you to retire and consider your verdicts." 
The transcript records that: "At 11.06 the jury retired to consider its verdict." 
His Honour also stated for "the record" that that was the case.

The Court resumed at 3.21 pm and the jury was called into court at 3.23 pm.
His Honour stated to the jury that as four hours had elapsed since they had retired, it was possible to take their verdict or to take the decision of three of them. The foreman informed the Court that they were not making progress on reaching an unanimous decision but that three of them had "reached decisions on all questions".

The jury then retired briefly. At 3.34 pm his Honour took the jury's verdict, which was a majority verdict in respect of each individual verdict which his
Honour had given to the jury.

The submission raised by the appellant was short - that the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html) of the [Jury Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/) are mandatory and that by 3.06 pm on Wednesday 23 September 1992 the jury had retired for more than 6 hours. That time was arrived at by adding the two hour period on Tuesday 22 September 1992 when the jury was deliberating upon the questions, together with the four hours on Wednesday 23 September 1992 from .06 am when the jury retired after the supplementary summing up. At 3.06 pm, the jury had not agreed on a verdict, either unanimously or under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s57.html) It was submitted therefore that the jury should have been discharged: [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ja197791/s58.html)
Accordingly there had to be a new trial.

Legislative History 
The 1977 Act, of which ss 57 and 58 form part, was the successor to the
Jury Act 1912 (the 1912 Act). Part XII of the 1912 Act contained provisions for the discharge of the jury in the case of disagreement as follows: "66(1) Where the jury upon any civil trial or assessment of damages under this Act have remained four hours or upwards in deliberation, if all of them do not agree as to the verdict to be given or amount of damages to be assessed, the decision of three-fourths in number of them shall be taken and entered as the verdict or assessment of all, but if three-fourths in number of them do not concur in any such verdict or assessment and it be found after examination on oath of one or more of them that they or three-fourths in number of them are not likely so to concur then such jurors may be discharged and the cause may without any new process for that purpose be again set down for trial or assessment (as the case may be) either at the same or any subsequent sittings, as the court or presiding judge may order.
 
If, after having remained six hours or upwards in deliberation, three- fourths in number of the jurors do not concur in any such verdict or assessment, then such jurors shall be discharged, and the cause may without any new process for that purpose be again set down for trial or assessment (as the case may be) either at the same or any subsequent sittings, as the court or presiding judge may order.
. ." 
The 1977 Act also contains provisions for the discharge of the jury. Part of the 1977 Act deals with "Proceedings upon Trial". Section 54 provides for the circumstances in which a jury in a criminal trial may separate, both before and after retiring to consider their verdict. There is no corresponding provision in respect of civil trials. Accordingly the common law continues to apply. At common law a jury was not permitted to separate after it had been charged to consider its verdict. However, the fact a jury had been permitted to do so did not, of itself, invalidate the verdict: see Fanshaw versus Knowles [[1916] 2 KB 538] at 547 per Lord Reading CJ.

Section 57 provides for the taking of a majority verdict in a civil trial.
Section 58 provides for the discharge of a jury in a civil trial. The relevant terms of those sections are: "57. Where the jury in civil proceedings have retired for more than 4 hours and they are unable to agree on their verdict: in the case of a jury consisting of 4 persons, the decision of 3 jurors; . .
 shall be taken as the verdict of all.
 .(1) Where the jury in civil proceedings have retired for more than 4 hours, the court in which the proceedings are being tried may discharge them if it finds, after examination on oath of one or more of them, that they are not likely to agree on either a unanimous verdict or a verdict under section .
 
Where the jury in civil proceedings have retired for more than 6 hours the court in which the proceedings are being tried shall discharge them if they have not agreed on either a unanimous verdict or a verdict under section .
 
Where a jury is discharged under subsection (1) or (2), the proceedings may, without any new process for that purpose, be set down for trial either at the same or any subsequent sittings, as the court may order." 
Before dealing with the meaning and effect of <case>, it is necessary to consider the consequence of the trial judge having referred a list of questions to the jury and later substituting a list of verdicts to be given.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s90.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) provides: "It shall be the duty of a jury to answer any question of fact that may be left to the jury by the presiding Judge at the trial. " 
In Morosi versus Mirror Newspapers Ltd [[1977] 2 NSWLR 749], the New
South Wales Court of Appeal (Moffitt P, Hope and Reynolds JJA) stated at 761: ". . .in deliberating upon the answers to be given to questions asked of them, the jury are not deliberating upon a verdict." 
The Court held therefore that the time limits of <case> of the 1912 Act did not operate in respect of the deliberations of the jury upon answers to questions put to them. The section was only concerned with the time during which the jury was deliberating upon a verdict.

It is clear from the trial judge's statements referred to above that he had the principles stated in Morosi in mind when he drew a distinction between the jury's deliberations on questions and charging them to consider their verdict.

Counsel for the appellant submitted, however, that under the 1977 Act, the position was different to that stated in Morosi. He submitted the difference flowed directly from the change in language from <case> of the 1912 Act to that used in ss 57 and 58 of the 1977 Act. Counsel for the appellant specifically stated that the appellant did not challenge the correctness of Morosi for the purpose of this appeal. It was incumbent upon him, therefore, to demonstrate that ss 57 and 58 involved a substantive change in the law from s66.

Wording of ss57 and 58 of the 1977 Act and s66 of the 1912 Act 
The difference in wording relied upon by the appellant revolves around the expression "remained. . .in deliberation" in the case of <case> and "retired" in the case of ss 57 and 58. The relevant expression in each is qualified later in the respective provisions by the circumstance as to whether there has been, or is likely to be, "concurrence" (in the case of <case>) or "agreement" (in the case of ss 57 and 58) in a verdict. There is no difference in meaning between "concurrence" and "agreement". Nor, in my view, is there any difference in the effect of the sections when <case> uses the phrase to "remain deliberation" and ss 57 and 58 use the term "retire". In both cases the section refers to the circumstance that the jury is out of the court room and is undertaking the task of considering its verdict. In this case, and applying Morosi, the jury was not charged with that task until .06 am on Wednesday 23 September 1992.

Prior to that time, it was considering the questions asked of them by the
Court. Accordingly, at 3.23 pm, when the jury was called back into court, slightly in excess of 4 hours had elapsed. At that stage, as the jury were unable to agree on a unanimous verdict but three had agreed, then in accordance with <case> the trial judge was required to accept their agreement as the verdict of all. This is, in fact, what occurred.

As the decision in Morosi is not challenged, the appellant's submission must fail. There is no difference, in substance, between <case> of the 1912 act and s of the 1977 Act. Accordingly, there was no error and the appeal should be dismissed.

Failure to discharge jury after 6 hours 
Having regard to my view on the appeal, it is not necessary to consider the consequences of a jury not being discharged after 6 hours of deliberation upon a verdict. However, as the matter was argued and it is a matter of practical importance, I will briefly express my views on the matter.

If, as at 3.23 pm on Wednesday 23 September 1992, the jury had been retired for more than 6 hours deliberating upon their verdict, the question would have arisen as to the effect of the trial judge's failure to discharge them at that time. Counsel for Sutherland submitted the verdict could not be taken - in other words it was a nullity - and that there must be a new trial.

This submission could not have been sustained. In Cameron versus Cole <case>; [(1944) 68 CLR 571], Rich J stated, at 590: "It is settled by the highest authority that the decision of a superior court, even if in excess of jurisdiction, is at the worst voidable, and is valid unless and until it is set aside." 
The "highest authority" to which his Honour referred was Scott versus Bennett [(1871) LR 5 HL 234] at 245; Revell versus Blake [(1873) LR 8 CP 533] at 544.
See also R versus Metal Trades Employers' Association; Ex parte Amalgamated
Engineering Union, Australian Section <case>; [(1951) 82 CLR 208.] 
Sir Frederick Jordan in General Principles of the Administration of Justice expresses the same principle. He states, at 10: ". . .the judgment of a superior court is never a nullity and must be treated as valid unless reversed." 
He, too, cites Scott versus Bennett and Revell versus Blake as authority for this principle. He also refers to Craig versus Kanssen [[1943] 1 KB 256] and Re K.
Piper (Deceased) and the Testator's Family Maintenance & [Guardianship of
Infants Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/goia1916231/), [[1960] SR 328.] 
In Re K. Piper, Myers J stated at 331: "No order or judgment of [the Supreme Court] can be treated as void or non- existent merely because the order itself was beyond power. In such cases, the order stands and remains binding unless it is set aside on appeal: Revell v
Blake [(1873) LR 8 CP 533]; Scott v Bennett [(1871) LR 5 HL 234] at 245.
... It is a general rule that no court can review or vary a judgment after it has been drawn up except by way of appeal. . ." 
Re Piper was referred with approval by this Court in Electricity Commission of New South Wales versus Yates [(1993) 30 NSWLR 351] at 356.

In Craig versus Kanssen [[1943] 1 KB 256], Lord Greene
M.R. (Goddard LJ agreeing) held, at 262, in respect of an order made by the
English Supreme Court that: ". . .a person who is affected by an order which can properly be described as a nullity is entitled ex debito justitiae to have it set aside." 
Craig versus Kanssen thus seems to modify the general principle to which I have referred. Rich J in Cameron versus Cole doubted the correctness of the decision in Craig versus Kanssen. In Re Piper, Myers J referring to Craig versus Kanssen stated: ". . .but there are certain circumstances in which the court will set aside a judgment or order treating it for that purpose as a nullity. Nevertheless, the order remains good until it is so set aside: Craig versus Kanssen [[1943] 1 KB ."] 
However, his Honour then attempted to explain away the decision. In my opinion, as Craig does not bind this court and as its correctness has been doubted or otherwise explained away, it should be put to one side. There is little point in attempting to rationalise it given the clear jurisprudence on the issue in this country.

It follows, therefore, that even if the verdict was taken six hours or more after the jury had retired, the verdict was not a nullity. Accordingly, this
Court would not have been bound, on appeal, to set it aside.

I have not yet dealt with the meaning of the phrase "for more than six hours" in s58 of the 1977 Act. In my opinion, the expression does not refer to any time beyond six hours. It means that once a jury has been retired for six hours, the trial judge must take the necessary steps to assemble the court and bring back the jury. If the jury have not decided upon a unanimous verdict or a verdict under s57, the judge must discharge them.

THE CROSS APPEAL 
Contributory Negligence 
By his cross appeal, Zalakos contended that there was no evidence of contributory negligence for that issue to have been left to the jury.
Alternatively, it was submitted that the jury's verdict that Zalakos was 20% contributorily negligent was excessive.

The allegations of contributory negligence were: that Zalakos had had problems with the horse he was riding on the occasion of the accident, but did not so inform Sutherland; and that Zalakos was riding the horse faster than he had been instructed.

The evidence that Zalakos had had problems with the horse, but did not tell
Sutherland, was given by Zalakos in his evidence in chief. The "problem" it appeared was that the horse was "[j]ust a generally strong type of black colt". Sutherland, however, said that the horse was a very quiet horse and that he had seen Zalakos riding the horse in the lane and was "having no trouble whatsoever in handling it".

The evidence as to the second allegation of contributory negligence was more extensive. Sutherland said the he instructed Zalakos to "trot the horse around the trotting track and then come out on to the A cinders and canter around twice, canter steady twice". Zalakos' evidence was to the same effect.
He said that Sutherland (possibly through the foreman) gave him instructions to: ". . .go out to the trotting track, trot three times around - which I did - then when you get onto the A Cinders don't take him off at a hundred mile an hour start, trotting off until you come up to the back which was about the and then give him a nice, good, steady canter twice around." 
Sutherland said that a steady canter was "totally different" from a "good solid canter" and from "3/4 pace". A steady canter involved the horse doing around "20, 24, 25, 26 seconds to the furlong or 200 metres"; a good solid canter "would be about 20 seconds to every 200 metres" and 3/4 pace is "15 seconds to every 200 metres". Sutherland was also asked about the meaning of a solid hit-out. He said: "A solid hit-out is a recognised expression as far as horses that are racing are concerned. A solid hit-out is as fast as you can go." 
Later, Sutherland said there was: "very little difference between a steady canter and any of the cantering.
Where your time started to change is when you get up half pace, 3/4 pace and galloping." 
Zalakos described what he in fact did, as follows: "When I came towards the A cinders I walked him past the A cinders and I walked him to the centre of the racecourse, the dam, and I trotted the horse three times around and then, after trotting three times around, which took ten, twelve minutes -- . .
 
I walked, after completing trotting, I walked back to the gap which was the dam and the B cinders. The attendant said "All clear, come on", so I did, and
I started to trot around the A cinders, started to trot, I didn't take him off, boom, completely.
. .
 
I kept him at a trot until I was up the back, which was the 1600 metre mark . .
 
I started to get into a canter and I was at a fairly quick canter up until the turn, the turn at Rosehill Racecourse, the home straight as people would know it, and from there, at the horse's pace, I was at three-quarter pace giving him a solid hit-out in the last 300 to 400 metres." 
He said that as he approached the gap, through which he had brought the horse onto the track: "I slowed down a fraction, say - yes, slowed down a fraction, not much." 
Zalakos later said that when he slowed down he was going at a half gallop, travelling at about 30-40 kilometres per hour. He said the horse started to shy about 10 metres before the gap. He said the horse was "[n]ot out of control; he was gathering his own momentum and pulling towards the corner of the gap". Zalakos fell, his leg becoming entangled around the corner of the gap "like an octopus".

Zalakos was questioned as to why he had slowed down fractionally as he approached the gap. He explained that he had to stop 50 metres past the gap as he would have then finished his ride. Later he said he had decided to finish the ride after having ridden once round the track and not twice as directed, as he considered the horse had "had enough".

He was cross examined extensively about the speed he was going shortly before the accident and whether that speed was contrary to his instructions. The following evidence is relevant on this issue: "Q. If you had been instructed to give him a good steady canter, why were you galloping him? 
A. Well, a good steady canter in horse terms is don't plod. . . . I was a fast canter, as in a fast canter, gallop is virtually the same thing. . . . A canter is exactly the same thing but a fraction slower." . .
 "Q. A good steady canter is not in any way the same thing, is it, as a gallop? 
A. Mr Cassidy, as I will say again, a canter, a trot he's got his foot on the ground. He's like sort of dancing. When he canters he takes leaps and bounds.
When he gallops he takes leaps and bound." . .
 ". . .it's just leaps and bounds but a gallop is a lot quicker, not a lot quicker. It's quicker than a canter, just the same thing he's got this to his legs off the ground to canter.
. ." "Q. Do you say on this occasion as you came around there do you say that you were following your instructions and riding the horse at a good steady canter? 
A. Steady canter, yes. And gallop is just about the same thing.
 
Q. And you say you were riding him at a good steady canter because you regard a gallop as just about the same thing as a good steady canter, is that right? 
A. Just about. But a gallop's a little bit quicker.
. .
 
A. . . .the motion to a canter and to a gallop is the same. It's only that the gallop goes a little bit quicker. He's at his full capacity." 
Sutherland said that he would not consider giving the horse "a good solid hit-out" as complying with his instructions to go around the A cinders at a steady canter. He also said Zalakos definitely had the ability to judge the difference between a steady canter and a solid canter.

Counsel for Zalakos submitted that there was no evidence of a causal connection between the problems Zalakos had had with the horse or the speed at which he was riding the horse, and the horse "going for the gap" which was the direct cause of the accident.

Causation involves "applying common sense to the facts of each particular case": March versus E & M.H. Stramare Pty Limited & Anor <case>; [(1991) 171 CLR 506] per Mason CJ at 515, quoting Lord Reid in Stapley versus Gypsum
Mines Limited <case>; [[1953] AC 663] at 681.

In my opinion the evidence to which I have referred was capable of supporting the allegations of contributory negligence which were left to the jury. Had
Zalakos told Sutherland he had had problems with the horse, it was open to the jury to conclude that Sutherland may have taken some different course in relation to the ride that morning. Likewise, the speed at which the horse was being ridden could have affected Zalakos' ability to control it as it commenced to go towards the gap.

Finding of 20% contributory negligence 
Counsel for Zalakos submitted that even if there was evidence of contributory negligence, the jury's verdict of 20% contributory negligence was not open to it. He submitted that the question of contributory negligence had to be viewed in light of: ". . .the relative position of the 16 year old, untrained boy sent out on to the track without any warning, for the first time, with no instructions, it being the duty of his employer to give him instructions to safeguard him.." 
In Calin versus Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd <case>; [(1991) 173 CLR 33], the High Court in its majority decision stated, at 41: ". . .The correct principle is that a court on appeal may order a new trial if the jury has reached a conclusion which is against the evidence in the sense that the evidence in its totality preponderates so strongly against the conclusion favoured by the jury that it can be said that the verdict is such as reasonable jurors could not reach. " 
In my opinion, for the same reasons I have given above, the jury's apportionment of 20% was not one against which the evidence preponderated so strongly that it should not stand.

Accordingly, the appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.
