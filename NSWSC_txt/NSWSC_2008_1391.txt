JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
ROTHMAN J DECEMBER 2008 /2006 Permanent Custodians Ltd versus Mohamed El Ali & Anor (No 2) 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: On 28 November 2008, the Court, as presently constituted, issued orders setting aside a default judgment as against the second defendant and permitting the filing of a defence confined to the existence of a debt, above and beyond any debt satisfied by a mortgagee sale, pursuant to the terms of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/):
Permanent Custodians Ltd versus El Ali <case> ("the earlier judgment"). This judgment ought be read in conjunction with the earlier judgment. The orders granted liberty to apply for any further or consequential order, including an order for costs. Each of the plaintiff and the second defendant seek that the other pay its or her costs of the motion.

Principles [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) grants to the Court a broad discretion as to what, if any, orders for costs should issue, by whom, to whom and to what extent they should be paid, and whether they should be paid on an ordinary or indemnity basis. The terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) are additional to the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales, as a superior court of record with general jurisdiction in law and equity, to award costs.
 The terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html), and the broad discretion, which it embodied, requires the Court to exercise its power judicially. The ordinary rule is that costs follow the event:
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, Rule 42.1. Often the issue is that which is meant by "following the event", or which of the parties, if anybody, is the successful party.
 Further, prior to the enactment of <case> and the Uniform Civil Procedure
Rules, the general principle was that, where a party seeks the indulgence of the Court, that party must pay the costs associated with a successful application for that indulgence. The plaintiff submits that where a default judgment has been regularly entered, then setting aside the default judgment ordinarily includes the imposition of the term that the defendant (it is usually the defendant) has terms imposed upon it or her relating to the payment of costs: Gamble versus Killingsworth & Mclean Publishing <case>; [[1970] VR 161] at 168.
 Further, the plaintiff submits that it is not unusual for terms to be imposed upon a defendant that the defendant pay the costs of the judgment and the costs of the application to set it aside: Federal Bank versus Bate <case>; [[1889] 5 WN 67];
Burgoine versus Taylor [[1878] 9 Ch D 1]; Cockle v
Joyce [[1877] 7 Ch D 56]; Passmore versus Minahan <case>; [[1887] 13 VLR 262]; Proudfoot versus O'Brien [[1896] 13 WN 64];
Australian Executor Trustees Limited versus Lanmar Pty Ltd & Ors <case> (per Adams J). They also cite, and I repeat, a passage from the judgment of Spender J in Re Zagoridis; Ex parte Q'Plas Group Pty Limited <case>; [(1990) 98 ALR 718] at 723, in which his Honour said: "Where judgment is irregular or signed in breach of good faith, the plaintiff is usually ordered to pay the costs of the application to set it aside, but, if the judgment be regular, as a rule it will be set aside only on terms that the defendant pay the costs of the judgment and of the application to set the judgment aside." The second defendant, Ms Awad, relies upon the judgment of the Court of
Appeal in Hooker versus Gilling (No 2) <case>,
Dib versus Regtop (Court of Appeal, 20 December 2006, unreported) and Yazgi v
Permanent Custodians Ltd (No 2)  <case> at <case>.
Essentially, Ms Awad submits that the starting point for the exercise of discretion is that the successful party is entitled to her costs of the proceedings (or, in this case, of the motion), unless there is some competing fact which requires special consideration.
 The Court of Appeal in Hooker, supra, cited, with approval, its own judgment in Arian versus Nguyen <case> and said: " <case>; [(2001) 33 MVR 37] as follows: '36 In Oshlack versus Richmond River Council McHugh J (at 97) reiterated the long-standing rule that, subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful party in litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour. His Honour went on to say: "The traditional exceptions to the usual order as to costs focus on the conduct of the successful party which disentitles it to the beneficial exercise of the discretion. In Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd versus Paphos Wine
Industries Ltd ([1951] 1 All ER 873 at 874), Devlin J formulated the relevant principle as follows: 'No doubt, the ordinary rule is that, where a plaintiff has been successful, he ought not to be deprived of his costs, or, at any rate, made to pay the costs of the other side, unless he has been guilty of some sort of misconduct.'" 
His Honour noted that "misconduct" in this context includes conduct relating to the litigation and conduct that unnecessarily protracts the proceedings.

McHugh J was in dissent in Oshlack but as Foster AJA pointed out in Mannix v Loumbos <case> there was no disagreement in the High Court as to these observations of general principle which are well established.
 The making of an order that a successful party pay his or her opponent's costs requires strong justification (Ottway versus Jones [[1955] 1 WLR ] at , 714, Scherer versus Counting Instruments Limited [[1986] 1 WLR 615] at 618) and exceptional circumstances must exist before a party will not only be deprived entirely of costs but also required to pay part of the opponent's costs (Trade Practices Commission versus Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd [(1979) 28 ALR ];
Robinson versus Australian Association of Social Workers Limited  <case> 
Where a party raises issues or makes allegations improperly or unreasonably, this may constitute misconduct such that the court may not only deprive it of its costs but order it to pay the whole or a part of the unsuccessful party's costs: Trade Practices Commission versus Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd at 208 per
Fisher J, Re Elgindata Limited (No 2) [[1993] 1 All ER 232] at 237 per Nourse LJ; Ashby versus Marshall, (unreported, SC (SA), 28 November 1991);
Popovic versus Murray (unreported SC(Tas), 15 March 1991).
 It is rare for a successful party who is guilty of misconduct in the litigation to be ordered to pay the unsuccessful opponent's costs where the misconduct does not lengthen the proceedings unnecessarily, cause unnecessary issues to be canvassed or otherwise cause the costs of the litigation to be increased. Indeed, the court's entitlement to depart from the usual order that costs follow the event has sometimes been said, in effect, to be subject to the qualification that the misconduct in question occasioned unnecessary litigation and expense (see Huxley versus West London Extension Railway Company App Cas 26 at 32-33 per Lord Halsbury LC; Ritter versus Godfrey [[1920] KB 47] per Atkin LJ at 60). In other cases, however, this qualification has not been mentioned: see for example Donald Campbell & Co versus Pollak [[1927] AC ] at -812; Thorne versus Doug Wade Consultants Pty Ltd <case>; [[1985] VR 433] at 500; Jamal versus Secretary, Department of Health [(1988) 14
NSWLR 252] at 271-272; Re Elgindata Limited (No 2) (supra). On balance, it seems to me that while delay and increased expense brought about by improper conduct in the course of the litigation are highly relevant factors in the discretion to depart from the usual order as to costs, they are not essential to the exercise of that discretion. It would, in any event, be very unusual for misconduct of that kind not to cause unnecessary delay and expense.' (emphasis added)." (Hooker versus Gilling (No 2) <case>, per McColl JA, with whom Ipp and Basten JJA agreed.) 
Application of Principles I have already determined that the plaintiff, and its solicitors, have acted appropriately and no criticism ought to be made of them in obtaining the default judgment: Permanent Custodians Ltd versus El Ali  <case> at <case>.
 I have also recounted the circumstances of the failure by the solicitor for
Ms Awad in failing to file a defence. Ms Awad submits that this was a "regrettable oversight". She relies upon the statement by Allsop J (as he then was) in White versus Overland  <case> at <case>: "Litigation is not a game. It is a costly and stressful, though necessary, evil.... Representatives do not owe duties to the other side's client. They owe duties to their own client. But no one's interests are advanced by litigation proceeding on assumptions which are seen or suspected to be false.... In the long run, the only consequence of keeping issues hidden or not clearly identifying them is to disrupt the business of the court leading to the waste of valuable public resources and to lead to the incurring of unnecessary costs by the parties, costs which ultimately have to be borne by someone." Ms Awad claims that the sentiments of Allsop J (as he then was) relate to the proceedings before the Court in the instant matter. She submits that the plaintiff was aware that the signature had been forged, because there had been an affidavit sworn, and for another purpose, served on the plaintiff's solicitor, which affidavit set out clearly the allegations of forgery, made by
Ms Awad.
 I accept, without deciding, that the plaintiff was aware that Ms Awad claimed the mortgage was a forgery, at least in respect to her signature. It is also the case that Ms Awad did not (and does not) dispute the capacity of the plaintiff to exercise its rights under the mortgage and effect a mortgagee sale. The mere fact, if it be the fact, as alleged by Ms Awad, that the plaintiff was aware of her claim of forgery, does not translate into an understanding that the second defendant (Ms Awad) was contesting the debt. To say the least, given Ms Awad's attitude to the mortgagee sale, such an understanding would not necessarily follow.
 The failure to file a defence, even if it were a defence confined to a debt beyond that sum realised by the mortgagee sale, is the kind of "misconduct in litigation" to which Ipp AJA (as he then was) referred in Arian versus Nguyen, supra, cited, with approval, by McColl JA in Hooker versus Gilling (No 2), supra.
Understandably, Ms Awad submits that she should not bear the cost of the "regrettable oversight", but that is a matter between Ms Awad and her solicitor.
 Because these are costs in an interlocutory proceeding, and I do not make an order that the costs be payable forthwith, it seems that the most appropriate exercise of the discretion of the Court, in the circumstances, is to order that the second defendant, Ms Awad, pay the costs of the motion, which costs result directly from her failure to file a defence in time or at all. Otherwise, the costs will be payable at the conclusion of the proceedings and the issue between Ms Awad and her solicitor is, at this stage, a matter for them.

Conclusion  The Court orders that the second defendant, Ms Awad, pay the plaintiff's costs of and incidental to the motion to set aside default judgment, such costs to be as agreed or assessed.
