Radin versus Vekic /97 November 1997 
Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /97 - RADIN V VEKIC 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a dispute between a former solicitor, the plaintiff, and his former client. I dealt with the principal dispute in reasons I gave on 6 June 1997. On that day I ordered that unless the plaintiff delivered to the defendants a bill in taxable form showing a proper amount due to the solicitor of more than $2,180, a caveat should be removed. 
A document purporting to be a bill was given on 21 August 1997 showing that $3,273.59 was claimed for costs which, with disbursements less credits, amounted to a claim of $4,083.59 by the solicitor.

At the time when the solicitor gave the bill, he was not on the Roll of
Solicitors. Further evidence filed on 4 September last shows that the solicitor sold his practice to Mesdames Milicevic and Stefanovic on 6 March
A deed of sale and consent was executed by the parties to effect this transfer. This deed made provision for work in progress and also made provision for the solicitor to be paid for completed work, with a grant of a power of attorney to the purchasers to assign the legal right to the debt but not the beneficial ownership of the debt to themselves if they should consider that to be appropriate.

I heard further submissions on the matter on 21 August 1997. Two questions arose which required further consideration and counsel sought and obtained leave to address these by written submissions. The questions were whether - it had been established that Ms Milicevic was an assignee of the solicitor's right to recover costs; or a successor to a firm of solicitors in receivership is entitled to sign a bill of costs on behalf of the solicitor.

Under the [Legal Profession Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s194.html), a bill of costs must be signed by the solicitor or his or her partner or employee. [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s173.html) of the Act defines, for the purpose of the relevant Part of the [Legal
Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), that a reference to a solicitor includes: "(a) a person who was a ... solicitor when the legal services concerned were provided; or the assignee of a ... solicitor; or ... the receiver of a solicitor's property appointed under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p8) ...".

Mr Beale, for the plaintiff, argues that Ms Milicevic is the assignee of the solicitor and so may sign the bill. The word "assignee" can mean different things. In particular, in this Act, it could mean assignee of the costs or assignee of the solicitor's practice. I can find no actual guidance as to the meaning of the word. The definition has been in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s173.html) in some form or other since it was first enacted in 1987. However, it seems consistently with what is in the other paragraphs of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s173.html) that the expression must mean assignee of the solicitor's practice. One would not think that a factor, for instance, of a solicitor's bills would be a person who would be a solicitor who could sign a bill under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s198.html)
Accordingly, Ms Milicevic, who signed the bill, was able to do so for costs owing to Mr Radin.

Mr Willmott for the defendants, put that the deed of assignment did not assign to Mesdames Milicevic and Stefanovic any of the money due to the solicitor for completed work and that the probabilities are that the bill in the instant case was for completed work. That construction of the deed may well be correct, but for the reason I have just given that is irrelevant, if "assignee" means assignee of the solicitor's practice.

Mr Willmott then submits that if there was an assignment of the debt in respect of completed costs from the solicitor to Mesdames Milicevic and
Stefanovic, then there is no debt owing to Mr Radin which could be secured by the mortgage which is in question in the instant case. This must be correct.
However, as the debt is still in the solicitor and has not been assigned, the mortgage still covers the debt.

The situation thus is that the solicitor appears to have a mortgage. He has protected his mortgage by caveat. In the absence of a proper bill of costs, I would have removed the caveat. A proper bill of costs has now been filed and awaits assessment by the appropriate costs assessor. It seems to me in accordance with the agreement between the parties that the caveat should remain in place until that costs assessment process has been completed, save of course, that the defendants may lodge some substitute security.

I believe it is sufficient if I thus make no orders as to the caveat at this stage, publish these reasons and stand the matter over for mention on 5
February 1998 at 9.30 am so that the position can be kept under review. If that date is inconvenient to counsel, so long as they contact my Associate no later than 2 February 1998, some other date can be substituted.
