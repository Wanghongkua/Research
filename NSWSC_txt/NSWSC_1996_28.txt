JUDGE1
GLEESON CJ This is an application under [section 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) for leave to appeal against what is said to be an interlocutory judgment or order made by Magistrate Barnett in the course of certain committal proceedings in the Local Court.
The applicants, both men in middle age, are charged with numerous offences involving various forms of sexual misconduct against a complainant who turned thirteen on 21 March 1994. The complainant's allegations against the applicant
Colby are wide ranging and involve allegations of sexual activity extending over a lengthy period of time and bounded, if the allegations are true, by no limits on behaviour, other than physical possibility. On the other hand, the allegations against the applicant Kennedy are significantly narrower in that they relate to conduct involving the complainant, the applicant Kennedy and the applicant Colby, all of which occurred on a particular day which, according to the charges, fell somewhere between 21 March and 7 September .
It is common ground that those two dates, that is 21 March 1994 and 7
September 1994, were selected by the Crown for the purpose of framing the indictment for the reason that, according to the complainant, she was thirteen at the relevant time. It follows that the earliest date on which the events could have occurred was 21 March 1994 and the latest date was September , which was the date on which she complained to the authorities. I will return, in due course, to the significance of that period of approximately six months which, it should be remembered, is a period that fell during last year.
The applicants
Colby and Kennedy were charged respectively in September and November 1994. The committal proceedings were heard before Mr Barnett on June 1995, 27 June 1995, 28 June 1995, 25 August 1995 and 8 September 1995.
On the last mentioned date the applicants were committed for trial to the
District Court.
The applicants were furnished with a very lengthy statement by the complainant.
On 26 June 1995 they both applied for a direction pursuant to s
EA of the Justice Act 1902. Section 48E of the Justice Act, which is part of a series of provisions dealing with the conduct of committal proceedings, provides that the evidence in committal proceedings is to be conducted by way of written statements from witnesses, but that a magistrate, if satisfied that the interest of justice so require, may give a direction requiring the attendance at the proceedings, for cross-examination of the author of a statement.
The scheme of this legislation was discussed in the decision of the
Court of Appeal Kant versus The Director of Public Prosecutions (1994) A Cr R .
Shortly stated, although with sufficient accuracy for present purposes, the effect of a giving of a direction of the kind sought in the present case is that the written statement is not admissible in evidence in the committal proceedings unless the author of the statement attends to give oral evidence and be cross-examined. Section 48EA provides that in the case of certain types of proceeding, of which the present is an example, the magistrate shall not give a direction of the kind earlier mentioned unless satisfied that there are special reasons why such a direction should be given.
The learned magistrate on 27 June 1995, giving reasons, declined to make a direction of the kind sought by the applicants. However, his reasons made it clear that he was influenced by an offer on the part of the prosecuting authorities to supplement the complainant's written statement by a further written statement. On that basis the matter was not further pursued at that stage.
Subsequently an additional written statement was obtained from the complainant and copies were furnished to the applicant. The committal proceedings continued but, on 25 August , the applicant made a further application for a direction pursuant to ss 48E and 48EA.
The merits of that application were fully argued and, once again, the magistrate declined to give a direction. The committal proceedings were then pursued to completion and, as was noted earlier, on 8 September 1995 the applicants were committed for trial.
It is convenient at this stage to make some brief observations as to the basis upon which the applicants claim that this was a proper case for the making of a direction.
The argument in this regard is concentrated upon the allegations of the complainant concerning the events of the day on which she allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both applicants together. As was noted above, according to the charges this day was some time between 21 March and 7 September 1994.
According to the statement of the complainant, as it was explained to this court, the complainant only ever met the applicant Kennedy on three occasions, and on two of those occasions nothing untoward occurred.
The occasion the subject of the charges involved a visit by the applicant Colby and the complainant to Sydney. Most of the events the subject of the charges were said to have occurred at a motel which she thought was at Bankstown, although it may possibly in another locality where there was an airport. I gather from what we were told in argument that some other information in the case suggests there may have been a beach near the airport and it could be that the complainant was referring to Mascot airport.
 .
However that may be, it is plainly important, from the point of view of the applicants, that before the trial commences they should be in possession of the most specific information that can be given to them as to the date or occasion on which the complainant alleges the relevant events occurred. As was emphasised in argument before the learned magistrate, issues of alibi may become important.
Fairness clearly dictates that before the trial commences the Crown and the complainant should inform the applicants in a manner that can be relied upon by the applicants and, if necessary, used at the trial, of the best information that the complainant is in a position to give as to the time of these events involving the visit to the motel.
It was mentioned earlier that these events only occurred a little over a year ago. We are not dealing here with a case of the kind sometimes encountered where a person complains of sexual activity that occurred many years previously in circumstances where it would be unreasonable to expect that the person could have anything like a clear recollection of the date.
These events occurred between March and September 1994 and, unless the complainant was a person possessed of a singular degree of sangfroid, must have been found by her to be memorable.
The existing statements of the complainant do not distinctly say that the information contained in them is the best information she can give concerning the time of these events. It may be that in truth the information in the statements is the best information she can give but, if that is the case, then fairness dictates that the applicants should have the Crown or the complainant formally say so.
If, on the other hand, the complainant is in a position to give more comprehensive information about that matter, then the applicants ought to have the information before the trial commences.
To that extent there was merit in the application made to the magistrate.
On the other hand, as at present advised I would have little sympathy with an attempt on the part of the applicants to go further and to engage in some kind of wide ranging examination of the complainant about her allegations generally. In the limited respect that I have mentioned, however, I have substantial sympathy with what the lawyers representing the applicants were seeking to achieve.
The threshold question for this court, however, is whether this is a case which falls within [s 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). That in turn depends upon whether the decision of the magistrate, to use a neutral expression, declining to give a direction under ss 48E and 48EA amounted to an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of [s 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
In my view it did not. It is important to bear in mind the precise legal character of the learned magistrate's decision.
He was being asked to make a direction under <case> and the considerations relevant to his power to make such a direction are those set out in <case>. The statute obliged him not to give a direction unless he was satisfied of certain matters and, having heard argument, he expressed the view that he was not satisfied of those matters. In consequence he was obliged by the terms of the statute not to give the direction and, accordingly, he declined to give the direction.
The primary submission advanced on behalf of the applicants was that what was involved was, at least in a negative sense, an interlocutory order.
Alternatively it was submitted that this was an interlocutory judgment.
In my view the court is constrained to reject both of those submissions.
There have been a number of authorities dealing with the expression "interlocutory judgment or order" in [s 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). The cases most directly in point are R versus Pouch [(1988) 14 NSWLR 136]; and R v
Steffan (1993) 16 A Cr R 506.
What was involved in the present case was a ruling or decision in relation to an application for a direction. It is to be remembered that if the direction had been given it would not have had the legal effect of an order compelling the complainant to attend for cross-examination. A complainant in a sexual case might have very good reason for being unwilling to attend to be cross-examined on a witness statement in committal proceedings. If the complainant in the present case, after the making of such a direction, simply declined to give oral evidence, the consequence of that would have been that her statement would not have been available to be read in evidence by the prosecution. That in turn may well have resulted in a discharge of the applicants and a failure of the committal proceedings. We have not investigated all the other evidence there might be in the present case.
I should add that a conclusion that the matter does not fall within [s 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) does not mean that persons in the position of the present applicants are in a proper case without remedy. Kant versus Director of
Public
Prosecutions provides an illustration of an application that was made to a judge in the Administrative Law Division of the Supreme
Court for the purpose of obtaining relief on administrative law grounds in relation to a decision that was made under <case> of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/). I am not intending to express any developed opinion on whether or not, if that course had been taken in the present case, it would have been proper to grant relief to the applicants. Indeed, I would hope that what I have earlier said would make it unnecessary for the applicants to consider taking that course because I would hope that what has been said will produce the consequence that the prosecuting authorities, before the commencement of any trial in the District Court, will provide the applicants with the additional information to which I have referred, or, alternatively, a formal statement to the effect that there is no further or better information about the relevant subject matter that can be provided to the applicants.
For the reasons that I have given I do not consider that the Court has jurisdiction to grant leave under <case>. I find it unnecessary to embark upon the question whether this would have been a proper case for leave had there been power to grant leave. The Court has a long-standing and understandable reluctance to intervene in committal proceedings. It is unnecessary to elaborate upon the reasons for that reluctance. It suffices for present purposes to say that even if juristiction under <case> had been found, there would have been a substantial question to be considered as to whether this was an appropriate case for the granting of leave to appeal.
I would propose that the application be dismissed.
JUDGE2
KIRBY P The stumbling block for the applicants is the requirement, to find jurisdiction in this Court, that there be an interlocutory "judgment or order" as [s 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) provides.
As the Chief Justice has pointed out, that phrase has been the subject of not inconsiderable authority over the years since its introduction. In some cases, the Court has been able to avoid a conclusive determination, being of the view that leave would in any case be refused and that it was therefore unnecessary to determine the quality of the decision (to use a neutral term).
See e.g. R versus Anderson, unreported, CCA, New South Wales, 12 October 1989; R v
Waterhouse (1992) 62 A Cr R 59 (NSWCCA), 61.

However, in a number of cases, decisions of the Court have explained the rather narrow meaning of the words used. Those decisions bind us. See e.g. R v
Pouch [(1988) 14 NSWLR 136 (CCA)]; R v
Rogerson (1990) 45 A Cr R 253 (CCA) at 254; and R versus Steffan (1993) 67 A Cr R (CCA).
The case closest to the present, which it was suggested gave comfort to the applicants, was R versus Baker, unreported, CCA, New South Wales, 5 April 1993.
That case involved the grant of leave against the refusal of the trial judge to provide an adjournment of a trial conducted in the Supreme Court at
Grafton. It was pointed out, in the course of the decision of the Court, that the purpose of the application had actually been to procure a change of the venue of the trial from Grafton to Sydney. The case was in some ways in point.
But the point which has been argued at length in the present applications was not fully argued in that case. It is difficult to rely upon that decision in the face of the line of clear authority expressed in Pouch, Edelsten, Rogerson and Steffan.
No stable principles could be suggested by the applicants to distinguish their case from the variety of interlocutory decisions which have been held to be outside the statutory phrase "interlocutory judgment or order". Quite apart from the decisions on [s 5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html), that phrase is one not unknown to the law as the large collection of cases dealing with it in Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, vol 26, p 2440 demonstrates.
It is arguable, in a case such as the present, that there ought to be a facility for applications for leave to appeal to this Court, and a facility of appeal as of right by the Crown. After all, such a facility could be appropriately controlled by the Court by the usual requirement of a grant of leave under [s 5F.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) It is already open to an accused person to proceed under the general law for relief as is demonstrated by what was done by the accused in
Kant versus Director of Public Prosecutions (1994) 73 A Cr R 481 (CA) where the accused proceeded to the Administrative Law Division and, on appeal, to the
Court of Appeal.
It is possible that Parliament intended this differentiation in order to reinforce the discouragement of interlocutory appeals to this Court. As the
Chief Justice has pointed out, the reluctance of appellate courts generally, and this Court in particular, to interfere in committal proceedings is well established and supported by strong authority.
On the other hand, there are reasons of principle which would suggest that it would be preferable that such provision for review as exists should be retained in the Court of Criminal Appeal rather than being afforded elsewhere in the legal system.
A somewhat analogous problem to the one now before this Court arose in the
Court of Appeal in respect of applications from appeals in the District
Court.
It was held that [s 128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s128.html) of the [District Court Act, 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), as originally enacted, provided no facility for appeals from rulings, orders, directions or decisions given in proceedings ancillary to actions in that court. See Clutha
Developments Pty Ltd versus Barry [(1989) 18 NSWLR 86 (CA).] See also National
Employers' Mutual General Insurance Limited versus Manufacturers' Mutual Insurance
Limited [(1989) 17 NSWLR 223 (CA).]
Subsequently, perhaps as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Barry, [s 128(5)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s128.html) of the [District Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) was enacted permitting appeals from proceedings interlocutory to the principal action. But such appeals may only be brought with the leave of the Supreme Court.
That reform has not produced a flood of applications to the Court of
Appeal. That court and this Court know well the need for restraint in reviewing the wide range of interlocutory rulings which must be made in the course of trials, civil or criminal. Yet in the exceptional case, the facility of an appeal by leave could occasionally be of benefit.
In parting with this case, it is important to say that Parliament has specifically contemplated that in some cases there will be "special reasons" for the grant of a direction under <case> of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). It would, in my view, be quite wrong to administer that section as if no exceptional facility were provided permitting a direction that the alleged victim of the offence should attend proceedings to give oral evidence.
It is to be hoped that the suggestion made by the Chief Justice in the course of his reasons will lead to the resolution of the main reason that appears to have brought this application to this Court today. It is possible, alternatively, that the applicants may approach the Administrative Law
Division and/or the Court of Appeal for orders. I agree with the order which the Chief Justice has proposed with the comfortable knowledge that the applicants have that alternative facilities available to them if the suggestions made by the Chief Justice bear no fruit.
However, it has to be accepted that such proceedings will involve additional expense to the applicants and to the legal system generally.
This is to be regretted. They also involve the prospect of proceedings in the Supreme Court which, arguably, would be better sited in this Court. If oral committals are to continue in this State, it may be expected that the outcome of this case will have the attention of Parliament as did the earlier outcome of Barry in the Court of
Appeal.
I agree with the order proposed.
