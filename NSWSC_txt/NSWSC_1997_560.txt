JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff in 3844/96 is the daughter-in-law of the first defendant, Lucille Hodgson, and the wife of the second defendant, Thomas Hodgson. She says that, up to September 1995, the defendants were the registered proprietors of property at Kirribilli and that there were various transactions put through since then which altered the situation. She claims that the first defendant is estopped from asserting, as against her, that the first defendant had any equitable or financial interest in the property or the proceeds of sale of such property. She also claims that her husband is precluded from denying that he was entitled to be the holder of the balance of the proceeds of sale of such property. The parties are at issue in that suit. 
In proceedings which commenced in the Family Court and which have been transferred to this court by order of Justice John Cohen (see his reasons for judgment of 24 October 1997), the husband seeks relief against the wife, not only in respect of this property but generally.

There was a motion before Master McLaughlin in 3844/96 to stay the proceedings as they were essentially a matrimonial cause. The learned Master made that order and there is listed before me today an appeal from that decision. The
Master's judgment was given on 14 May 1997.

Things have changed since the Master gave his decision, in that the Family
Court has transferred the matter before it to this court. The reasons of his
Honour were that that was mainly to ensure that the merits of the matter were dealt with and that technicalities did not get in the way of the determination of the merits. His Honour considered that the proceedings should be consolidated.

Mr Archer, who appears for the wife, asks that the proceedings be consolidated. However, after discussion, I think it is fair to say that Mr
Archer has not put forward that submission other than as under a duty to do so. There is a general reluctance of this court to consolidate proceedings.
Particularly, there is a problem in consolidation where one set of proceedings is under the general law and one is under the [Family Law Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/). This is that an appeal from the general law suit lies to the Court of Appeal, whereas an appeal from the Family Court proceedings probably lies to the Full Family
Court.

I struck this problem before in Sapir versus Sapir (No 2) [(1989) 13 Fam
LR 362.] The matter was there resolved by hearing the evidence in both proceedings together, with evidence in one suit being evidence in the other, not consolidating them and giving two separate judgments. Of course, the findings of fact in each judgment are exactly the same. This does not completely remove the problems, as the standards of review by the two appellate courts may be different on findings of fact, but for all practical purposes does so.

I will not make any actual order at the moment because this matter and the related matter will be placed in my expedition list on 13 February 1998 after all the evidence has been filed. However, my present feeling is that when the proceedings are heard, both of these proceedings should be heard at one and the same time. Skill will have to be exercised by the presiding judge to make sure that if a person only wants to be involved in one of the suits, that person's interests will not be unduly prejudiced by being involved in only part of the case. Of course, any party taking such a course always does so with some risk.

Accordingly, I decline to consolidate the proceedings. I have made orders as to the filing of affidavits. The parties will make a motion for expedition in both proceedings. The "mother-in-law" will be filing a notice of motion in both proceedings to have them put in the expedition list on 13 February 1998.
Depending upon what proceedings in that list are more urgent than the present case, the proceedings will probably be fixed, if everyone is ready, for some time in April 1998.

I formally allow the appeal, which has now become virtually otiose in view of what has happened in the Family Court. I set aside the Master's orders and the costs of both parties both before the Master and before me are to be their costs in 3844/96.
