Appeal dismissed
JUDGE1
SHELLER JA On Tuesday 13 June 1995 the appellant, Neil Joseph
Lethlean, was arraigned before Acting Judge Job QC on a charge under <case> of the [Crimes
Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of obtaining money by a false statement. The Crown alleged that the appellant between 23 March and 7 April 1993 with intent to obtain for himself a financial advantage, namely a retrenchment benefit, published a statement that he had been retrenched by his employer,
Tamworth City Council, on the ground that his employment was not necessary and his position was not to be refilled, which he knew to be false in a material particular. On the appellant's application, consented to by the Crown, Judge Job heard the case without a jury.
 
CERTIFICATE UNDER SECTION 5F (3) (b)
The Crown case opened on 13 June and closed on 27 June 1995 when the appellant submitted that there was no case to answer. Judge Job refused this application. His Honour said he had carefully considered all the matters the appellant's counsel had put to him and had been through the authorities. I am of the view that there is a case to answer and it is a case which I will not stop at this stage." After a short adjournment the appellant indicated he wished to appeal pursuant to [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) (3) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) and applied for a certificate under para (b). Judge Job granted the certificate, he said, "reluctantly". The grounds of appeal set out in the judge's certificate were: "1. That it is contended that I have erred in law in determining that there is a prima facie case at the close of the Crown case on the charge set out in the indictment herein.
That it is contended that I have erred in law on the true construction on the definition of "retrenchment" in the [State
Authorities Superannuation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sasa1987389/).
That it is contended that I have erred in law in holding that the evidence at the close of the Crown case would permit me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not retrenched within the meaning of that term as used in the [State
Authorities Superannuation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sasa1987389/).
That it is contended that I have erred in law in holding that the evidence at the close of the Crown case would permit me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the said statement was false in a material particular at the time of publication by him.
That it is contended that I have erred in law in holding that the evidence at the close of the Crown case would permit me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused published the said statement to the State Authorities
Superannuation Board."
Section 5F, so far as presently material, provides as follows: "(1)
This section applies to: proceedings ... for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court....
 
The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or an order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.

Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings: if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal; or if the judge, justice, justices or magistrate of the Court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal.
 
An appeal under this section shall ... be determined on the evidence (if any) given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates.

The Court of Criminal Appeal may: affirm or vacate the judgment or order appealed against; or give or make an interlocutory judgment or order instead of the judgment or order appealed against.

If leave to appeal under this section is refused by the
Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal does not preclude any other appeal following a conviction on the matter to which the refused application for leave to appeal related." 
INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OR ORDER .
The Crown took the preliminary point that the appeal was not against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings.
The Crown submitted that what his Honour said did not amount to a judgment or order.
Section 5F was inserted by Act No 251 of 1987 because of legislative concern that applications for stays of indictments by reason of abuse of process were being determined in the Court of Appeal by application for prerogative relief under the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) rather than by the Court of Criminal Appeal. This legislative history encouraged the reading down of the unqualified words of subs ; R versus Edelsten [(1989) 18 NSWLR 213.] at 348 Gleeson CJ said that the decision in Edelsten was not authority for the proposition that the only form of interlocutory judgment or order to which s5F applies is one made following an application for stay of proceedings. "On the other hand, as other cases have demonstrated, it does not follow that every ruling or direction given before or during the running of a trial may be the subject of an appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, under OF" In R versus Powch [(1988) 14 NSWLR 136] this Court held that there was no appeal under s5F against a refusal by the trial judge to direct that a witness be recalled so that he might be further cross examined. At 138 Yeldham J, with whose judgment Carruthers and Wood JJ agreed, said: "In my opinion, a ruling by a judge that evidence should or should not be admitted would not come within the expression 'an interlocutory judgment or order' so as to enable the party aggrieved to seek leave to appeal during the course of a trial to this Court.
Such an entitlement notwithstanding the provision concerning the granting of leave, would give rise to the very evils which judges of this Court have on many occasions referred to when declining, in the exercise of their discretion, to entertain applications for declarations concerning procedure in matters part-heard in lower courts. So, also in my opinion, the ruling of Newman J that the witness could not be recalled for further cross examination is no more than that, that is to say, a ruling on a procedural matter, and is not in any sense an interlocutory judgment or order."
R versus Groves (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 April 1990 was an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s5F from a decision of the
District Court refusing a permanent stay of proceedings against the applicant.
One ground was that the further prosecution of the applicant would be an abuse of process in that he could not lawfully be convicted on the evidence proposed to be adduced by the Crown as indicated in the committal proceedings and two previous trials. The applicant's submissions were that the identification evidence was so weak that the trial judge would reject it in the exercise of his discretion on the basis that its probative weight was outweighed by its prejudicial effect or alternatively rule that it was so tenuous that there was no case which could be left to the jury. At 11 - 12 the Court said: "The applicant faces a difficulty in seeking to raise either proposition in this case by way of an application for leave to appeal under s5F. First, the trial judge was not invited to rule on the admissibility of the evidence or to exercise the discretion in question, nor was he asked to rule that there would be insufficient evidence to go to the jury. Had he made any such ruling at the commencement of or during the trial, it would not have been amenable to an appeal under s5F ;
R v
Edelsten and R versus Powch. It is difficult to see why the applicant should be permitted to have an appellate court review a decision refusing to stay the further prosecution of the proceedings on these grounds, when they were not taken before the trial judge, and when the relevant rulings during the trial could not have been reviewed save by appeal after conviction pursuant to [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/)."
In R versus Rogerson [(1990) 45 A Crim R 253] at 255 Gleeson CJ, with whose judgment Wood and Brownie JJ agreed, said that a judge's refusal to accede to an application that he should disqualify himself was not an interlocutory judgment or order concerning which an appeal would lie under [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) and that the
Court should follow Barton versus Walker [(1979) 2 NSWLR 740.] In Barton versus Walker the
Chief Judge of the Criminal Division had refused a "request" to disqualify himself from further hearing the matter. The appellants filed a summons in the
Court of Appeal seeking leave to appeal pursuant to [s101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s101.html) (2) (e) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). The appellants did not suggest that the decision was a judgment but submitted it was an interlocutory order. At 747 Samuels JA, with whom Reynolds and Glass JJA agreed, said: "The order, which the appellants contend was made, was not entered, despite the terms of the [Supreme Court Rules 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt 41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p41), r 11 (1) (d). However, the only formal disposal of the proceedings which could have occurred was his Honour's decision to reject the appellants' request; and, if that request were an application in the strict sense, then that decision would certainly have. constituted an order: Maxwell v
Keun [(1928) 1 KB 645] 
The matter is best approached, therefore, by considering whether the appellants' request (as I have called it for need of some general term) amounted to a justiciable application.
If the appellants were seeking to make an interlocutory application 'in or for the purposes of or in relation to' the proceedings commenced by their statement of claim, they should have made it by motion [(Pt 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/s19.html), r 1) of which, in the ordinary case, notice should have been given. No notice of motion was filed. But it is not uncommon for the Court to entertain a motion for certain orders without notice, and it may be that in the present case the provisions of [Pt 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p19), r 2 (a), or, impliedly of r 2 (2) (d), could have applied."
At 749 his Honour said that it was a matter of real difficulty to conceive of an order directed by the judge to the judge forbidding himself to hear the case. Having considered the conceptual difficulties, at 750, his Honour said: "These considerations, in my view, clearly show that a motion to disqualify a judge of the Supreme Court is not cognizable.
The present informal practice is sensible and adequate; the absence of complaint by the profession or by the law reformers tends to show that it has not been abused."
R versus Watson; ex parte Armstrong <case>; [(1976) 136 CLR 248] was an application for prohibition against a Judge of the Family Court of Australia. A discretionary consideration was whether an appeal lay to the Full Court from the Judge's rejection of a submission that he should not hear the case. At 266 in the majority judgment their Honours said: "As to that submission no more need be said than that an appeal lies only from a 'decree' (s94 ), which means a 'decree, judgment or order' (s4 (1)), and a judge who simply continues to sit after it has been submitted that he is disqualified does not thereby make a 'decree'. No doubt an appeal could have been brought if the learned judge had finally given judgment in the matter, but it would obviously be inconvenient to allow him to complete the proceedings when he is disqualified to hear them."
In Barton at 751 Samuels JA referred to this passage from the majority judgment and said: "Nor does he make an order, I would think, if he announces that he will sit or gives reasons for deciding to do so.

I do not consider that any order was made in the present case from which an appeal can be brought."
R versus Steffan [(1993) 30 NSWLR 633] was an application for leave to appeal from the District Court against rulings made in advance of the trial that recordings of conversations between the applicant and another person were prima facie admissible and refusing to stay the proceedings. At 635-6 this
Court, before reviewing some of the earlier cases, said: ... it is instructive to consider first how the phrase and its component parts are ordinarily used. A judgment is the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court. An order is a command by a court that something be done (or not done). It is unnecessary in the present case to discuss the highly technical distinction between interlocutory and final judgments or orders. If the ruling on evidence in this case was either a judgment or order, it was clearly interlocutory in nature. It is not immediately self evident as a matter of ordinary usage how a ruling on the admissibility of evidence could be entered in the records of the court as a judgment or how it commands that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court. It is true that such a ruling may be accompanied (as it was here) by elaborate reasons which have been expressed in a document called a 'judgment', but that is an altogether different usage of the word judgment' and denotes the reasons which have been expressed rather than the formal act of the court."
At 639 the Court held that a ruling on evidence made or in advance of or in the course of the trial was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). In. coming to that conclusion the Court said that it was unable to accept obiter dicta expressed separately by Kirby P, Cripps JA and myself to the contrary in Chou, versus Director of Public
Prosecutions [(1992) 28 NSWLR 593] at 610, 621 and 618.
In Attorney General versus Stuart [(1994) 75 A Crim R 8], the Attorney General appealed, pursuant to [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) , against a magistrate's rejection of a claim of public interest immunity asserted by the Attorney General in answer to parts of a subpoena the respondent had served on the Commissioner of Police. At -13 Hunt CJ at CL said: "An order to a stranger to the proceedings that documents be produced to the Court following the rejection of a claim of public interest immunity is one which commands the stranger to do something. It may be entered in the Court record, and action may be taken upon it in the event that it is disobeyed.
For myself, I have no doubt that (it) is an interlocutory order within the meaning of [s5F.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) The fact that it is or may also amount to a ruling upon evidence does not exclude such an order from the terms of [s5F."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html)
The cases have set no bright line for differentiating between what are truly orders in the sense described in Steffan and
Stuart, and what are rulings, in the sense described in Powch, Groves and Rogerson. There is some similarity in the position of a judge who refuses to disqualify himself and allows the trial to proceed and a judge who is not persuaded that there is no case to answer and allows the trial to proceed. The reasoning of Samuels JA in
Barton versus Walker suggest one particular difference. In that case if the judge had acceded to the request his Honour would have regarded it as inappropriate to describe the decision not to sit as an order. I have some difficulty with this. An application to a judge in the course of a trial to disqualify himself or herself, would usually be part of an application for orders that the proceedings be stayed or adjourned to be heard before another judge.
However this may be, in a jury trial the consequence of a judge's conclusion that there is no case to answer would normally be a direction to the jury to acquit.
 
DIRECTION TO ACQUIT
Mr James QC, who argued the appellant's case, referred us to The King v
Snow <case>; [(1915) 20 CLR 315.] This case needs to be understood in its context, the ambit of the appellate jurisdiction granted to the High Court by [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s73.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and, in particular, the words in that section "appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders and sentences" of the Supreme Court of a State exercising federal jurisdiction. Jurisdiction was granted "with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes".
Section 35 (1) (b) of the Judiciary Act 1903-1912 provided that the appeal could be brought with the special leave of the High Court. At the conclusion of the Crown case, in a prosecution under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914, the trial judge directed the jury to return a verdict of "not guilty", which they did. The accused was ordered to be discharged from custody. The
Crown sought leave to appeal both from the judgment of acquittal and from the decision upon which the judge based his direction to the jury to find a verdict of "not guilty". One obstacle to the Crown's application was the absolute protection afforded at common law to a verdict of acquittal. Of the six judges who heard the appeal three, Griffiths CJ and Gavan Duffy and Rich
JJ, considered that there was no means by which this verdict could be set aside; see 322 and 364. Isaacs J found himself unable to insert into the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) any such exception; 351. See also Higgins J at 355 and Powers J at 373. Isaacs and Higgins JJ would have granted leave. However Powers
J held that as a matter of discretion leave to appeal should not be granted.
At 324 Griffiths CJ said of the argument that a direction of a judge to a jury on a point of law was an interlocutory judgment and appealable as such: "It is difficult to treat such an argument with gravity. It may be that the term judgment' is sometimes applied colloquially to such a pronouncement but I affirm with confidence that, for the purpose of discussion or description of the kind of determination from which an appeal may be brought, the term 'interlocutory judgment' has never been used by lawyers to denote a judge's verbal direction to a jury given in the course of a trial antecedent to verdict."
At 361 Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ said: "In our opinion the direction given by the Judge to the jury was not a judgment within the meaning of [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s73.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) or [s35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s35.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/): it was a mere statement of the law for the benefit of the jury on which they should have acted though they were not bound to do so. Had they chosen to ignore his direction and return a verdict of guilty, he could not have insisted on any other verdict. Nor was it a decision of the Court within the meaning of [s39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) (2) of the [Judiciary
Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), though that, for reasons which we shall presently state, is immaterial if it was not a judgment'. The result is that no appeal lies from the direction complained of."
To the contrary was the opinion of Isaacs J. At 345 he said: "It is objected that the decision of Gordon J was not an interlocutory judgment. Well, what was it? Was it not an act of the Court when the learned Judge took the case out of the hands of the jury, and intercepted them in the performance of their duty under [s80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)? If we are to look for precedent, the English Courts have never in such a case permitted substance to be strangled by form."
His Honour cited Lane versus Esdaile [(1891) AC 210] at 211 where Lord Halsbury
LC said, when considering whether, pursuant to s3 of the Appellate
Jurisdiction Act 1876, an appeal lay to the House of Lords from the Court of
Appeal's refusal to grant special leave to appeal from a judgment of the High
Court: "The words used are 'leave of the Court'; and although it may be that in some sense the leave of the Court, whether it is given or withheld, becomes an order (that I will not stay to discuss), that is not the ordinary mode in which it would be described. It is to be something that is done by the order of the Court. I confess myself that I should hesitate if it was only to turn upon the question of language, because although a thing might be called an order, or it might be called a judgment or might be called a rule, or might be called a decree, it might well be that nevertheless by reason of the context it would come within the obvious meaning and purpose of the statute; so that although it was no one of those things in name it might be one of those things in substance, and therefore would come within the general provision that an appeal should lie."
His Lordship was however driven by a consideration of the object and purview of the order, under which an appeal should lie to the House of Lords from any order or judgment of the Court of Appeal, to the conclusion that to give an appeal in such a case would defeat the object and purview of the order or rule itself. At 214 Lord Herschell said that whether an appeal should be permitted to the Court of Appeal was entrusted and intended to be entrusted to their discretion. "... the exercise of a discretion of that sort entrusted to them is not, within the true meaning of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, an order or judgment from which there can be an appeal." In Geogas SA versus Trammo
Gas Limited [(1991) 1 WLR 776] Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, with whom the other members of the House of Lords agreed, at 779, after referring to Lane v
Esdaile said that two points emerged from the speeches (1) that an exercise of a discretion to grant or refuse leave to appeal was not such an order as was contemplated in s3 of the Act of 1876 and (2) that no distinction fell to be drawn between an order refusing and an order granting leave to appeal.
In The King versus Snow, having concluded that an appeal lay from judgments of acquittal based on verdicts of juries, neither Higgins J nor Powers J needed to nor did they decide whether or not the trial judge's direction to the jury fell within the expression "judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences". The appellant relied upon the judgment of Isaacs
J. In reading this judgment one cannot overlook the time when it was written, the second half of 1915, and the passion with which it was written. At 330 his Honour spoke of the offence with which Snow was charged as "one of unparalleled gravity in the history of
Australia. The crime for which Carl Lody was shot was mild in comparison.
Though technically laid as an offence under the Statute, it was, in effect, one constituting both by common law and the Statute of Treasons an act of high treason." At 377-8 Powers J remarked: "In conclusion, after hearing the judgments just delivered by my brothers Isaacs and Higgins holding that we as a Court should, in this case, exercise our discretion and grant leave to appeal because, amongst other reasons, the nature of the offence in time of war lifts it out of ordinary cases, I think it right to add that, in my opinion, we have no right to adopt one practice in time of war and another in time of peace. ...

It is also necessary, I think, in time of war - when all members of this Court feel so strongly that no one guilty of supplying or attempting to supply the enemy with munitions of war or any material required for munitions of war for a miserable money consideration, or at all, should escape punishment - to remember that we have no right, as Justices of the High Court, to exercise a personal or arbitrary discretion, or consider our own personal feelings at all, but only to act according to law without fear or favour, and, in exercising the discretion reposed in us, only to exercise it judicially."
Undoubtedly, those members of the High Court who needed to decide the matter, Griffiths CJ and Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ, held that the direction given by the judge to the jury to return a verdict of "not guilty" was not a judgment within the meaning of [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s73.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). No more was it an order. It was a mere statement of the law for the benefit of the jury on which they should have acted though they were not bound to do so.
In my opinion the words used in s5F (3), "judgment or order" no more embrace a direction to the jury to acquit or the decision upon which that direction is based than the same words when used in [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s73.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
In the present case if the trial had been before a judge and jury and the judge had concluded that there was no case to answer and directed the jury to acquit, the direction would have been neither a judgment nor an order. Nor would a judge's statement that he would not give such a direction even though the judge might give lengthy reasons. It falls on that side of the line to which the
Chief Justice referred in Saunders at 348 when he said that it did not follow that every ruling or direction given before or during the running of a trial might be the subject of an appeal or an application for leave to appeal under s5F . I do not regard it as helpful to refer by way of example to other rulings or directions which might be said to fall into the same category.
 
TRIAL BY
JUDGE ALONE
However in this case there was no jury. The appellant was asking his
Honour to do something of a different character.
In a jury trial it is for the jury, not the judge, to convict or acquit. On the other hand where the trial is by a judge alone a submission that there is no case to answer is one effectively asking the judge to acquit. Had the judge acquitted there would have been a judgment. The question is does his refusal to do so on a no case application amount to a judgment. The appellant in making his application was not asking the judge to decide the case but to determine whether at that particular stage on the evidence as it stood the appellant could lawfully be convicted, a question of law; May versus O'Sullivan <case>;  <case>; [(1961) 106 CLR 166] the Delegate of the
Commissioner for Employees Compensation had disallowed an employee's claim for compensation under the Commonwealth
Employees Compensation Act 1930-1956. The employee appealed to the County Court from the Delegate's determination At the outset of the appeal the Commonwealth contended that the grounds of appeal were not open to the appellant in as much as the matter had been concluded against him by a certificate of a medical board appointed under the Act. The
County Court judge disallowed the submission and ordered the appeal to be set down for hearing. The Commonwealth appealed to the High Court. At 169 the
Court said: "An appeal does not lie from what the County Court then said or did unless it amounted to a judgment decree, order or sentence.
 
It is apparent from the description of the proceedings ... that what the County Court did was to rule upon a point of law which was raised in opposition to the appeal. If the County
Court had ruled against the employee who appealed to the
County
Court, the County Court might have dismissed that employee's appeal and that would have been an order. It might on the other hand have decided not then and there to dismiss his appeal but to hear more about it by way of explanation, or to enable another tribunal to pass judgment on the view which the learned judge adopted. What his Honour did was simply to give a ruling on a point of law which was raised.
It did not conclude the rights of the parties before the hearing of the case was completed.
The County Court judge might have altered his mind, he might have ruled otherwise, he might have qualified his ruling; there was no determination. It was something done in the course of the hearing. His Honour realised that and adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed. It did not in our opinion, amount to a judgment still less to a decree; it did not amount to an order and certainly not to a sentence. It is outside the terms of [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s73.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and this appeal has no foundation in any curial order which is appealable."
With this case Rees versus Kratzmann (1965) 114
CLR 63 should be contrasted.
In that case during the course of the public examination of a company director a direction was given that counsel for the liquidators should not be allowed to put a question and the director should not be required to answer on the ground that it did not arise from matters set out in the liquidators' report.
In order to give the liquidators an opportunity to test the ruling, the judge conducting the inquiry made a formal order directing that counsel be not allowed to put the question and that the director be not required to answer it; see 67. The High Court overruled an objection that the order appealed from was not a decree, order, judgment or sentence within [s73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s73.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/); .
 
CONCLUSION
In my opinion what Judge Job was asked to do in the present case, correctly categorised, was to rule upon a point of law raised during the hearing. This like a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is not within the meaning of s5F (3) an interlocutory judgment or order. This conclusion accords with the object and purview of the section and the decisions of the Court in
Powch, Groves, Rogerson and Steffan. Notwithstanding the inclusion, in the case of any party other than the Attorney General or the Director of Public
Prosecutions, of the need to obtain the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal or the certificate of the court of trial, the legislature should not be taken to have intended that the course of a criminal trial should be interrupted by appeals from rulings on law or evidence. In my opinion no appeal lay under s5F from Judge Job's decision that there was a case to answer.
I would uphold the jurisdictional point raised by the Crown and dismiss the appeal.
I would add that although, in the present case, the trial judge granted a certificate, in my opinion and with due respect, he clearly should not have done so. His Honour apparently had no doubt that he had ruled correctly and said he was prepared to grant the certificate with considerable reluctance. A certificate should be granted only if the trial judge considers there is substantial doubt about the interlocutory judgment given or order made and that it is convenient that the Court of Criminal Appeal resolve that doubt before the trial proceeds further. The trial judge should bear in mind the general disadvantages of appeals on interlocutory matters. These include that the appeal may ultimately prove to have been either unnecessary or an unnecessary duplication of the appeal process.
In view of my conclusion on the jurisdictional point and particularly bearing in mind that his Honour gave no reasons for his view that there was a case to answer and it was a case which he would not stop "at this stage", I think it undesirable that this Court express any view about the evidence beyond saying that, having paid careful attention to the submissions put by Mr
James, I was not persuaded that the view reached by his Honour at the time that he reached it was not open to him.
 
ORDER
I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.
JUDGE2
ALLEN J I agree with Sheller JA.
JUDGE3
HULME J I agree with Sheller JA that in the case there was no judgment or order - something with [s5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5f.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) makes mandatory before there can be an appeal. The case of Rees versus Kratzmann (1965)114 CLR 63 and a consideration of some of the matters canvassed in the decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeal referred to by Sheller JA indicates to me that whether, in a particular case, there is an order may often be a matter of form but, be that as it may, I am satisfied that in this case there was no judgment or order.
I agree also with Sheller JA's remarks concerning the grant of the certificate under s5F (3)(b) of the Act.
 .
I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.
