Haymek Pty Ltd versus Sjoquist & Anor /95 
Tuesday, 19 March 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks leave to discontinue these proceedings which it commenced on 10 October 1995 and in which it alleged various breaches by the defendants of fiduciary duties owed by them to Rock Eisteddfod Productions Pty Ltd as trustee of the Rock Eisteddfod Productions Trust, of which the plaintiff was and is a beneficiary as to a half interest. Also included in the proceedings were alleged breaches of s.52 of the Trade Practices Act relating to alleged representations relating to - and I speak in very general terms - the entitlement of the defendants to undertake certain activities.

Except in one respect the specific relief sought by the plaintiff in the proceedings was injunctive relief. Counsel for the plaintiff has explained that that was because no actual loss had been thought to have been suffered by the breaches relied on. The exception is in paragraph 8 of the summons where it is sought to have the amount of $30,000.00 by way of damages paid by the defendants to the trustee of the Rock Eisteddfod Productions Trust on the basis that that amount was in fact received by the defendants in consequence of one of the breaches relied on.

The proceedings were fixed for hearing to commence today, and this morning the plaintiff has sought leave to discontinue. The primary basis on which that leave is sought is that in consequence of the winding up of the company Rock
Eisteddfod Productions Pty Ltd and the sale by the new trustee of the Rock
Eisteddfod Productions Trust of what are said to be assets of the Trust (which the injunctive relief sought in these proceedings was sought to protect), the plaintiff has no continuing interest in pursuing those injunctive proceedings since the assets sought to be protected have passed to the defendants by virtue of the sale.

The principal question for decision is what terms should be imposed on the grant of leave to discontinue in relation to the costs of the proceedings and, as the argument has developed, it is, as it seems to me, a choice between ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendants' costs as from 23 November 1995 which was the date of the purported sale of the assets in question (which because of errors which have only recently been corrected may not have been an effective sale at that time) on the one hand, and the whole of the costs of the proceedings of the other. Costs are usually a difficult matter when proceedings are discontinued so that there is no opportunity to have a determination of the merits, but it seems to me that the general rule of practice is, or ought to be, that where a party elects to discontinue proceedings, then the costs of the proceedings should be paid to the other party, unless some good reason to the contrary is demonstrated. In the present case, although an explanation for the discontinuance at least of a substantial part of the proceedings (otherwise than on the merits) has been proffered and prima facie is plausible, nevertheless there is still subsisting a claim for compensation which the sale would not have precluded being pursued, and there is also the circumstance that as Mr Walton has put, claims of breach of a duty have been made against the defendants which if the proceedings are discontinued they will have no opportunity of refuting.

I must say that my mind has fluctuated during the argument, but I have reached the conclusion that I should in this case apply what I have referred to as the general rule of practice and impose a term that the plaintiff pay to the defendants their costs of the proceedings, without limitation as to date.
Relevant to this is the circumstance which was discussed during argument that at the time the proceedings were commenced the defendants and, in particular the first defendant, had ceased to have control of the trustee, which was the entity with most direct concern with any breaches of fiduciary duty by the defendants causing actual or potential loss to the trust, that entity having passed into the control of a provisional liquidator. This last matter is by no means the only consideration, but it is, as I have said, a relevant consideration.

Accordingly, the orders I make are as follows: Grant leave pursuant to Part 21 rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules to the plaintiff to discontinue the proceedings on the following terms.
 that the plaintiff pay to the defendants their costs of the proceedings; and that the plaintiff shall not be entitled to claim in any fresh proceedings relief based on the same or any substantially similar cause of action as any on which these proceedings are based.
