EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: In terms of the application to discharge the jury, just I suppose for the record, the considerations that I have, the advanced stage that the trial has reached, it is day 11, all of the most significant evidence has been given. There were quite considerable delays in getting some of the evidence before the Court and at least in part, I apprehend that that is because some of the witnesses were less than willing to come to court and give their evidence in answer to their subpoena. That is one of the features that I take into consideration when having regard to the determination of the application to discharge the jury.
The interests of the accused are of course a significant consideration, but it seems to me, particularly since he has the advantage of very experienced counsel coming into the matter to assist him that there is every likelihood can be ready to proceed within a reasonably short and an acceptably short period and that it seems to me is the preferable approach.
It is always in the interests of everyone to bring these matters to finalisation as quickly as can reasonably and justly be done, so, on that basis I refuse the application for a discharge of jury.
