JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
COMMERCIAL LIST  
Einstein J  
Friday 3 November 2006  /06 HIH Casualty & General Insurance Limited (in liquidation) versus R J Wallace sued on his own behalf and on behalf of all other members of Syndicate No 683 at Lloyd's of London for the 1993 underwriting account & Ors  
JUDGMENT  
The proceedings  By Commercial List Statement filed on 1 June 2006, HIH Casualty &
General Insurance Limited (in liquidation) has instituted proceedings against
Lloyds Syndicate 683 in relation to a series of primary, first and third excess layer quota share policies of reinsurance for the policy years -1997. The proceedings involve 15 separate quota share policies of reinsurance.  The substantive issue concerns the question whether or not, on the proper construction of the policies, HIH needs to have actually paid out its underlying insureds before it is entitled to be indemnified under the terms of its reinsurances with Syndicate 683 ["the pay as paid out issue"]. This issue is described in the Commercial List Statement in the following terms:  "Whether, contrary to the analysis of the House of Lords in Charter
Reinsurance Co Ltd versus Fagan [[1997] AC 313], the payment by the plaintiff to its insureds is a condition precedent to its right to recover from the defendants the balances confirmed from time to time to be owing by the defendants to the plaintiff under the Contracts as detailed in Schedule ."  The related issues identified in the Commercial List Statement as likely to arise in the proceedings are stated to be as follows:  i. The proper construction of the Contracts.  ii. Whether the failure of each of the defendants to pay to the plaintiff the balances detailed in Schedule 2 is a breach of the Contracts.  iii. Amount payable.  In terms of relief sought, HIH seeks the payment by Syndicate 683 of the balances claimed to be confirmed to be owing to HIH and said to be as furnished in quarterly summary accounts presented to the Syndicate in accordance with Article X of the policies. Those quarterly balances in respect of each of the 15 policies are said to be set out in Schedule 2 to the
Commercial List Statement.  
The significance of the issue  The point raised in the present case is a short but important one of construction. It is however of high significance.  Mr McGrath, one of the joint liquidators of HIH, has given evidence that:  i. the resolution of the 'pay as paid issue' not only affects the possible recovery of $53.9 million from Syndicate 683 but also the recovery of other uncollected amounts from other reinsurers on the reinsurance contracts the subject of these proceedings and other similar reinsurance contracts.  ii. the Liquidators estimate that at a minimum $212 million of reinsurance recoveries from reinsurers could be affected by resolution of the pay as paid issue in relation to the reinsurance contracts obtained by HIH C&G for its professional indemnity business. [This estimate comprises $56 million of unpaid balances due from reinsurers less an estimated amount of $5 million in relation to amounts possibly paid by HIH C&G to insureds prior to provisional liquidation and $161 million in outstanding loss reserves. The estimate does not include an amount for incurred but not yet reported claims, which could be substantial].  iii. resolution of the 'pay as paid issue' could also affect the recovery of amounts from other reinsurers on other reinsurance contracts. On his evidence liquidators estimate is that as at 30 June 2006:  a) in total, for HIH C&G, there are $487.3 million in possible recoveries from reinsurers, comprising $139.4 million of unpaid balances owing by reinsurers and $347.9 million in outstanding loss reserves. This estimate (which includes the figures referred to in paragraph 22) does not include an amount for incurred but not yet reported claims, which could be substantial.  b) in total for all HIH Companies, there are $650.2 million in possible recoveries from reinsurers, comprising $199.4 million of unpaid balances owing by reinsurers and $450.8 million in outstanding loss reserves, this estimate not including an amount for incurred by not yet reported claims.  iv. the Liquidators consider the potential impact of the pay as paid issue on not only the liquidation of the licensed insurers within the HIH and FAI groups, but also possible future insurance company insolvencies to be extremely important.  v. the potential denial of the access of creditors to reinsurance assets that form part of an insurance company's solvency requirements, once the company has entered formal insolvency, may well have serious regulatory implications.  
The Notice of Motion seeking a stay of proceedings  As at the present time no defence has been filed for the reason that by notice of motion filed on 13 July 2006, Syndicate 683 sought orders that the proceedings be stayed pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) (Cth) or, in the alternative, pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s53.html) of the [Commercial Arbitration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) or in the further alternative, at common law pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.  
The provisions of the material instruments  It is convenient to commence by setting out the material provisions of the sundry instruments/legislation falling to be considered on the hearing of the instant motion.  [Section 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/)  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) provides as follows:  
Where:  the procedure in relation to arbitration under an arbitration agreement is governed, whether by virtue of the express terms of the agreement or otherwise, by the law of a Convention country;  the procedure in relation to arbitration under an arbitration agreement is governed, whether by virtue of the express terms of the agreement or otherwise, by the law of a country not being Australia or a Convention country, and a party to the agreement is Australia or a State or a person who was, at the time when the agreement was made, domiciled or ordinarily resident in Australia;  a party to an arbitration agreement is the Government of a Convention country or of part of a Convention country or the Government of a territory of a Convention country, being a territory to which the Convention extends; or  a party to an arbitration agreement is a person who was, at the time when the agreement was made, domiciled or ordinarily resident in a country that is a Convention country;  this section applies to the agreement.  
Subject to this Part, where:  proceedings instituted by a party to an arbitration agreement to which this section applies against another party to the agreement are pending in a court; and  the proceedings involve the determination of a matter that, in pursuance of the agreement, is capable of settlement by arbitration;  on the application of a party to the agreement, the court shall, by order, upon such conditions (if any) as it thinks fit, stay the proceedings or so much of the proceedings as involves the determination of that matter, as the case may be, and refer the parties to arbitration in respect of that matter.  
Where a court makes an order under subsection (2), it may, for the purpose of preserving the rights of the parties, make such interim or supplementary orders as it thinks fit in relation to any property that is the subject of the matter to which the first-mentioned order relates.  
For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), a reference to a party includes a reference to a person claiming through or under a party.  
A court shall not make an order under subsection (2) if the court finds that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  'Arbitration agreement' is defined in [s3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s3.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) to mean:  'an agreement in writing of the kind referred to in sub-article 1 of Article
II of the Convention.'  The 'Convention' is defined in [s3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s3.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) to mean:  "the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards adopted in 1958 by the United Nations Conference on International Commercial
Arbitration at its twenty-fourth meeting, a copy of the English text of which is set out in Schedule 1".  Article II of the Convention provides:  
ARTICLE II 
Each Contracting State shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration. 
The term "agreement in writing" shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. 
The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  [Insurance Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/)   [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) provides that:  "A provision in a contract of insurance or other contract or agreement, being a provision with respect to the submission to arbitration of any matter arising out of the contract of insurance, does not bind the insured except where the provision is contained in a contract or agreement, entered into after a difference or dispute has arisen between the insurer and the insured, providing for the submission to arbitration of that difference or dispute."  [Section 53](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s53.html) of the [Commercial Arbitration Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/)  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s53.html) of the [Commercial Arbitration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) provides:  
If a party to an arbitration agreement commences proceedings in a court against another party to the arbitration agreement in respect of a matter agreed to be referred to arbitration by the agreement, that other party may, subject to subsection (2), apply to that court to stay the proceedings and that court, if satisfied:  that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement, and  that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration,  may make an order staying the proceedings and may further give such directions with respect to the future conduct of the arbitration as it thinks fit.  
An application under subsection (1) shall not, except with the leave of the court in which the proceedings have been commenced, be made after the applicant has delivered pleadings or taken any other step in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance.  
Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, a party to an arbitration agreement shall not be entitled to recover damages in any court from another party to the agreement by reason that that other party takes proceedings in a court in respect of the matter agreed to be referred to arbitration by the arbitration agreement.  [It is appropriate to highlight an important distinction between the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) and the [Commercial Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) namely that, where the former applies and a dispute relevantly falls within the scope of the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement, a stay of proceedings is mandatory whereas under the [Commercial Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/), a stay is discretionary]  
The material terms of the Reinsurance Treaties  These reasons require to deal with certain issues concerning the treaty wording is insofar as the provisions dealing with arbitration are concerned.
Without intending to presently treat with the cross-contentions in that regard, it is convenient to observe that the relevant provisions are in articles XVIII and XIX of the Primary Treaty Wording [together the 'arbitration clauses']. For present purposes the arbitration clauses may be assumed to have provided as follows:  
ARTICLE XVIII 
SERVICE OF SUIT  
The Reinsurer hereon agrees that:-  i. In the event of a dispute arising under this Agreement, the Reinsurers at the request of the Company will submit to the jurisdiction of any competent
Court in the Commonwealth of Australia. Such dispute shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice applicable in such Court.  ii. Any summons notices or process to be served upon the Reinsurer may be served upon  
MESSRS. FREEHILL, HOLLINGDALE & PAGE 
M.L.C. CENTRE, 
MARTIN PLACE, SYDNEY, 
N.S.W. 2000 AUSTRALIA  who has authority to accept service and to enter an appearance on the
Reinsurer's behalf, and who is directed, at the request of the Company to give a written undertaking to the Company that he will enter an appearance on the
Reinsurer's behalf.  iii. If a suit is instituted against any one of the Reinsurers all Reinsurers hereon will abide by the final decision of such Court or any competent
Appellate Court.  
ARTICLE XIX 
ARBITRATION:  
Disputes arising out of this Agreement or concerning its validity shall be submitted to the decision of a Court of Arbitration, consisting of three members, which shall meet in Australia.  
The members of the Court of Arbitration shall be active or retired executives of Insurance or Reinsurance Companies.  
Each party shall nominate one arbitrator. In the event of one party failing to appoint its arbitrator within four weeks after having been required by the other party to do so, the second arbitrator shall be appointed by the
President of the Chamber of Commerce in Australia. Before entering upon the reference, the arbitrators shall nominate an umpire. If the arbitrators fail to agree upon an umpire within four weeks of their own appointment, the umpire shall be nominated by the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Australia.  
The Arbitrators shall reach their decision primarily in accordance with the usages and customs of Reinsurance practice and shall be relieved of all legal formalities. They shall reach their decision within four months of the appointment of the umpire.  
The decision of the Court of Arbitration shall not be subject to appeal.  
The costs of Arbitration shall be paid as the Court of Arbitration directs.  
Actions for the payment of confirmed balances shall come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts.   The following matters may be noted:  i. apart from one provision, the wordings applicable to each of the reinsurance treaties are in almost identical terms. An article concerning contingent commission is included in the wording for the primary layer and the first excess layer (article VII), but is not included in the wording for the third excess layer. That article has no relevance to the outcome of any issue arising from the motion;  ii. the business reinsured by HIH pursuant to the reinsurance treaties was the net liability of HIH arising out of loss occurrences under HIH's professional indemnity and professional liability policies commencing during the term of each of the reinsurance treaties (article III);  iii. pursuant to each of the reinsurance treaties, HIH ceded to the Syndicate a particular identified percentage of the net retained liability of HIH, not exceeding an identified amount for any one policy and any one risk being that "layer" of insurance (eg. the primary layer which does not exceed the first $1 million) (article V);  iv. the wording for each of the reinsurance treaties contains provisions concerning amounts payable by the Syndicate to HIH. Those provisions appear in articles IX and X and provide, in part, as follows:  
LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES: 
The Company [HIH] will settle all losses incurred under its Policies and such settlements shall be binding on the Reinsurer in proportion to its participation in this Agreement. In addition, the reinsurer will be liable for its pro-rata share of expenses incurred by the Company [HIH] in connection with such losses. The reinsurer is entitled to, and will be paid or credited with, any amounts the Company recovers as salvage. The reinsurer agrees to reimburse the Company [HIH] promptly when so requested by the Company for losses paid by the Company [HIH]. Requests for such reimbursement must be accompanied by an executed reinsurance proof of loss. Alternatively, losses shall be handled in the quarterly accounts and need not be individually reported;  v. the procedure set out in the reinsurance treaties is that within 60 days after the close of each calendar quarter, HIH provides the reinsurer with a summary account in respect of the transactions during the quarter (article X).
The balance so calculated is due by the debtor to the creditor within 90 or days after the close of the calendar quarter.  
An overview of the issues  Without being exhaustive a short overview of the primary issues litigated on the motion is as follows:  i. Syndicate 683 contends that:  a) [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) applies to the Reinsurance Treaties because the requirements of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) (1) are satisfied;  b) hence the Court is obliged upon such conditions as it may think fit, to stay the proceedings and to refer the parties to arbitration.  ii. HIH contends that the arbitration clause/agreement is not binding on it by reason of the provisions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/)  [Syndicate 683 joins issue on this contention submitting that:  a) [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) is inconsistent with [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) and therefore inoperative by virtue of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) ;  b) in the alternative, as a matter of construction, [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s19.html) does not apply to the circumstances of the present case because article XIX is not 'a provision in a contract of insurance' or 'a provision with respect to the submission to arbitration of any matter arising out of the contract of insurance'.]  iii. in the event that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) is not engaged, HIH contends that the arbitration clause is not engaged because:  a) properly construed, the policy gives an option to HIH to litigate rather than to arbitrate or  b) the action is for payment of 'a confirmed balance' which is expressly carved out from the arbitration clause.  [Syndicate 683 joins issue on each of these propositions]  iv. In the event that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) is not engaged and that the arbitration clause is engaged, HIH contends that this is not an arbitration agreement to which the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) applies as it is not 'an agreement in writing'  [Syndicate 683 joins on this proposition]  v. Syndicate 683 contends that HIH is estopped from denying the existence of an arbitration agreement for the purposes of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) (1) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/).  vi. In the event that the arbitration agreements are binding and operative and that the proceedings fall within their scope, vide:  a) [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) does not apply;  b) the juxtaposition of Articles XVIII and XIX did not provide HIH with an option to litigate (which it has exercised);  c) the proceedings do not involve claims for the payment of confirmed balances; and  d) the "arbitration agreements" (or some of them) were not "agreements in writing" within the meaning of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/).  
HIH contends that a number of reasons favour the discretionary refusal of a stay of proceedings  [Syndicate 683 joins issue on this proposition]  
Approach taken in these reasons to the submissions put in the alternative  Where HIH in particular has approached its analysis in the form of a series of cascading submissions, the Court has proceeded to deal with those submissions seriatim for the reason that there must be a reasonable possibility that this judgment will be appealed from. In that circumstance it is appropriate at first instance to treat with as many of the alternative sets of submissions [falling from both sets of parties] as is practicable.  
The [section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s19.html) issue  In my view as a matter of correct ordering, this presents as the initial issue for determination. Prior to considering whether the [International
Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) is engaged, the Court requires to be satisfied that there is a binding arbitration agreement in existence between the parties. This involves determining what was the contract and what were its terms.  [I accept that this is a separate and anterior issue to the question as to whether or not there is an agreement in writing]  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s19.html) was introduced into the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) by the
Commercial Transactions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1974 , the long title to which included the words "to excuse the insured under a policy of insurance from any requirement of compulsory arbitration": as quoted by
Samuels JA in 325 George Street Pty Ltd (in liquidation) versus Norwich Union Fire
Insurance Society Ltd [(1980) 1 ANZ Ins Cas 60-404.]  Syndicate 683 has submitted inter alia that <case> (1) does not encompass contracts of reinsurance and that the contracts in issue do not constitute contracts of reinsurance.  The submission is that it is appropriate to interpret the phrase "contract of insurance" [as it appears in section 19] narrowly. The propositions advanced are as follows:  i. it is self evident from the wording of the relevant provision that it was designed to protect persons considered to be in need of protection from the effect of arbitration clauses inserted into contracts of insurance;  ii. whilst consumers entering into contracts of insurance with insurance companies might reasonably be perceived to require such protection on the basis that they are simply not in a position to negotiate in respect of the standard terms of a policy of insurance, reinsurers are in a completely different position;  iii. there is no apparent policy reason for seeking to protect a reinsurer from an arbitration clause contained in reinsurance contract;  iv. reinsurers are perfectly capable of protecting themselves and deciding for themselves the manner in which their disputes will be resolved.  Syndicate 683 has further submitted that an reinsurance treaty is not a contract of insurance but is merely 'a commercial arrangement' between two parties. The contention is that when a quota share reinsurance treaty is put in place there is no individual risk scrutiny by the reinsurer and the reinsurer is obliged to accept the risks bound by the reinsured. This is said to follow from the definition of treaty reinsurance to be found in (Parkington & Ors, 'MacGillvaray and Parkington on Reinsurance Law' 9th ed at para [33-17]):  "The treaty method of reinsurance proceeds by way of an agreement, or treaty, between reinsured and reinsurer that all risks of the class of business specified by the treaty which are accepted by the reinsured will be ceded to the reinsurer and duly accepted by him. Thus, the reinsurer binds himself in advance to cede business of the relevant kind, and the reinsured binds himself to take it, contrary to the freedom of choice allowed to each in facultative transactions."  Syndicate 683 contends that direct insurance protects the insured against extraordinary risks outside the ordinary course of events, whereas reinsurance is concerned with the management of risks which it is the ordinary business of both parties to underwrite. The proposition is that reinsurance is essentially a professional hedging operation by which the reinsured assigns all or part of his insurance liabilities to the reinsurer. Reliance was sought to be placed inter alia on Agnew versus Lansforsakringsbolagens [2000] Lloyd's Rep IR 317 at -331.  The matter at issue is of some importance concerning as it does the meaning of the term "Insurance" in section 19.  
Finding  The finding is that "Insurance" within the meaning of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) includes reinsurance: see Sutton Insurance Law in Australia (3rd ed., 1999) at 2.65, cf AssetInsure Pty Ltd versus New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd (in liq) <case>; <case>, [28].  As HIH has submitted:  i. It is well established that a reinsurance contract is a contract of insurance: see, for example, British Dominions General Insurance Company Ltd v Duder [[1915] 2 KB 394] at 400; Forsikringaktieselskapet National of
Copenhagen versus Attorney General [[1925] AC 639] at 642; Toomey v
Eagle Star Insurance Co. Ltd [1994] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 516 at 523;
Forsikringaktieselskapet Vesta versus J N E Butcher <case>; [[1989] AC ] at 908.  ii. It is a well-established canon of statutory construction that when legislation uses a term which has acquired a settled meaning at common law, the legislature is ordinarily taken to have intended to pick up that meaning when employing that term in legislation. As O'Connor J. said in Attorney-
General versus Brewery Employees Union of New South Wales <case>; [(1908) 6 CLR 469] at 531:  
Where words have been used which have acquired a legal meaning it will be taken, prima facie, that the legislature has intended to use them with that meaning unless a contrary intention clearly appears from the context. To use the words of Denman J in R versus Slator [(1881) 8 QBD 267] at 272): 'it always requires the strong compulsion of other words in an Act to induce the
Court to alter the ordinary meaning of a well known legal term'.  [See also Wik Peoples versus State of Queensland [(1996) 187 CLR 1] at 151 per
Gaudron J,["Ordinarily, words which have an established meaning at common law are construed as having the same meaning in a statute unless there is something in the words or the subject matter of the statute to indicate otherwise."].  iii. So much was implicitly recognised in the [Insurance Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (Cth) [(section (1)(a))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s9.html) where reinsurance was expressly excluded, consistent with the express recognition in the Australian Law Reform Commission Report No 20 on Insurance
Contracts that the generally accepted meaning of the term "contract of insurance" would include a reinsurance contract [see paragraph 10 of that
Report which states "reinsurance is a form of insurance"].  I further accept that the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/), being beneficial and remedial legislation, ought be construed broadly, not narrowly, a proposition also consistent with well-established principles of statutory construction: see, for example, Bull versus Attorney-General  <case>; [(1913) 17 CLR 370] at 384 where Isaacs J said that such legislation "should be construed as to give the fullest relief which the fair meaning of its language will allow"; see also Samuel versus Newbold [[1906] AC 461] at 467; Wilson v
Moss <case>; [(1909) 8 CLR 146] at 165;
Holmes versus Permanent Trustee Co of New South Wales Ltd <case>; [(1932) 47 CLR 113] at 119; Waugh versus Kippen <case>; [(1986) 160 CLR 156] at 164; Day and Dent Constructions Pty Ltd versus North
Australian Properties Pty Ltd <case>; [(1982) 150 CLR 85] at 108; Devenish versus Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd(Milk Vendors case) <case>; [(1991) 172 CLR 32] at 44 per
Mason CJ.  Reinsurers are capable of protecting themselves and deciding for themselves the manner in which their disputes will be resolved. As HIH has contended, the protection of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) extends to 'reinsureds' and not 'reinsurers', HIH having been a reinsured and not a reinsurer.  The Court rejects the proposition that the proper approach requires the introduction of some extra-statutory concept of "stronger" and weaker" parties into the terms "insurer" and "insured". As HIH has contended:  i. BHP, Westpac and Macquarie Bank, for example, all have the benefit of the general provisions of the [Insurance Contracts
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) when they enter into policies of insurance with insurance companies even though, as a matter of economic fact, they may be the stronger party;  ii. that Act, as with the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/), operates by reference to a concept which has a settled meaning which is not qualified by considerations foreign to the language of the legislation;  iii. when the operation of certain provisions in the [Insurance Contracts
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) or the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), for example, is limited to "eligible contracts of insurance" or "consumer contracts" those provisions are specified and the 'consumer contracts' in turn are defined within the legislation.  Nor do the express terms of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s19.html) provide any basis for excluding contracts of reinsurance from its operation.
Consistently with the Australian Law Reform Commission's recognition in Report
No 20 that there is a public interest in the enforcement of an insurer's rights under its policies of reinsurance [see paragraph 10 of that Report: "adverse effects on the availability ...of reinsurance...would not be in the interests of the insuring public."], [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s19.html) makes no distinction in its terms between direct insurance and contracts of reinsurance.  Further and as HIH has also submitted:  i. sub-section 21(2) provides that certain provisions of Part 6 of the
Insurance Act (namely ss 18A and 18B) do not apply to certain contracts of insurance, but does not provide that contracts of reinsurance are excluded from the operation of section 19;  ii. sub-section 21(1) empowers the Governor to make regulations exempting certain classes of contracts of insurance from all or any of the provisions of
Part 6 of the Act;  iii. this power has been exercised in respect of contracts of marine insurance, contracts of life insurance and contracts of insurance that are subject to the [Insurance Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (see Reg of [Insurance Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/ir2004207/));  iv. the latter exemption does not apply to a contract of reinsurance since such a contract is specifically excluded from the operation of the [Insurance
Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) under section 9(1)(a) of the Commonwealth Act.  v. the scheme of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) is that
Part 6 of the Act, including section 19, applies to all types of contracts of insurance (which would include contracts of reinsurance), except those that are specifically exempted from the operation of those provisions under <case> or (2);  vi. specific exemptions have been made for certain types of insurance contracts, but not for contracts of reinsurance. Section 19 should be regarded as applying, on its terms, to contracts of reinsurance;  vii. the submissions by Syndicate 683 that section 19 does not include contracts of insurance would render section 19 effectively redundant, limited to export trade insurance and health insurance (see Sutton Insurance Law in
Australia, 3rd Ed at 2.65).  It does not appear that the decision of the House of Lords in Agnew v
Lansforsakringsbolagens [2000] Lloyd's Rep IR 317 relied upon by Syndicate is presently of assistance. That case was decided in a wholly different setting: it involved the interpretation of a European Union jurisdiction and judgments convention where the very matter at issue, whether a reference to insurance in the context of that Convention included a reference to reinsurance was the subject of express consideration in the relevant travaux preparatoires, namely the report of Professor Schlosser on the 1978 Accession
Convention referred to by Lord Millett at 338-339. Of particular significance is the observation by his Lordship that, had he not been deciding the issue in the context of a European instrument and against the background of that
Convention's policy and intendment, he would have had no hesitation as a matter of English law in holding that insurance includes reinsurance: see at Syndicate 683's proposition that a reinsurance treaty is merely a commercial arrangement between two parties hence not constituting a 'contract of insurance' requires to be rejected for each of the following reasons advanced by HIH and adopted as correct:  i. the policies contain an indemnity clause, a classic characteristic of a contract of insurance. The clause relevantly provides:  "Now Know Ye that We the Underwriters, Members of the Syndicates whose definitive numbers in the after-mentioned List of Underwriting Members of Lloyd's are set out in the attached Table, hereby bind ourselves each for his own part and not one for another, our Heirs, Executors and Administrators, and in respect of his due proportion only, to pay or make good to the Assured or to the Assured's Executors or Administrators or to indemnify him or them against all such loss, damage or liability as herein provided, such payment to be made after such loss, damage or liability is proved and the due proportion for which each of us, the Underwriters, is liable shall be ascertained by reference to his share, as shown in the said List, of the Amount, Percentage or Proportion of the total sum insured hereunder ..." (see p [224 Ex TJW1] to the affidavit of T J Whittaker 12/7/06).  ii. the submission is contrary to a long line of authority that reinsurance contracts, and in particular "quota share treaties", are contracts of insurance. See Re Dominion Insurance Co of Australia Ltd and the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) [[1980] 1
NSWLR 271] at 273 [9] - 274 [12] where Needham J, citing Dixon J in
Tariff Reinsurance Ltd versus Commissioner of Taxation (Vic) <case>; [(1938) 59 CLR 194] at 215, held that a quota share treaty was a contract of insurance for the purposes of <case> of the Companies Act 1961 (a predecessor provision to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s562a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)); Re
Palmdale Insurance Ltd (in liq) (No. 3) <case>; [[1986] VR 439] at 444 per Crockett J, also in respect of 292(5) of the [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) (Vic);
Forsikringaktieselskapet National of Copenhagen versus Attorney General [[1925]
AC 639] at iii. the Syndicate's submission that a reinsurance treaty is "not a 'contract of insurance' but merely a commercial arrangement between two parties", conflates the nature of the arrangement with the true legal character of such contracts. In Agnew versus Lansforsakringsbolagens [2000] Lloyd's Rep IR 317,
Lord Hope (at 330) acknowledged that reinsurance is a form of insurance, but drew a distinction for the purposes of Section 3 of the Lugano Convention between direct insurance and reinsurance having regard to the social protection policy the section was directed to. Likewise, Lord Millett (at 338) acknowledged that reinsurance was merely a species of insurance, and if the question in that case had arisen under a domestic statute then absent compelling context to the contrary, there would be no reason to confine insurance to direct insurance.  iv. all insurance is about managing risk (see Agnew at 339 per Millett LJ).
Reinsurance does not cease to be insurance because of the financial nature of the transfer of risk between the parties.  v. the treaties in the present case do not require some action by HIH as the ceding company in the form of a declaration of risk, or an entry in a register or bordereau to indicate acceptance of the reinsurer's offer. The quota share treaties are undoubtedly true contracts of insurance, as it is agreed from the outset that qualifying risks are covered.  The finding is that <case> applies to the present facts for the reason that the policies are governed by the laws of New South Wales (of which this section forms a part). And in any event, the section would operate irrespective of the law which governs the policies, as a mandatory law of the forum.  In truth the policies are governed by New South Wales law as a result of a combination of:  i. Article XVIII, sub-clause (i) which provided that "[i]n the event of a dispute arising under this Agreement, the Reinsurer at the request of the
Company will submit to the jurisdiction of any competent Court in the
Commonwealth of Australia. Such dispute shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice applicable in such Court [emphasis added];  ii. the request on behalf of HIH to the Syndicate to submit to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; and  iii. the commencement of those proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South
Wales.  
The term "inoperative" as used in [s 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) (5) of the [International Arbitration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/)  The holding is that the Insurance Arbitration Act has no application where, in terms of <case> (5), the agreement in question is "inoperative or incapable of being performed".  In this regard Syndicate 683 has submitted that the term "inoperative" in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) (5) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) is confined to circumstances where the agreement has become inoperative on the basis of ordinary common law principles.  In support of this contention Syndicate 683 has cited a number of authorities where consideration has been given in the United Kingdom to whether particular agreements have lost their efficacy by reference to the operation of common law doctrine. However these authorities do not establish that the efficacy or operability of an agreement cannot be lost by other means, such as the operation of a statute.  As HIH has contended:  i. an arbitration agreement may become inoperative or incapable of being performed as a result of the operation of common law doctrine (see, for example, election: La Donna Pty Limited versus Wolford AG <case>; [(2005) 194 FLR 26]; Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd versus The Ship 'Comandate' (No ) <case>;  ii. this being so (and well-established), there is no reason as a matter of logic, policy or the language of the Act why an arbitration agreement could not become inoperative by operation of statute, whether Commonwealth or State;  iii. the trilogy of concepts employed in the sub-section - null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed - emphasises the breadth of its intended operation.  iv. this trilogy of concepts derives from Article II (3) of the New York
Convention which is an international convention; its signatories extend far beyond the family of common law countries;  v. when this is appreciated, it simply cannot have been intended that the meaning of these terms (including "inoperative") can have been intended to be confined to the consequences of the operation of common law principles;  vii. such a construction would fly in the face of the accepted approach to the construction of terms in or deriving from an international convention. As
Rares J recently noted in Pan Australia Shipping Ltd versus Comandate Marine Corp <case> at <case>:  
It has been recognized that a national court, in the interest of uniformity, should construe rules formulated by an international convention, especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods, in a normal manner, appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention, unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law, or by English or domestic legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation:

[emphasis added]  viii. the law of contract in New South Wales is far more than simply common law principles; it extends to and includes all applicable State and Federal statutes such as the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/), the
Industrial Relations Commission Act, the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) and, in the present context, the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/).  The holding rejects the Syndicate's submission as to the meaning of the word "inoperative" in [section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/).  
Section 109 [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) (Cth)  It is necessary to consider Syndicate 683's two propositions in support of the suggested [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) inconsistency:  
The "right" to a stay argument  i. The contention that the effect of [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) is to provide a party with a "right" to a stay of proceedings, and that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) purports to limit the availability of that right.  
The "cover the field" argument  ii. The contention that the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) was intended to cover the field for regulating the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements and foreign arbitration awards, such that there is no scope for [s19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) to operate.  
The "right" to a stay argument  Syndicate 683 contends that section 7(2) of the Commonwealth Act confers on a party to an arbitration agreement which comes under section 7(1), the right to a stay of proceedings and the referral of the matter to arbitration. HIH contends and the Court accepts that if this be described as a 'right', it is not an absolute right, but is subject to subsection 7(5).  In truth the Commonwealth Act does not prescribe the circumstances in which an agreement may be held to be "null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed". Nor does it prescribe the circumstances in which a matter will or will not be "capable of settlement by arbitration" within the meaning of section 7(2)(b) of the Act. Those matters are left to be determined against the background of the applicable general law, including both common law and statute.  In Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Limited versus Wardley <case>; [(1980) 142 CLR 237] it was argued that the Airline Pilots Agreement (which was deemed to be an award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission) and gave
Ansett the right to terminate the employment of a pilot within the first 12 months, was inconsistent with Victorian legislation which prevented dismissal on grounds of gender. The Court held that the award did not give Ansett the right to dismiss, irrespective of circumstances, but dealt with the process for dismissal where Ansett had a right to dismiss according to the general law of employment, including any State legislation.  Stephen J said (at 246-248):  "In my view there is in this case no inconsistency within the meaning of [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). I regard the right of termination of the contract of employment which clause 6 of the Agreement confers as no absolute right, such as that for which Ansett contends. The right which it confers is not one which is capable of exercise regardless of the unlawfulness under State law of the ground for its exercise.
On the contrary it is a right the nature of which is to be understood against the background to its operation which general laws of the land, whether State or federal in origin, provide.  
The Agreement is not, I think, to be read as if creating a partial vacuum, within which the relationship between Ansett and its pilots lies wholly withdrawn from the operation of those general laws of the land which are applicable to other members of the community. ...  
The view that the Agreement is not to be read in isolation from, but, rather, against the background of, the general law of the land finds support in certain features of the Agreement. ... the provisions of the Agreement regarding grievance procedures are elaborate, yet they provide no particular criteria or considerations which are to be applied in the determination of any review or appeal from a dismissal. It will no doubt be by reference to any relevant provisions of the general law, together with general notions of fairness and fair dealing, that such proceedings are determined. Included in that general law will be any applicable statute law, whether State or
Commonwealth. [emphasis added]  [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) does not confer the type of absolute right for which [at least in its initial approach]
Syndicate 683 had contended. As HIH has submitted:  i. [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) is not to be read as requiring arbitration agreements to be enforced in a vacuum, separate from the general law background (including State legislation) of the circumstances in which such an agreement is binding and enforceable;  ii. indeed, section 7(5) of the Act expressly denies the application of s7(2) in circumstances where the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed;  iii. in Stephen J's words, section 7(5) does not provide any particular criteria or considerations which are to be applied in determining whether an agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, but instead leaves that issue to be determined by reference to the general law, which includes "any applicable statute law, whether State or Commonwealth";  iv. the same reasoning may be applied by analogy in the context of the reference to a "matter capable of settlement by arbitration" in s7(2)(b) of the Act;  v. whether or not a matter is capable of settlement by arbitration can be directly affected by the operation of the statute law of a State as the decision in Metrocall Inc versus Electronic Tracking Systems Pty Ltd <case>; [(2000) 52 NSWLR 1] illustrates. In that case, it was held that the operation of the provisions of the [Industrial Relations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/) of New
South Wales rendered a dispute involving a contract containing a United States arbitration clause incapable of settlement by arbitration with the consequence that no stay was granted pursuant to [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/).  The judgment of the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission in
Court Session in Metrocall includes the following:  "We are satisfied that no inconsistency arises between the [International
Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) (Cth) and [s106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) of the [Industrial Relations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/) so as to deprive the Commission in Court Session of jurisdiction to hear the application. We agree with Schmidt J that [s7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) (Cth) is to be construed as operating on the basis that the relevant court has jurisdiction as to the proceedings sought to be stayed. The [International
Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) (Cth) does not purport to alter the jurisdiction of courts to entertain proceedings as to agreements to which it applies. It merely requires those courts to stay proceedings in the event that there is an arbitration agreement which applies to the matters raised in those proceedings. Even then, the court is only required to stay the proceedings on application by a party. The [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) (Cth) contemplates courts having jurisdiction to determine the existence of an arbitration clause, whether the proceedings involve a matter which is capable of settlement by arbitration [(s7(](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) [2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s2.html))), whether to make any interim or supplementary orders [(s7(3))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) and whether the arbitration clause is "null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed" [(s7(5)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html)
These findings must be made by the court as a prerequisite to the granting of a stay of proceedings: see Hi-Fert Pty Ltd versus Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No.5) at 14. As Emmett J observed in that case, at 28:  [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) is only invoked upon the application of a party. It is open to the parties not to invoke [s7(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) or the discretionary inherent jurisdiction of the Court. If a party chooses to make no application, then there will be no occasion for the Court to consider ordering a stay under [s7(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html)"  [emphasis added]  [Hi-Fert is referred to later in these reasons]  Hence the same analysis as given in Metrocall, [where it was held that
State legislation applied without any inconsistencies to answer the question whether the matter the subject of the arbitration agreement was capable of settlement by arbitration], requires to be given in relation to the issue presently before the Court [where [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) answers the question as to whether or not the arbitration agreement was inoperative].  Nor do I accept as correct Syndicate 683's submissions in reply seeking to put the matter rather than on the basis that the alleged right is an absolute right, upon the basis that if [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) was valid, and thereby limited the right created in <case>, then the State Act would alter, impair or detract from the operation of the Commonwealth Act.  I reject the submission by Syndicate 683 that although section 7 (2) is subject to section 7 (5), the only part of the general law applicable to determining whether an agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed are "ordinary common law principles, including, for example, the doctrines of frustration and repudiation". As HIH has contended, on this view, any State legislation that might be relevant to whether an agreement is binding or enforceable would have no role to play.  Additionally to the reasons earlier given, apart from the fact that the proposition sought to be put by the Syndicate is wholly incongruous with the international (i.e. not solely common law) character of the New York
Convention, it seeks to draw a distinction between common law and statute which cannot be maintained. As HIH has contended, this is because:  i. in NSW, many areas of the law of contract have been codified. For example, the law relating to the capacity of minors is codified in the [Minors (Property and Contracts) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1970348/) ;  ii. further, some NSW statutes lay down general provisions regarding the enforceability of contracts. [For example, [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s7.html) of the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) and [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s72.html) of the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) provide that, in certain circumstances, the Court may refuse to enforce the provisions of a contract, or make an order declaring the contract void];  iii. finally, there is legislation in NSW which applies to specific categories of contract, such as consumer credit contracts, retail leases, or contracts relating to the sale of land.  I accept as correct the contention put by HIH that the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) falls into this third category. It lays down provisions which relate to all contracts of insurance, other than those which are specifically exempted from its operation. It alters the common law of contract in relation to the consequences of breach [(s18)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s18.html), the consequences of misrepresentation [(s18A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s18a.html), the effect of limitation clauses [(s18B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s18b.html), and the enforceability of arbitration clauses [(s19).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html)  A contention that this Act needs to be ignored, and that the Court should have regard solely to the common law, eschews the fact that the general law background against which the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) operates consists of both common law and statute, and that in some respects (including in relation to contracts of insurance) the common law has been supplanted by statute.  
Finding with respect to the "right to a stay" argument put by Syndicate 683  For the reasons already given the finding is that insofar as [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) confers a 'right' to have proceedings stayed and referred to arbitration, it is not an absolute 'right', but is expressly subject to [section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html), which provides that the Court has no power to grant a stay where the arbitration agreement is "null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed".  The Commonwealth statute does not set down any criteria for determining when [section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) shall apply, but instead leaves the issue to be determined against the background of the general law, which includes any applicable State legislation.  It is artificial to draw a line between the common law and legislative components of the general law, particularly in circumstances where aspects of the law have been codified, where statutes (such as the [Fair Trading
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/)) allow the Court to declare a contract void or unenforceable in certain circumstances, and where there exists legislation (such as the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/)) which specifically modifies the common law applicable to certain categories of contract.  As HIH has submitted, the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) takes the arbitration agreement as it finds it, including whether it has been waived as a matter of common law or whether it is in some other way "inoperative", including as a result of the operation of an applicable statute.  
The 'cover the field' contentions of Syndicate 683  Syndicate 683 has contended inter alia as follows:  i. the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) covers the field for regulating the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards such that there is no scope for [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) to operate. This intention is imputed from the fact that the [International
Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) was enacted in compliance with Australia's international obligations to enact law to implement an international convention. In this respect, the Second Reading
Speech of the Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Bill 1974, where the Minister for Manufacturing Industry explained:  
The present Bill deals with the matter on a national basis. This is desirable because the implementation of an international Convention is involved and because that Convention concerns trade and commerce with other countries. The
Australian Parliament has the necessary power to proceed in this way and should exercise that power. The former Government had proposed that the matter be dealt with by State and Territory legislation, but that would have been unsatisfactory. The resulting multiplicity of legislative provisions would have been confusing, particularly to parties in other countries. (The
Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Bill 1974, Second Reading Speech by Mr Enderby, the Minister for Manufacturing, House of Representatives
Hansard, 2 December 1974, 4390)  ii. this statement evidences first, an intention by the Commonwealth
Parliament to uphold obligations under the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and second, an intention to ensure that the national response covered the field and was not left to State legislatures to regulate. The [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) provides a detailed scheme of regulation governing recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards and includes inter alia the referral of a matter to arbitration, which is set out in [s.7.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html)  iii. it is clear that the Commonwealth Parliament did not intend for the
Commonwealth legislative scheme to operate in conjunction with State legislation. Against this, it might be suggested that [s.7(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) contemplates that there is no right to arbitration in the event that an arbitration agreement is 'inoperative' under State legislation, including, for example, [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/). [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) provides that '[a] court shall not make an order under subsection (2) if the court finds that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.' The purpose of [s.7(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) is not however to preclude the right to arbitration where an arbitration agreement is declared inoperative under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/). Instead, s.7(5) precludes a court from making an order that a matter be referred to arbitration where the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed on the basis of ordinary common law principles, including, for example, the doctrines of frustration and repudiation.  
Dealing with the issue  In my view the submissions and advanced by HIH are of substance and they are adopted in what follows.  In Clyde Engineering versus Cowburn <case>; [(1926) 37 CLR 466] (at 489-490) the following steps were outlined by Isaacs J as appropriate to be taken in applying the "cover the field" test:  i. identify or characterise the field, or subject matter, that the
Commonwealth law deals with and regulates;  ii. ascertain whether the State law attempts to regulate a field which the
Commonwealth intends to cover. If there is no overlap of the fields, then no indirect inconsistency will be found;  iii. if the two laws do overlap, ascertain if the Commonwealth intended to cover the field - did the Commonwealth intend its law to be the only law on the subject matter in question?  In relation to the first of these steps, Syndicate 683 has identified the 'field' that the Commonwealth law regulates, as "the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral awards"  In relation to the second of the steps identified above, Syndicate 683 does not attempt to identify the field which the State law attempts to regulate. In simple terms, it may be said that the NSW Act deals with the regulation of contracts of insurance.  This is not a case, like O'Sullivan versus Noarlunga Meat <case>; [(1954) 92 CLR 565], where the Commonwealth and State acts both seek to lay down detailed regimes in relation to the same subject matter.  Rather, it is a case where the State and Commonwealth laws address different subject matters. In that sense, it is closer to Ansett versus Wardley, where the subject matter of the State law was sex discrimination, and the subject matter of the Commonwealth law was an award dealing with the dismissal of pilots; or Commercial Radio Coffs Harbour versus Fuller <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 47], where the Commonwealth law related to the regulation of broadcasting, and the NSW law related to environmental planning restrictions.  The only area of 'overlap' which could be identified is in relation to one specific provision of each statute, namely [s7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) and [s19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/), and only in the specific circumstances where an arbitration agreement, which satisfies the requirements of s7(1), is found in a contract of insurance that is covered by the NSW statute, and if the arbitration clause is sought to be enforced by the insurer against the insured.  However, there is - even in these limited circumstances - no overlap at all:  a) Section 7 of the Commonwealth statute sets down the steps to be taken by a court when a party to a binding international arbitration agreement applies for a stay of proceedings and referral to arbitration, but does not deal with the circumstances in which an arbitration agreement is not binding; and  b) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the NSW statute describes the circumstances in which an arbitration agreement in a contract of insurance is binding, but does not deal with the manner in which the Court should deal with an application by a party to that contract for a stay of proceedings and referral to arbitration.  The two statutes are therefore not overlapping, but complementary.  Even if there were some overlap between the 'fields' covered by the respective statutes, the third step outlined above requires an enquiry into whether the Commonwealth intended its law to be the only law on the subject matter in question.  The starting point is the proper measure of the nature of the right conferred by the Commonwealth legislation.  Syndicate 683 does not suggest that there is an express intention to this effect. Instead, it is argued that such an intention may be "imputed from the fact that the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) was enacted in compliance with Australia's international obligations to enact law to implement an international convention."  There are two bases on which an intention to cover the field may be implied: first, the detail of the legislative regime (for example, O'Sullivan v Noarlunga Meat Ltd); and second, the subject matter of the Commonwealth legislation. That is, the determination of the intent of the Commonwealth legislation depends upon a consideration of the legislation itself, and not by reference to extrinsic material such as a second reading speech.  Even if such material could be called in aid, it is of limited assistance to the Syndicate. The quotation given by the Syndicate from the second reading speech is directed to the issue of whether it was appropriate to implement the convention by way of Commonwealth legislation, or by way of a series of uniform State statutes (as is the case with the [Commercial Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/)). It says nothing about any relationship between the Commonwealth law and individual statutes of the States regarding the circumstances in which agreements may not be binding.  Rather than relying on the detail of the Commonwealth legislative regime as the basis of an implied intention, Syndicate 683's contention appears to rely on the fact that the Commonwealth law is intended to fulfil an obligation cast upon it by the Convention.  However, the Commonwealth statute evinces no intention to 'cover the field' in relation to the circumstances in which an arbitration agreement is binding.
[Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s7.html) specifically makes the duty of the Court in [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s7.html) subject to the general law regarding the circumstances in which an agreement may be "null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed". Syndicate recognises that this preserves a field of operation for the common law of
NSW, but seek to draw a distinction between the common law and statute, which ignores the extent to which NSW legislation supplants and supplements common law principles relating to contract. Both legislation and common law form part of the general law background against which [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) operates, by virtue of [section (5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html)  In Commercial Radio Coffs Harbour versus Fuller <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 47], Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ stated (at 57-58):  
The intention of the Commonwealth Act is to maintain the provision of high quality and technically efficient broadcasting services which are commercially viable and receptive to the needs of the community. It does so by the prohibition of broadcasting except under licence granted subject to certain conditions. But the relaxation of the prohibition by the granting of a licence does not confer an immunity from other laws, Commonwealth or State. The Act does not purport to lay down the whole legislative framework within which the activity of broadcasting is to be carried on. It is intended to operate within the setting of other laws with which the grantee of a licence will be required to comply. ... In the words of Dixon J in Ex parte McLean ... the Act was intended to be 'supplementary to or cumulative upon the State law'.
[emphasis added]  Similarly here, the intention of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) (as shown by sub-section 7(5)) is not to confer an immunity from the general law requirements for there to be a binding arbitration agreement. It does not purport to lay down the entire legislative framework within which the enforceability of arbitration agreements is to be determined. Instead, it is intended to operate within the setting of other laws, both Commonwealth and
State, both common law and statute, which determine the circumstances in which an agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. In this sense, it is intended not to remove any field of operation for State law, but to be supplementary to or cumulative upon the State law.  It follows that there is no inconsistency between [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) and the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) so that in the circumstance of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s19.html) otherwise applying, extending as it does to contracts of reinsurance [as a species of the genus 'contracts of insurance'], it renders the arbitration clause upon which the Syndicate relies non-binding and, in terms of [section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/), "inoperative".  This also removes any basis for the grant of a stay pursuant to the [Commercial Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) or at general law as both of those aspects of the motion are predicated upon the existence of a binding arbitration agreement. Moreover, [section (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s3.html) of the [Commercial Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) expressly preserves the operation of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/).  
Construing the material Articles  The Syndicate submits that:  i. the proper construction of the arbitration clauses is that all disputes arising out of the reinsurance treaties or concerning their validity must be referred to a Court of Arbitration in Australia pursuant to article XIX unless they fall within the exception to this general requirement contained in the last paragraph of article XIX namely, "actions for the payment of confirmed balances".  ii. such actions are to be determined by the "ordinary Courts" (article XIX).  iii. the present proceedings fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.  iv. Article XVIII serves the purposes of providing the procedure to be followed for service of process in respect of those disputes that are to be determined by an ordinary court, those being "actions for the payment of confirmed balances".  v. Article XVIII has no operation in respect of disputes to be determined by arbitration.  The Syndicate relies inter alia upon the following propositions:  i. the starting point for interpretation of clause XIX is to give content to the opening phrase "Disputes arising out of this Agreement or concerning its validity shall be submitted to the decision of a Court of Arbitration".  ii. there is no doubt on the existing authorities that claims in the nature of those made in the current proceedings fall within the scope of this term which has been broadly construed (Francis Travel Marketing Pty Ltd versus Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd [(1996) 39 NSWLR 160] at 165;
IBM Australia Ltd versus National Distribution Services Ltd [(1991) 22 NSWLR ]
at 475-477, per Kirby P; Ethiopian Oilseeds versus Rio del Mar [[1990] 1 Lloyd's
Rep 86] per Hirst J; Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG versus Cross
Pacific Trading Ltd  <case>  iii. therefore, prima facie the matters raised in these proceedings come within the scope of article XIX and are liable to be referred to arbitration unless they are properly characterised as being "actions for the payment of confirmed balances".  iv. in construing the scope of the exception to the arbitration clause, the starting point is an assumption that the parties did not intend the inconvenience of having possible disputes arising from their transaction being heard in different places.  v. the arbitration clause is broadly drawn and evinces a clear intention of the part of the parties that the primary forum for resolution of disputes between them will be a court of arbitration.  
Decision  In my view the Syndicate's above submissions require to be rejected. In the reasons which follow HIH's submissions are of substance and are adopted in what follows.  Before giving those reasons it is appropriate to step back from the exercise and consider the proper approach to the construction exercise.  
The principles of construction  The policies, like any contracts of insurance, fall to be construed according to orthodox principles of contractual construction, the relevant search being for the mutual intentions of the parties, objectively ascertained: see Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd versus Alphapharm Pty Ltd (2004) 219 CLR Particularly important in this regard is the dictum of Gibbs J. in
Australian Broadcasting Commission versus Australasian Performing Right
Association Limited <case>; [(1973) 129 CLR 99] at 109:  "It is trite law that the primary duty of a court in construing a written contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the parties from the words of the instrument in which the contract is embodied. Of course the whole of the instrument has to be considered, since the meaning of any one part of it may be revealed by other parts, and the words of every clause must if possible be construed so as to render them all harmonious one with another.... If the language is open to two constructions, that will be preferred which will avoid consequences which appear to be capricious, unreasonable, inconvenient or unjust." (emphasis added)  Generally the following principles are apt to inform the construction of the subject instrument:  i. the construction exercise is to take place in accordance with the principles which apply to the interpretation of contractual documents:
Australian Casualty Co Ltd versus Federico <case>; [(1986) 160 CLR 513] at 520, per Gibbs CJ.  ii. the Court is dealing with a commercial contract and requires to give the instrument a business like interpretation, requiring attention to the language used by the parties, the commercial circumstances which the document addresses, and the objects which it is intended to secure: McCann v
Switzerland Insurance Australia Ltd <case>; <case>, per
Gleeson CJ.  iii. the task is to ascertain the objective intention of the parties from a consideration of the material wording. The instrument must be read in its commercial setting in such a way as to fulfil and not restrain its commercial purposes: see MGICA Ltd versus United City Merchants (Australia) Limited [(1986) ANZ Ins Cas 60-729] at 74,349 and 74,350; Darlington Futures Limited versus Delco
Australia Pty Limited <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 500] at 510.  iv. the instrument is to be construed in light of the matrix of the agreement that is, the factual background known to the parties at or before the date of the contract, including the aim and commercial purpose of the transaction:
Prenn versus Simmonds [[1971] 1 WLR 1381]; Legal & General Insurance Australia Ltd versus Eather [(1986) 6 NSWLR 390] at 394.  v. each clause in dispute is to be interpreted according to its natural and ordinary meaning, read in the light of the instrument as a whole, thereby giving direct weight to the context in which the clause appears, including the nature and object of the instrument : see Darlington Futures Limited versus Delco
Australia Limited.  vi. as Kirby P observed in Hide & Skin Trading Pty Limited versus Oceanic Meat
Traders Limited [(1990) 20 NSWLR 310] at -314:  "Whoever may be the parties to the agreement, it is the fundamental rule, that a Court should give the words of a written agreement the natural meaning that they bear. Subject to that rule, in giving meaning to the words of an agreement between commercial parties, Courts will endeavour to avoid a construction which makes commercial nonsense or is shown to be commercially inconvenient. This is because Courts will infer that commercial parties would not themselves normally agree in such a way".  vii. in resolving ambiguities, a reasonable construction is to be preferred as representing the presumed intention of the parties: see Alex Kay Pty Limited v General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Hartford Fire Insurance Company <case>; [[1963] VR 458] at 463.  
Returning to the analysis  The key to the proper analysis is the necessity to reconcile Articles XVIII and XIX in circumstances where:  i. Article XVIII:  a) explicitly contemplates curial proceedings not only being commenced in a competent Australian court of HIH's choosing but also contemplates that such proceedings would be determined in that court (the word "shall" is emphatic); and being determined in accordance with the law and practice applicable in such court.  b) also explicitly contemplates in sub-clause (iii) appeals being taken from the final decision of such a court.  ii. Article XIX explicitly contemplates arbitration, with no appeal, and in which the arbitrators are directed to reach their decision "primarily in accordance with the usages and customs of Reinsurance practices" and "relieved of all legal formalities" [a diametrically opposed procedure to that contemplated in Article XVIII].  The final sentence of Article XIX makes it clear that an action for a confirmed balance is outside the scope of the arbitration clause so, to that extent at least, there is no overlap between the two clauses.  I accept that Article XVIII is not confined in its operation to actions for the payment of confirmed balances and that, in fact, its scope is delimited by the phrase "dispute arising under this agreement", a concept that goes well beyond disputes as to confirmed balances.  HIH has referred the Court to Woolworths Limited versus DS McMillan (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 29 February 1988) on which occasion Rogers J had before him for consideration a service of suit clause from a Lloyd's policy in the following terms:  "In the event of a dispute arising under this Policy, Underwriters at the request of the insured (or reinsured) will submit to jurisdiction of any competent Court in the Commonwealth of Australia. Such dispute shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice applicable in such Court."  His Honour proceeded to note that the service of suit clause specified a firm of solicitors upon whom service and process may be effected and who undertook to enter an appearance on the underwriters' behalf. The virtual identity between that clause and Article XVIII of the policies under consideration in the present case will be apparent.  Relevantly, in respect of the construction of the service of suit clause,
Rogers J observed that:  "It is idle to suggest that the underwriters would not have foreseen the possibility that a dispute triggering the service clause may involve non- disclosure or misrepresentation. There are very few cases indeed in my experience where an underwriter declining liability under a policy fails to allege non-disclosure. In other words, when, as part of their commercial bargain with the plaintiff, the underwriters submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court, they could not have been unaware of the possible inconvenience or cost that could be occasioned by Sydney being selected as the forum for determination of any such dispute between them."  HIH has submitted and I accept, that although his Honour's observations were made in the context of an application for a stay in proceedings on forum non conveniens grounds, what his Honour said in relation to the above passage is directly inconsistent with Syndicate 683's submission that the service of suit clause in the present case should be confined as a matter of construction to disputes for the payment of confirmed balances.  It is also true that Syndicate 683's submission lacks any textual support for the extreme limitation of the kind sought to be imposed on the clause by that submission. As HIH has submitted, if the submission were correct, this aspect of Article XVIII would be redundant because its work would be done entirely by the final sentence of Article XIX which, it will be recalled, provides that "[a]ctions for the payment of confirmed balances shall come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts."  Syndicate 683 also sought to pray in aid the terms of section 1(1) of the
Arbitration Act 1975 (UK) in giving meaning to the policy. However the particular phrase from that section relied upon- "there is not in fact any dispute between the parties with regard to the matter agreed to be referred" - has no counterpart in any Australian legislation. As HIH has contended, this is significant because the arbitration clause in the policies contemplates arbitration not in the United Kingdom but in Australia.  HIH also contends and I accept that Syndicate 683's submission is also inconsistent with the width of the phrase "dispute arising under this agreement". Section 1(1) of the Arbitration Act 1975 (UK) contemplates no disputes; Article XVIII contemplates the opposite.  As HIH has further contended, the dispute raised in the current proceedings is a dispute arising under the reinsurance policies, namely whether or not, on their proper construction, the balances claimed to be owing to HIH under the policies are owing and, in particular, the question whether the policies require a reinsured first to have paid out its underlying insureds as a precondition to its entitlement to indemnity under the reinsurance policy.
This is the issue which went to the House of Lords in Charter Reinsurance Co
Ltd versus Fagan [[1997] AC 313.]  In my view where, as here, a dispute arises under the policies, provided that the dispute is not in effect a claim for a confirmed balance [in which case it cannot be the subject of a reference to arbitration], HIH has an option to require that dispute to be litigated pursuant to Article XVIII in a competent court in the Commonwealth of Australia of its choosing or, alternatively, to submit that dispute for determination by way of arbitration.
The issue is dealt with below.  Syndicate 683's submission that Article XVIII is limited to actions for payment of confirmed balances, and that such "actions" ought to be limited to proceedings commenced pursuant to the statutory demand procedure, or other proceedings of a similar nature, also fails to take account of the jurisdiction choice provided to HIH under Article XVIII, namely the Courts of
Australia, not England. The statutory demand procedure under section 459E [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), and any consequential proceedings under [section
P](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459p.html), are simply unavailable to HIH in Australia against the Syndicate or any of its members or the other reinsurers, since they have no relevant presence within the jurisdiction, such as registration, or carrying on business in the jurisdiction.  The suggested limitation to the nature of "actions" under Article XVIII is ignores the clear words of the Article which is not limited to claims for debts which are not disputed.  
An option to litigate  Continuing the analysis pointing up New South Wales as the governing law of the policies, the following matters may be noted, again adopting the submissions put by HIH:  i. a clause such as Article XVIII has been described as conferring an "option to select law and jurisdiction", per Colman J. in King versus Brandywine
Reinsurance Co (UK) Ltd [2004] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 670 at 681 [47]. Thus, when HIH commenced its proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, it selected
New South Wales law as the governing law of the agreement. Article XVIII of the policy was the source of its contractual right to do so;  ii. The above decision of Colman J also involved a reinsurance policy which juxtaposed a "Service of Suit Clause" in materially similar terms to Article
XVIII with an arbitration clause. The Service of Suit Clause in Brandywine relevantly provided that:  "It is agreed that in the event of the failure of Insurers hereon to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, Insurers hereon, at the request of the
Insured, will submit to the jurisdiction of any Court of Competent jurisdiction within the United States and will comply with all requirements necessary to give such Court jurisdiction and all matters arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice of such Court."  
Colman J said of the Service of Suit Clause (at 680 [39]) that:  "Its effect is to confer on the assured an option to select the jurisdiction of the New York courts or, in the case of Section IIIB, any United States court for the resolution of any dispute in respect of which insurers have failed to pay a claim made by the assured. If that option is exercised by the assured, the insurers are obliged to comply with all procedural requirements necessary to give the New York court or (under section III B) other Court jurisdiction and all matters arising are to be determined in accordance with
New York law and practice or in the case of III B the law and practice of the
Court selected. This clearly provides for an express choice of law, but it is contingent on the assured being entitled to exercise the option as to jurisdiction and on the assured having exercised it. It is thus clear that a dispute might arise in respect of which the assured was not entitled to exercise the option: for example an allegation by insurers that they were entitled to avoid the policies for non-disclosure before any claim for payment had arisen. Equally the assured might choose to sue the insurers in their place of business not in the United States and so not to exercise its option to undertake New York or United States jurisdiction. In either event, there would be no effective express incorporation of either New York jurisdiction or
New York law or under Section III B any other jurisdiction or law."  [His Lordship repeated the language of an "option" for New York jurisdiction in [53] and [54]. Although aspects of this decision were reversed on appeal (see (2005) 1 Lloyd's Rep. 655), no criticism was made of the analysis of the
Service of Suit Clause as providing an option on the part of the assured to litigate.]  iii. To similar effect is the decision of Clarke J. in Commercial Union
Assurance Co Plc versus NRG Victory Reinsurance Limited [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 80 at 85 where there was a similar juxtaposition of arbitration and service of suit clause. Clarke J. held at 85.5 (second column) that:  "The important point for present purposes is, however, that clauses 11 and 12 give the insured a choice where to proceed with a claim under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1.html) It could choose arbitration in New York under clause 11 or litigation in New York under clause 12 or it could choose another jurisdiction altogether. There is nothing either in clauses 11 or 12 or any other clause of the policy to prevent the insured from proceeding wherever it wished."  iv. Further support is supplied by the decision of Colman J. in BP plc v
National Union Fire Insurance Co [2004] EWHC 1132. As his Lordship said (at [42]):  "the presence of a dual option for service of suit strongly suggests that more than mere service of proceedings is involved. The right also to select the jurisdiction is much more likely to be intended where the insured is given an option. In the field of insurance, the contract is more likely to be catering for the insured's jurisdictional advantage rather than merely its administrative convenience."  v. this analysis is supported by E I Du Pont de Nemours & Co versus I C Agnew [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 585 at 592. The service of suit clause in Du Pont was similar to Article XVIII of the policies in the present case. It provided that:  
It is agreed that in the event of the failure of Underwriters hereon to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, Underwriters hereon, at the request of the insured (or reinsured), will submit to the jurisdiction of any Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States and will comply with all requirements necessary to give such Court jurisdiction and all matters arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice of such
Court.  
It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made upon
Messrs. Mendes & Mount, 27 William Street, New York U.S.A., and that in any suit instituted against any one of them upon this contract, Underwriters will abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal;  vi. that case differed from the present, however, because, as Bingham LJ pointed out, the "option" had not been exercised in that case. (That case involved an application to stay English proceedings. Relevant to that question was the identification of the proper law of the policies. It was in this context that Bingham LJ made observations about the service of suit clause);  vii. relevantly, his Lordship accepted that it was possible for there to be a retrospective variation of a contract's choice of law. That there can be a variation of an express choice of law provision follows not only from the application of general principles of contract law but has been expressly held to be possible in the context of choice of law clauses: see Nygh Autonomy in
International Contracts (OUP, 1999) at p.100.);  viii. the above analysis is also supported by Heath Lambert Limited v
Sociedad de Corretaje de Seguros [2004] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 495 at 500 in which
Jonathan Hirst QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court judge, accepted the validity of a term in a reinsurance policy - "Subject to Venezuelan Law and or
Venezuelan jurisdiction if required" - as giving the Venezuelan principal the option to choose the governing law of the policy;  ix. so also in BP plc versus National Union Fire Insurance Co. supra, where the relevant clause under consideration provided that "At the Principal Insured(s) discretion this insurance shall be subject to English law and practice or USA law and practice" Colman J. relevantly held:  ... there may be contracts where an express agreement identifying the proper law is provided for at some point after the contract has become binding: see Du Pont v. Agnew [[1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 585] per
Bingham LJ. at page 592. Such agreement may operate prospectively or retrospectively. In either event the effect will be a variation of the contract in as much as there will be a variation of the proper law.  ...  General Condition 16 on its proper construction provides to BP an option exercisable without reference to the insurers to select whether "this insurance" should be subject to English Law and Practice or the Law and
Practice of the USA. The phrase "this insurance" must, in my judgment, be taken to mean the entire operation of the Open Cover on an umbrella basis. If the parties had intended that it was open to BP to select different bodies of proper law for different projects or participating insurers, they would have made express provision to that effect.  The position at the time when the Open Cover was entered into was therefore that its current proper law, not having been expressly chosen, was to be inferred from the terms of that transaction, but if and when BP indicated that it was selecting a body of law under General Condition 16, that implied proper law which had hitherto prevailed would be retrospectively replaced by either
English law or that body of law, presumably USA Federal Law, which had been selected. Accordingly, the validity of declarations made up to that time would be determined by reference to that selected body of law."  [It is to be noted that the service of suit clause provided for service of suit in the United States or the United Kingdom "at the insured's discretion"]  It is to be noted that Colman J used the phrase "jurisdictional option":  "44 I conclude that the sense of the service of suit clause is to provide for a jurisdictional option. That General Condition 16 provided for a proper law option is consistent with a mutual intention to dovetail the proper law with the selected jurisdiction."  Syndicate 683 sought to distinguish Commercial Union Assurance Plc versus NRG
Victory Reinsurance Ltd on the basis that the arbitration clause was in different terms to the present case, because first it did not include reference to a "Court of Arbitration", and second, the arbitration clause was an agreement to agree and therefore not enforceable.  As HIH has contended:  i. the first suggested distinction is not borne out by the terms of the arbitration clause in Commercial Union.  ii. the arbitration clause in Commercial Union expressly referred to the arbitral forum as a "court of arbitration" (see p 84, col 2, 2nd last line).  iii. in Commercial Union nothing turned on the apparent different use of capitalised and lower case terms in the arbitration and service of suit clauses when referring to a "court".  iv. it appears that the references to "court" in the actual arbitration and service of suit clauses considered in Commercial Union, in fact referred to "court" using the lower case expression (see the terms of the clauses as reported in [1997] C.L.C. 1561 at 1566; cf the report in [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep at 84 -See also the terms of the same service of suit clauses as reported in King versus Brandywine Reinsurance at 679 [37], "... insurers hereon, at the request of the insured, will submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction ...".  v. it is readily apparent that the reference in the service of suit clauses in
Commercial Union to "any Court (sic court) of competent jurisdiction ..." was understood as a reference to Courts at law, not arbitral forums (see p 85, col 2 at .5 - .6).  Nor is the second suggested distinction relevant as pointed out by HIH. In short this distinction:  i. overlooks the fact that there were three policies in issue in Commercial
Union. In respect of the first two policies, referred to as sections I and
IIIA, it is the case that the form of the arbitration clause provided that arbitration, if requested by either party, was not compulsory (it had to be agreed by both parties) and therefore was not enforceable. By contrast, as recognised by Clarke J, the arbitration clause in section IIIB provided that either party could require the other to submit the dispute to arbitration in
New York (see p 85, col 1 at .6, col 2 at .3). [emphasis added]  ii. does not comprehend the fact that although Colman J recognised this difference when considering the same arbitration clauses in King v
Brandywine Reinsurance Co (UK) Ltd [2004] 2 Lloyd's Rep 670 at 681 - 682 [49] - [50], this did not affect his conclusion at 680 [39], that the service of suit clauses conferred on the assured an "option" to select the jurisdiction of the New York courts, or in the case of section IIIB, any
United States court for the resolution of the specified disputes. [emphasis added]  
The other United Kingdom authorities  Syndicate 683 further sought to rely upon three English authorities which recognise a bias towards upholding arbitration clauses.  That matter is however explicable when one focuses upon the different language and context of the clauses under consideration in each of those authorities where notably, there was no question of any "option" to litigate being dealt with.  As HIH has contended, Paul Smith Ltd versus H&S International Holding Inc [1991] 2 Lloyd's Rep 127 concerned the construction of a settlement of disputes provision (cl 13) and a choice of language and law provision (cl 14).  
The plaintiff had commenced Court proceedings in relation to a dispute. In response to the defendant's stay application based on the existence of the dispute resolution clause, the plaintiff argued that clauses 13 and 14 were hopelessly inconsistent and therefore devoid of effect.  
Steyn J held that there was no inconsistency because clause 14 merely specified the law governing the arbitration. This was not to be confused with either the proper law of the contract, the proper law of the arbitration agreement, or the procedural rules which would apply in the arbitration (see pp 129 - 130).  
Steyn J noted without any disagreement, the plaintiff's observation that the clauses in issue did not confer an "option" to resort to arbitration or legal proceedings (see p 129, col 2 at .6).  
Hence the contract in question did not include a choice of law clause governing the contract, a service of suit clause, nor a choice of law and jurisdiction clause conferring an option to litigate.  Shell International Petroleum versus Coral Oil Co Ltd [1999] 1 Lloyd's Rep 72 concerned the construction of a choice of law and jurisdiction clause (art 13) and an arbitration clause (art 14). The jurisdiction clause was held to confer only limited jurisdiction on English Courts in relation to any dispute "under this provision", being the choice of law clause itself. This case is distinguishable because the scope of disputes the subject of the jurisdiction clause was construed as being limited to disputes about the proper law only.
Article XVIII presently before the Court is however expressed in broad terms covering a dispute arising "under this Agreement" and is not limited to disputes about the proper law of the treaties.  Daval Aciers D'Usinor et de Sacilor versus Amare SRI ["The Nerano"] [1996] 1
Lloyd's Rep 1 concerned an arbitration clause in a charter party which was held to have been incorporated into a bill of lading, the terms of which provided "English Law and Jurisdiction applies". The arbitration clause was able to be read consistently with the provision in the bill of lading on the basis that the English Court retained a supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. The case did not concern a service of suit clause, nor a choice of law and jurisdiction clause conferring an option to litigate.  
Returning to the present litigation  In the result whatever the proper law of the policies may have been prior to the commencement of the proceedings, it was "retrospectively varied on the exercise of a contractual option" (to quote Bingham LJ in Du Pont versus Agnew at 592) and that exercise rendered New South Wales the governing law of the policies referred to in the summons.  Later in these reasons the [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s109.html) issue is determined adversely to the Syndicate. Taking that finding into account for present purposes, the correct analysis is that it is because the policies were governed by New South Wales law that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) applies, with the effect that the arbitration clause does not bind HIH: cf. for example, Wanganui-Rangitikei Electric Power Board versus Australian Mutual
Provident Society <case>; [(1934) 50 CLR 581] at 601 where Dixon J said:  "...an enactment describing acts, matters or things in general words, so that, if restrained by no consideration lying outside its expressed meaning, its intended application would be universal, is to be read as confined to what, according to the rules of international law administered or recognized in our
Courts, it is within the province of our law to affect or control. The rule is one of construction only, and it may have little or no place where some other restriction is supplied by context or subject matter. But, in the absence of any countervailing consideration, the principle is, I think, that general words should not be understood as extending to cases which, according to the rules of private international law administered in our Courts, are governed by foreign law."  The converse of this proposition is that statutes whose criterion of operation is not spelt out in terms on the face of the statute apply to contracts whose governing law, according to the forum's choice of law rules, "picks up" the statute: see Akai Pty Limited versus People's Insurance Company
Ltd [(1996) 188 CLR 418] at 442-443. That is to say, if the forum's choice of law rules indicate that the contract is governed by New South Wales law, New
South Wales statutes are picked up and apply to the contract in question. See also Barcelo versus Electrolytic Zinc Co of Australasia Limited <case>; [(1932) 48 CLR 391] at 424; Myer Emporium Limited versus Commission of Stamp Duties WN [(Part )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s2.html) ; see also K A & C Smith Pty Limited versus Ward [(1998) 45 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281998%29%2045%20NSWLR%20702 "View LawCiteRecord" ); Re Bulong Nickel Pty Limited [(2002) 42 ACSR 52.]  The granting by the policy to HIH of an option to litigate or arbitrate is consistent with the existence and operation of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) which as earlier observed, formed part of the contractual matrix against which the policies were entered into and against which they fall to be construed (see
Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust versus South Sydney City Council <case>; [(2002) 186 ALR 289).]  As HIH has submitted, in this context Yeldham J's observations in Parr v
Rural Agents Pty Limited [[1975] 2 NSWLR 347] at 354 are in point. His Honour said that:  "It should also be observed that [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) does not purport to render void, or otherwise destroy, the arbitration provision, but merely provides that, in a contract which this section applies, it "does not bind the insured", with the consequence that the insured is left with the option of proceeding to arbitration, if he desires to do so." (emphasis added)  It is also true that construing the policy as a whole as providing HIH with an option to litigate or arbitrate also satisfies the injunction contained in Australian Broadcasting Corporation versus Australasian Performing
Right Association, namely to construe a contractual document as a whole with a view to insuring an harmonious reading of all the clauses.  Article XVIII would not only be denuded of force and effect if, once a party had triggered its operation, the Court proceedings could be immediately stayed by reference to Article XIX but also such a construction would destroy the effect of the right on the part of HIH in effect to choose the governing law through its choice of jurisdiction. It would also arguably denude it of the opportunity to bind all Reinsurers on the programme (because there is no equivalent to clause (iii) of Article XVIII in Article XIX).  Finally the context permits the Court to infer that the parties would not have intended a potentially difficult legal question of policy construction to be resolved by insurance or reinsurance executives who were not bound to apply any legal standard and from whose decision no appeal would lie.  Reasoning of this kind was deployed by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Hi-Fert Pty Limited versus Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc. [(1998) 90 FCR ] at 6G (per Beaumont J) and 23G (per Emmett J, with whom Branson J agreed) where the
Court refused to attribute to the parties an intention to invest arbitrators (commercial men) in London with responsibility for resolving questions involving the construction of an Australian statute (the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/)) and possibly complex private international law questions.  In like fashion HIH has submitted and I accept that the Court would not readily attribute such an intention to the parties in the current case in relation to the proper construction of a clause of the policy.  
Syndicate 683's alternative contention  Syndicate 683's alternative contention that the natural and ordinary meaning of article XVIII is that it is a submission to jurisdiction clause, specifying "the jurisdiction of any competent Court in the Commonwealth of
Australia" and that the relevant Court may thus be a "Court of Arbitration" as it is referred to throughout article XIX, or a Court of law such as the
Supreme Court requires to be rejected.  The problems with this analysis are as follows:  i. on its plain language article XVIII does not mention or refer to the word "arbitration" at all and does not refer to article XIX, which governs arbitration;  ii. a "Court of Arbitration" as referred to in article XIX cannot be a competent court in the Commonwealth of Australia.  iii. Article XVIII(iii) which refers to the circumstance that a suit is instituted against one of the reinsurers [in which event all reinsurers are bound by the decision of the court or any competent appellate court] expressly provides for a right of appeal in respect of disputes within the scope of this article;  iv. by contrast article XIX provides that the decision of the Court of
Arbitration shall not be subject to appeal [hence one cannot read "Court of
Arbitration" consistently with article XVIII (iii)];  v. the procedures to be adopted by a Court in article XIII and by the Court of
Arbitration in article XIX are diametrically opposed, the latter requiring the arbitrators to reach the decision primarily in accordance with usage and customs of reinsurance practice and relieving them from all legal formalities, and the former requiring that a dispute be determined in accordance with the law and practice applicable in the Court in which HIH has elected to litigate;  vi. the reference in article XVIII (ii) to service of any summons, notices or process on Freehills, and the references to that firm having authority to accept service and to enter into an appearance, are all consonant with curial proceedings. On the other hand as made plain by article XIX one commences an arbitration by nominating an arbitrator involving an entirely different procedure.  For all those reasons HIH has succeeded in its alternative contention that the policies afforded HIH an option to litigate or arbitrate, which HIH has exercised in favour of litigation: hence for this reason also the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) is not engaged. The arbitration agreement contained in Article XIX of the policies would not be operative because of the exercise by HIH of the option contractually reserved to it.  
Is the action one for "the payment of a confirmed balance"?  Article X was in the following terms:  "Reports and Remittances  
Within sixty (60) days after the close of each calendar quarter, the Company shall furnish to the Reinsurer a summary account in respect of transactions during the quarter showing:-  
A. (1) Gross Written Premiums less Return Premiums  less  
B. (1) Ceding Commission 
Taxes as applicable 
Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid after deduction of salvage and subrogation.  
The balance so calculated shall be paid by the debtor party to the credit or [sic] party within one hundred and five (105) days after the close of the calendar quarter.  
C. Outstanding loss reserves at the end of the quarter."  The words "confirmed balance" are nowhere defined in the policy wording.
In the search for the proper construction to be given to those words it is naturally necessary for the Court to consider the language of the entire policy.  It should also be noted that Article IX deals with loss adjustment and expenses and losses and provides for HIH to settle all losses incurred under its policies, such settlements to be binding on the reinsurer in proportion to its participation. This article also includes an obligation on the reinsurer to reimburse HIH promptly when so requested by it, for losses paid by HIH.
Hence the article contemplates a reimbursement which might precede the submission or the furnishing of the quarterly accounts.  The last sentence in the first paragraph of Article IX is in the following terms:  "Alternatively losses shall be handled in the quarterly accounts and need not be individually reported."  Each of the following propositions put forward by Mr Gleeson SC during his address are accepted as correct:  i. there was an obligation on HIH to furnish to the syndicate a summary account each quarter setting out certain information;  ii. there are three pieces of information required;  iii. the first two pieces of information, A and B, are integers to a financial calculation.;  iv. the third piece of information, the outstanding loss reserves, does not impact upon the financial calculations A and B, but it is information required to be provided to the syndicate for obvious reasons. It gives an indication of the likely development of the account;  v. the clause is more than simply a process clause;  vi. the clause has a contractual consequence. The consequence is that having furnished the summary account setting out the information contained in the integers in A and B, the balance so calculated, whether it be credit or debit, shall be paid by whoever is the debtor party to the creditor party within a specified period of time 105 days after the close of the calendar quarter;  vii. the clause gives rise to a contractual obligation;  viii. the clause does not contain or provide any requirement for the syndicate to signify its assent or agreement to the balance, so calculated, and the clause clearly contemplates a unilateral statement by HIH of the balances.  ix. in furnishing these statements HIH would be subject to an obligation of utmost good faith and permits disagreement by the syndicate. Like any contractual obligation imposing an obligation to pay a sum of money, it might be disputed. If it is disputed, the contract provides for procedures dealing with that dispute.  I further accept that there is nothing unusual or exceptional about the unilateral nature of the type of confirmation being here dealt with, particularly in circumstances of these types of quota share treaties where the reinsurer in the position of the syndicates, stands far removed from the underlying relationship between the original insured and HIH, and the settlement of those claims.  The scheme provided for was that if HIH wanted to obtain early reimbursement, then it had to provide certain information at the time to satisfy the syndicate, but otherwise the matter would be dealt with in the ordinary course in the quarterly statements.  As Mr Gleeson SC further contended the clause is consistent with HIH's construction of article 10, that it involves a unilateral verification by HIH of the balances owed, either way. That is not to say that a dispute cannot arise in relation to those balances. If a dispute does arise the treaty provides certain mechanisms for the resolution of those disputes.  In the result and as HIH has contended:  i. the Policy prescribes a process whereby on a quarterly basis, HIH furnished to the Syndicate a summary account made up of various integers, and, if the account showed a balance owing to HIH, the Syndicate was under a mandatory obligation to pay that amount within a prescribed period;  ii. the Policy makes no provision for any confirmation by Reinsurers of the balances so furnished. Rather, it directs the debtor party to pay "the balance so calculated". Thus, the only party who, on the terms of the Policy, has any role in confirming the balances due is HIH;  iii. this also follows from the fact that the Reinsurer will not, in the ordinary course, be in a position to "confirm" the balance as it will lack critical information required to do so. It will not have, for example, information on the number of risks written in order to calculate the premium component of the balance, nor will it have information about underlying losses or salvage, also a necessary integer in the calculation of the balance under
Article X. In this context it is relevant to note that Article IX expressly provides that losses "need not be individually reported" where they are handled in the quarterly accounts, further confirmation that HIH was the only party in the position to confirm the balance due or owing;  iv. the situation thus is that HIH has presented, via its brokers, summary accounts and claims amounts due. By those presentations, HIH confirmed the balances due to be paid (either to or by the Reinsurers depending upon the direction of the balance) and, where amounts are owing to HIH, Reinsurers have failed to pay those balances;  v. in the present proceedings, HIH's claim in effect is for the payment of those balances - a proceeding which is expressly excluded from the operation or scope of the arbitration clause (see final sentence of Article XIX);  vi. nor is it surprising that such a claim would be so excluded. It is reasonable to assume that the parties did not intend the type of legal defences arising under the Policy to the making of such a claim to be determined by arbitration and without any right of appeal.  
Agreement in writing  It will be recalled that one of HIH's alternative submissions [strictly falling to be considered only in the event that [s19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/s19.html) of the [Insurance
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1902116/) was not engaged and that the arbitration clause was engaged], was that the Court did not have before it an arbitration agreement to which the [International
Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) applied as it is not "an agreement in writing".  The terms of Article II (2) have already been set out. Syndicate 683 contends that the facts establish that there was an agreement in writing within the meaning of Article II (2) on the basis of satisfying either:  * the requirement that the material arbitration clauses were signed by the parties; or  * the requirement that the material arbitration clauses were contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.  
The requirement that an agreement be "in writing"  The submissions put to the Court by HIH in this regard and supported by a plethora of texts, articles and authorities, are accepted as correct and are adopted in what follows.  i. The policy underlying the definition in Article II(2) and the requirement that an agreement be "in writing" is to ensure that the arbitration agreement was actually consented to and concluded [Van den Berg, New York Convention, p 173; Toby Landau "The Requirement of a Written Form for an Arbitration
Agreement: When 'Written' means 'Oral'" International Arbitration Conference
ICCA Congress Series (2001, Series no. 11)]. The formal requirements also serve the purpose of ensuring that the terms of the arbitration are clear and susceptible of proof [Landau, "The Requirement of a Written Form", p 23; JD
Lew, LA Mistelis and SM Kroll Comparative International Commercial
Arbitration London 2003, at 7-7]. Article II(2) was included in the
Convention with the intention of overcoming the divergence of national laws in favour of a uniform rule as to formal validity [Van den Berg New York
Convention, p 173].  ii. The word "include" has been taken to be exhaustive (see, for example,
Chloe Z Fishing Co., Inc. versus Odyssey Re (London) Ltd [109 F Supp 2d ]
) - an interpretation which is consistent with the French and Spanish texts of the Convention (which are equally authentic by virtue of Article
XVI of the Convention) [Van den Berg, New York Convention, p 179. The
French text provides "on entend par 'convention ecrite' ...". The Spanish text provides "La expresiun 'acuerdo por escrido' denotÜ" (which seems to translate to "the expression 'agreement in writing' denotes")]. So also, in
Zambia Steel Building Supplies Ltd versus James Clark & Eaton Ltd [1986] 2
Lloyd's Rep. 225 at 234, Ralph Gibson LJ said:  'It is clear to me that the [New York] Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document.'  iii. The drafters of the Convention considered and rejected a proposal by the Dutch delegate to add to the definition of Article II(2) a third category, whereby an arbitration agreement "in writing" could be proved by demonstrating that there had been "confirmation in writing by one of the parties [which is kept] without contestation by the other party" [Van den Berg, New York
Convention, pp 179 and 196, citing UN DOC E/CONF.26/L.54 and SR.22]. The rejection of this proposal is referred to by Rares J. in Pan Australia
Shipping Pty Ltd versus The Ship 'Comandate' (No. 2) <case> at <case>- <case>.  iv. In Kahn Lucas Lancaster Inc versus Lark International Ltd (1999) 14 Mealey's
International Reports C1 (29 July 1999); <case>; [(1999) 186 F 3d 210], the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit held (at [C5-C6]) that the modifying phrase "signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams" applies to both arbitral clauses in contracts and arbitration agreements. In so holding, the Court rejected an earlier approach that had been taken in Sphere Drake Insurance, the case relied upon by the Syndicate in its written submissions.  v. Following Kahn Lucas, the definition of "arbitration agreement" in
Article II(2) requires that such an agreement, whether it be in the form of an arbitral clause contained in a contract or an arbitration agreement, must be signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of communiques. Landau states that this approach has been applied in a number of cases and cites Lo v Aetna 2000 WL 565465 (US District Court, District of Connecticut) and
Chloe Z Fishing Co Inc (US) versus Odyssey Re (London) Ltd formerly known as
Sphere Drake Insurance Plc (UK) 109 Fed Supp 2nd Series (SD) Cal 2000, 1236 [Landau "Requirement of Written Form", p 36].  vi. The reference to "exchange" in sub-clause 2 of Article II means that there must be a mutual transfer of documents. The mere transmission of a document by one party to the other cannot linguistically satisfy the requirement of "exchange" [Van den Berg, New York Convention, p 192].  vii. Even if one party has orally or tacitly accepted an arbitration agreement contained in a document forwarded by the other party, this will not suffice to satisfy the second limb of Article II(2) [Van den Berg, New York Convention, p 207; Landau, "Requirement of Written Form", p 28]. For the same reasons, an oral offer accepted in writing will not suffice [Landau, "Requirement of
Written Form", p 29]. Landau states that Article II(2) was intentionally limited to exclude cases involving acceptance by performance, conduct or tacit acceptance [Landau, "Requirement of Written Form", p 26].  viii. The fact that the parties have had an ongoing trading relationship and regularly used the same standard conditions including an arbitral clause (which appears to be the tenor of Mr Whittaker's evidence) will not overcome the lack of compliance with Article II(2) if there has been no exchange of documents in respect of the particular transaction [Van den Berg, New York
Convention, p 221] or if the agreement is otherwise not signed by both of the parties. In James Allen (Ireland) Ltd versus Marea Producten B.V. (Netherlands) (Yearbook X (1985) p 485) the Court of Appeal in the Hague held that there was no enforceable arbitration agreement, despite the regular prior use (in at least 25 successive transactions) of particular general conditions of trade (which included an arbitration clause) because in the particular case the general terms had not been referred to [Referred to in Landau, "Requirement of
Written Form", p 42].  ix. The issue of the meaning of the "agreement in writing" requirement in the context of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) has recently been the subject of a close and careful analysis by Rares J. in Pan
Australia Shipping Pty Ltd versus The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) <case> at <case>- <case>. What emerges from that decision is that:  a) there will only be an arbitration agreement between the parties within the meaning of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/) if it is:  contained in a document signed by both parties; or  contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document;  b) confirmation in writing by one of the parties which is kept without contestation by the party will not suffice, and  c) an agreement in writing within the meaning of the Act could not be established by a course of dealing.  x. Importantly for present purposes, his Honour held that, although Article
II(2) of the Convention which relevantly contains the definition of "agreement in writing" uses the word "include", the two instances given in that Article, viz. a document signed by both parties or an exchange of letters or telegrams, contain the universe of circumstances that will satisfy the writing requirement of the Convention, and therefore, the Act. On this issue, his
Honour relevantly said (at [82]) that:  "As a matter of construction under Australian law, I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was an inclusive one. However, I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams."  xi. This conclusion followed a comprehensive survey and analysis of international case law on the meaning of the expression "agreement in writing". It was a fully reasoned decision. That the case may be distinguishable on the facts does not detract from the force of his Honour's research, analysis and reasoning. His Honour's conclusion is fundamentally at odds with the submission put by the Syndicate to the effect that the definition embraces three possibilities, and not the two expressly referred to in the definition of "agreement in writing" in Article II(2) of the
Convention.  
Turning to the factual issues  The following is a brief overview of the approach taken by Syndicate 683 to the factual question of whether the arbitration agreements were signed by the parties:  * identifying the Lloyd's syndicates' procedure in relation Reinsurance Treaty negotiations by reference to two cases (Eagle Star Insurance Co versus Spratt and American Airlines versus Hope) and the affidavits of Mr Whittaker;  * submitting evidence of the slips and treaty wordings to enable the Court to draw an inference that the arbitration agreements existed and were signed by HIH for all relevant years.  
The established procedure  Syndicate 683's submissions set out the key aspects of the process by which the slips and treaty wordings for each Reinsurance Treaty are said to be negotiated and put in place.  The process may be described thus:  a) a long-standing and well-known procedure is in place pursuant to which
Lloyd's syndicates contractually bind themselves in relation to inwards reinsurance. At all relevant times HIH's agent, the broker, participated in the process on HIH's behalf;  b) the procedure involves, as a first step, acceptance of a proportion of the reinsurance risk offered by the ceding insurer. This is done by the underwriter affixing the Syndicate's stamp and completing other information (known as "scratching") on a slip presented by the broker as agent for the ceding insurer (in this case, HIH). The Syndicate enters relevant information about the slip onto its computer system at the time of scratching the slip.
The slip is then returned to the broker;  c) the lead underwriter (in this case the Syndicate) was responsible for negotiating the wording for each of the Reinsurance Treaties (Whittaker
October Affidavit, para 13). In many instances, the wording for the relevant reinsurance contract may simply be recorded on the slip as being "wording as expiring", which means that the wording in place for the previous year continues to apply (Whittaker July Affidavit, para 8; Whittaker October
Affidavit, para 14). Sometimes the slip wording includes the phrase "wording to be advised L/U only" which means that brokers need only show any changes in the wording to the lead underwriter and not to the following reinsurers (Whittaker July Affidavit, para 10);  d) In due course the broker takes the slip and the wording to the Lloyds
Policy Signing Office ["LPSO"] for processing. Sometimes there is a significant delay between the time of scratching the slip and the time of the wording being produced to the LPSO for processing;  e) the LPSO checks the terms and conditions in the wording against the slip.
Any anomalies are taken up with the broker at once. If the wording is correct, the LPSO seals the wording with the LPSO stamp and assigns a unique number to the policy. The LPSO enters the relevant information about the slip on the
LPSO's computer system including the date the slip was processed which is called the "signing date" (Whittaker October Affidavit, para 17). Although it is often the case that execution clauses are provided in the wordings (eg.
Whittaker July Affidavit, pp. 87-103 of "TJW1"), for inwards reinsurance the
Syndicate does not sign the execution clause itself. All original documents are then returned to the broker;  f) ordinarily the broker does not provide a copy of the wording to the
Syndicate. The Syndicate can request a copy of the wording from the brokers' files (e.g. if the Syndicate wish to have the wording in relation to a particular claim). The Syndicate generally does not keep copies of any renewed policy wording that is issued. The practice of the reinsurance market at the relevant time was for the brokers to hold the relevant documentation (Whittaker October Affidavit, para 16).

The missing years: 1993 - 1994  The parties agree that the factual dispute only arises for the years 1993 - 1994 because signed copies of the treaty wordings for each of the layers for those years could not be found.  The Syndicate could only locate unsigned and unstamped reinsurance wordings for the primary and first excess layers for 1993 and 1994 and stamped reinsurance wording for 1994 for the third excess layer. The reinsurance wording for 1993 for the third excess layer could not be located.  The Syndicate sought to overcome this deficiency by referring to the
Lloyd's established procedure set out previously and then taking the Court through the slips for the years in question to contend for the drawing by the
Court of the inference that there once existed signed copies of the treaty wordings.  In the present case, HIH confines its submission based upon a lack of the requisite "agreements in writing" to the following policies:  
Year 
Layer  
Primary layer GT843K  
First excess layer GT118F  
Third excess layer GT160EA  
Primary layer GT843L  
First excess layer GT118G  
Third excess layer GT160FA  As earlier indicated issue raised with respect to each of the above policies is that no policies, which are signed by both parties for these layers in these policy years are in evidence.  The burden undoubtedly lies on Syndicate 683, as the party seeking a stay of proceedings pursuant to the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/), to satisfy the Court that "agreement in writing" meeting the description of that term in the Act, as it has been construed, were once in existence.  Mr Whittaker's evidence that it was not the practice of Syndicate 683 to receive signed copies from HIH is equivocal as to whether the policies were signed by both sides for the relevant years. This evidence clearly falls short of establishing the fact on the balance of probabilities.  It is critical for Syndicate 683 to establish that HIH had a consistent practice of signing the policies in place for the years in question. However,
Syndicate 683 has not put forward any policy signed by both parties in any policy year prior to 1993 and the only signed policies are dated from 1995 onwards. The available evidence supports no more than the inference that such a practice began after 1995.  It is inappropriate to draw an inference that the 1993 and 1994 policies were signed from the mere fact that they were processed by the LPSO. Rather the evidence suggests significant lapses in time between the dates when the policies were processed and when they were signed.  HIH concedes that the position may have been different if there were policies signed by both parties prior to 1993. The liquidators of HIH were obliged to bring forward any such policies had they existed. None were identified.  The finding is that the established procedure of scratching, stamping and processing the slips did not render the slips "agreements in writing" within the meaning of the Act signed by both parties.  
Estoppel  There is no substance in the contention by Syndicate 683 that HIH is estopped from denying the existence of an arbitration agreement containing signed policies for the purposes of [s7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/s7.html) (1) of the [International Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/iaa1974276/). The matter is put in terms of an estoppel by a convention. There is no evidence of any detrimental reliance by Syndicate 683 on any such assumption. That is of course an essential element for any estoppel case because the necessary consideration for the Court, when considering whether relief sought is proportional to the detriment, is to have regard to the detrimental reliance contended for. There was no evidence from the syndicate, in particular Mr
Whittaker, that he acted in reliance upon any such assumption.  
The obvious mistake  Mr Sackar QC appearing for Syndicate 683 drew attention to the fact that in some policies certain of the articles clearly had slightly different headings to the others.  This matter is shortly explained by the fact that the variation appears only in four policies in the third access layer. The scheme of the vast bulk of the policies involved Article V1 being headed "Commission" and Article VII being headed "Contingent Commission". It so happens that the scheme in the third access layer was that it did not include an article in relation to contingent commissions whereas the policies for the underlying layers did include the contingent commission article.  A mistake appears to have occurred with respect to the subject four policies. In terms of the placement of the relevant headings for the "Service of suit" and "Arbitration" articles, all the articles had been brought forward by one for those four years, resulting in the mistaken repositioning of the material headings.  The mistake was ultimately corrected [cf Exhibit R2] removing the matter from contention as an issue.  
Discretionary considerations  HIH has accepted that the usual principle [where agreements are binding, operative and where proceedings fall within their scope] is that the Courts begin with a firm disposition in favour of maintaining the bargain unless strong reasons be adduced against a stay: Akai Pty Ltd versus People's Insurance
Company [(1988) 188 CLR 418] at 445.  Notwithstanding that circumstance it is true that the Court retains a discretion such that even had HIH not succeeded in its several cascading contentions, the Court would not be obliged to grant a stay of the present proceedings.  HIH's submission that:  i. the provisions of the [Commercial Arbitration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) provide a right to either party to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court;  ii. there is therefore little utility to be gained in adding yet another potential layer to the contest between the parties in relation to the Charter
Reinsurance versus Fagan issue,  fails to give due recognition to the accepted limitations on an application for leave to appeal to the Court.  In my view the parties having solemnly entered into contractual commitments should be held to their bargain. Hence had it become necessary for the Court to determine the discretionary issue, the principled the exercise of the discretion would have been to grant the stay.  
Scheme of judgment  As will appear from the reasons, HIH has succeeded on most of its submissions. Hence it was strictly unnecessary for the Court to treat with all of those submissions. The [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s19.html) holding in favour of HIH and the rejection of the section 109 challenge were sufficient to resolve the motion.  
Short Minutes  The parties are to bring in short minutes on which occasion costs may be argued.
