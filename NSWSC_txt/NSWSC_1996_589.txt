SECTION 60 CLAIM REMITTED TO COMPENSATION COURT 
JUDGMENT 
COLE JA: The Court is in a position to give judgment. I shall ask
Justice Beazley to give the first judgment.

BEAZLEY JA: The appellant, who was born on 3 March 1965, claimed weekly compensation in respect of injury to neck, both arms, lower back and both legs sustained in a motor vehicle accident on 14 October 1991 whilst on a journey to her place of employment. She also made a claim under [s 60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the Act) for medical expenses, a lump sum compensation under [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and compensation for pain and suffering under <case>.

The appellant was off work for about one week after the initial accident in and then resumed full time work as manager of a donut shop conducted by the respondent. Thereafter she had some time off work and remained under medical care. She underwent various treatments including physiotherapy and hydrotherapy until October 1996 when she suffered increasing pain in her back and her left leg only (although the evidence is unclear as to whether it was her left leg or both legs). Before that she had had occasional flare-ups of symptoms.

In October 1995 when she had the flare-up which became the subject of the claim, she was given four weeks off work. She then returned to work initially for four hours per day and then five hours per day.

The trial judge awarded the appellant compensation at the rate of $200 per week from 18 October 1996 to 30 November 1996 pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) of the Act, as well as [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) expenses incurred during that period. Her Honour found that there was no permanent disability so as to grant a claim under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and no compensation payable under <case>. Her Honour's rejection of the claims under [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and 67 is not subject to challenge.

The two matters which are the subject of challenge on this appeal are her
Honour's finding that incapacity ceased on 30 November 1995 and her failure to award any [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) expenses for the period prior to 18 October 1995. It is important to state at the outset that it appears both from the application for determination upon which the hearing was conducted and from her Honour's judgment that her Honour considered that she was dealing with a closed period in respect of the claim for weekly compensation and for the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) claim and that she was not dealing with any claim prior to 18 October 1995.

In arguing the appeal, counsel for the appellant raised four issues. First he submitted that there was no evidence upon which her Honour was able to find that the appellant's incapacity from 18 October 1995 was caused by paramedical treatment administered to the appellant. The second issue related to her
Honour's failure to deal with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) medical expenses prior to 18 October. The third issue related to her Honour's finding that the appellant's symptoms were systemic or constitutional in origin and the fourth issue was that her Honour erred in finding that the incapacity ceased on 30 November 1995. I will deal with those four issues slightly out of order as two of them can be dealt with fairly quickly.

In relation to the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) medical expenses, I have already stated my opinion that it is clear from the material before the court and, in particular, her Honour's judgment that she did not consider that she was dealing with any claim for medical expenses prior to 18 October 1995. In my opinion that claim remains undetermined by the
Compensation Court.

The second issue with which it is convenient to deal is her Honour's finding that the applicant's intermittent symptoms suggested that her complaints were systemic or constitutional in origin. Counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no evidence to support that finding and that her Honour erred in substituting her own medical opinion (as it were) in the absence of any evidence. He submitted that this error had the effect of flawing the judgment as a whole.

However, in my opinion, counsel for the appellant has read her Honour's statement to which I have just referred too narrowly. Her Honour was dealing with the claim to which I have referred where the application for determination referred to injury to neck, arm, lower back and legs. Her Honour had before her medical evidence which recorded histories of the applicant going back to the early 1980s. That medical evidence indicated that from the early 1980s the appellant had, from time to time, had back pain and generalised joint pains. Her Honour referred to those matters in her judgment particularly at page 113 in the paragraph commencing at line G.

The claim for compensation for the period which commenced on 18 October 1995 was a claim which related to incapacity to work due to pain arising from her back with referred pain down her legs. Her Honour's reference at page 113X to the appellant's "widely distributed intermittent symptoms" is a reference not to that part of her claim in respect of the flare-up on back symptoms which she had, causing her incapacity in October 1995 but to her generalised low back and joint pain, a condition to which she had referred earlier in her judgment and which preceded the motor vehicle accident. Her Honour's statement in relation to the system or constitutional nature of the applicant's condition related to this condition.

That then leaves the final two issues in the appeal, namely whether her Honour was in error in making a finding that the condition which caused her disability and incapacity in October 1995 was due to paramedical treatment and her further finding that any period during which she was incapacitated extended beyond 30 November 1995. Counsel for the respondent has frankly conceded to the Court that there is no evidence that he has been able to find in the Appeal Book which would indicate there was any basis for her Honour's finding as to the cause of the symptoms in October 1995. He submits, however, that that is not to the point and that this Court ought to disregard it. He submits it is not to the point because it is a finding in the favour of the appellant and to that extent she is not a person aggrieved, as that phrase ought to be understood in the legislation under which this Court is acting.
More importantly, however, he submits the matter was not raised in the Notice of Grounds of Appeal, nor was it raised in the written submissions which were placed before the Court prior to the commencement of the case in accordance with the usual directions of the Court.

In my opinion for both those reasons the Court ought not to deal with this issue because the essential finding of her Honour appears to be that her
Honour was uncertain of the cause of any symptoms which the appellant may have been suffering from since 30 October 1995. In other words, her Honour was not satisfied on the evidence that any incapacity from which she was suffering was due to the motor vehicle accident. In my opinion that finding was open to her
Honour. In the first place the appellant's medical evidence did not go beyond
Dr Hopkins' evidence found in his report of 10 November 1995 that she should only work five hours per day until 29 November 1995. There was no evidence from Dr Hopkins or any other doctor that her incapacity extended beyond that date. Strictly that is as far as her Honour needed to go in relation to her findings, the onus at all times being upon the appellant to satisfy the Court that she was suffering from symptoms which caused her incapacity for work and that that incapacity was attributable to the motor vehicle accident. There was no such evidence in this case. However, her Honour's finding was further supported by the finding of Dr Harrington who saw the appellant on 1 February in which he reported that the appellant had had an exacerbation of back plain. He stated it was hard to report that the pain was referrable to the accident in 1995 and he considered that it would settle down. However, there was no opinion expressed by Dr Harrington that she was at that time or, indeed at any time in October 1995 incapacitated for her work. In those circumstances the appellant had failed to satisfy the onus which was upon her and the findings made by the trial judge were open to her Honour.

It seems to me in those circumstances that the appropriate order of the court is that the appeal be dismissed but that the appellant's claim for [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) expenses prior to 18 October 1996 be remitted to the Compensation Court for determination.

COLE JA: I agree.

ABADEE AJA: I agree.

COLE JA: The orders will be as indicated.
