JUDGMENT
The Plaintiffs seek by summons an order pursuant to [s 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/s8.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) that proceedings in the Dust Diseases Tribunal commenced by the First Defendant in these proceedings, Peter Frederick Key, against Amaca, the Plaintiffs herein, and CSR be removed into this Court and thereafter an order under [s 5(2)(b)(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html) of the Act that the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland.
The proceedings as between the injured worker and the respondents in the Dusts Diseases Tribunal have settled, and what remains in the proceedings in the Tribunal are cross-claims between those three respondents.
The application is consented to by CSR, it is neither opposed nor consented to by Amaca, and Mr Key has no remaining interest in the outcome of the application in any event. Mr Key was joined to this application as a matter of courtesy only
The evidence discloses that the place of the tort is fairly clearly Queensland, the worker resides in Queensland and the relevant medical practitioners are in Queensland.
One consideration in relation to whether the proceedings should be cross-vested to another jurisdiction in these matters concerns the availability of [s 25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ddta1989243/s25.html) of the [Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ddta1989243/) . That is a facilitative section that does not have a counterpart in a number of other jurisdictions within Australia.
The Plaintiffs on this summons have offered to the other Defendants the availability of using [s 25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ddta1989243/s25.html) of that Act, notwithstanding that the proceedings are cross-vested to Queensland. However the evidence from the Plaintiffs discloses that there is a similar rule in Queensland, but one which is said to be more general, and would likely cover similar matters to those covered by <case> of the New South Wales Act. The matter might have been a significant consideration, in the absence of any opposition to the cross-vesting, because of the conflict of authority in relation to whether <case> is a substantive or a procedural provision.
I am satisfied that if the proceedings were in this Court it is appropriate that they be cross-vested to Queensland because of the clear relationship between the issues in the matter and the jurisdiction of Queensland. Accordingly, orders should be made to bring the proceedings from the Dust Diseases Tribunal into this Court to enable such cross-vesting to occur.
For those reasons I make orders in terms of paras 1 and 2 of the Summons filed 27 April 2015.
I make no order as to costs to the intent that each party pays their own costs of these present proceedings.
