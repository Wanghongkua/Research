HAMILTON J  
FRIDAY, 5 DECEMBER 2003  /03 CLIFTON ANTHONY CORDER versus PETER OLSEN  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: These are proceedings for the specific performance of a parcel of land at Salamander Bay. The plaintiff has proved that a contract in the usual form was entered into between him and the defendant for the sale of the property to him for $125,000. It is proved that he paid the deposit under the contract and that he has cash funds available, to pay the balance of the purchase price. Although a notice to complete is not a prerequisite for an order for specific performance, a notice to complete was served when the contract was not completed in time and was not complied with.  Although the affidavit of service of the summons is slightly curious in form
I am prepared to find, on the basis of that affidavit, that the summons was duly served on the defendant. The defendant did not appear in Court on the return of the summons and an attempt has been made to inform him of the adjourned date by a letter to his former solicitors. He has not appeared again today and the hearing of the summons has proceeded in his absence.  The plaintiff has demonstrated those matters that entitle him to an order for specific performance, including that he was ready, willing and able to carry out the contract on his part so far as it remains to be performed by him.  In those circumstances I make orders in terms of prayers 1, 2 and 3 in the summons. I grant liberty to apply on three days' notice. I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings. I direct that these orders be entered forthwith.
