JUDGMENT
The plaintiffs, William Jeffries ("Mr Jeffries") and David Baffsky ("Mr Baffsky") are former directors of the defendant, the Indigenous Land Corporation ("ILC"). Mr CRC. Newlinds SC, with Mr RA. Yezerski, appears for the plaintiffs. Ms S. Pritchard SC, with Mr DH. Hughes, appears for ILC.
On 16 February 2012 Mr Jeffries and Mr Baffsky each executed separate agreements with ILC headed 'Deed of Access, Indemnity and Insurance' ("the Deeds"). The substantive terms of the Deeds are identical.
For the purpose of the proceedings, and pursuant to [s 191](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s191.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) , the plaintiffs and the defendant agreed on the following facts: "1 The plaintiffs, William Jeffries and David Baffsky, are former directors of the defendant, the Indigenous Land Corporation. Mr Jeffries was a director of the defendant from 2004 to October 2013. Mr Baffsky was a director of the defendant from 1999 to October 2013.  On 16 February 2012, each of the plaintiffs entered a deed, in relevantly identical terms, with the defendant, copies of which will be tendered .  On 27 February 2015, the defendant's solicitors, acting on the instructions of the defendant, wrote separate letters to each of the plaintiffs (the 27 February Letters).  Other than in relation to the details of the persons to whom they are addressed, the 27 February Letters are in identical terms.  The 27 February Letters are marked "Without prejudice save as to costs".  The 27 February Letters are expressed as having been written "pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cdra2011296/index.html#p2) of the [Civil Dispute Resolution Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/cdra2011296/) (Cth)".  The 27 February Letters assert that, during the period in which they were directors of the defendant, the plaintiffs breached certain statutory and common law duties of care and diligence owed to the defendant (including the duty imposed by <case> of [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/) (Cth)) in connection with the defendant's acquisition of Ayers Rock Resort (the
Alleged Breaches).  The 27 February Letters assert that the defendant has suffered loss as a result of the Alleged Breaches, and state that the defendant holds the plaintiffs liable for that loss.  The 27 February Letters invite the plaintiffs, should they have any insurance that would respond to a claim, to pass the 27 February Letters on to their insurer and provide the defendant's solicitor with the insurer's details.  The 27 February Letters state that the defendant reserves all its rights.  The plaintiffs have asserted since 9 March 2015 that they are each presently entitled to be indemnified by the defendant pursuant to clause 6.2 of the respective Deeds against any liability for legal costs (on a full indemnity basis) incurred by each plaintiff following receipt of the 27
February Letters.  The defendant denies that the plaintiffs are presently entitled to any indemnity under clause 6.2 of the Deeds.  As at the date of these agreed facts, the defendant has neither commenced any proceedings against the plaintiffs, nor notified the plaintiff and the Court that it does not intend to commence such proceedings."
By Summons filed 5 June 2015 the plaintiffs seek the following relief: "1 A declaration that the First Plaintiff is presently entitled to be indemnified by the Defendant pursuant to clause 6.2 of the Deed of Access,
Indemnity and Insurance between the First Plaintiff and the Defendant dated 16
February 2012 (Jeffries Deed) against any liability for legal costs (on a full indemnity basis) incurred by the First Plaintiff in defending the action threatened by the Defendant in the letter from its solicitors to the
First Plaintiff dated 27 February 2015.  An order that the Defendant pay to the First Plaintiff the amounts in respect of which the First Plaintiff is indemnified and has become liable to pay, pursuant to clause 6.4(a) of the Jeffries Deed.  A declaration that the Second Plaintiff is presently entitled to be indemnified by the Defendant pursuant to clause 6.2 of the Deed of Access,
Indemnity and Insurance between the Second Plaintiff and the Defendant dated February 2012 (Baffsky Deed) against any liability for legal costs (on a full indemnity basis) incurred by the Second Plaintiff threatened by the
Defendant in the letter from its solicitors to the Second Plaintiff dated 27
February 2015.  An order that the Defendant pay to the Second Plaintiff the amounts in respect of which the Second Plaintiff is indemnified and has become liable to pay, pursuant to clause 6.4(a) of the Baffsky Deed.  An order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiffs costs of the proceedings, including on an indemnity basis.  Such other orders or relief as the Court deems appropriate."
The plaintiffs contend that, in circumstances where the ILC has asserted claims against them in the terms set out in the 27 February Letters and they have incurred legal costs in relation to those asserted claims, they are entitled to be indemnified against any liability for legal costs incurred by them in defending the action under clause 6.2 of the Deeds which is as follows: "6.2. Indemnity for legal costs 
ILC indemnifies the Director out of the property of ILC, to the extent and for the amount that the Director is not otherwise entitled to be indemnified and is not actually indemnified, against any liability for legal costs (on a full indemnity basis) incurred by the Director in connection with any legal proceedings commenced by the Director where he or she does so at the request of or with the concurrence of the Board where the Board is satisfied that to do so is in the interests of ILC and/or in defending an action for a liability incurred as a director of ILC, provided that the costs are not incurred:  in defending or resisting proceedings in which the Director is found to have a liability for which he could not be indemnified under clause .1; or  in defending or resisting criminal proceedings in which the Director is found guilty; or  in defending or resisting proceedings brought by ASIC or a liquidator for a court order if the grounds for making the order are found by the court to be established (except to the extent the liability for legal costs was incurred in responding to actions taken by the ASIC or a liquidator as part of an investigation before commencing proceedings for the court order); or  in connection with proceedings for relief to the Director under the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) in which the Court denies the relief; or  in proceedings for which an indemnity for legal costs is prohibited by [section
M(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27m.html) of the [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/) ." (Emphasis added)
Alternatively the plaintiffs contend that if they are not presently entitled to such indemnity, they would become so entitled upon the ILC commencing the proceedings described by the ILC in the 27 February Letters.
The plaintiffs accept that to succeed they need to establish: * (1) that they have no other indemnity nor insurance (from elsewhere than ILC) to indemnify them against legal costs * (2) that the steps which they have undertaken which have led them incurring legal liability for costs are steps taken in: * (a) defending an action * (b) for a liability incurred as a director of ILC * (3) that none of the exceptions or 'carve outs' from liability as they have been described set out in cl 6.2(a) to (e) apply
The plaintiffs claim that they have established (1), that (2)(a) is established notwithstanding the fact that ILC has not to date commenced proceedings, that (2)(b) is established, and that no exceptions of the kind described in 6.2(a) to (e) apply. That they have incurred legal costs in connection with the 27 February Letters including their attempts to obtain indemnity from ILC (see paras 25 and 26 of the affidavit of Brian James Whittaker of 5 June 2015 Tab 3) is not disputed.
ILC disputes that the plaintiffs have established that they have no other indemnity or insurance. ILC does not dispute that the matters outlined in the 27 February Letters do relate to liability incurred by the plaintiffs' directors but they do not accept that the letters constitute a demand, and they do not accept that even if the letters constitute a demand that they are sufficient to trigger cl 6.2. ILC contends that for costs incurred to be recoverable 'action' requires proceedings to have been commenced in a Court.
ILC also contends that the plaintiffs' reliance on cl 6.2 is misconceived. It contends that no indemnity is available under cl 6.2 until a Court has ruled positively in the director's favour. ILC contends that prior to a determination of the claim against the director, the director has available to him cl 6.3 pursuant to which he can seek a loan from ILC.
The plaintiffs resist the construction of cl 6.2 advanced by ILC and ILC's reliance on cl 6.3 to support that construction and submit that once it is established that the director has no other indemnity available to him, and that an action has been foreshadowed and costs incurred, cl 6.2 requires indemnity as soon as it is requested. The plaintiffs accept that if indemnity is granted in accordance with cl 6.2 but a Court later rules against the director making a finding of the type referred to in cl 6.2(a) then the director must repay the money so paid to him pursuant to cl 6.2.
Although cl 6.2 contains subsections (a) to (e) as 'carve outs' only (a), it was agreed, has any relevance here.
The parties are agreed that the three principal questions which require determination by the Court are: * (1) have the plaintiffs established that they are not otherwise entitled to be indemnified by virtue of any other indemnity or policy of insurance? ("the no other indemnity point") * (2) does cl 6.2 of the Deeds require ILC to indemnify each of the plaintiffs for legal costs incurred by them in defending the action described in the 27 February Letters until such time as there is a judicial finding that the plaintiffs have a liability to the ILC as alleged in the 27 February Letters? ("the no indemnity pending finding point") * (3) if the answers to (1) and (2) are yes, are the plaintiffs entitled to indemnity under cl 6.2 of the Deeds in respect of legal costs they have incurred to date in defending the allegations made in the 27 February letters, notwithstanding that no proceedings have yet commenced in respect of those allegations? ("the no action point")
I should set out some additional preliminary matters. Although the 27 February Letters were sent in February, ILC has to date not determined whether it will commence proceedings or not. It was unable to indicate by what date it would do so: see T2 of 15 July 2015 before Bergin CJ in Eq and as of the date of the hearing ILC does not expect to make a decision before three months hence and possibly not for six months: T39.8. ILC therefore may never commence proceedings and it contends that the directors would not be entitled to any indemnity for legal costs incurred if it did not do so.
The 27 February Letters contained the following two sentences: "Please contact us or arrange for your insurer to contact use at your earliest convenience to discuss the resolution of this matter. In the interest of an early resolution of this matter, our client is willing to accept the sum of $50 million in full and final settlement. Our client also seeks an unreserved apology from you and an undertaking not to accept or hold any statutory office in the future" (see T8).
The following are the provisions of [s 27M(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27m.html) and (5) of the [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/) (Cth): "(4) A Commonwealth authority, or a subsidiary of a Commonwealth authority, must not indemnify a person (whether by agreement or by making a payment and whether directly or through an interposed entity) against legal costs incurred in defending an action for a liability incurred as an officer of the authority if the costs are incurred:  in defending or resisting a proceedings in which the person is found to have a liability for which they could not be indemnified under subsection (3); or  in defending or resisting criminal proceedings in which the person is found guilty; or  in defending or resisting proceedings brought by the Finance Minister for a court order if the grounds for making the order are found by the court to have been established; or  in connection with proceedings for relief to the person under this Act in which the Court denies the relief. 
Paragraph (c) does not apply to costs incurred in responding to actions taken by the Finance Minister as part of an investigation before commencing proceedings for the court order. 
Note: Paragraph (c)--This includes proceedings by the Finance Minister for an order under [section
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27c.html) (disqualification order) or clause 3 or 4 of Schedule 2 (civil penalties). 
For the purposes of subsection (4), the outcome of proceedings is the outcome of the proceedings and any appeal in relation to the proceedings."  (Emphasis added) 
It was agreed that although the [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/) has been repealed it remains relevant by virtue of transitional provisions.
The clauses in the Deeds (additional to cl 6.2 set out above) to which the parties have referred in their submissions are: "6.1. Indemnity-other than for legal costs 
ILC indemnifies the Director out of the property of ILC, to the extent and for the amount that the Director is not otherwise entitled to be indemnified and is not actually indemnified, against any liability (except for legal costs) incurred either before or after the date of this Deed, by the Director, as a director of ILC, to another person provided that the liability is not: 
A personal director's liability individually owed to ILC or a Related
Body Corporate of ILC; or  for a pecuniary penalty order under section 1317G or a compensation order under [section
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317h.html) or [1317HA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317ha.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); or  for a pecuniary penalty under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caca2010265/s76.html) of the [Competition and Consumer Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caca2010265/) (Cth) or under [Part
IV](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caca2010265/index.html#p4) of that Act; or  owed to someone other than ILC or a Related Body Corporate and did not arise out of conduct in good faith; or  of a type for which it would be unlawful for the ILC to provide an indemnity pursuant to [section
M](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27m.html) of the [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/) ."  "6.3. Advance for legal costs 
To the extent that the Director is not presently entitled to be indemnified against a liability for legal costs pursuant to clause 6.2 (each a "Liability") and is not actually indemnified, ILC shall, upon written request from the Director, advance to the Director amounts expended or to be expended by the Director in relation to that Liability provided:  that the Director's request is supported by a written opinion from
Queen's or Senior Counsel that the Director has good prospects of being entitled to an indemnity for such costs pursuant to clause 6.2; and  at the absolute discretion of ILC, the Director grants ILC a mortgage, charge or other encumbrance over property or rights agreed between the
Director and ILC to fully secure all such advances, together with interest and enforcement and other costs. 
Each advance under this clause 6.3 shall accrue daily interest, which shall be capitalised, at the rate 9 per cent per annum, but which shall be waived if the advance shall be used to satisfy a Liability in respect of which the indemnity under clause 6.1 or 6.2 shall operate. 
Within 30 days of written demand from ILC, the Director shall repay to
ILC any amount advanced to the Director under this clause 6.3 in relation to a
Liability:  which is not used by the Director to satisfy that Liability; or  in respect of which the Director has not become entitled to be indemnified under clause 6.2, having exhausted or abandoned all rights of appeal in respect of the relevant proceedings.  .4. Payment by ILC where Director entitled to indemnity 
Subject to clause 6.5(a), if the Director becomes liable to pay any amount in respect of which the Director is entitled to be indemnified under this Deed, ILC must indemnify the Director by paying that amount to the person to which the amount is due within 30 days from the date that the Director provides satisfactory evidence to ILC that the Director is liable to pay the amount. 
It is not necessary for the Director to incur expense or make payment before enforcing the Director's right of indemnity under this Deed.  .5. Application of indemnities 
Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 have effect only to the extent their provisions are not avoided by law. 
Subject to paragraph (a) of this clause, the indemnities provided by clause 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3:  are irrevocable;  are in addition to any indemnity contained at common law;  continue irrespective of one or more previous applications of the clause; and  continue in full force and effect without limit in relation to any claim in respect of the matters the subject of this indemnity whether arising during or after the period which the Director was acting as a director of
ILC."  "6.6. Relief from duty to indemnify and advance money  ..... 
If ILC has pursuant to clause 6.1 or 6.2 paid a liability incurred by the Directorand the Director is not subsequently entitled to an indemnity in relation tothat liability, the Director must pay ILC an amount equal to the liability paid byILC, the payment to be made within 30 days of ILC providing to the Directordetails of the liability and payment of it by ILC."
For present purposes cl 6.2 can be restated relevantly as "ILC indemnifies the Director out of the property of ILC.... against any liability for legal costs (on a full indemnity basis) incurred by the
Director..... in defending an action for a liability incurred as a director of
ILC, provided that the costs are not incurred:  in defending or resisting proceedings in which the Director is found to have a liability for which he could not be indemnified under clause 6.1" with cl 6.2(a) mirroring [s
M(4)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27m.html) of the [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/).

The no other indemnity point
The plaintiffs accept that they have the onus of establishing that they are "not otherwise entitled to be indemnified" and are not "actually indemnified" by some other indemnity. They contend that they have discharged that onus. Mr Baffsky deposed in his affidavit that "9 Other than the Deed, I do not have any insurance policy or other contract which provides for any insurance or indemnity in respect of my activities as a director of the ILC which would operate to cover an action brought by the ILC.
To the best of my knowledge, I do not have any rights to indemnity or insurance in respect of my activities as a director of the ILC which would operate to cover an action brought by the ILC, other than as provided for by the Deed, and I have not been indemnified in respect of those activities by any person.  To the best of my knowledge, other than the indemnity provided for under the Deed, I am not otherwise entitled to be indemnified and am not actually indemnified for the legal costs incurred by me in responding to and defending the ILC action foreshadowed in and constituted by the 27 February Letter.
Mr Baffsky was cross examined. His evidence that he has not actually been indemnified by anyone to date was not challenged. The cross examination established that Mr Baffsky has deeds of indemnity from some other companies of which he is a director. He said on his oath that he has no directors and officers insurance, he never having taken out one: T34- 35. He accepted that the companies which have granted him an indemnity (other than ILC) might have obtained protection in respect of those indemnities from an insurer and that, to that extent, he might benefit from such a policy (ie because the company has insurance). He was not aware that any such policies contained clauses "in relation to outside directorship": see T34.24 and he was not himself aware of the availability of such extensions. No evidence was led concerning the existence of such extensions, how they operate or as to their ubiquity in the market. There was a faint suggestion in the submissions on behalf of ILC that I could take judicial notice of the existence of such clauses. I am unaware of the supposed content of such clauses and quite unable to take judicial notice of their existence, content or ubiquity, since their content is not 'notorious' or so generally known that every person may be presumed to be aware of it: see Holland versus Jones <case>; [(1917) 23 CLR 149] at 153 per Isaacs J with whom Barton ACJ concurred.
Mr Baffsky agreed that he did not know whether or not he was the beneficiary of a policy taken out by another company of which he was a director providing an indemnity in respect of his activities as a director of ILC: T34 - 33.50 and that an investigation could have been carried out to see whether that was the case, but his evidence is that he is not aware of any such policy.
It was open to ILC to subpoena copies of insurance policies effected by companies of which Mr Baffsky was a director to seek to establish that policies effected by those companies granted cover to Mr Baffsky in respect of his role in ILC but they have not done so. I agree with Mr Newlinds' submission that Mr Baffsky's evidence discharged the onus placed upon him so that without more the conclusion on the balance of probabilities is that he has no other indemnity.
In my view the prospect that a corporation in effecting insurance to protect itself in respect of an indemnity granted to a director would arrange and pay for insurance that granted indemnity for activities of that director not as a director of that company but as a director of other companies is remote. That other company would have no reason to seek or pay for insurance of anything beyond the obligations incurred by them under the indemnity given by them nor any interest in incurring and paying for liability to a director for activities unconnected with that company. I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that there is no other indemnity available to Mr Baffsky.

Mr Jeffries
Mr Jeffries deposed in identical terms to Mr Baffsky that he has no other indemnity and no insurance policy. Again, his evidence that he has actually been indemnified by anyone other than ILC was not challenged. He was cross examined at T20- T25. Mr Jeffries said he presumed that he had directors liability in respect of his work as director of the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence: T21.18. He could not recall if there was a policy in relation to directors of Indigenous Environmental Service Pty Ltd but he did not think it did: T22.4- 8. He could not recall whether Reconciliation Australia of which he is or was a director had a directors insurance policy.
Mr Jeffries agreed that he had not examined any directors and officers policies effected by companies of which he was a director at the relevant time which leaves open the possibility that a policy taken out by a company of which he was a director other than ILC might have taken out cover for him in his role as a director of ILC. His evidence is that he is not aware of any policy covering him.
It is true that Mr Jeffries' evidence does not exclude the possibility that another corporation of which he was a director did effect insurance covering not only his role as a director of that corporation but of other corporations as well, but what I have said in [22] and [23] in relation to Mr Baffsky above applies equally to Mr Jeffries' position.
I conclude on the balance of probabilities that neither Mr Baffsky nor Mr Jeffries held indemnity or policies entitling them to indemnity in respect of their role as directors of ILC, from anyone other than ILC.

The "no indemnity pending finding" point
I turn now to the "no indemnity pending finding" point.
The plaintiffs point to a number of matters favouring the construction for which they contend: * (1) in all subclauses of cl 6 "the criterion of operation for the exception in question is some judicial determination on the merits, and not merely the existence of an accusation of liability" * (2) the construction contended for accords with the analysis in authorities construing [s 199A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) (which is in very similar terms to <case> of the Cth Act): Rickus versus Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Limited <case> and Note Printing Australia Ltd versus Leckenby  <case> * (3) cl 6.6(c) of the Deeds supports this construction * (4) the construction advanced by the defendant, it is contended, gives the clause a commercial and businesslike construction. In Leckenby, Tate JA observed (at 66): "Furthermore, the judge's construction of the Deed is also supported by the need for a businesslike approach to be adopted in the interpretation of a commercial contract. It would be apparent to a reasonable person in the position of NPAL and Leckenby, at the time of entering into the Deed, that, in the eventuality of a criminal prosecution, unless there was an agreement for ongoing legal costs to be paid prior to verdict, Leckenby could incur significant liability for those costs in a manner that could be potentially compromising of his defence. As Callinan J said, in the context of construing an exclusion in an insurance policy, which indemnified a director of a company against loss arising from a claim by reason of a wrongful act, as limited only to those circumstances where there was an admission of misconduct, or a curial finding of misconduct: [T]he adoption of the construction for which the respondents contend would mean that in a real and practical sense they would become the final arbiters of the extent of their obligations because their insureds will frequently lack the means to defend themselves adequately against the charges levelled against them unless they are put in funds to do so. It would not have been a difficult matter for the respondents to have insisted upon a policy that put beyond doubt their right to postpone payment of defence costs until the outcome is known had they so wished."
ILC: * (1) contends that any liability to indemnify the plaintiffs does not arise until such time as a Court adjudicates the claim against the plaintiffs (ie in this case by ILC) in favour of the plaintiffs. ILC claims that cl 6.3 and not cl 6.2 provides the mechanism for an advance of funds to allow a former director to defend proceedings of the kind identified in cl 6.2(a) to (e) which funds will not be repayable if the director is successful in his defence of the proceedings * (2) calls in aid the following principles of construction: * (i) where open to more than one interpretation the clause should be construed in favour of the person granting the indemnity: Andar Transport Pty Ltd versus Brambles Ltd  <case>; [(2004) 217 CLR 424] * (ii) the Court should take into account the statutory background * (iii) the Court should avoid interpreting the contract so that a particular clause is treated as nugatory or ineffective * (iv) when a contract uses a legal term of art the Court will give that term its legal meaning: Brett versus Barr Smith  <case>; <case>. The legal terms of art here are said to be "Indemnity for legal costs" in cl 6.2 and "advance for legal costs". Reference was also made to "irrevocable" in cl 6.5(i) * (v) construction by a Court as to the words of one contract are no precedent for the construction or similar words in another contract between different parties * (3) submits that the interpretation advanced by the plaintiffs is uncommercial
It might be thought surprising that a corporation would agree to indemnify a director in respect of costs he incurs in defending a claim by the corporation itself but it is not asserted by ILC that the Deed is not intended to provide protection to directors who are sued by the corporation itself. An argument of that kind was run by the trustee in Rickus and accepted at first instance but rejected on appeal: see Rickus [47] to [56].
ILC's argument placed considerable weight upon the existence of cl 6.3. I enquired of Ms Pritchard as to whether, in absence of cl 6.3, there would be any basis for resisting the plaintiffs' claim to indemnity (leaving entirely to one side the "no action" point). Ms Pritchard was not able to provide me with any reasons that would support the defendant's position if cl 6.3 was absent (see T48.20- T49.1).
Cl 6.3 does provide a mechanism for assistance to directors who are sued whether by third parties or ILC. The clause requires provision of a QC/SC opinion and the payment of interest on the advance and the provision of such security as ILC shall determine. There is something incongruous in the director having to provide a QC/SC's opinion to the very party who brings the suit against them but that anomaly exists both on the plaintiffs' construction and ILC's construction. Importantly, however, cl 6.3 commences with the words: "To the extent that the Director is not presently entitled to be indemnified against a liability for legal costs pursuant to clause 6.2" and Mr Newlinds contends that that form of wording requires, as a first step, consideration of whether the director is presently indemnified under cl 6.2 without any regard to the contents of cl 6.3. I accept this contention and also the contention that as a consequence cl 6.3 cannot be used to read down cl 6.2.
Given the absence in cl 6.2 of any qualifying words about indemnity given by cl 6.2, in my view it follows that ILC has agreed to indemnify the director in relation to any liability incurred by the director "in defending an action" provided the liability in question is one alleged to have been incurred as a director of ILC.
I am unable to accept ILC's contention that the question of whether indemnity should be provided is dependent on a 'positive' finding in favour of the director. The reverse is true- the director is entitled to an indemnity until such time as the director is found to have a liability for which he could not be indemnified under cl 6.1. If such a 'finding' were made, any money received by the director by reason of the indemnity under cl 6.2 would lead to the director being required by virtue of cl 6.6(c) to repay the amounts so received within 30 days of receipt of the details of payment.
I do not regard cl 6.2 as ambiguous and accordingly there is no scope for the principle found in Andar Transport Pty Ltd.
I accept that this approach leaves cl 6.3 limited scope since it would operate only when the director has in fact been found liable and hence where the director wishes to launch an appeal. Cl 6.3 would apply because there having been a finding that the director is not entitled to indemnity the director could not obtain indemnity by virtue of cl 6.2 and could apply through cl 6.3 for a loan (subject to complying with the terms of cl 6.3). I do not accept that the approach contended for by the plaintiffs renders 6.3 nugatory.
In Rickus the plaintiff was the chairman of the board of directors of an industry superannuation fund trustee. Claims were brought against Mr Rickus including claims relating to documents which he had provided to APRA. Mr Rickus sought, by way of cross claim, declarations as to his entitlement to indemnity in respect of his costs of defending the proceedings (including costs incurred before the proceedings were commenced). The trustee abandoned its claims against Mr Rickus before the hearing.
Flick J ordered the trustee to pay Mr Rickus' costs of defending the proceedings on an indemnity basis, but that order did not extend to costs incurred before the commencement of proceedings. The deed used the phrase "any liability incurred". The Full Court, Jacobsen, Siopis and Foster JJ held that the Deed of Indemnity (and Article 88 of the Corporate [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)) provided the right of indemnity to the director. The Full Court held, contrary to the trial Judge, that the indemnity did apply to claims brought by the trustee itself against the director not just the claims by third parties: see [49]- [53] and [58].
As the trustee had abandoned its claims against Mr Rickus there was a question as to what was to be determined on the cross claim (ie the claim for indemnity). The Court did not accept that any finding concerning a breach by Mr Rickus was relevant to whether or not he was entitled to indemnity in accordance with his cross claim. This was because it was only in the trustee's proceedings in which that would be determined and those proceedings had been abandoned.
In the course of considering whether the trial Judge's conclusion that the deed only applied to claims by third parties and not claims by the trustee, the Full Court said of <case> of the Corporations Law on which cl 2.2 of the deed was based (similar to cl 6.2): "The effect of this provision is that a corporation is prohibited from indemnifying an officer of that corporation in respect of legal costs incurred by him in defending proceedings brought by that corporation against that officer if there is a finding in those proceedings that the officer is liable to that corporation. But, for the prohibition to bite, there must be a finding to that effect and that finding must be made in the very proceedings in respect of which legal costs are being claimed by the officer under his or her indemnity.  [42] The prohibition contained in <case>(a) does not apply if the officer successfully defends the proceedings brought by the indemnifier. Nor does it apply if those proceedings are settled or abandoned without any finding of liability being made in those proceedings against the relevant officer."
In Leckenby the Chief Executive Officer of NPAL was charged with conspiring to bribe foreign officials to secure bank note printing contracts for the benefit of NPAL. Mr Leckenby sought to recover under a Deed of Indemnity granted to him by NPAL. NPAL refused to indemnify Mr Leckenby on the basis that NPAL was not permitted at law to indemnify Mr Leckenby until it was known whether or not he is found guilty in criminal proceedings. NPAL offered to lend Mr Leckenby money subject to his providing NPAL with sufficient security.
Cl 2.2 of the deed had a clause which was similar to cl 6.2 because it provided that NPAL: "indemnifies the Officer against each and every liability for legal costs and expense the Officer may incur or for which the Officer may become liable in defending an action for a liability incurred as such an officer of NPAL unless such costs and expenses are incurred:  in defending or resisting proceedings in which the Officer is found to have a liability for which he or she could not be indemnified pursuant to clause 2.1..." (emphasis added)
Tate JA stated: "[38] With respect to the importance of the statutory language, Leckenby submits that NPAL ignores the plain meaning of the word 'found' which requires that there has been, in the future, a finding of guilt. The prohibition in s
A(3)(b) is expressed in the future perfect tense. So too is the exception in cl 2.2(b) of the Deed. This is a conditional tense that is used to indicate that an action will have been completed (or 'perfected') at some point in the future. Thus, unless and until a finding of guilt occurs (that is, will have occurred in the future), the obligation on NPAL to 'indemnify' Leckenby for his legal costs and expenses subsists.  [39] I agree.  [40] A person, including an officer of a corporation, cannot be 'found' guilty until a verdict of guilty has been arrived at. At all relevant times before a verdict has been reached, a person charged with an offence is not a person who has been 'found guilty' of that offence. An obligation to indemnify a person charged with an offence for all his or her legal costs and expenses during the course of defending criminal proceedings until and unless he or she is, in the future, 'found' guilty is, in my view, consistent with the prohibition in <case>(b)." and speaking of Rickus said: "[48] Thus, not only was it necessary that there be a finding of liability before the prohibition in <case>(a) had any impact but, a fortiori, it was necessary that the finding be made in the very same proceedings as that in respect of which the claim for indemnity was being made. This emphasised the Court's construction of <case>(a), relied upon here by the judge, that 'for the prohibition to bite, there must be a finding to that effect'.  [49] The Court reiterated that, under <case>(a), there is a present entitlement to an indemnity up until the time the relevant finding is made and that entitlement will not be defeated by a finding in a separate proceeding from that in respect of which the costs are being claimed, or by supposition as to what findings could have been arrived at hypothetically: 
By the time the primary judge came to hear and determine [Rickus'] cross- claim, the trustee's proceedings had been discontinued. The claimed indemnity pursuant to cl 2.2 was, in terms, confined to legal costs incurred in defending the trustee's proceedings and in resisting the trustee's claims before those proceedings were commenced. Although it may have been the case that, had the trustee pressed its proceedings to finality, [Rickus] would have been found liable to it as alleged, that is not how events unfolded and no finding of liability was ever made in the trustee's proceedings. 
For these reasons, the indemnity provided to [Rickus] pursuant to cl 2.2 of the deed was enlivened when [Rickus] made his claim pursuant to that clause and was not precluded either by the clause itself or by [s
A(3)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). The cross- claim is not a proceeding which [Rickus] defended or resisted and is thus not within the preclusions laid down in cl 2.2(a) of the deed and in [s
A(3)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).  [50] As the judge here recognised, it is clear that analogous reasoning can apply to the prohibition in [s
A(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) so that it does not preclude an entitlement to an indemnity arising when a claim is made by a person in respect of legal costs incurred in defending an action for a liability incurred as an officer of the company if the costs are incurred in defending or resisting criminal proceedings, until and unless the officer is found guilty. As the High Court recognised in Farah Constructions
Pty Ltd versus Say-Dee Pty Ltd, comity between intermediate appellate courts is a matter of great importance. Indeed, with respect to the interpretation of
Commonwealth legislation, as here, there are more stringent obligations: 
Intermediate appellate courts and trial judges in Australia should not depart from decisions in intermediate appellate courts in another jurisdiction on the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation or uniform national legislation unless they are convinced that the interpretation is plainly wrong.  [51] The Full Court in Rickus was not interpreting the section of the
Act with which this appeal is concerned, [s
A(3)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html)
However, it was interpreting a closely related section of the same piece of
Commonwealth legislation, [s
A(3)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) of the Act, and the judgment of the Full Court dealt expressly with the question of when the prohibition 'bites'. Moreover, its answer, namely, not until and unless the finding of liability has been made, has obvious and direct application to the question of when the prohibition under [s
A(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) 'bites', namely, not until and unless the finding of guilt has been made. Far from considering the interpretation of the Full Federal Court to be plainly wrong, with respect I agree with their Honours and find their reasoning convincing. Irrespective of whether I am strictly bound to adopt an interpretation of [s
A(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) that is analogous to their Honours' interpretation of [s
A(3)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html),
I consider that I should adopt such an interpretation as correct."
I accept, with respect, the conclusion of Rickus and Leckenby that payment of funds prior to any finding of the type described as a carve out does not involve any breach of relevant legislation, in this case <case>, and indeed ILC did not contend that cl 6.2 read as the plaintiffs contend would infringe <case>. The plaintiffs accept that construction by a Court of the words in one contract is not a precedent for construction of similar words in another contract: see Commonwealth of Australia versus Chubb Security Australia Pty Ltd  <case> at <case> per Palmer J with whom Handley JA and Beazley JA as her Honour then was concurred: see Sir Kim Lewison and David Hughes 'The Interpretation of Contracts in Australia' (2012, Thomson Reuters) at 4.09 for a detailed discussion of this area. Whilst the interpretation of words used in one contract does not provide authority for what similar words in another contract between different parties mean, the close interplay between legislative provisions and indemnities and the similarity of context do provide some guidance, and I find the reasoning in Rickus and Leckenby persuasive.
Further, although involving a different wording in a different document between different parties, the approach taken in Rickus and Leckenby is, in my view, precisely the same as that taken in Wilkie versus Gordian Runoff Ltd  <case>; [(2005) 221 CLR 522.] I have set out the passage in Leckenby in which Tate JA made reference to what was raised by Callinan J in Wilkie at [52]. That case concerned an exclusion clause in a directors and officer insurance policy by which the insurer would not be liable for defence costs arising out of dishonest, fraudulent or malicious acts or any breach of legislation or contract where such conduct had been admitted to have occurred or subsequently established to have occurred "following the adjudication of any court, tribunal or arbitrator" with the plurality commenting in the course of discussing the exclusion: "The evident purpose of the concluding words of exclusion 7 (and the corresponding words in exclusions 5 and 6) is to deprive the insured of an entitlement to indemnity only where there has been a curial finding of misconduct of a kind specified. Where, by hypothesis, there has been no such finding, a necessary element of the exclusion is missing." (see [42])
In my view cl 6.2 does not operate only after there has been a hearing in which the director obtains a positive finding in his favour. Rather the director is entitled to indemnity until there has been a finding that he is not entitled to be indemnified.
ILC made submissions relying on the explanatory memorandum to the [Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/clerpb1998385/) para 6.16 which is in the following terms: "One of the concerns about the operation of the indemnity provisions has been that a person is not entitled to an indemnity until the outcome of the relevant proceedings is known. Substantial liability may be incurred (for example, ongoing legal costs) during the course of a proceeding, which are unable to be paid to the indemnified officer, until the outcome of the proceedings is known. To address this, as indicated in Note 2 to proposed section 199A, the company may be able to give a person a loan or advance in respect of legal costs. Once the outcome of the proceedings is known, the person would be either obliged to pay back the loan or advance, if not entitled to an indemnity, or may retain the loan moneys as the indemnity to which the person is now entitled." 
The Court is currently concerned with the interpretation not of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) or even [s
M](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27m.html) of the [Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/) (Cth), but rather cl 6.2 of the Deeds. Cl 6.2 does not speak of a loan or advance (whereas cl 6.3 does) but rather indemnity. As I have noted, there is no suggestion that cl 6.2 is void because it infringes [s
M](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caaca1997387/s27m.html) (or any other legislative enactment). In my view what is said in the explanatory memorandum in relation to the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) has no bearing on how cl 6.2 is to be read.
So far as the 'term of art' point is concerned, it seemed to be suggested by the defendant that cl 6.2 by using the phrase 'indemnified' in contrast to the use of the word 'advance' of amounts in cl 6.3 the parties must have intended what is normally understood by indemnity, that is a payment which cannot be recovered from the recipient. This is a theme that was discussed in Leckenby because the Full Court drew attention to the fact that Sifris J the trial Judge (at <case> had regarded the indemnity, which was repayable, as not a traditional indemnity. Tate JA held that the trial Judge was correct to find that the payment was otherwise than a strict indemnity loan or advance: see [64] but that did not mean that the deed infringed the prohibition found in [s 199A(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) (and replicated in <case>(b)). Her Honour said "The judge was correct to recognise that an arrangement that requires the refund of any payment made, upon the satisfaction of a condition, is not a traditional indemnity because it does not hold the promisee harmless against loss despite any relevant contingency. Whatever particular label is given to this type of agreement is of little consequence; what is important is that a proper construction of [s
A(3)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s199a.html) demonstrates that payments can be made up until, and unless, a guilty verdict is reached providing that there is an obligation to repay any such payments in the event of a guilty verdict and that the Deed provides for just such an arrangement."
Given the terms of cl 6.6 which expressly recognises that the director might have been paid an amount under cl 6.2 (or cl 6.1) but is "not subsequently entitled to an indemnity in relation to the liability" he must repay it, I do not think it is open to construe cl 6.2 (or cl 6.1) as not providing for an indemnity in different terms to that which might normally prevail. A promise to indemnify subject to a condition subsequent is still, in my view, a promise to indemnify and I do not think that cl 6.2 can be treated as using 'indemnified' without regard to another clause of the Deed. I regard the word 'irrevocable' in cl 8 as meaning that the indemnity (with its attendant qualifications) could not be revoked and I do not think that repayment in accordance with the terms of the indemnity amounts to revocation of the indemnity.
As for commercial interpretation, I see no lack of commerciality if the Deed works as providing an indemnity for costs to a director unless and until he is found not to be entitled (ie because he has been found to have a liability for which he cannot be indemnified under cl 6.1) and that thereafter he is entitled to a loan on which he must pay interest and for which he must provide security which he will have to repay if he loses his appeal.
I do not think it is incongruous that the director should not have to pay interest or provide security at any time before a finding is made and it makes sense that after a finding has been made against him that he has to pay interest and provide security in respect of the loan to fund his appeal. It does not strike me as absurd, as Ms Pritchard contended (see T54.10), that a director should, as it were, pay a higher price for assistance, once a finding against him has been made.
It follows in my view that the plaintiffs are entitled to indemnity as soon as they have incurred a liability of the type described in cl 6.2. I therefore need to deal with the third question.

Action
Ms Pritchard has referred the Court to definitions of the word 'action' in various legal dictionaries and made reference to Nilant versus Macchia <case>; <case> in which a passage in Black's Law Dictionary to the effect that the term 'proceeding' is more comprehensive than the term 'action'. I accept that 'action' in cl 6.2 is referring to a proceeding in a court of law or tribunal commenced against a director and that this is so notwithstanding that the phrase 'legal proceedings' and 'proceedings' are also used in the clause. It is clear that no proceeding in a court or tribunal has been commenced against either of the plaintiffs.
However, the question for determination is not whether a proceeding has been commenced but rather whether the plaintiffs have taken steps which have led them to incur liability for legal costs in defending an action. In my view steps can be taken to defend a proposed action before it is commenced. A publisher who arranges for an author to be interviewed by media outlets prior to publication is taking steps to sell the book even though the book has not yet been published. A student who purchases texts for next years course is expending money for the purpose of the course even though the course has not commenced. The question which needs to be addressed is whether the words 'defending an action' requires the action to have been commenced rather than only threatened. It is not necessary to determine whether the 27 February Letters constitute a 'demand', rather the question is whether by their very nature the letters are likely to prompt incurral of legal fees in determining the appropriate response and preparation for a foreshadowed action. The words "in full and final settlement" are important since they point to a full and final settlement of the action threatened.
In my view it must have been envisaged that a director who receives a letter from a company of which he was a director and which: * (a) asserts that he breached his duties as a director * (b) asserts that those breaches have caused loss to the company * (c) seeks the payment of $50 million in full and final settlement would be likely to seek legal advice concerning a prospective defence to those foreshadowed proceedings and as to what steps he can take to ensure that his legal costs in so doing are met. Once a letter of the kind written by the ILC has been sent I do not see any good reason for treating the indemnity for the legal liability for costs to be limited to steps taken in defending the foreshadowed action the subject of the letter to only those taken after proceedings have been commenced.

Conclusion
It follows in my view that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought in their Summons and set out at para 4(1)-(5).

Costs
The plaintiffs have been successful and the defendant should pay the plaintiffs' costs on a full indemnity basis because that is what they are entitled to under the Deed.
