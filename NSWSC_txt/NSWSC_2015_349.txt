DECISION
R A HULME J: MLP was sentenced by his Honour Judge Garling in the District Court on 6 October 2005 to imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years with effect from 12 May 2005. This was for an offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years (namely 9 years) for which the applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for 25 years and for which there was a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
On 6 September 2006 the Court of Criminal Appeal "confirmed" the 16 year sentence but "varied" the non-parole period to one of 11 years: MLP versus R <case>; [164 A Crim R 93.]
The Crown conceded the error when the matter was back before the Court last year: MLP versus R <case> (MLP versus R (2014)). Bellew J, with whom Macfarlan JA and Adamson J agreed, said (at [8]) that "the sole issue to be determined ... is whether some other sentence is warranted in law: [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) [s 6(3)".](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) After referring to various aspects of the case his Honour arrived at the conclusion that some other sentence was not warranted. The appeal was dismissed.
MLP has now made another application pursuant to [Pt 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/index.html#p7) Div 3. The basis of the application is that Bellew J "misdirected himself as to the operation of [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html); without exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, he concluded that while there was 'no doubt that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was stern ... I am not persuaded that some other sentence is warranted in law'" (Application submissions at [6]).
Submissions were made by the applicant and by the Attorney General. The latter succinctly characterised the application as posing a question whether there was a doubt or question as to a mitigating feature in the case, namely the proper application of sentencing principles in the applicant's second appeal.
 [Section 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/)
Subsequent to MLP versus R (2014), the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in Kentwell versus The Queen <case>; [313 ALR 451.] That case was concerned (in part) with the correct application of [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/): "On an appeal under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal."
The correct approach to [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) was described in the joint judgment (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) at [42]-[43] (with citations omitted) as follows: "Spigelman CJ's analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the [Sentencing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/) [the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/) ], and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be "warranted in law". A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not "warranted in law" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal
Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s44.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/) requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1
February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.

After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the
Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal's independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re- sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender's appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal."
Two things emerge from the above that are pertinent to the present application. The first (and this is emphasised in the applicant's submissions) is that in considering the issue in [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s6.html) the Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. It is a matter of moving directly from the identification of error to an independent determination of what sentence was warranted in all the circumstances (including matters that have arisen since the original sentencing exercise). The second is that it is a matter of comparison of what that determination yields with what the original sentence was.
There is nothing that indicates that this involves a sequential or two-step process; the two issues may be considered simultaneously. This is because there is but one question posed by [s 6(3):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s6.html) whether the Court is "of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed".

Submissions and consideration
It was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant that Bellew J had misdirected himself by inserting "an intermediate step requiring that he be 'persuaded' that some other sentence was warranted in law or that the sentence was outside an established range, prior to exercising the sentencing discretion afresh" (Application submissions at [9]). This was said to arise from two aspects of his Honour's judgment:
The language adopted by his Honour: that the sentence was not outside the "established range" and that he was "not persuaded" that another sentence was warranted.
The incomplete manner in which his Honour considered the matters that would otherwise have been relevant to a genuine re-exercise of the sentencing discretion.
Focus was placed by the applicant upon the following paragraphs: "[46] Even if such conclusions are supported by the statistical material, they do not lead to the further conclusion that some other sentence is warranted in the present case. The sentence imposed upon the appellant might well be the highest imposed for a single instance of offending contrary to s. 66A. That does not demonstrate that the sentence is unduly harsh. As a matter of common sense, there will always be one sentence which constitutes the longest sentence imposed for particular offending: Jolly versus R <case> at <case>.
In my view, the statistical material put before the Court in the present case does not support a conclusion that some other sentence is warranted.
 [47] I have considered the cases to which the Court was referred in which sentences were imposed for similar offending and which were said to demonstrate the harshness of the sentence imposed upon the appellant. I am not persuaded that they support the conclusion that some other sentence is warranted, nor am I persuaded that they establish that the sentence imposed upon the appellant is at odds with some established sentencing range.
 ...
 [52] There is no doubt that the sentence imposed upon the appellant was stern. However, having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant, I am not persuaded that some other sentence is warranted. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the two legislative guideposts to which I previously referred." (The underlining and italics are mine and direct attention to words that were the focus of the applicant's submissions)
There is another important matter to be borne in mind aside from the two matters that emerge from Kentwell versus The Queen that I have referred to above. The Court does not consider those two matters in a vacuum. It considers them in the context of submissions made by the parties. An appellant's submissions focus upon an attempt to persuade the Court that a lesser sentence than that originally passed is warranted whilst the Crown's submissions (not necessarily but usually) focus upon an attempt to persuade the Court that a lesser sentence than that originally passed is not warranted. It is understandable then that the Court will express itself in terms of whether it is persuaded by one or the other. It naturally follows from this that having made its own independent assessment of what sentence should have been passed, the Court would provide reasons for why it is not persuaded by the submissions of the unsuccessful party to a different conclusion either generally or in relation to submissions on discrete topics (here, for example, in relation to statistics and comparisons with other cases).
The submissions for the applicant (at [10]) identify that Bellew J referred in his reasons for judgment to a number of matters that had been the subject of his submissions to the Court: 
The offending was isolated in nature.

The applicant had spent the entirety of his sentence in protective custody.

He remained at risk of assault.

He had been generally well-behaved while in custody.

He had undertaken such rehabilitative programs as had been offered to him.

He had been employed.

He had a number of serious health issues.

His mother had died following complications during routine surgery in 2010 leaving his elderly father, who was in poor health, adversely affected and unable to visit the applicant regularly. And his siblings, all of whom are blind, could not adequately care for his father nor visit the applicant regularly.

Sentencing statistics and other cases involving similar offending.
The applicant's submissions also referred (at [12]) to the following matters that Bellew J had considered: 
The legislative guideposts of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period prescribed for the offence.

That the offending was objectively serious and there was an abuse of a position of trust.
 (The reference to these matters in the judgment was explained in summary fashion (at [28]): "the appellant forced his penis into the vagina of his daughter who was then only 9 years of age. The offending occurred in the immediate presence of the appellant's other children".) 
That concentrating on the short duration of the offending minimised or ignored the significance of long term effect of such offending on a young victim.
 (Bellew J referred to R versus Gavel <case> at <case>- <case>.
And he said (at [30]) that whatever the precise duration of the offending, the "more important factor is that ... the offending occurred over a sufficient period of time, and with sufficient force, to tear the victim's hymen".) 
That the applicant apparently continued to deny the offending.
 (His Honour continued (at [33]) by saying that the potentially mitigating feature of remorse is not something that can be taken into account in the applicant's favour.) 
That ill-health does not necessarily operate in mitigation where the offending is serious and some of it pre-dated the offending.
 (And (at [38]) his Honour was satisfied that the applicant was receiving appropriate treatment whilst in custody.) 
That while the various matters concerning the applicant's family members rendered it more difficult for him to have contact with them, this was not an uncommon occurrence for prison inmates.
 (His Honour also accepted (at [39]) that the circumstances surrounding the applicant's mother's death was a source of considerable anxiety for him.)
The applicant's submissions took no issue with the description by Bellew J (at [18]) of the applicant's submission in MLP versus R (2014) that "sentencing statistics, along with a number of sentences imposed in other [similar] cases ... demonstrated that the sentence imposed upon the [applicant] was unduly harsh and unwarranted".
The submissions for the Attorney General, while disagreeing with every other aspect of the applicant's submissions, conceded that it would be open to conclude the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal because the use of terms like "harsh" may suggest that the assessment was confined to whether the sentence was within a "permissible range". If that were the case, there would be error because the task with which the Court was engaged under [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sa121/s6.html) requires more than that as the joint reasons in Kentwell versus The Queen explain.
I respectfully disagree that the use of these terms was erroneous. The Attorney General argued that every other aspect of the judgment is indicative of an independent discretion being exercised. The use of "harsh" in the context of addressing submissions by the applicant that statistics and comparable cases demonstrated that the sentence was "unduly harsh and unwarranted" is perfectly explicable and not inconsistent with his Honour engaging in the correct approach. Similarly the use of the term "stern" is not indicative of error. A 16 year sentence is self-evidently amenable to such a description. But his Honour was clearly of the view that such an outcome was warranted.
It was submitted by the applicant that his Honour failed to take into account in a "genuine re-sentencing exercise" the matters I referred to in the applicant's submissions (at [10]) which I have listed above (at [14]). The fact that his Honour troubled himself to refer to them does not support a proposition that he did not take them into account.
The fact that Bellew J engaged in an independent exercise of sentencing discretion is further indicated by the fact that he did not simply adopt findings made by the primary judge; without necessarily descending into every detail he did refer to all significant objective and subjective circumstances of the case; and he did not ignore evidence of matters that had arisen since sentence.
I cannot identify any error in the approach taken by Bellew J, with the concurrence of the two other members of the Court, to the assessment of the issue posed by [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
Isolating a few words here or there ("not persuaded" for example) is not a fair approach to the assessment of the judgment as a whole and fails to appreciate the complete task with which his Honour was engaged. Statements such as his Honour not being persuaded that the sentence was "at odds with some established sentencing range" have to be seen in the context of submissions by the applicant that the sentence was "at odds".
There is no suggestion that his Honour failed to take into account any sentencing principle; any evidentiary matter (I reject the applicant's submissions (at [18]-[20]) that some particular matters were not expressly referred to; his Honour sufficiently referred to the gist of all that had been put on the applicant's behalf); or any submission advanced on the applicant's behalf. To the contrary, it appears that his Honour thoroughly canvassed all of the evidence and submissions.

Conclusion
The applicant submitted that the doubt or question that warranted the referral pursuant to Div 3 of [Pt 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/index.html#p7) of the [Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) last year remains because of the erroneous approach taken to the re-sentencing exercise by the Court in MLP versus R (2014). It was submitted (at [1]) that "despite two appeals, the applicant has still not been sentenced according to law, as is his entitlement: Kentwell at [44]". With respect to the learned authors of that submission, I reject it.
To reiterate, what was required was for the Court to make an independent assessment of the appropriate sentence and compare it with that which had been imposed in order to determine whether there should be a lesser sentence. Necessarily, that had to be done in the context of the submissions that had been made in an endeavour to persuade the Court one way or the other. This was done.
I feel no unease or sense of disquiet that this task was not undertaken in MLP versus R (2014). And, not that it is necessary to fulfil my present function, I have nevertheless considered for myself the question whether a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed. I have no unease or sense of disquiet about the answer to that question being answered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the negative.

Decision
The application is refused.
