JUDGMENT
By Originating Process filed on 30 March 2012, the Plaintiff, Oztec Pty Limited ("Oztec") seeks to set aside a statutory demand dated 2 March 2012 ("Demand") served by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation ("DCT"). The Demand claims the amount of $458,442 described as: "Running Balance Account deficit debt as at 2 March 2012 in respect of amounts due under the BAS [business activity statement] provisions as defined in sub- section 995-1(1) of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/) ("the
ITAA 1997") ..., administrative penalties due under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/index.html#p4)-[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/index.html#p25) of Schedule 1 to the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) ("the TAA ") and the general interest charge payable under [section
AAZF](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazf.html) of the TAA 1953, being a debt due and payable by the Company pursuant to [section
AAZH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazh.html) of the TAA 1953".
Oztec's application to set aside the Demand is made on the grounds specified in [ss 459H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) and [459J](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth). The Originating Process further identifies the grounds of that application as that (1) Oztec does not owe the amount claimed; (2) there is a genuine dispute about the existence of the amount of the debt; (3) Oztec has an offsetting claim; (4) the Demand is defective because it has been based on source documents and processes that are misleading and contain gross errors; and (5) injustice would be caused unless the Demand be set aside. Oztec seeks an order setting aside the Demand and costs. Oztec also claims damages, but the Court has no jurisdiction to make an order for damages in an application to set aside a statutory demand and that claim was not pressed in Oztec's submissions before me.
Oztec was represented by its director, Mr Simon Oke, in the application. I dispensed with the requirement for Mr Oke to file an affidavit as to his authority to carry on the proceedings complying with r 7.2 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , having drawn to his attention the prospect that he might be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings in accordance with the principles set out in Knight versus FP Special Assets Ltd [[1992] HCA 28] The DCT neither consented to nor opposed that course.
Oztec relies, in support of the application to set aside the Demand, on Mr Oke's affidavits dated 30 March 2012 and 3 August 2012. In broad summary, Mr Oke contends that Oztec does not owe the money claimed; that the DCT has made errors in calculating its claim and based that claim on documents that are defective and misleading; that the DCT has relied on an audit process that was misleading and deceptive; and that the Demand is defective and there would be injustice if it were not set aside. Mr Oke acknowledges that the amounts claimed are generally consistent with the outcome of an audit conducted by the Australian Taxation Office but Oztec complains as to the audit process. Mr Oke refers to difficulties by Oztec in accessing documents and staff during the period of the audit, by reason of a relocation of its premises; that the audit was completed with "undue haste"; that documents that he contends were mailed to the Australian Taxation Office were, he contends, ignored by it; that the Australian Taxation Office revised Oztec's business activity statements for a wider period than it had indicated was the subject of the audit; that the DCT disallowed Oztec's claimed GST credits for a 45 month period and should not have done so; that no penalties or charges should apply since the claimed GST credits should not have been disallowed; and that the DCT made later statements which could only be correct if its letter dated 14 December 2011 setting out the interim findings of the audit were incorrect.
For reasons which will emerge below, it is ultimately not necessary for the Court to reach an assessment of the detail of these criticisms. I should note, however, that it was by no means clear that they were justified. To take three examples, Mr Oke refers to Oztec's difficulties in accessing documents and staff in order to justify GST credits claimed by Oztec during the period of the audit, but there is no evidence that those documents were subsequently provided to the DCT in order to seek to persuade it to change its views, nor were they put in evidence in these proceedings in order to seek to support Oztec's position. Mr Oke contends that documents were provided to the DCT and ignored, but the transaction listing for purchases on which Oztec relies includes, for example, substantial internet transfers without further explanation. The criticism that the DCT acted inconsistently with the interim report provided on 14 December 2011 ignores the fact that that report was interim in character, and it was hardly inappropriate for the DCT not to act on the outcome of the audit before finalising it.
Mr Oke indicates that Oztec has applied for an internal review by the DCT of the audit findings, although there is a dispute that it is not appropriate to resolve in an application of this kind as to when that application was made. Mr Oke contends that Oztec's running balance account ("RBA") of GST credits and debits has been in surplus based on Oztec's own records, but those records were largely not in evidence before me. Mr Oke also contends that the RBA on which the DCT relies do not include R&D tax offsets claimed by Oztec and Oztec therefore has an offsetting claim which exceeds the amount of the Demand or the debt properly owed. I will address that contention further below.
Mr Oke's affidavit dated 3 August 2012 exhibits further documents, including an objection to the findings of the audit which Oztec claims it submitted in February 2012, but which the DCT denies receiving at that time. Oztec also relies on its income tax returns for the years ended 2011 (which it claims was posted to the DCT in October 2011 and relodged in August 2012; the DCT's evidence is that it did not receive that return until 2 August 2012 and had not yet processed it) and 2012 (which it claims to have lodged in September 2012 and relodged on the date of the hearing of this application).
The DCT relies on an affidavit of Mr Brendan D'Arcy dated 7 June 2012, which outlines its accounting systems; indicates the origin of the debt claimed, including the outcome of the audit and the issue of revised business activity statements forms to Oztec for the period 1 October 2007-31 March 2011; and sets out the manner in which liabilities and penalties are treated in the RBA maintained by the DCT in respect of primary tax debts in relation to Oztec. The DCT also relies on a Certificate under [s 8AAZJ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazj.html) of the [Taxation Administration Act 1953](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (Cth) ("TAA 1953") showing a deficit debt owed by Oztec of $472,561.31 as at 7 June 2012, which corresponds to the balance claimed in the Demand as at 2 March 2012 plus further general interest charged from that date to 7 June 2012. 
It is not necessary to review the statutory structure for the RBA in detail. However, broadly speaking, liabilities arising under the business activity statements and assessment notices in respect of penalties are "primary tax debts" for the purposes of [s 8AAZA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aaza.html) of the TAA 1953. The RBA in respect of primary tax debts is maintained by the DCT under [s 8AAZC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazc.html) of the TAA 1953. A general interest charge is imposed where there is an RBA deficit debt (as defined in TAA 1953 [s 8AAZA)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aaza.html) on a daily basis: TAA 1953 [s 8AAZF.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazf.html) The amount of Oztec's liability for GST was self-assessed and, in its original business activity statements, the amounts it owed to the DCT broadly corresponded to the amounts it claimed the DCT owed it for GST credits. Following the audit, the DCT issued amended business activity statements which excluded the claims for amounts owed by the DCT to Oztec, on the basis that the DCT considered that Oztec had not substantiated those claims.
The DCT also relies on the affidavit of Mr Michael O'Neill sworn 20 August 2012. Mr O'Neill's evidence is that he has not located any record of any objection lodged by Oztec under [Pt IVC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/index.html#p104) of the TAA 1953 and he refers to Assessment Notices issued by the DCT to Oztec for GST liability and penalties respectively on 17 and 18 January 2012. Mr O'Neill's evidence is that Oztec's RBA balance as at 20 August 2013 was in deficit in the amount of $478,878.72. The DCT also relies on a Certificate under [s 8AAZJ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s8aazj.html) of the TAA 1953 in that regard.
Oztec made lengthy written submissions and Mr Oke also made comprehensive oral submissions. As I pointed out to Mr Oke in the course of those submissions, I cannot have regard to matters asserted in those submissions that are not established by evidence led in the proceedings. In particular, Mr Oke made submissions as to the business activities of another entity, Ozone Manufacturing Pty Limited ("Ozone Manufacturing"), and as to its history in research and development ("R&D") which were not the subject of evidence led in the proceedings. Mr Oke also relied on the judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Ozone Manufacturing Pty Ltd versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(2006) 94 SASR 269] to seek to establish matters as to the business of Ozone Manufacturing, but that judgment is not admissible as proof of the relevant facts in these proceedings, by reason of [s 91](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s91.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) ; and, second, there is no reason to assume, absent evidence, that the business of Ozone Manufacturing (or, indeed, Oztec) in 2011-2012 is the same as the business of Ozone Manufacturing in the period prior to 2006.
Oztec also refers to the legislative basis of R&D tax offsets and provides a detailed analysis of the structure of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1997](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/) (Cth) (as it stood prior to amendments by the [Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Act 2011](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tlaada2011399/) (Cth)). It is not necessary to address those provisions because the DCT did not contend that the [Income Tax Assessment Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1997240/) did not permit R&D tax offsets in a proper case.

Whether a genuine dispute is established
The first basis on which Oztec seeks to set aside the Demand is that there is a genuine dispute as to the existence of the amount of the tax debt to which the Demand relates, for the purposes of [s 459H(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). The principles applicable to establishing a genuine dispute are well-established. In order to establish such a dispute, Oztec needs to show that its claim that the debt does not exist, or does not exist in the amount claimed, is not vexatious or frivolous or may have some substance or involves a plausible contention requiring investigation: Eyota Pty Ltd versus Hanave Pty Ltd  <case>. 
Oztec faces several difficulties in seeking to establish that the debt claimed in the Demand is genuinely disputed. First, the DCT relies on the statement of RBA and certificates annexed to the affidavits of Messrs D'Arcy and O'Neill. The RBA for Oztec indicates that the amount of the deficit at 2 March 2012 is the amount claimed in the Demand. [Section 53](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s53.html) of the TAA 1953 in turn provides that the production of a RBA statement in relation to business activity statement debts is prima facie evidence that the amount and particulars contained in it is correct. The DCT has also issued a certificate in respect of the RBA deficit as at 7 June 2012, which is consistent with the amount claimed at 2 March 2012 plus interest, and that certificate is also prima facie evidence of that matter under <case> of the TAA 1953.
Moreover, on 17 January 2012, the DCT issued a Notice of Assessment under [s 105](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s105.html)-[5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s5.html)(1) of Sch 1 to the TAA 1953 applying a debit of $269,227 to Oztec's RBA reflecting the outcome of the audit. [Section 105](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s105.html)-[100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s100.html) of Sch 1 of the TAA 1953 in turn provides that the production of a Notice of Assessment is conclusive evidence that the assessment was properly made and, except in a proceeding under [Pt IVC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p104) of the TAA 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and particulars in the assessment are correct. On 18 January 2012, the DCT issued a Notice of Assessment and Liability to Pay Penalty to Oztec in the amount of $134,613.50. [Section 298](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s298.html)-30 of Sch 1 of the TAA 1953 provides for the DCT to make an assessment of an administrative penalty and that the production of a notice of that assessment or a copy of it certified by or on behalf of the DCT is conclusive evidence of the making of that assessment and the particulars in it, other than in proceedings under [Pt IVC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p104) of the TAA 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment: TAA 1953 Sch 1 [s 298](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s298.html)-[3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s3.html)(3)-(4). The amounts of the assessment are in turn reflected in Oztec's RBA with process dates of 16 and 18 January 2012 and, after general interest charges are applied to 1 March 2012, give rise to the amount claimed in the Demand. 
In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation versus Broadbeach Properties Pty Ltd <case>; [(2008) 237 CLR 473] It follows that, since there are conclusive provisions as to both the amount of the tax assessment recorded in the RBA and the amount of penalty applicable, there is no room for a genuine dispute as to those matters to be established. 
Mr Oke submitted that the High Court's decision in Broadbeach Properties left open the possibility that a genuine dispute could arise in respect of the amount of general interest claimed by the DCT, by reason of a concession made by the DCT in that case. While I accept that submission, Oztec did not seek to establish any basis for a genuine dispute as to the interest claimed by the DCT other than that the tax assessed and penalty assessed were not due, and it cannot establish that matter for the reasons noted above. Absent any other challenge to the basis of the interest claimed, it also cannot establish that there is a genuine dispute as to the amount of interest included in the Demand. 
For these reasons, Oztec's claim to set aside the Demand on the basis that there is a genuine dispute as to the amount claimed under [s 459H(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) must fail. 
Whether an offsetting claim is established
Oztec also seeks to establish an offsetting claim in respect of the debt claimed in the Demand, for the purposes of [s 459H(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), arising from tax offsets to which it claims to be entitled as a result of deemed assessments on lodging its 2011 and 2012 tax returns. As I have noted above, there is a dispute as to when those returns were lodged, which it is not necessary to determine for the purposes of these proceedings. 
I raised with Mr Oke, in the course of submissions, whether it was open to Oztec to rely on its 2012 tax return, having regard to the principle in Graywinter Properties Pty Ltd versus Gas & Fuel Corp Superannuation Fund <case>; [(1996) 70 FCR 452] I am satisfied that it is open to Oztec to do so, because Mr Oke's original affidavit seeking to set aside the Demand, which was filed within the 21 day period specified in [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), had identified an offsetting claim exceeding the sum of the Demand and pointed to further R&D tax offsets which would also be lodged for R&D work already performed for periods corresponding to those stated in the Demand. That reference was, in my view, sufficient to identify the fact that further credits would be claimed in respect of the financial year ending 30 June 2012 as a basis of opposition to the Demand.
An "offsetting claim" for the purposes of [s 459H(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is the amount of a claim, or claims, that the company has against the person who served the statutory demand by way of counter claim, set-off or cross demand, whether or not that amount arises out of the same transaction or circumstances as the debt to which the demand relates: [s 459H(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) If the Court is satisfied that the company has an offsetting claim, then the Court is required to calculate the "substantiated amount" of the demand by deducting any offsetting claim from the admitted amount of the debt: [s 459H(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html)
It is well-established that a company can establish an "offsetting claim" if there is a "serious question to be tried" or "an issue deserving of a hearing" as to whether the company has such a claim against the creditor and that claim is made in good faith and is arguable and not frivolous or vexatious: Scanhill Pty Ltd versus Century 21 Australasia Pty Ltd <case>; <case>, Palmer J observed that an offsetting claim is: "... a claim on a cause of action advanced in good faith, for an amount claimed in good faith. 'Good faith' means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful".
In Gujarat NRE Australia Pty Ltd versus Williams <case> at <case>, Austin J noted that the standard to be reached to persuade a Court that there is an offsetting claim "is the same as the standard to be reached to persuade the Court that there is a genuine dispute between the alleged debtor and the party claiming to be creditor". His Honour also noted (at [21]) that, in proceedings of this kind, the Court does not enter into the merits of any dispute but merely satisfies itself, to the standard described by McLelland CJ in Eq in Eyota Pty Ltd versus Hanave Pty Ltd above, that the assertion of an "offsetting claim" is "genuine" and, if so, the statutory demand procedure is out of place. In Toorallie versus Black <case> at <case>, Barrett J noted that: "[T]he court must look sufficiently closely at the asserted claim to assess its general viability in the light of the evidence."
Oztec placed particular weight on the analysis of the character of an offsetting claim in the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Ozone Manufacturing Pty Ltd versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation above. Oztec contended that Ozone Manufacturing was a related body, although the only evidence as to that matter was a concession by the DCT that Mr Oke was director and secretary of both Ozone Manufacturing and Oztec. Oztec also contended that Ozone Manufacturing had previously carried on the business now carried on by Oztec but that was not established by admissible evidence. In that decision, the Full Court referred to well-known cases concerning the nature of an "offsetting claim" and Debelle J observed, consistent with the authorities to which I have referred above, that: "when deciding whether an offsetting claim exists, the test is whether the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that the person on whom the demand has been served has an offsetting claim ... or that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious ... or that it is not fictitious or merely colourable ...".

His Honour also noted (at [46]-[47]) that the test whether an offsetting claim exists is the same as for a genuine dispute, that is to say, the claim must be bona fide and truly exist in fact and that the grounds for alleging the existence of the dispute are real and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived.
In that case, Ozone Manufacturing had not disputed the substantial negative balance in its RBA (other than a relatively small amount) but had contended that it was entitled to tax offsets for R&D expenditure for 3 years so that the total of the credits exceeded the balance in the RBA and a refund was due to it, and the Full Court held that Ozone Manufacturing had established an offsetting claim. The Court undertook a detailed analysis of the relevant legislative provisions and held that, if Ozone Manufacturing qualified for deductions from income tax for R&D expenditure, it was entitled to claim a tax offset instead of a deduction for that expenditure and could apply those tax offsets against taxes other than income tax. The Court pointed to matters which suggested that Ozone Manufacturing's claim was not artificial, including that it had been claiming and had been allowed deductions for R&D expenditure from 1995 to 2001 and had been claiming tax offsets for that expenditure since 2002, and observed that the question whether Ozone was able to establish what part of its expenditure was for research and development, as distinct from whether there was a genuine offsetting claim, was a question to be determined in other proceedings. The Court also relied on the fact that Ozone Manufacturing had supplied a large number of documents in response to an Australian Taxation Office audit of its research activities. 
Oztec similarly contends that its offsetting claim arises from R&D tax offsets available to it under its 2011 and 2012 tax returns. Oztec contends that deemed assessments arose when Oztec lodged those returns and the DCT does not contest that contention. Oztec contends that, even if it cannot compel the DCT to credit the R&D tax offsets that it claims in those returns against its RBA, it has an offsetting claim against its liability under the RBA arising from them. While there is no suggestion that the amount of any credit arising under the 2012 return existed as at the date of the Demand, that does not prevent Oztec relying on the amount of that credit as an offsetting claim, if it is otherwise established. An offsetting claim may include a claim which arises after the proceedings to set aside the Demand are filed but prior to the hearing: Noroton Holdings Pty Ltd versus Sydney Land Corporation Pty Ltd <case> at <case>; F Assaf, Statutory Demands and Winding Up in Insolvency, 2nd ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2012 at [6.4].
In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Oke accepted that a genuine offsetting claim was not established merely because Oztec had self-assessed a particular amount of R&D tax offset to be due to it, notwithstanding the deemed assessment which might arise from the lodgement of its return, but also required that there be a genuine case that Oztec was properly entitled to the tax offset it claimed. In my view, that concession was properly made. While a claim to a tax offset might arise merely from the amount of a deemed assessment, limited only by the taxpayer's ingenuity and ambition in the amount of the R&D tax offset claimed in its return, that would not be a genuine offsetting claim unless the taxpayer also established that the claim to a tax offset was genuinely made and there was a serious question to be tried or an issue deserving of a hearing as to whether that tax offset was properly to be set off against the debt or otherwise recoverable against the ATO.
In order to establish that its claim for an R&D tax offset was genuinely made, Oztec relied on its applications to AusIndustry for registration of its R&D activities for the years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 and on the lodgement of the relevant tax returns. Those applications refer to some projects to be undertaken in both years; there was also a difference between the projects identified as to be undertaken by Oztec in its 2010-2011 AusIndustry application and its 2011-2012 AusIndustry application, with a point of entry water purifier and grey water, rain water and recirculating water recycling systems using redox treatment identified as to be undertaken in 2010-2011 but not 2011-2012 and electric hose reel research and designs identified as to be undertaken in 2011-2012 but not in 2010-2011. The applications set out expenditures proposed to be made in respect of the relevant projects and objectives of those projects as well as describing, in general terms, the activities to be undertaken. Those applications were admitted without objection by the DCT, and it sought no limitation on the matters proved by them. Those applications should therefore be treated as proof of the fact of the matters stated in them. However, they are directed to the activities that Oztec proposed to undertake and do not establish that those activities were in fact undertaken. The tax returns on which Oztec relies in turn establish that it claimed to have incurred expenditure subject to a R&D tax incentive, but also do not establish that it had in fact incurred such expenditure or that that expenditure qualified for the R&D tax offset claimed. 
The difference between, on the one hand, evidence of claims made by Oztec and, on the other, evidence of activities undertaken by Oztec that would support those claims emerged clearly in oral submissions, when I raised with Mr Oke whether there was any evidence before me to establish that Oztec's claim to an R&D tax offset was genuine, apart from the fact that Oztec had made it. Mr Oke responded by drawing attention to the evidence that Oztec had sought registration for R&D activities and claimed tax deductions for them, as distinct from evidence that such activities were in fact undertaken by it: "Well, your Honour, to that I would answer that there is a web of documentary evidence before the Court which proves the genuineness of the claim comprising four kinds of documents: The first document is the taxation return. This is one for each of the years. The first is the taxation return. The second is the research and development tax incentive schedule, which is the separately 4 paged document attached to it. The third is the objection form, which has only been submitted for 2011 at this point in time. The fourth, importantly, are the two Oztec Industry application forms, and these are substantial documents.

For example, for 2012, at tab 3 annexure B is the Oztec Industry forms, a 22 paged document. For 2011, the Oztec Industry form is at tab 2 annexure J, which is a 10 paged document. Looking at the 2012 document by way of example, that is at tab 3 annexure B, what is required with [AusIndustry] is to state what the individual projects are or the costs of the subprojects and what the core R&D activities are. That begins, for example, on p 5 of 22. It runs through to p 17 of 22.

The plaintiff has done everything that is legislative[ly] required to properly claim the R&D tax return. This is a form of tax offset. There is nothing else. Not only is there nothing else that the plaintiff needed to do to properly claim the R&D tax offset, but there is nothing it actually can do. The grand total of what it can do in terms of the legislative requirement and the paperwork, is all done. All that is required in addition, which is of course provided a difficulty to provide to this Court in addition to the claim, that it had actually done it, done the R&D." (emphasis added)
It was not, of course, necessary for Oztec, in order to meet the relatively low threshold of establishing an offsetting claim, to establish that it had undertaken research and development so as to entitle it to an R&D tax offset in the detail that might be necessary in a substantive trial. However, in order to establish that Oztec had a genuine claim to an R&D tax offset, and therefore a genuine offsetting claim derived from that tax offset, it needed to satisfy the Court to the relatively undemanding standard set by [s 459H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that it in fact undertook activities that were capable of supporting such a claim, so the claim was made in good faith. Oztec did not lead evidence in this application, even in summary form, that it in fact undertook R&D activity, as distinct from lodging applications with AusIndustry anticipating that it would do so and claiming tax offsets on the basis that it had done so. 
I have also referred above to the evidence that, on 20 August 2012, the RBA balance of Oztec was $478,878.22 and, on 20 August 2012, the DCT certified that the RBA deficit debt owed by Oztec was that amount. I accept Oztec's submission that the prima facie evidence arising from those matters, under ss 8AAZI and 8AAZJ of the TAA 1953, would be capable of being rebutted by evidence that tax offsets were due to Oztec, and I do not understand the DCT to contend to the contrary. However, as Mr Acheampong who appeared for the DCT pointed out, even if it were assumed that Oztec was entitled to the R&D tax offsets which it claimed in its tax returns, it did not follow that Oztec had any claim against the DCT arising from those tax offsets, because that would depend upon Oztec's overall tax position (including its income tax liabilities) as to which it had led no evidence. Where Oztec sought to establish that it had a genuine offsetting claim, then it was a matter for it, not the DCT, to establish that there was a serious question to be tried, or an issue deserving of a hearing, that its overall tax position meant that either the entire amount of the R&D tax offsets, or some identifiable part of them were available to be offset against the debt claimed in the Demand. Oztec also did not establish that matter.
For these reasons, an offsetting claim under [s 459H(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) is not established.

Whether there is some other reason to set aside the Demand [Section 459J(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides that a statutory demand may be set aside when the Court is satisfied that, because of a defect in the statutory demand, substantial injustice will be caused unless the statutory demand is set aside. I do not understand Oztec to assert there is a defect in the Demand, other than that it contends the amount claimed is not due. It has not established a defect in that sense.
[Section 459J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) allows a statutory demand to be set aside on the basis that there is some other reason why it should be set aside. The Court's power to set aside a statutory demand under that section exists to maintain the integrity of the process provided under [Pt 5.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.4) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and is to be used to counter an attempted subversion of the statutory scheme, but is not exercised by reference to subjective notions of fairness: Portrait Express (Sales) Pty Ltd versus Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd [(1996) 20 ACSR 746]
However, the scope for [s 459J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to operate in respect of tax debts is also constrained by Broadbeach Properties, where the plurality of the High Court emphasised that the application of [s 459J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) in this context must have regard to the legislative policy which provides for the recovery of tax debts. In Mossimo Systems International Pty Ltd versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation above at [30]-[31], Barrett J observed that: "The question of what comes within the [s
J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) category is to be answered by reference to legislative policy, including the policy of the taxation legislation. That policy makes tax debts recoverable, notwithstanding the pendency of steps directed towards revision of the liability for tax under that legislation.

It follows that any appeal to undefined notions of fairness on the ground that a concluded assessment or other quantification against a taxpayer is the subject of challenge initiated by the taxpayer under the taxation legislation is foreign to the operation of [s
J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) in a case such as the present or, more particularly, to the exercise of the discretion under that section. This very point is made at para [62] of the joint judgment in Broadbeach." 
In Catarina Gardens Pty Ltd versus Deputy Commissioner of Taxation above,
Macready AsJ took the same view.
The fact that Oztec contends that the audit, which gave rise to the relevant tax debt, was "unfair" is not a matter which can give rise to an abuse of process or other reason to set aside the Demand, for the purposes of [s 459J(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html), where a genuine dispute as to the amount of the debt cannot be established for the reasons noted above. So far as Oztec relied on the disruption to its business that would ensue from a statutory demand which had not been set aside; the plurality of the High Court emphasised in Broadbeach Properties (at [60]), that matters of this kind were ordinary incidents of reliance by the DCT upon the statutory demand system. Oztec has also not established that the Demand should be set aside for some other reason under [s 459J](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459j.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).

Orders and costs
I therefore order that the Originating Process be dismissed. I will hear the parties as to costs.
