JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex-parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst, as here, there is an application pending for an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the Act.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 22 November 2016. In that affidavit Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer as defined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to her suspicion that the three Defendants have engaged in serious crime related activity or activities.
In relation to the First Defendant, Ronnie Mogy, that serious crime related activity is knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) an offence involving money laundering. In relation to the second defendant, Uri Mogilevsky, the serious crime related activity is knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). In relation to the third defendant, Halina Gilla Sher, the serious crime related activity is supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug being methamphetamine and also knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to [section 193B(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) .
I note that Miss Bourne's suspicion is based on reading the factual material provided to her by the New South Wales Police. She sought information from Detective Senior Constable Charbel Azzi as to the source of the facts contained in the facts sheet, including whether he was the officer who drafted the facts sheet, whether he knew that the contents of the facts sheet were true and if they were prepared based on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. Detective Senior Constable Azzi answered all of those questions in the affirmative.
It is not necessary to detail all of the information contained in the facts sheet. It is sufficient to note that the material justifies the reasonable suspicion that there has been a knowing dealing with the proceeds of crime by all three Defendants and by the supply of a large commercial quantity of methamphetamine found in a motor vehicle being driven by the third defendant. I note that each of the Defendants has been charged with the offences to which I have made reference.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10a.html) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the authorised officer's suspicion. As I have indicated, there are such reasonable grounds.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to a defendant before an order is made, if the Court thinks fit. In the light of the evidence contained in Ms Bourne's affidavit concerning the speed with which persons are able to alienate property in their possession, and noting the nature of the offences charged, I do not consider that the Defendants should be given notice of this application before the order is made. The Defendants in any event have the rights of review set out in [section 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10c.html) of the Act.
I note the usual undertaking is given by the solicitor for the plaintiff. I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 7, 9 to 11 and 13 and 14 of the form of order provided to me. I grant the leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 8 and 12. The balance of the summons is stood over before the Common Law Registrar on 27 February 2017.
