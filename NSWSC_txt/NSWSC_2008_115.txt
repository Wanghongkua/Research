JUDGMENT:  
THE SUPREME COURT Ex tempore - revised 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
ADAMS J  
WEDNESDAY 13 FEBRUARY 2008  /07 - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NEW SOUTH WALES) versus AB & ANOR  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: On 18 September 2004 the first defendant was issued with a court attendance notice alleging the commission of a sexual offence without consent on 17 September 2004 upon a female complainant who was then aged 14 years, the age of the complainant being a circumstance of aggravation. Both children were at that time pupils at a secondary school in Sydney and the alleged act of sexual intercourse was said to have occurred between them whilst at school.
This charge is referred to as the sequence 1 charge.
 On 21 October 2004 the first defendant was issued with a further court attendance notice for an offence arising out of the same circumstance but this time alleging a different circumstance of aggravation. The circumstance of aggravation alleged in this charge was more serious than that in the sequence charge since it was particularised as the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm. This charge is referred to as the sequence 2 charge.
 The sequence 1 charge did not allege a "serious children's indictable offence" as that term is defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s3.html) of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/). The first defendant being 16 years of age at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, was a child within the meaning of that Act. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/s31.html) of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1987261/) has the effect that the first defendant having been charged in the Children's Court with that offence it must have been dealt with in summary proceedings in the
Children's Court subject to the possibility that at the end of the prosecution case the first defendant might have requested that his trial take place "according to law".
 The sequence 2 charge on the other hand, because of the nature of the aggravation alleged, did constitute a "serious children's indictable offence".
Accordingly, it could only proceed in the Children's Court by way of a committal and other consequential limitations on the proceedings, for example in relation to calling the complainant for cross-examination, applied.
 On 16 November 2004 both sequence 1 and sequence 2 charges were before the
Children's Court. They were adjourned to 7 December 2004. For various reasons, which it is not necessary to mention, further adjournments were necessary. In due course, there having been agitated a question of the course of evidence in the committal proceedings, written submissions by the parties were tendered.
 On 12 April 2005, the committal proceedings commenced. At the conclusion of the cross-examination of one witness (who was called by agreement), no submissions were made by then counsel for the first defendant, and the
Children's Court Magistrate committed the defendant for trial in respect of the sequence 2 charge. The solicitor acting for the Director of Public
Prosecutions requested that the sequence 1 charge be "withdrawn". The
Magistrate allowed this to occur and noted the papers "W/D discharged". This slightly cryptic note could mean "withdrawn/dismissed and discharged" or, as
Mr Frearson SC for the Director submitted, "W/D" was shorthand for withdrawn.
Either interpretation is open. In the view I have taken it does not matter which interpretation is adopted.
 When the matter eventually came before the District Court the Crown proceeded by way of ex officio indictment in respect only of the sequence 1 charge. The learned trial judge remitted the matter to the Children's Court so that it could proceed in accordance with the procedure envisaged by the
Children's (Criminal Proceedings) Act. The Director successfully challenged that order in the Court of Criminal Appeal, which determined in effect, that the judge had no jurisdiction to remit the matter and that the District Court was required to proceed to try the indictment in the conventional way. The
High Court confirmed the correctness of this view.
 It appeared sometime later, however (I suppose as this matter was being prepared for trial), that the Children's Court had issued a certificate under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s205.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) which, by virtue of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s206.html), "prevents any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person". If the certificate was properly given, then the Director was precluded from proceeding in the District Court by way of ex officio indictment as is proposed.
 Although a number of arguments have been addressed to me by the parties relating to the effect of what was said to the Magistrate as to the preferring of the sequence 2 charge and the ensuing committal proceedings, it is not necessary for me to consider that matter. I think it fair to observe, however, that the provisions of the legislation as to sequence 1 brook no qualification. The sequence 1 charge could never be the subject of committal proceedings, consent or implied consent was immaterial, and the scheme of the
Act is mandatory, however much "rationalisation" (used by counsel for the
Director in this Court to describe what occurred) of charges might be thought to be desirable.
 I return therefore to the provisions of the [Criminal Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/).
[Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s205.html), [206](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s206.html) and [208](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s208.html) are as follows: "205 Order dismissing matter to be made 
A court may make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed if it decides to dismiss the matter.
 
A court must make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed if requested to do so by an accused person against whom a matter has been dismissed or by the prosecutor.
 
This section does not apply to a matter that is taken to be dismissed because of section 208.
 Effect of certificate that matter has been dismissed 
A certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed, if produced and without any further proofs being required, prevents any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person.
 Dismissal of matter if matter withdrawn 
If a matter is withdrawn by the prosecutor, the matter is taken to be dismissed and the accused person is taken to be discharged in relation to the offences concerned.
 
The dismissal of a matter because of its withdrawal by the prosecutor does not prevent any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person." It is clear that <case> specifies a mandatory course in the event of the withdrawal of a matter by a prosecutor. The deemed dismissal of the charge and discharge of the accused person in relation to the alleged offence occurs by virtue of the section. Further action by the Magistrate or the court is unnecessary and can add nothing to the effect of the withdrawal.
 It is true that, in some circumstances, the court will have the power to consider whether leave to withdraw should be granted unconditionally. It may be that, in some cases, it is appropriate that conditions should be imposed before withdrawal is allowed. These might cover such matters as costs, for example, but also presumably return of exhibits and deal with other incidental matters arising from the proposed withdrawal. But, once the matter is withdrawn, <case> effects both dismissal and discharge.
 The dismissal and discharge by virtue of <case> must be contrasted with that which arises from <case>. Where a court has decided to dismiss a matter then by subs (1), the court may make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that that has occurred. Sometimes it may be that matters are dismissed in circumstances that make it inconvenient to give a certificate. Amongst other things, a defendant might not be present or be represented on such an occasion. Subsection (2), however, requires the order of dismissal to be made and a certificate to be given where there is a request either by an accused person or by the Prosecutor.
 I think it certain that the words "has been dismissed" in subs (2) refer only to a dismissal following a decision in accordance with subs (1) and are not intended to comprehend what I might call the statutory dismissal provided by <case>.
 In the present case, it is not controverted that the prosecutor withdrew the sequence 1 charge. It is submitted by Mr Sutherland SC for the first defendant, however, that whatever might have been the effect of <case> the
Magistrate also dismissed the charge and that this independent action is evidenced by his note on the papers. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that this submission is the correct characterisation of what the Magistrate thought he was doing, it seems to me that the effect of <case> is to render any decision by the Magistrate supererogatory and, indeed, was outside the Court's jurisdiction. To my mind, the better interpretation of what the Magistrate did was simply to note the papers with the effect of <case> so it would be clear, if anyone needed to consider the papers, that the matter had been dismissed.
 I note it was the Registrar of the Court who issued the impugned certificate. I suspect, though there is no evidence, that he simply relied on the note of the Magistrate and had overlooked the effect of <case>. Accepting that the Registrar in an appropriate case can give a certificate (although this might be doubted), it is obviously desirable that, where magistrates do note a dismissal and discharge pursuant to a withdrawal, the papers specifically refer to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s208.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/) so that any officer of the court who finds it necessary to consult the papers will understand immediately what the actual position was.
 To return, however, to this case I am satisfied that the certificate was given without jurisdiction and is accordingly void and without effect. I make no order as to costs.
