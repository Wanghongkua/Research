THE NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION versus ROBERT WONG /96 June 1998 
Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
HIS HONOUR: By Notice of Motion filed on the 4th of June 1997 the Defendant seeks provision for the payment of his reasonable legal expenses out of the sum of $55,000 which is presently subject to a restraining order obtained by the Plaintiff pursuant to [section 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act, 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) ["the Act"]. The Defendant's Notice of Motion was opposed by the Plaintiff. 
It is convenient to commence this Judgment by setting out the relevant provisions of the Act. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html), [subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s5.html) provides as follows:- "A restraining order may, at the time it is made or at a later time, make provision for meting out of the property, or a specified part of the property, to which the order applies to all or any of the following: 
Subject to section A, the reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order, being expenses incurred in connection with the application for the restraining order or an application for a confiscation order, or incurred in defending a criminal charge." [Section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html) provides as follows:- "(1) The following restrictions apply to a restraining order making provision for the payment of any legal expenses of a person: no provision is to be made except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme
Court is satisfied that the person cannot meet the expenses concerned out of the person's unrestrained property, no provision is to be made in relation to any particular interest in property if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the interest is illegally acquired property, no provision is to be made unless a Statement of Affairs disclosing all the person's interests in property and liabilities and verified on oath by the person has been filed with the Supreme Court, no provision is to be made unless the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person has taken all reasonable steps to bring all of the person's interests in property within the jurisdiction of the Court, any such provision must specify the particular interest in property out of which the expenses concerned may be met." 
In Schedule B to the Defendant's Notice of Motion the Defendant initially claimed a total of seven identified items. During the course of the hearing this claim was amended by limiting the claim for reasonable provision to the items identified as 6 and 7, a total of $8,854 as calculated therein. The
Defendant indicated that the items 1 to 5 would become costs in the cause in connection with the present application. Items 6 and 7 are referable to a claim under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html) of the Act for an exclusion order and, accordingly, come within the terms of [section (5)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) 
The background to this matter can be stated shortly. On the 27th of March 1996 the Defendant went to an address at 157 Canley Vale Road, Canley Vale as the passenger in a motor car. He was observed to get out of the motor car and walk to the front door of that address. According to the Statement of Evan Bouris, a Detective Senior Constable of Police, the Defendant went into the premises.
After about ten minutes the officer says he saw the Defendant walk out of the premises carrying a white bag similar to a plastic shopping bag and enter the vehicle which then drove off. The vehicle was subsequently stopped and the sum of $55,000 was found in the vehicle. The occupant of 157 Canley Vale Road at the material time was subsequently convicted of drug offences. It is the
Plaintiff's case that the $55,000 were the proceeds of dealing in drugs and in those circumstances the Plaintiff obtained the restraining order in relation to that money ex parte. It is the validity of that case which the Defendant seeks to challenge in the proceedings for an exclusion order.

It was conceded before me on behalf of the Defendant that the restraining order was served on the Defendant on the 18th of November 1996.

The Defendant was cross-examined before me and various documents were put into evidence in the course of his cross-examination including exhibit 2, his criminal record; exhibit 4, an Application to the Commonwealth Bank for a loan, dated the 9th of January 1996 and exhibit 7, the transcript of the
Defendant's examination in the proceedings before the Registrar.

It will be convenient to set out the various grounds upon which the Plaintiff opposed this Summons and relate them to the evidence.

The Plaintiff contended that I should be satisfied that the $55,000 was illegally acquired and therefore would be unable to make any provision for legal expenses by reason of [section
A(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html) of the.

In his evidence before me the Defendant said that he already had the $55,000 in his possession before visiting the address at 157 Canley Vale on the 27th of March 1996. He had accumulated it from gambling. He denied having been given a bag or money by any person in the house at Canley Vale and he said he was not carrying anything when he went to the door nor when he left. When the car he was in was stopped and the money discovered he said before me the money was not in a bag it was in a box. He was referred to passages in the transcript of his examination before the Registrar, exhibit 7 at pages 39 and in which he appears to be referring to a white bag or bag. As I have already said, the Statement of Mr Bouris is to the effect that when the
Defendant left the premises at Canley Vale he was carrying a white bag similar to a plastic shopping bag. There was no other evidence before me as to what precisely was found in the car in which the Defendant was travelling at the time he was stopped. The Plaintiff points to other discrepancies in the
Defendant's evidence, particularly with relation to much of the contents of exhibit 4 which were acknowledged to be untrue. Before me he said he did not know what his friend had put in the form which he the Defendant signed whereas before the Registrar upon his examination he appeared to acknowledge that he was aware of their falsity. In my judgment the Defendant's evidence was unreliable in various respects but I am not able to conclude that the only reason for him telling lies was a consciousness of guilt in relation to the source of the $55,000. Further, it appears to me that I am being asked to pre- judge the issue which the Defendant wishes to argue under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s25.html)
While it may be that in some cases the evidence may be so overwhelming as to preclude any reasonable possibility of such an application succeeding, this case, in my judgment, is not one of them and I find myself unable to say on the evidence before me that I am satisfied that the $55,000 was illegally acquired.

The Plaintiff contended that the Defendant had not disclosed all his interests in property as required under [section
A(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html) of the Act. This arose because in evidence, the Defendant said that he had sent approximately $10,000 to his girlfriend in America between September 1995 and May 1996. He said he sent it to her because she was sick. He further said that he had won a bit at gambling and was therefore in a position to send it.
When asked whether he expected it to be repaid he said that if she repaid it she did but if she didn't, there it was. The Plaintiff contends that this sum of money should have been disclosed as an asset in his Statement of Affairs which was annexed to his Affidavit, exhibit 5. There is no reference to that money or its status in exhibit 5. In my judgment it was not regarded as a loan on terms or repayable at any particular time by the Defendant. I do not think he gave any thought to the question of repayment when he sent that money to his girlfriend and, accordingly, I do not regard the absence of any reference to that money in exhibit 5 as constituting a failure to comply with the requirements of the subsection.

The Plaintiff contended that there was no need to make any reasonable provision under [section (5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) because the solicitors had agreed to "spec the matter" by which I understand the Plaintiff to mean that the solicitors had agreed to fund all necessary proceedings in the hope that the Defendant would recover the $55,000 and they would be repaid out of that sum. In support of this, the Plaintiff relied upon exhibit 8 which is a letter dated the 13th of March 1997 from the Defendant's solicitors to the Defendant. It reads as follows:- "Dear Sir, 
Re: Your Criminal Matter 
We refer to the above matter and enclose a copy of our Memorandum of Costs and
Disbursements in relation to your criminal matter.

As advised we are willing to wait for that money until finalization of your asset matter.

We further note that all work in relation to the civil matter shall be deducted from the confiscated money. We are not able to say at this stage how much money you will have left.

We will charge the scale rates applicable to these types of matters." 
There was reference in evidence to some proceedings before the Magistrate's
Court in relation to the $55,000 to which, on my understanding, the first two paragraphs of the above letter refer. As to the balance of that letter, the wording of those paragraphs do not, in my judgment, support the Plaintiff's contention, nor does it preclude the present application.

The Plaintiff submitted that in the exercise of my discretion I should not make the order under [section (5)(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html)
The principal foundation for this argument is that the Defendant since the service of the restraining order has in the course of his gambling activities been in possession of substantial sums of money sufficient to fund the proceedings proposed in relation to seeking an exclusion order. The Plaintiff further relied upon the inconsistencies in the Defendant's evidence and contended that I should have a suspicion of the source of the money being a criminal source so as to cause me to decline to exercise my discretion in the
Defendant's favour.

It was clearly established on the evidence in my judgment that the Defendant has been gambling large amounts of money over a number of years, although the degree to which he has been able to indulge his passion for gambling in recent months is doubtful because of his lack of funds. He conceded in evidence that since being served with the restraining order he had been in possession of sums in excess of $10,000 and had gambled such sums and lost. It was said on the part of the Plaintiff that the courts will not help those who fail to help themselves. In my judgment the fact that he was an enthusiastic but overall unsuccessful gambler does not disentitle him to discretionary relief from a court. Again, in connection with the exercise of my discretion, the Plaintiff argued that although the Defendant had filed no tax returns since his arrival in this country in 1992 and yet had been able to fund his gambling lifestyle which included being treated as a high roller by casinos in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney and the evidence showed minimal funds being obtained by way of loans, I should therefore conclude that the source of his money was drug- related or other criminal activity. In the absence of evidence to that effect,
I am unable to draw that conclusion and do not do so.

What is clear from all the above is that should an order be made for provision of the Defendant's reasonable legal expenses, it should be framed in such a way as to ensure that those moneys do not come into the hands of the
Defendant.

I was referred to New South Wales Crime Commission -v- Younan and Anor.
[(1993) 31 NSWLR 44] at p.50, where the following passage occurs in the judgment of the Court:- "The only reason given is that the respondents 'are unable to meet' their legal expenses without resort to the funds. That reason, with respect, is not in itself for exercising the discretion in favour of the respondents. In a sense, the need for legal expenses to defend [the] criminal charges is necessarily involved in the presupposition upon which [s.10(5)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) is based. It still remains to determine whether, in the particular case the discretion should be exercised pursuant to the statute in favour of the application. Relevant to that exercise will obviously be the apparent strength of the prosecution case against the alleged offender; the size of the fund of property involved; the probable amount of the legal expenses; and the effect of any exemption upon the achievement of the purposes of the Act which is to restrain the disposal of property to abide orders under the Act following the completion of proceedings." 
The following points have to be made in relation to that passage. [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html) was inserted into the Act in 1997. Secondly, this application by the Defendant does not relate to criminal proceedings, but rather to the very nature of the money subject to the restraining order. That said, it is of course necessary to bear the other matters mentioned in the above passage very much in mind. I have already dealt with the apparent strength of the Plaintiff's case. The amount of money involved here is $55,000. The application is as to $8,854 or, possibly, if two days are involved, $15,131. I bear in mind that should the
Defendant's application be unsuccessful, the amount available for the achievement of the purposes of the Act will be reduced to some $40,000 which is still a substantial sum in my judgment.

Turning to the quantified amount of costs set out as items 6 and 7, I am satisfied they are appropriately calculated in accordance with Studdert J's judgment in State Drug Crime Commission -v- Leon Stanley Heel and Rhonda Jean
Fleming (unreported, 21st December 1992) as increased in accordance with CPI statistics. I am further satisfied that it is appropriate should he so wish for the Defendant to employ the services of senior counsel, particularly in view of the fact that Mr Temby QC who appears on behalf of the Plaintiffs, told me he was on a retainer to the Plaintiffs in matters such as these. I do not think the Defendant should be put at any disadvantage in pursuing his claim against the Plaintiff.

Dealing with the balance of the matter in [section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html)
I am satisfied that the Defendant cannot meet the expenses concerned out of his unrestrained property, [s.16A(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html); and I am satisfied that the Defendant has taken all reasonable steps to bring all of his interests in property within the jurisdiction of the Court, [s.16A(1)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s16a.html)
There was no evidence or argument to the contrary on either of the above issues.

Accordingly, I am satisfied that it is appropriate in this case to exercise my discretion in favour of the Defendant and to make an order providing for the reasonable legal expenses of the Defendant. Such order should provide for the payment out of the sum restrained of $15,130.00 or the taxed costs whichever be the lesser sum of the Defendant's proposed application for an exclusion order. Such payment is to be made to the Defendant's solicitors and no part of the sum is to be paid to the Defendant.

If counsel for the parties cannot agree upon the appropriate form of order the matter will be re-listed for further argument before me.

I will hear argument as to costs.
