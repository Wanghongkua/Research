JUDGE1
FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND ISSUES REQUIRING RESOLUTION
SANTOW J This is a contest between two rival groups, being collectively the
Second Defendants and the Third Defendants, for control of an incorporated association called The Rangers Club of N.S.W. Inc., being the First Defendant.
I will refer to the First Defendant as "the Club". It is incorporated under the [Associations Incorporation Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/)").
The matter originally came to this Court by a Summons of 18 May 1995 seeking interpleader relief, whereby the Plaintiff,
St George Bank Limited ("the Bank") as the holder of various investment accounts on behalf of the
Club, sought an order that it pay into Court the proceeds of those accounts.
That relief was granted by consent and the necessary orders made. The fund was paid into
Court after deduction of the Plaintiffs costs in an agreed amount.
It is common ground as between the Second and Third Defendants that the
Plaintiff is not to pay these costs. Accordingly, as a consequential matter, I have also to determine how these costs are to be apportioned as between the
Second and Third Defendants. This is based upon the usual rule that this will depend on the outcome of the primary contest between those two Defendants, with the unsuccessful defendant ordinarily expected to pay such costs.
 .
In relation to that primary contest, the Second Defendants have subsequently filed a Statement of Contentions and the Third Defendants a
Statement of Issues. These are intended to outline the matters in dispute and the relief claimed by each. Apart from cost orders, that relief is solely by way of declaration; no injunctive relief is sought. The First Defendant, the
Club, makes no appearance as it is currently paralysed by the dispute. It awaits judicial determination as to which party is now in control of the Club.
 .
The following can be taken to be agreed facts as between the Second and
Third Defendants (though I have reformulated the agreed fact number 20 so as more accurately to reflect the status of the Model Rules).
As at 16 September 1994 the persons named in paragraph 2 of the affidavit of D. Auld sworn 29 August 1995 held the positions stated in the affidavit, namely: 
Mark Young...........President;
Trevor Goes..........Vice-President and Entertainment Secretary;
Estelle Barboza......Honorary Secretary;
David Auld...........Honorary
Treasurer;
Basil Cardis, Noel French and
Peter Van Ross.......Advisers;
Terry Rodrigues......Public Officer;
Gail
Meriden....... committee member;
L Dawn Van Ross......committee member;
Rudi Martin     committee member;
Peter
Barboza........committee member;
A Sigmund........... committee member;
Mark Cotter..........committee member (resigned from committee prior to 16 September 1994).
On 16 September 1994 the Club held its Annual General Meeting so as, inter alia, to elect new members of the Executive Committee of the Club. The term "new members" included persons already on the committee who were standing for re-election for either their existing or other positions on the Club's executive.
At the meeting held on 16 September 1994 the then President of the Club chaired the meeting from between 7.45 pm until approximately 10.50 pm, whereupon the President purportedly declared all offices vacant. At this point, Mr Trevor Correy (an ordinary member) took the chair as returning officer to oversee the election of the next executive committee.
However, before nominations for positions on the executive could be voted upon, the members of the Club had to vacate the premises, it being 11 pm or thereabouts. The then chairperson, Mr Correy, advised the members that, inter alia, the meeting had to be adjourned and re-convened after the requisite notice period and further that the "old committee" which had been vacated pending the elections, was back until that time.
Subsequent to the adjournment of the meeting, the Secretary of the Club,
Estelle Barboza, organised for the public officer of the Club, a Mr
T
Rodrigues, to obtain an extension of time for the holding of an Annual General
Meeting from the Department of Consumer Affairs.
The Secretary organised a new date for the holding of the part-heard Annual
General Meeting. There was no meeting of the Executive
Committee in order to consider the date for the resumption of the Annual General Meeting.
On or about 22 and 23 September 1994 the Secretary forwarded letters to all the members of the Club informing such members of the date of the resumed
Annual General Meeting, to be held on 28 October 1994 at 7.30 pm at the
Wentworthville Community Centre.
On 27 October 1994 the Secretary of the Club received a letter from the
President of the Club, such letter purporting to cancel the Annual General
Meeting on 28 October 1994.
The then President (Young), Treasurer (Auld), and three advisers (Cardis,
French and Van Ross) did not attend the meeting on October 1994.
Forty-nine members, including executive committee members, attended the meeting on 16 September 1994. Forty members attended the meeting on 28 October .
At the meeting on 28 October 1994 the following persons were purportedly elected by those present at the meeting into executive positions: 
President      R Rodrigues
Vice-President    A Cotter
Treasurer      Mr P Barboza
Social Secretary   T Goes
Secretary      Estelle Barboza
Public Officer
K Fernandez
On 28 November 1995 Mr Rodrigues purportedly resigned as President of the
Club, and was purportedly replaced by Mr Cotter, with Mr J Etto being purportedly elected the Vice-President.
Prior to the dispute, the Club maintained five bank accounts. Four of these accounts were held with the St. George Bank. These accounts were not operating accounts. A fifth account was held with the Westpac Bank which is the operating account of the Club. This account is currently operated by the
Second Defendants.
The Third Defendants have paid membership renewal fees into the said
Westpac Bank account, as stated in paragraphs 6 to 10 of the affidavit of
David Auld sworn 29 August 1995, on behalf of the persons referred to therein.
Up to and including 31 January , Rudi Martin received monies purportedly for renewals of the memberships of seventy-seven persons plus "family memberships" for the children of Mr and Mrs Chater.
Those monies were paid into State Bank of New South Wales Account No. 166 -00 in the name of "The Secretary, The Rangers Club of NSW Inc.".
The said account was conducted by Estelle Barboza purportedly on behalf of the First Defendant.
There is no dispute as to what was the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) up to and including 27 October 1994 (though there is a dispute as to validity of purported constitutional amendments claimed to have been made on 28 October ).
There is a dispute that notices of the resumed meeting did not give notice of intention to amend the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), nor did the notice convening the original annual general meeting.
The Model Rules were capable of application as at September and subsequently, but subject always to [s 19(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s19.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/).
The persons referred to in prayer 5 of the relief claimed by the Second
Defendants (the "current" committee according to its claim) are all persons who paid monies to Rudi Martin on or before 31 January 1995 purportedly by way of membership renewal subscriptions and those monies were banked into State
Bank of New South Wales Account No. 166 112 394-00 in the name of "The Rangers
Club of New
South Wales Inc." on or before 31 January 1995.
From the Statements of the Second and Third Defendants and against the background of these agreed facts, I have formulated the following principal issues in dispute in the form of questions requiring resolution.
I also set out a broad summation of the Second and Third Defendants' competing contentions in that context. These issues, by virtue of SCR [Pt 56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/index.html#p56) r 9(b)(v) and (vii), are determinable summarily. 
Question 1 - Validity of Meeting
Was the Annual General Meeting of the Club, which was adjourned on 16
September 1995 sine die, properly re-convened by the Chill Secretary to 28
October 1994, or was such meeting otherwise deemed to have been validly held on that day, notwithstanding that the Club Secretary of the Club purported so to reconvene it without recourse to the then Executive Committee of the Club? (The Club Secretary at the time was Ms Barboza, one of the Second
Defendants.)
The Second Defendants contend that the meeting was validly adjourned and re-convened by the Secretary, under the
Rules of the Club whilst the Third
Defendants dispute this. The Second Defendants contend this is either because the Secretary has this power without reference to the Executive Committee, there being no prohibition or restriction on the Secretary organising either a
re-convened annual general meeting or any other meeting of the Club, or in the alternative, there was a ratification or acquiescence by the members of the
Club, or some form of estoppel, which would cure any invalidity.
By "the Rules of the Club" or "the Rules",
I refer primarily to the rules contained in the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of April 1986 as subsequently amended ("the constitution") and also, but only to the extent made applicable by [s19(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s19.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/), the Model Rules for the Incorporation of Associations, passed under the Regulations made pursuant to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) ("the Model Rules"). I deal later with the precise effect of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) in this context.
The Third Defendants contend that the adjourned Annual General Meeting could only be re-convened by the Executive
Committee of the Club, this being mandated by Model [Rule 24(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s24.html) Hence they contend that the Secretary, in purporting to re-convene that meeting without the Executive Committee, acted without authority, the Secretary's power being ministerial only.
In response to the Second Defendants' contention that ratification and acquiescence occurred, the Third Defendants deny this on various grounds, including lack of the unanimity required for acquiescence and the fact that not all Committee members were present at the 28 October 1994 meeting and none of the Third Defendants attended that meeting.
So far as any alleged estoppel is concerned, the Third Defendants contend that the conditions to make out estoppel were not fulfilled.
The second issue below only arises if, notwithstanding these grounds of attack, the re-convened Annual General
Meeting conducted on 28 October 1994 were valid or deemed to be so. 
Question 2 - Procedural Irregularity and Constitutional Amendments
Were the elections that took place at the re-convened Annual General Meeting
Oil 28 October 1994 invalid owing to procedural irregularity, so that the persons purportedly elected at such meeting were not validly elected and appointed to the Executive Committee? There is also a subsidiary issue, namely whether the constitutional amendments purportedly passed at that meeting were likewise invalidly passed?
The Third Defendants contend that even if the Meeting on 28 October 1994 were validly convened, the election of the following persons to the Committee was irregular in that Messrs Young and Auld were wrongly excluded for election on the ground that they were only present at the first occasion of the Annual
General Meeting and not when re-convened. The Second Defendants in response contend that, as nominees to the Committee, they had to be present at the
Annual General Meeting at which the election of the Committee members is to take place (clause 23 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)). Therefore they contend that merely to be present, as they were, only at the original Annual General Meeting which was then purportedly re-convened or adjourned, would not suffice.
This requirement of presence is set out in clause 23 of the constitution of the
Club. It provides for only one relevant exception, namely where the member concerned has submitted a written acceptance that he or she is willing to take office on the Committee. It is common ground that no such written acceptance was given by those undermentioned, who claim to have been validly elected to the positions noted against their name.

R Rodrigues      as President
A Cotter as Vice-President
P Barboza       as Treasurer
T Goes        as Social Secretary
It is further contended by the Third Defendants that the election of R
Martin, L Simon and T Rodrigues and J Etto as Committee members was irregular.
This was on the basis that there were insufficient nominations received to fill the five positions and that the persons nominated in advance of the meeting ought therefore to have been declared elected unopposed and further nominations accepted from the floor only for the purpose of an election to fill the remaining positions; see constitution clause 23 and Model Rules clause .
Finally, as regards the constitutional amendments purportedly made at the meeting of 28 October 1994, the Third Defendants contend that they were made in circumstances of procedural irregularity and thus were not validly passed.
These amendments required special resolutions, under [s20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) and thus should have been given with twenty-one days written notice under [s5(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s5.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/). It is contended that these amendments were therefore invalid because such notice was never given.
To this the Second Defendants respond by saying that the spirit and intent of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) were complied with. This is because the amendments to the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) were read to the general body at the first meeting, being the
Annual General Meeting on 16 September 1994 (see annexure B page 16 of Miss
Barboza's affidavit of 19 August 1995). Debate on these amendments was commenced but, owing to the lateness of the day, they were not voted upon. The next time these Constitutional amendments were considered was on 28 October , well over twenty-one days after the meeting on 16 September 1994.
Furthermore, at the second meeting, it is contended by the Second Defendants that as the discrepancy between the provisions of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) and the constitution as to notice of amendments was raised with the members, with the general body agreeing to consider and vote upon these amendments, then it follows that the form of notice should be held to be sufficient notice to satisfy the spirit and intent of [s5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s5.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/): compare Daly versus Gallagher and Ors (1925) SRQ I at , Ho Tung versus Man On Insurance Company Limited [(1902) AC 232] at 236.
Any further related factual background is dealt with in the course of answering these principal questions. 
Question - Validity of Meeting
I have earlier referred to the two sources of the Rules of the Club, being the Club's constitution and the statutory Model Rules. I first turn to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/). [Section 19(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s19.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) defines and limits the scope for application of the Model Rules in the case of a club incorporated under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) in the following way: "(3) Where in relation to any matter the model rides make provision bill the rules of an incorporated association do not make provision, the provision of the model rides shall, in relation to that matter, be deemed to be included in the rules of the incorporated association."
The initial question to be answered is whether, applying the test in [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s19.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/), there is any scope for the application of Model [Rule 24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s24.html) as a rule of the Club. That test can be paraphrased as whether "in relation to a matter" the Model Rules "make provision", while the rules of the Club's [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) do not "make provision".
Model [Rule 24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s24.html) is in the following terms: "24.(1) The annual general meeting of the association is, subject to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) and to ride 23, to be convened on such date and at such place and time as the committee thinks fit."
Whereas, the constitution provides in clause 8 for the convening of annual general meetings, as follows: "8. The Annual General Meeting of the Club shall be held once a year, preferably as early as convenient in the month of April each year, bill not more than 15 months after the previous Annual
General Meeting, on a dale to be notified to all members at least days prior to the meeting. Each financial member of the Club present at a General Meeting shall be entitled to one vote on each matter dealt with and the
President or other person presiding shall he entitled to a casting vote. No unfinancial member of the club shall make a motion.

At Annual General Meetings the Chair shall be taken by the
President, if present, or in his absence, the Committee shall elect one of the Vice Presidents or if no Vice President be present, the Committee shall elect as Chairman one of its member before any other business is taken up.

Order of business at Annual General Meetings shall be: a) Minutes of the previous Annual General Meeting b) Annual Report of the President, Secretary and Social
Secretary c) Treasurer's Annual
Statement of Accounts d) Correspondence re. A.G.M.
e) Changes in [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) 
General Business re. A.G.M.

Items for discussion under General Business must be submitted to the Secretary no less than the latest date set by the
Committee as laid out in the By-Laws for the receipt of nominations for the positions on the Committee. g) Election of Committee members (as detailed in para. 3 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/))"
Thus in applying the test, have the Model Rules made provision in relation to a particular matter but not the constitution, it is necessary first to characterise the "matter". This is in order to ascertain whether the constitution fails to make provision in relation to that same matter, since only then is there room for the Model Rules to apply. I am satisfied that the "matter" in relation to which Model Rule 24(1) makes provision (as also certain other Model Rules), is at least that of convening annual general meetings. However, I consider on balance that "matter", amplified by the words "in relation to" goes further. It encompasses the manner of convening annual general meetings (whereby in the case of the Model Rules, date, place and time are determined by the committee, save in the circumstances of an adjournment within Model Rule 29(2)). I will proceed on the basis that "matter" comprehends both elements. I should add that though the words "in relation to" are of wide import (Victoria versus Commonwealth <case>; [(1971) 122 CLR 353] at 399 per
Windeyer J), there must nonetheless be a "real, substantial and proximate relation" between the provision and the matter (Bourke Appliances Pty Ltd v
Wonder <case>; [(1965) VR 511] at 518).
I start therefore with the cluster of Model Rules which are potentially capable of making provision in relation to the convening of annual general meetings, including the manner of their convening. I test each Model Rule to see if it does so in fact. I do so, by ascertaining whether there is a "real, substantial and proximate relation" between the Model Rules and the matter as
I have earlier characterised it. I then turn to the nearest equivalent rule in the Club's constitution (clause 8 read with clause (b)). This is to ascertain whether it does or does not also make provision in relation to that matter, applying the same test.
Model Rule 24(2) states what business may be transacted at an annual general meeting in the following terms (concluding in
Model Rule 24(3) with a requirement that the annual general meeting must be specified as such in the notice convening it).
 "(2)
In addition to any other business which may be transacted at an annual general meeting, the business of an annual general meeting is to include the following: to confirm the minutes of the last preceding annual general meeting and of any special general meeting held since that meeting; to receive from the committee reports on the activities of the association during the last preceding financial year; to elect office-bearers of the association and ordinary members of the committee; to receive and consider the statements which is required to be submitted to members under [section 26(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s26.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/).
An annual general meeting must be specified as such in the notice convening it."
Since the convening of a meeting ordinarily embraces notice of its subject matter, had Model [rule 24(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s24.html) simply provided for the content of that notice, it might be said to be making provision "in relation to" the convening of the annual general meeting. However, Model [Rule 24(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s24.html) rather prescribes the subjects that are to be included at the annual general meeting. This prescription applies irrespective of any notice convening the meeting, whatever be the consequential practical effect on the content of the notice. I therefore consider, on balance, that Model [Rule 24(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s24.html) does not make provision in relation to the relevant matter, though if I were wrong, nothing hangs on that in the present context.
Model [Rule 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s23.html) requires that for each annual general meeting after the first, the Association must convene that subsequent annual general meeting within a period of six months after the expiration of the relevant financial year. I am satisfied that it does make provision in relation to the relevant matter.
Model [Rule 26(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s26.html) requires that except in the case of a special resolution, the Secretary must give at least fourteen days' notice of the place, date and time of the relevant meeting and the nature of the business proposed to be transacted at the meeting. Again I am satisfied that it does make provision in relation to the relevant matter.
Model [Rule 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s29.html) deals with the adjournment of any general meeting, therefore including but not limited to annual general meetings. It deals with the matter of convening adjourned meetings, to the extent that it lays down requirements for when notice is required and requires the secretary to give notice if the adjournment is for "fourteen days or more" (Model [Rule 29(2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s29.html) I quote Model [Rule 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s29.html) below: "29. (1) The chairperson of a general meeting at which a quorum is present may, with the consent of the majority of members present at the meeting, adjourn the meeting from time to time and place to place, but no business is lo be transacted at an adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting at which the adjournment took place.
 
If a general meeting is adjourned for 14 days or more, the secretary must give written or oral notice of the adjourned meeting to each member of the association stating the place, date and time of the meeting and the nature of the business to be transacted at the meeting.

Except as provided in clauses (1) and (2), notice of an adjournment of a general meeting or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting is not required to be given."
Comparing clause 8 of the constitution to the earlier quoted Model Rules and leaving aside any implication from clause 3(b), it is clear clause 8 also makes provision in relation at least to the convening of annual general meetings, such provision covering similar subject matter to the earlier quoted
Model Rules as to timing and frequency of such meeting. This is borne out not only by their common subject matter, but by there also being significant inconsistencies between the Model Rules and clause 8 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). This could be expected given that they deal with substantially the same subject matter.
Thus, on inconsistencies, firstly clause 8 of the constitution requires that the annual general meeting be held "preferably as early as convenient in the month of
April each year, but not more than fifteen months after the previous Annual General Meeting" - whereas Model [Rule 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s23.html) effectively gives a further three months. Secondly, clause 8 of the constitution provides for at least thirty days notice of an annual general meeting, whereas Model [Rule (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s26.html) provides for fourteen days' notice.
Finally, whilst clause 8 of the constitution lays down no express requirement as to who shall determine the date, time and place of the annual general meeting, it is clear enough from clause 3(b) of the constitution that the secretary would have power to do so and indeed would be the natural person to do so. Under clause 3(b) of the constitution it is provided that "under his (the President's) direction", "the Secretary will be the Chief Executive
Officer and carry out all the instructions given to him or her by the
Committee". Thus the Secretary as the Chief Executive Officer would clearly have authority to convene such a meeting as well as authority to determine in the Secretary's discretion its date, place and time. This is unless that discretion had earlier been curtailed either by a direction from the President or by instructions from the Committee. But there is no requirement under the constitution for the secretary first to seek either a direction from the
President or an instruction from the committee, nor to await the initiative of either President or committee, before the secretary may elect to convene a meeting.
Nor, given the senior executive status of the secretary, would this be implied.
Given this express provision in clause 3(b) and the executive authority connoted by the title "Chief Executive Officer", I do not need to resort for support to the ostensible or implied authority of a modern secretary of a corporation, at general law. Nonetheless that support can be found in the trend of modern authority. It clearly supports a secretary having more than mere ministerial authority. Relevantly, though subject in the present case to direction and instruction from first President and then Committee, a modern company secretary has general authority on ordinary matters relating to the company's affairs (Donato versus Legion Cabs (Trading) Co-operative Society Ltd WN (Pt.
) 242 AT 248) and is no mere clerk or factotum (Panorama Developments (Guildford) Limited versus Fidelis Furnishing Fabrics
Limited [(1971) 2 QB 711] Development of the Power of the Modern
Company Secretary lo Bind his Company). Such matters would therefore certainly encompass the arranging of the annual general meeting including time, place and venue; NE Renton: Guide for Meetings and Organisations, Vol. 1
Law Book
Company 1994 at 221. Thus on a modern company board, it is ordinarily the secretary who so attends to such corporate statutory obligations as arranging annual general meetings setting date, place and time, without necessity for any board direction or direction from the chief executive officer. The position must be a fortiori where the Secretary is also the Chief Executive
Officer.
 .
I am therefore satisfied that clause 8, read with clause 3(b), does make provision "in relation to" the convening of annual general meetings by the secretary and comprehends the power on the secretary's part to determine date, time and place in the absence of countermanding direction or instruction.
These provisions of the constitution therefore leave no gap for the Model
Rules to fill in relation to that matter. The regime of the Club's constitution "covers the field" in relation to that matter; just as, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), Commonwealth legislation covering the field prevails over inconsistent State legislation (Ex parte McLean <case>; [(1930) 43 CLR 472] at ). The earlier examples of difference between the two codes illustrate how the Club's constitution in relation to the matter constitutes a regime which is quite distinct from the regime of the Model Rules applicable to that matter, each covering that field in a different manner. By analogy with [s109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), the fact that the Model Rules and the constitution could both be complied with by obeying the more stringent regime in the Model
Rules does not alter the fact that the Club's constitution makes separate, inconsistent and distinct provision in relation to the same matter" compare
Clyde Engineering Pty Limited versus Cowburn <case>; [(1926) 37 CLR 466] at 472.
Given this conclusion, it follows that the Annual General Meeting of the
Club was properly re-convened by the Club
Secretary to 28 October 1994. I therefore do not need to deal with any alternative basis for that conclusion contended for by the
Second Defendants, based on ratification or acquiescence by members of the Club, or else some form of estoppel, as curing any invalidity.
I should however consider whether there is any independent or exclusive source of power in the secretary to re-convene a meeting adjourned sine die under the earlier quoted Model Rule 29.
I conclude first that an adjournment sine die can be made under
Model
Rule 29 (1) and indeed that the conditions for so doing were fulfilled. I accept the Second Defendants' submission that such an adjournment, which must be "from time to time" allows within those words not only an adjournment for a specified time (or indeed allows repeated such adjournments) but also allows an adjournment "at any time" or, in other words, sine die; see Carter versus Carter [(1959) SR 163] at 171 per Kirby P. I further conclude that an adjournment sine die, as was made here, which de facto turns out to be for more than fourteen days, should be taken to be "adjourned for 14 days or more" within the meaning of Model Rule 29(2). I take that quoted expression to comprehend either an actual adjournment for a stipulated time of fourteen days or more, or an adjournment sine die for a time which de facto turns out to be fourteen days or more. (I do not need to consider the third case of an adjournment sine die which de facto turns out to be for less than fourteen days.)
Model Rule 29(2) then requires the secretary to give the notice with place, date and time. There is no implication that I can discern that requires the secretary first to get the committee's authority to do so or the
President's.
The conclusions I have earlier reached concerning sine die adjournments are compatible with the language of Model Rule 29(2). They also comport with the logic of that Model Rule and avoid absurdity. Thus if an adjourned meeting sine die were not included within Model Rule 29(2), the effect of Model Rule (3) would be to deny notice altogether of its date, time and place and this for the very situation which clearly requires it.
 "Where an adjournment is to an indefinite dale, notice of the adjourned meeting naturally becomes necessary" Joskes Law and
Procedure at Meetings in Australia, Eighth Edition,
Eilis S
Magner, The Law Book Company Limited 1994 at 60.
The Third Defendants argue this would still leave room for Model
Rule (1) to fill the breach and deal with that situation. But this creates the absurd result that adjournment (and consequential re-convening) is to be taken to be dealt with, not exclusively under Model Rule 29, its logical place, but for the one case only, an adjournment sine die, instead only under Model Rule (1). I do not consider that that interpretation comports with a logical structure of Model Rules and do not accept it.
Otherwise, and consistently with Model Rule 29(3), the principle is that an adjourned meeting, being for the purpose of completing unfinished business of the previous meeting, is deemed a continuation of that meeting, and, unless the rules prescribe otherwise, no new notice is required for it, Scadding v
Lorant <case>; [(1851) 3 HLC 418]
Thus where the adjournment is for a specified 14 days or more, such a notice serves the purpose of being a reminder of the already fixed date, time and place, for a meeting earlier convened and adjourned. In the case of a sine die adjournment, the notice is necessary for a more basic reason - to actually advise when (and where) the meeting is to take place. One would expect that no intervention of the committee or President should be required. One would rather expect that the secretary should have the discretion to attend to the relatively ministerial function of determining and notifying date, place and time for what is after all only a re-convened meeting. This is in contrast to the original meeting, where Model Rule 24 vests the more important task of its convening in the Committee (assuming Model Rule 24 is not displaced by a Rule from the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)). All of this supports the construction of Model [Rule 29](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s29.html) which I prefer.
Finally, though this point was not taken by the Second Defendant, it is the case that no injunctive proceedings by way of restraint were taken by the
Third Defendants but rather proceedings for a declaration. This has the result that [ss18(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s18.html) and (4) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) may apply to preserve the relevant act of convening the meeting from invalidity, were it otherwise invalid. This is because there is no excepted proceedings by way of restraint brought by the
Third Defendants within [s18(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s18.html), and in particular within sub-paragraph(d).
Similar provision is made for conventionally incorporated companies under the
Corporations
Law, s162(7)(f). This would then raise the question whether leave could and should now be given to supplement the declaratory relief sought, with injunctive relief aimed at preventing the relevant appointees acting in that capacity. It is of course clearly too late to restrain the re-convened meeting. However, it is not necessary that I consider this issue. This because
I have earlier concluded that the relevant act of the secretary in re-convening the Annual General Meeting was within authority. I so conclude because Model [Rule 24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s24.html) cannot apply when [Rule 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s8.html), read with [Rule 3(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s3.html), already makes provision in relation to the relevant matter and because Model [Rule 29(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s29.html) would in any event so authorise the secretary. 
Question 2 - Procedural Irregularity and Constitutional Amendments.
Clause of the Club's constitution provides as follows:
Nominations for Office Bearers at an A.G.M. - Nominations for all positions, each signed by two financial members and the nominee, shall be made in writing and placed in the hands of the
Secretary no less than two weeks before the A.G.M. at which the election of the Committee members is to lake place, slating the position nominated for. All nominees are to be prevent at the A.G.M. In the case of a member who has been duly nominated suddenly finds he or she is unable to attend and the reason is acceptable to the General Body, the member must submit a written acceptance that he or she is willing to take office on the
Committee 
The Committee will examine the nominations and will report to the President that the nominations are in order and the nominees are financial. If sufficient written nominations are not received in advance by the Secretary to fill all the positions on the Committee nominations may be accepted from the floor of the house."
It is thus clear that "All nominees are to be present at the A.G.M.". I am satisfied that this can only mean present, until at least the time of the relevant election. It certainly could not have been intended that a mere fleeting appearance would suffice nor an appearance which ceases before the very matter for which their presence is material, namely election.
I agree with the Second Defendants that this interpretation is supported by the evident purpose of the requirement of presence. This is as a gesture of commitment on the part of the nominee or at least to affirm continued willingness to stand, as well as to be available to answer questions. Such an interpretation is further reinforced by the fact that clause 23 actually provides a mechanism for the candidate not present to submit a reason for non-attendance which, if acceptable to the general body and accompanied by a written acceptance of willingness to take office, then excuses attendance.
That did not occur here.
Thus the absence of Messrs Young and Auld from the re-convened meeting, without so complying with the requirements to be excused, when they had nominated for a number of positions including that of President and Treasurer, meant that they were ineligible to be appointed. They were in fact not elected to fill these positions. (Another person, R Francisco, was also not present and accordingly also passed over for consideration by the general body.) I am therefore satisfied that this exclusion of these three from election was not an irregularity but that they were properly withdrawn from the election of office bearers that took place on 28 October 1994. It follows that each of the undermentioned were validly elected, since the Third Defendants' attack on their election is based on this supposed irregularity and thus must fail.
They are elected pursuant to clause 23 and Model Rules 15(1) and 15(2).

R Rodrigues      as President
A Cotter   as Vice-President
P Barboza       as Treasurer
T Goes        as Social Secretary
It is then contended by the Third Defendants that the election of R
Martin, L Simon, T Rodrigues and J Etto as committee members was irregular, in that there being insufficient nominations to fill the five positions, the persons nominated in advance of the meeting ought to have been declared elected unopposed and further nominations accepted from the floor only for the purpose of an election to fill the remaining positions; clause 23 of the constitution and Model Rules 15.
To this the Second Defendants reply that the election of the four
Committee Members complied with clause 23 of the constitution and Model Rule (2). As presently advised, I am unable to conclude that that submission would be incorrect. I am not aware on the evidence before me whether there were any other persons who were both nominated for the Committee in advance of the meeting, and who complied with the requirement of being present till the election, such that they should be appointed unopposed. They certainly could not include Messrs Young and Auld or, I take it,
Mr Francisco since none of these were present till the election. If necessary, Counsel may apply to make further brief submissions on that matter only. 
The Constitutional Amendments
Amendments to the constitution all require special resolutions under [s20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/). That in turn requires twenty-one days written notice under [s5(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s5.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/). It is common ground that whilst the amendments to the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) "were read" to the general meeting at its first convening on 16
September 1994, they were not voted on. Rather they were simply put again (but again with no written notice) to the then members present on 28 October 1994.
I agree with the Third Defendant's submission that "circulation of the proposed amendments at the meeting is not twenty-one day's notice, nor is it notice to all members, nor is it notice that the amendments would be proposed as special resolutions. It is informal notice only to those attending". I elaborate below on the reasoning for this conclusion.
[Section 20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) provides as follows: "20. (1) An incorporated association may, by special resolution, alter its statements of objects or its rules.

The public officer of an incorporated association shall, within 1 month after the passing of a special resolution altering the statement of objects or the rules of an incorporated association, lodge with the Commissioner notice in the prescribed form, verified as prescribed and accompanied by the prescribed fee, setting out particulars of the alteration.

Maximum penalty: 1 penalty unit.

Any such alteration has effect when the notice is lodged with the Commissioner and the requirements of subsection (2) are complied with in respect of the alteration.

An alteration of the rules of an incorporated association is of no effect unless those rules, as so altered, comply with [section 11."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s11.html) [Sections 5(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s5.html) and (b) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) provide as follows: "5. (1) For the purposes of this [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/), a resolution of an association is a special resolution if: it is passed by a majority which comprises not less than three-quarters of such members of the association as, being entitled under the rules of the association so to do, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of which not less than 21 days' written notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution was given in accordance with those rules; or where if is made to appear to the Commissioner that it is not possible or practicable for the resolution to be passed in the manner specified in paragraph (a) -- the resolution is passed in a manner specified by the Commissioner."
These requirements are imposed by statute and are mandatory. It is undisputed that notice in writing was never given of the relevant constitutional changes. That can only mean notice in writing specifying "the resolution" (my emphasis). Otherwise there is not identified in writing what resolution is the subject of the intention so to have it passed. Oral communication at one or both meetings to those who happen to turn up cannot be a substitute for written notice to all members, nor satisfy the statutory requirements in that regard. Indeed [s5(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s5.html) reinforces the mandatory character of [s5(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s5.html) by the limited provision for its modification, which is only with the Commissioner's approval in the circumstances there set out.
There is of course no room under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) for any kind of member ratification of irregularity proposed attempts at special resolutions. Such attempts simply fail to satisfy the limited permission to alter by special resolution an incorporated association's objects or rules, laid down in [s20(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/s20.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/).
This case is clearly distinguishable from a case where the mode of alteration to the rules of a voluntary association were contained, not in statute, but in those rules themselves and where there was a subsequent history of those amendments having been acted upon without objection; Daly v
Gallagher and Others [1925 SRQ 1.] And there was certainly not the long period of acquiescence (nineteen years) following the adoption of Articles of
Association irregularly registered because of a lack of signatures by members to the Articles and where there was no failure of notice to shareholders who duly passed the resolution; Ho Tung versus Man On Insurance Company Limited [(1902)
AC 232.] 
CONCLUSION
It follows that I am satisfied that control of the Club is effectively vested in the persons purportedly elected at the adjourned meeting into executive positions on the Committee (see paragraph 11 of the earlier agreed facts) and, subject to any matters which Counsel may wish to raise, in the remaining persons elected as committee members to the Committee on 28 October
These latter were R Martin, L Simon, T Rodrigues and J Etto. It therefore also follows that the Third Defendants should be responsible for the
Plaintiffs costs, as I do not consider the success of the Third Defendants on the subsidiary issue of the constitutional amendments affects that result. 
ORDERS
Accordingly, subject to any submissions on any matters incidentally arising, the Second
Defendants should receive the relief claimed in their
Statement of Contentions, though it may be appropriate to take into account the effect of the agreed facts so far as declaration 4 is concerned regarding payment of subscription fees. This is subject to the qualification that the
Third Defendants are entitled to the relief in paragraph 2 of the Third
Defendant's Statement of Issues, namely "a declaration that the resolutions purportedly amending the constitutional roles of the First Defendant, purportedly passed at a meeting on 28 October 1994 are null and void". I direct that Counsel submit draft orders giving effect to the foregoing within fourteen days.
So far as costs between Second and Third Defendants are concerned (other than in relation to the Plaintiffs costs),
I give leave to Counsel to address me, in the event that they are unable to agree on an apportionment of costs between them. The
Third Defendants should pay the Plaintiff's costs.
