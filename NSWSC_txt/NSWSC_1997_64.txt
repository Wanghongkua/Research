March 1997) 
PETER JAMES O'LOUGHLIN versus JEFFREY FRANCIS O'LOUGHLIN /96 
MONDAY 3 MARCH 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
MEAGHER JA 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This matter concerns a notice of motion for a stay of certain orders of Master Macready made on 28 November 1996. In my view no case has been made out for the granting of a stay. That is to be without prejudice to any further application which the claimant may deem fit to make in the future when events have become clearer and he is in a better position to file a more considered application. 
As I say, the only order I should make now is the notice of motion be dismissed with costs.
 (Mr Gruzman made application for the costs of the application for a stay before Master Macready.) 
Those costs will await the appeal.
