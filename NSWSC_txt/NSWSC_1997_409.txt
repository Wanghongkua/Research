 /96 RE NORTH SYDNEY COUNCIL 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a summons filed under [s63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) by the North Sydney Council seeking advice as to the course it should pursue as trustees of the St Thomas' Church of England Cemetery pursuant to the [St Thomas' Church of England, North Sydney, Cemetery Act 1967](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/stcoensca1967494/) (the "Act"). 
The application is not the usual type of matter that is considered under s63 because the trust is in the nature of a public trust rather than a private trust but it was sensible to bring the matter before the court in this way.
Neighbouring occupiers were served and counsel appeared as amicus curiae to put the position that those occupiers would like the court to consider.

I heard this morning the evidence and the very helpful written and oral submissions of Mr Weber for the Council and Mr Atkin as amicus curiae and then adjourned to consider the matter because there were a couple of matters I wished to pursue. Those matters having turned out to be red herrings, it is best to give reasons for judgment now whilst the matter is fresh in everybody's mind.

From at least 1845, the relevant land, which is in West Street, Cammeray, has been used as a burial ground. In 1967 the land was still Old System land and it was vested in the Anglican Church Property Trust Diocese of Sydney, as that body is now known, a corporation incorporated under the [Anglican Church of
Australia Trust Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/acoatpa1917459/). I will refer to it as "the Property Trust". By the [St Thomas' Church of
England, North Sydney, Cemetery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/stcoensca1967494/) the legislature removed the land from the Property Trust and vested it in the plaintiff Council. It did this by enacting that the land in the Schedule to the Act, which has been assumed for present purposes to be the land occupied by the whole of the cemetery, was dedicated as a public park with the Council to be the trustees of the park. [Section (4)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/stcoensca1967494/s3.html) of the Act is as follows: "Any estate or interest in the scheduled land which, immediately before the commencement of this Act, was vested in or held by any person or body of persons is hereby divested." 
The remaining paragraphs of [s3(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/stcoensca1967494/s3.html) dealt with liabilities, securities and trusts that might have affected the land.

For the purposes of the present case, I am asked to assume the following: that the persons by whom Mr Atkin is instructed (whom I will call "the adjoining owners") have been in adverse possession of a strip approximately .4 metres long at the rear of their properties since, at least, 1947. In other words, the back yards of the adjoining occupiers have extended into what is part of the land scheduled to the Act, so that the adjoining owners have an extra 2.4 metres of depth to their property at the expense of the old cemetery; that very old paling fences have been erected at the rear of the adjoining owners' land on the de facto boundary; that the fences have been in existence, at least, since 23 March 1947; that on 17 August 1989, following an application by the Council, the land was brought under the provisions of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/); that the adjoining owners had no notice of the application to bring the land under the Act.

The vital question is whether the adjoining owners have any rights to the 2.4 metre wide strip at the rear of their properties, which strip is in the plaintiff Council's certificate of title.

One has to look at this problem at different times to see the rights, if any, that were held by the adjoining owners. The first moment to look at is the assent to the Act on 23 March 1967. Immediately before the assent, the
Property Trust was the documentary owner of the land but, by virtue of the
Real Property Limitation Act 1833, the adjoining owners would on the assumed facts have a better title to the strip because the documentary owner's title had been barred by the process of limitation. Accordingly, had the adjoining owners applied for a grant to bring the land comprised in the strip under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) at that date, they would have succeeded.

Was their interest divested by s3(4)(a) of the Act? 
Mr Atkin argued that the adjoining owners did not have an estate or interest in the land within the meaning of s3(4)(a). He said that the words were not defined and did not have the wide meaning which those words might have in the
Conveyancing Act and the thrust of the whole of s3 was that it was the land that was vested in the Property Trust, the liabilities of the Property Trust and the debts due by it in respect of the land, that were being transferred to the Council. He put that argument in the light of the general rule of construction that one does not construe an enactment to take away people's private property, at least without compensation in the absence of clear intention. The property of the adjoining owners was not affected.

Although the words "estate or interest" are not defined, the law clearly is that a person, even with an inchoate possessory title, is seised or possessed of the land in fee simple. That person has seisin or possession, which is good against all of the world except the person with a better right to seisin or possession. I use the word "seisin" or "possession" disjunctively because prior to 1832, the proper word would have been "seisin", but, with the abolition of the real actions, possession has really displaced seisin so much so that most of the modern books now describe "possession" as "seisin". This principle clearly appears from the authorities; see for instance Perry v
Clissold [[1907] AC 73], 79 to 80, and the discussion in Lightwood, A Time
Limit on Actions (Butterworths, London, 1909) pp 120 and following, and see also Shaw versus Garbutt (1996) 7 BPR 14816, 14832.

Accordingly, in my view, the word "estate" in s3(4)(a) whatever it means, at least includes the legal fee simple held by an inchoate or complete adverse possessor.

Does the subsection then extend not only to an estate, which is held by the
Property Trust, but also to an estate which is also held by anybody else? Even paying due heed to the well known problem of interpretation, on which Mr Atkin relies, it is almost impossible to get around the words "by any person", which are used in s3(4). It seems to me those words clearly show that it was all of the estates or interests which were to be divested.

During the morning, I checked a series of other Cemetery Acts to see whether there was any comparable provision, and I could not find any. I am told also that there is nothing in the second reading speech of the Minister who introduced the Bill that would assist. I would have thought that the subsection is probably primarily directed to nullify any interest by a person who might have a right to a grave site or something of that nature and so is in deliberately wide words. However, the words would cover a situation such as the present even though I would be fairly sure it was not one that was addressed by any person at the time. Accordingly, as at 23 March 1967, any title that the adjoining owners had was extinguished.

However, between 23 March 1967 and 17 August 1989 a further 20 years passed and, on the assumptions I have made, provided it was possible to do so, a new possessory title would have been obtained. It matters not whether one looks at the 1833 Act or the Limitation Act of 1969, which reduced the 20 year period to 12 as, whatever it was, the time had expired. During this time, the land was vested in the Council, but had not been brought under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/).

I have assumed that, on the proper construction of the Act, the legal fee simple vested in the Council. The Act does not actually say this, but it is hard to see how the Council could be the trustees unless this were so. In any event, that assumption is more favourable to the adjoining owners than the other assumption, that the land had escheated.

One then has to look at s235B of the Crown Lands Consolidation Act 1913.
Although this Act was repealed as from 1 May 1990, it was the statute that was in force at all material times between 1967 and 1989. Section 235B is the equivalent to the present [s170](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla1989134/s170.html) of the [Crown Lands Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla1989134/), but some of the definitions of terms that are employed differ between the two statutes.

Section 235B provides: "(1) No title to any land of the Crown which has been ...
 left between Crown grants for use as a road or driftway; or dedicated under the Crown Lands Acts or any other Act for a public purpose; ...
 shall by reason of adverse possession be allowed to be asserted or established as against: the Crown; or persons holding such lands in trust for any public purpose." 
The words "Crown lands" are defined by s5(1) of that Act as meaning lands vested in His Majesty and not permanently dedicated to any public purpose or lawfully contracted to be sold. The present lands are thus not Crown lands because on the assumptions which I have made, they are vested in the Council.
That is usually a vital distinction, as I pointed out in Smith versus Tamworth
City Council [(1997) 41 NSWLR 000.] 
Mr Atkin says, accordingly, that s235B has no application and, therefore, one is governed by the ordinary rules as to limitation as exist between subjects.

Mr Weber, on the other hand, says that it is vital to realise that there is a distinction between the expression "any land of the Crown" at the commencement of s235B(i) and "Crown lands". It is clear, he says, that s235B applies to a wider group of properties because the reference in (ii) to persons holding such lands in trust shows that the section is to apply not only where lands are vested in His Majesty but where lands are vested in other persons for a public purpose.

As far as I have been able to research the matter, the only time that s.235B appears to have been the subject of judicial consideration is Simpson v
Northwest County District Council (1978) 4BPR 9277 at 9304. That concerned a driftway where land between two Crown grants had been left ungranted so that the land was actually Crown lands and what Waddell J said at that page tells a little against the construction for which Mr Weber put, but his Honour was really not directing his mind to the point. Despite Mr Atkin's able argument, it does not seem to me that one can sensibly read s235B other than the way Mr
Weber put. In the instant case, there is land which s3(1) of [St Thomas'
Church of England, North Sydney, Cemetery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/stcoensca1967494/) dedicates for a public purpose and a person holds that land for the public purpose. It would thus seem to me that s235B applies.

I should also mention that Mr Atkin puts that the words "public purpose" are not made out because the definition in s37M(1) of the 1913 Act defines public purpose. However, I think Mr Weber's submission is correct that that definition is only for lands dedicated or reserved under the [Crown Lands
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla1989134/) or the
Closer Settlement Acts and does not extend to the more general purpose in s235B.

Accordingly, the section prevents a title by adverse possession having been obtained as at 1989.

After 1989, either s235B of the 1913 Act as amended or [s170](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla1989134/s170.html) of the [Crown Lands Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla1989134/) would have the same result. Another reason why the adjoining owners' position cannot be any better is because the land is now under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/). The only way of obtaining a title by adverse possession under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) is by virtue of s45D of that Act and that section only applies where it is the whole of a parcel of land that is the subject of the application. There are other reasons as well why the matter would not come within s45D but it is not necessary to go into those.

Accordingly, there is no legal title in the adjoining owners to the strip.

The next matter raised by Mr Atkin is whether there is a personal equity which is maintainable against the plaintiff Council in respect of the land. Although the full circumstances, out of which the alleged personal equity was said to arise, were not fully enunciated, it would seem that such circumstances are: there was no notice of the application; the plan filed with the Registrar General when the land was brought under the Act did not draw attention to the fact that there were encroachments onto the cemetery; that there is some fiduciary duty owed by a local authority to its ratepayers not to divest their land from them without seeing that they have an opportunity to defend themselves; that the adjoining owners had adverse possessors' rights, which it would be unconscionable for the Council to ignore.

Dealing with this fourth matter first, in the ordinary case, at least if not in every case, the rights possessed by a person in adverse possession are purely legal rights. A person seeking to have the Registrar General register him or her as a possessory owner is not seeking an equitable right and, accordingly, does not have to offer to do equity; Shaw versus Garbutt at 14834.
The mere fact that the person has been deprived of his or her land when they had a possessory title is not sufficient to give that person any equity.

The personal equity exception to indefeasibility is said to have flowed from the judgments of the Privy Council in Frazer versus Walker [1967] 1 AC 569, 580 and 585. Generally speaking, a personal equity means a right of a person to apply to a court of equity for relief, though an action at common law in deceit would also suffice; Gorofino versus Reliance Finance Corp Ltd (1992) 5
BPR 11941 at 11945. In the instant case there is no equity and there is no common law fraud which might be classed as an "equity" for the purpose of the rule. I need say nothing further about (i) and (ii).

As to the third matter, there is a principle in what might be called
Aboriginal Land Right cases in other countries, where the government is said to owe a statutory fiduciary obligation to Aboriginal people not to deprive them of their land. The genesis is Guerin versus The Queen [(1984) 13 DLR (4th) ](http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1984/1984scr2-335/1984scr2-335.html "View Case" ) at 334 et seq and see also R versus Sparrow [(1990) 70 DLR (4th) ], 408. However, this fiduciary duty only seems to apply between a government and an indigenous population and has not been extended beyond that. In Blacktown City Council versus Huxedurp (1990) 6 BPR 14118, I said that a local council owes a fiduciary duty to a ratepayer not to use its town planning policies so as to obtain an unconscionable advantage when buying the ratepayer's property. I adhere to that decision, but it is a long way short of the present case.

I would think that it is just possible for the adjoining owners to show that there is some personal equity but they would need to put before the court a lot more facts than are before the court at the moment, and on the facts as I have them and the assumptions which I have been asked to make, there would be no personal equity arising against the Council. I repeat that what I say would not preclude those persons bringing an action if they had appropriate evidence, but it might be said that they would be brave litigants seeking to break new ground.

It may be that the bringing of the land under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) in 1989 was the cause of the adjoining owners being deprived of their land. If so, then, subject to the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/), there may be a claim under s127 of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/). However, if my view of s235B is correct, then that action would not lie. The only reason for mentioning this is that it should not be thought that it is only the Council who might be liable for deprivation of any interest in land the adjoining owners have. Of course, under the 1967 Act the government clearly divested any title that adjoining owners then had and the legislature made it clear, in s9 of the Act, that no compensation was to be payable for such divestiture.

An analogous situation to the present is where there is a sale by a council for unpaid rates under the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/lga182/). Under s602 and s604 of the Local Government Act 1919, there was provision to preserve covenants and easements, which affected the land but otherwise to completely divest it from the original owner and invest it in the purchaser from the council. The provision of those sections seems to have a similar effect to s3(4) of the present Act. The decision of Hope J in Morgan versus 15 Bannerman
Street Pty Ltd [[1971] 1 NSWLR 601], I think, reinforces the view that I have taken.

The final matter that was raised was whether ss 12 and 136 of the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) permit the Registrar General to recover the certificate of title issued to the
Council and to correct the title so as to remove the disputed strip. This is because it is put that there has been an erroneous recording in the register.
I do not wish to say very much about this because the Registrar General is not a party and experience tells me that it is wise to hear from counsel for the
Registrar General in such matters. There are usually little twists and turns in the practice which the court needs to consider before making a final adjudication. If there is a "remedy" for a mistake under those sections, the usual consequence is that the person who has been registered in error is divested of his or her land and has a claim against the Registrar General; see
Brantag Pty Ltd versus Minister for Mines (No. 3) Young J 29 March 1995 unreported. Both because of that and because of the terms of the section, it is, I think, the better view of s136 that it is limited or may be limited to errors of a formal nature rather than the situation in the present case where the Council has vested in it by Act of Parliament land which is described in the Schedule to an Act of Parliament. The Registrar General is presented with the appropriate survey plan and issues the certificate of title. The process means that a new ownership is generated by virtue of the Act, freed from all other rights. In Woodman & Nettle's Torrens System NSW (looseleaf edition by Butt & Ticehurst) para 136.80, the learned authors say of the analogous situation of a sale under the present [s726](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s726.html) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) that the
Registrar General is expected to record the Council's transfer in the register without requiring the production of the certificate of title and that this is the appropriate procedure. It may be that, if not before, [s726](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s726.html) shows that the Registrar General is expected to register a statutory divesting and revesting and is not to expend time and energy on making inquiries outside the documents which are presented to him.

For all of those reasons, it seems to me that the adjoining owners have no legal or equitable right to the strip.

What the Council does about that is really a matter for the Council. I am not told whether there is any plan of management for the park under [s36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s36.html) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) and there may be complications in permitting the adjoining owners either to have a licence of the strip or for the Council not to take any action against them on certain conditions. It seems to me that I should not go into that area. That is, I do not consider that I should enter into the third matter on which the
Council seeks the court's advice, that is, whether it would be justified in taking steps to cause the encroaching fences to be removed and return the disputed strips to appropriate public use.

I will permit short minutes to be brought in after Mr Weber and Mr Atkin have had a chance to consider these reasons and I will tentatively put the matter in the list for 16 October 1997 at 9.30 am, though counsel can contact my
Associate the previous week to arrange a more suitable date so that short minutes can be brought in. However, I am presently minded merely to advise the
Council by order that none of the adjoining owners have any legal or equitable rights to the land on the facts which have been presented to the court and the
Council must exercise its powers of management and otherwise under the [Local
Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/).
