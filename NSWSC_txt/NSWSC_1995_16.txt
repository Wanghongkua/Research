JUDGE1
GLEESON CJ: The issue in this matter concerns the meaning and effect of [s2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) of the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/), and the capacity of a District Court judge to grant a certificate under the Act relating to the costs of an accused person where, following a voir dire examination and an adverse ruling as to the admissibility of certain evidence, the Crown decides to enter a nolle prosequi.
The claimant seeks an order, in the nature of certiorari, quashing a decision of Newton DCJ, who refused to grant a certificate under the [Costs in
Criminal Cases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/), and an order that the matter be remitted to the District
Court to be determined according to law. Certain other relief claimed in the summons was not pursued.
The history of the matter is as follows.
In August 1990 the claimant was arrested and charged with armed robbery.
It was alleged that he and two co-offenders were involved in the robbery of
Armaguard security officers, from whom an amount of $87,000 was taken. The alleged co-offenders were also involved in the criminal proceedings to which I shall refer, and in the unsuccessful application for a costs certificate.
However, for present purposes it is convenient to ignore them and to refer only to the proceedings insofar as they affect the claimant.
The Crown case against the claimant depended solely, or substantially, upon police evidence of admissions made by the claimant. Those admissions were allegedly recorded in notes which were signed by the claimant.
In March 1991 the claimant was committed to stand trial at the Sydney
District Court. The trial was ultimately fixed to commence in August 1992.
The District Court Rules establish a procedure by which disputes as to the admissibility of evidence may be resolved before a jury has been empanelled.
This procedure has practical advantages. As in the present case, it sometimes happens that evidence and argument on a voir dire hearing may take several days, and it is inconvenient for a jury to be kept waiting over such a period.
The relevant rule, which is contained in Pt 53, is as follows: "11(1) The Court may order that an enquiry by way of a voir dire into the admissibility of any evidence or as to the capacity of a witness to give evidence be had, before the trial Judge, at any stage of any proceedings whether before or after the jury is empanelled.
 
Before commencing any enquiry ordered under subrule (1) the
Court shall require the accused person, if he has not already pleaded to the charge against him, to so plead".
The trial of the claimant was fixed before Newton DCJ. An indictment was presented, and the claimant pleaded not guilty. Newton DCJ then proceeded under the provisions of the above rule, without empanelling a jury.
The claimant challenged the admissibility of the confessional evidence on two grounds. First, he said that he had been assaulted by the police, and the confessions were not voluntary. Second, he said that an untrue representation had been made to him by the police, and this had induced the making of the confessions. For reasons that are not presently material, Newton DCJ, after hearing evidence, resolved these questions in favour of the claimant. His
Honour did not make any positive findings against the police officers involved, but he concluded that on the evidence he could not be satisfied that the confessions were voluntary, or not the result of an untrue representation.
Accordingly, he determined that the confessional evidence was inadmissible.
The prosecuting authorities acknowledged that, in those circumstances, there being no other evidence presently available to them, they could not succeed in the prosecution. Counsel for the claimant made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the judge that he should empanel a jury and direct an acquittal. His Honour's refusal to take that course is not a matter that is now in issue in these proceedings.
Under s7(2)(b) of the Directory of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, the
Director has the same functions as the Attorney General in relation to directing that no further proceedings be taken against a person who has been committed for trial. The effect of that provision was examined in R versus Howard [(1992) 29 NSWLR 242.] A direction was given that no further proceedings be taken against the claimant, and that was communicated to the claimant, and to the court. Newton DCJ informed the claimant, who was on bail, that he was discharged.
Subsequently, the claimant made an application to Newton DCJ to grant a certificate for costs under the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/). It is the decision on that application that is presently in question.
[Section 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html), so far as is presently material, provides as follows: "2 The Court or Judge or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may - where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry; or where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and - he is discharged as to the indictment upon which he was convicted; or the information or complaint upon which he was convicted is dismissed, grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act ... ".
 .
Newton DCJ declined to grant the certificate upon two grounds. First, he held that there had not been a hearing on the merits within the meaning of the legislation. Second, he held that the claimant had not been relevantly acquitted or discharged.
The claimant submits that his Honour erred in law in relation to both of those matters.
Counsel for the claimant acknowledges that, in the events that have occurred, if the Crown came into possession of further evidence, (such as, for example, the evidence of an apparently credible witness who claimed to have seen the claimant participating in the armed robbery), then there would be nothing to prevent the renewal of the prosecution, and the presentation of a further indictment charging the claimant with the same offence. (Halsbury's
Laws of England, Vol. 11, para 224.) However, counsel submits that there has been, for all practical purposes, a hearing on the merits and a relevant discharge. As to the first matter, the outcome of the voir dire hearing was that the evidence upon which the Crown intended to rely at the impending trial was found to be wholly inadmissible, and the Crown acknowledged that it had no case against the claimant. As to the second matter, whilst it is not submitted that there has been an acquittal of the claimant, it is argued that he was discharged within the meaning of s2.
It is common ground that what occurred before Newton DCJ would not enable the claimant to plead autrefois acquit if he were, at some future time, charged again in relation to the robbery. On the other hand, it would be vexatious, oppressive and an abuse of process for the Crown, in further proceedings against the claimant, to endeavour to rely upon the confessional evidence that was held to be inadmissible following the voir dire hearing before Newton DCJ (Rogers v The Queen [(1994) 68 ALJR 688).] That means that, for practical purposes, any further proceedings would depend upon the availability of new evidence.
It is not for this court to rule upon the appropriateness of the Crown's decision to invoke [s7(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/doppa343/s7.html) of the [Director of Public Prosecutions Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/doppa343/). That is not an issue that has been debated before us. Lord Devlin's scathing criticism of the use of the nolle prosequi in the case of John Bodkin Adams (Patrick Devlin, "Easing The Passing", Bodley Head 1985, pp 180-182) went to a political rather than a legal issue. (His Lordship said, at p181, that the nolle prosequi had never before been used to prevent a person committed for trial from being acquitted.)
In Allerton versus Director of Public Prosecutions [(1991) 53 A Crim R 33] this court considered the puzzlement expressed by McHugh JA in Fraser versus The Queen (No 2) [(1985) 1 NSWLR 680] as to the meaning of [s2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) of the [Costs in Criminal
Cases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/). McHugh JA pointed out that the practice of trial courts was to treat the provision as applicable to a case where a trial before a jury resulted in a verdict of acquittal. His Honour took the view that such a practice could only be justified by treating "information" as including "indictment". However, in Allerton the court said that the solution to the problem was to break up [s2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) so that it reads, in effect, as follows: "(a) where, after a hearing on the merits, a defendant is - acquitted; or discharged as to the information under inquiry".
This, it was said, accorded with the scheme of the section which dealt, in relation to first instance proceedings, with two situations: proceedings before a magistrate, and proceedings at a trial. The court said (at 38) that a discharge as to the information then under inquiry "would typically occur at the committal stage where the defendant stands before the court on an 'information' which is 'then under inquiry'". The court treated the concept of acquittal as referable to proceedings on an indictment and the concept of discharge as to an information as, at least in the usual case, referable to an order of discharge made by a magistrate.
In R versus Hull [(1989) 16 NSWLR 385], in a quite different context, it was said that in some circumstances the word "information" is wide enough to include "indictment".
However, as [s2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) was explained in Allerton, it is not necessary to give "information" that wider meaning in order to cover the common case of an acquittal following a trial by jury in the case of an indictable offence.
It is unnecessary, for the resolution of the present matter, to form a view as to whether there are any circumstances in which, for the purposes of [s2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html), it might be appropriate to treat "information" as including, "indictment". The fact that a discharge of the kind referred to in the section would typically occur at the committal stage does not necessarily mean that it could only occur at that stage.
 .
The idea of acquittal or discharge after a hearing on the merits is a composite idea, as appears from the authorities on the meaning of the expression "a hearing on the merits". The meaning of "a hearing on the merits" has been expounded in a number of cases concerning legislation, which is of some antiquity, under which persons the subject of a failed prosecution may obtain a certificate of dismissal.
The purpose of such a certificate was to prevent a subsequent prosecution. In Bridie versus Messina [(1965) 66 SR 446], the Full Court was concerned with a provision of the Crimes Act under which a person who had been unsuccessfully prosecuted before a justice was entitled to a certificate of dismissal if there had been a hearing on the merits and a dismissal of the complaint.
Sugerman J said, at 453: "A hearing on the merits is one in which the issues of fact or law, or both, between the parties are fought out to a final conclusion binding upon the parties - a decision 'upon the merits'. It does not seem to matter that the determination of one or some only of the issues may suffice to decide the whole controversy, or that the issues may be decided on facts which are the subject of admission and not of dispute or even of evidence.
Without purporting to make an exhaustive enumeration, or to state all the qualifications which may be a necessary, a hearing may be said not to have been on the merits if it resulted in a decision which was not final but analogous rather to a non-suit, or if, for some such reason as withdrawal, want of jurisdiction, noncompliance with some preliminary requirement, defect in the information, or other technical or procedural informality or irregularity, it did not result, or could not have resulted, in a decision on the merits, final in its nature and capable of supporting (in criminal cases) a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict".
Although his Honour expressed himself in a way that left open the possibility of marginal cases that did not fall directly within his formulation, the substance of what was said is equally applicable to [s2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) of the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/), and is fatal to the claimant in the present case.
What occurred in this case was analogous to a non-suit. There was, in effect, a withdrawal of the proceedings on the indictment that had been presented before Newton DCJ following a preliminary ruling upon the admissibility of certain evidence. It can hardly make a difference that the ruling on admissibility depended upon hearing the evidence of witnesses. The position would have been no different if the argument as to admissibility had turned upon some point of law. The most that can be said on behalf of the claimant is that, by reason of the decision in Rogers, there cannot be any further attempt, in a later prosecution, to introduce the same evidence.
However, the reference to "merits" in the section is a reference to the merits of the charge, not to the merits of some particular argument about an individual piece of evidence.
The claimant is still, technically, liable to prosecution on the robbery charge. The Crown decided to take no further proceedings on the indictment that was presented before Newton DCJ because of an unfavourable ruling on the admissibility of the evidence upon which its case then depended.
There was no hearing on the merits of the charge against the claimant. There was no acquittal. The only sense in which the claimant was discharged was that, being on bail, he was freed from any further requirement to appear before a court, or to comply with any bail conditions. Newton DCJ was right to conclude that the conditions of [s2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) of the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/) were not satisfied.
The summons should be dismissed with costs.
JUDGE2
KIRBY P: The [Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/) (the Act) is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions. The Act overcomes the normal rule that, by the Royal Prerogative and by the common law, the Crown neither seeks nor pays costs in criminal proceedings. See Attorney-General of
Queensland versus Holland <case>; [(1912) 15 CLR 46], 92; Acuthan v
Coates [(1986) 6 NSWLR 472 (CA)], 479.
The Act should therefore be given a beneficial construction. Its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of the Act's general purposes. But those purposes must be derived (in circumstances of disputed interpretation) from the words in which Parliament has expressed itself.
Gleeson CJ has set out the facts. The short question is whether, in the circumstances that arose in the criminal prosecution of the claimant, he has: "... after a hearing on the merits (been) acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry".
 
It should be assumed that the accused was "discharged"
Although it is not entirely clear, I would be prepared to assume that the order of Newton DCJ was, in the circumstances, a "discharge" as contemplated by <case>(a) of the Act. It is highly arguable that that is the effect of the authority of this Court as to the meaning of the phrase "as to the information then under inquiry". See Fraser versus The Queen (No. 2) [(1985) 1 NSWLR 680 (CA)], 555.
In Allerton (at 555), the Court refer-red to the remarks of McHugh JA in
Fraser. It was inclined (at 556) to accept a suggestion that <case>(a) of the Act should be split up in the way described by Gleeson CJ in his reasons. It was acknowledged that this involved "minor surgery" to <case>(a). The surgery was the more unusual because <case>(b) was already subdivided in such a way. Although I was a party to the judgment in Allerton, I concede the force of the criticism voiced about the "minor surgery" which was tentatively favoured in that decision.
To hold, as the claimant urges, would accord with a purposive construction of <case> of the Act. The object of the Act (and of the section) was to afford a facility for procuring a certificate at the conclusion of a criminal proceeding.
Necessarily, costs are incurred in such a proceeding. The fact that, later, theoretically at least, a further proceeding might be brought, does not detract from the conclusion that a "discharge" of that proceeding has occurred in respect of which the successful accused might seek a certificate.
To that extent, I am inclined to think that Newton DCJ erred in confining the discharge contemplated by <case>(a) to a committal proceeding before the magistrate.
 
But the discharge was not after a "hearing on the merits"
However, it is not necessary finally to determine this question. His
Honour did not err in holding that the discharge which actually occurred in the instant case had not happened "after a hearing on the merits". If the purpose of the Act was to provide a facility to a successful accused in a criminal prosecution, its condition, relevantly, is that any acquittal or discharge follows "a hearing on the merits".
Behind this notion is the concept that a court has heard the charge presented against the accused to its conclusion on its merits and the accused has been acquitted or discharged.
Anything failing short of a hearing on the merits, and a decision thereafter, in effect, that the prosecution was unwarranted or misconceived, has to be dealt with under the preexisting law. No facility for a statutory costs certificate then exists. Doubtless this precondition was meant to exclude from the statute those who secured an acquittal or discharge, but not after a hearing on the merits. So the Act is expressed. So it must be interpreted.
Some care must be taken in the use of the remarks of Sugerman J in Bridie v Messina [(1965) 66 SR 446 (FC)], 453 concerning the meaning of the phrase "a hearing on the merits". Bridie went to the High Court sub nom Messina v
Bridie and Anor <case>; [(1966) 114 CLR 354.] There, Barwick CJ (with whom Taylor,
Menzies and Windeyer JJ agreed) dismissed the appeal, although on a ground different from that favoured by the Full Court. Barwick CJ said, at 358, of the foregoing passage in Sugerman J's reasons: "Nor do I need express any final opinion upon the propriety of the views of the Full Court that there was in this instance a hearing of the information or complaint 'upon the merits' or that the justice who had accepted a plea of autrefois acquit or convict could properly dismiss the information on the ground that he deemed the offence of which the information before him complained not to have been proved. Suffice it to say that in taking the course which I propose, I would not wish to be taken to adopt any such views. The essential consequence of a successful plea or defence of autrefois acquit or convict in preventing any further examination of the facts relating to the offence the subject of that plea or defence must have a serious impact upon the decision of the question whether a justice who has accepted such a plea or defence could properly consider the offence not to be proved."
Only McTiernan J felt persuaded by the reasons of Sugerman J in the Full
Court that "there was a hearing of the case 'upon the merits' . ....."in that case. See ibid, 358.
I do not regard the present proceedings as an occasion for an exploration of the entire meaning of the phrase "hearing on the merits" in <case>(a) of the
Act. It is enough for me to say that I do not consider that the phrase can be stretched so far as to include a hearing of a preliminary, interlocutory character under Pt 53 r 11 (1) of the District Court Rules. As Gleeson CJ has pointed out, all that occurred in this case, by the invocation of that procedure, was a ruling on certain evidence proffered by the Crown. It is true, as the claimant points out, that all parties were represented; an indictment was presented; the accused pleaded; the Crown presented its then entire available case; the accused gave evidence on oath; submissions were made; Newton DCJ rejected the confessional material; the Crown conceded that there was no further evidence available to it against the accused; and the accused was then discharged and released from his bail undertakings.
The result is that, in practical terms, a hearing occurred for which costs were certainly necessary. They resulted in a discharge of the accused.
 .
But, by definition, that hearing was a preliminary one. It was certainly not the hearing of the trial of the accused before a jury that would have been the ordinary venue for a hearing on the merits of such a charge. Nothing would stand in the way of a fresh indictment upon other evidence, should that course later become available to the Crown. Although, as a matter of practicality, that is unlikely to occur in fact in the present case, this Court must approach the construction of the Act mindful of its application to a large variety of criminal proceedings.
The present case can readily be distinguished from Allerton. There, the entire case was heard at trial. The trial judge erroneously took the matter from the jury and directed an acquittal. Nothing of the sort happened in this case. All that was heard was a limited preliminary application, albeit one crucial for the further prosecution of the indictment found against the claimant.
In the preliminary procedure which was followed and, in this case, successfully for the claimant, all that was finally heard and determined was the disputed admissibility of certain evidence. That does not constitute a "hearing on the merits" of the count of the indictment presented against the accused as the Act contemplated. The character of the court proceedings was no more than it purported to be: a convenient pre-trial determination of the admissibility of evidence, as now allowed by the
District Court Rules.
 
Order: summons dismissed
In the result, Newton DCJ's refusal of a certificate under the Act disclosed no error such as would attract relief from this Court in the nature of a writ of certiorari. The summons seeking that relief must therefore be dismissed with costs.
JUDGE3
PRIESTLEY JA: On the question whether there was in the present case "a hearing on the merits", within the meaning of those words in [s 2(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/s2.html) of the [Costs in
Criminal Cases Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/), I agree with Gleeson CJ and Kirby P, for the reasons given by them, that there was not. On that basis alone Newton DCJ was correct in thinking he had no power to grant a certificate under the section. I confine myself to that ground for reaching the conclusion that this court should dismiss the summons with costs.
