Handler and Anor versus Handler Matter No 2277/97 [1998] NSWSC 687 (8 December )

Last Updated: 14 January 1999 `GILBERT HANDLER & ANOR versus CHARLES HANDLER` `2277/97` `8 December 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` `JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: This is a question of how the costs of the further consideration should be borne. Both Mr Whittle for the plaintiffs and Mr Cashion SC for the defendant have made submissions, the former as to why the defendant should be ordered to pay the additional costs and the latter as to why those costs should be borne by the person expending them. 
My mind wavered as each advocate presented the case. However, essentially I consider that the evidence before me shows that it was unlikely that the court's order would have been carried out without further mention before the court and this court's guidance. It was under those conditions that eventually the matter was happily settled by a consent decree being made by the Probate
Court in Tel Aviv.

I think accordingly that the plaintiffs were justified in bringing the matter back before the court and the defendant should pay the costs of the further consideration.
