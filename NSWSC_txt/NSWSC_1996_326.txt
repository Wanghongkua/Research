JUDGE1
HUNT CJ AT CL The appellant (Peter Kurtic) was found guilty by Judge Karpin in the District Court upon a charge pursuant to [s 35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s35.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of having maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon a neighbour (Larjos
Joni). In accordance with <case> of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), the judge deferred passing sentence for a period of five years subject to conditions as to supervision and medical treatment.
In support of his appeal against conviction, the appellant has complained that the judge made a number of factual errors in her judgment. Before turning to those complaints, it is necessary to say something in relation to the nature of the appeal which has been brought.
Judge Karpin sat without a jury, the appellant having elected to be tried by a judge alone pursuant to [s 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s32.html) of the [Criminal Procedure Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/). [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s33.html) of that Act provides that the judge who tries the case alone pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/s32.html) may make any finding which could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person and that such finding, once made by the judge, "has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury".
Appeals against conviction on indictment are brought to this Court pursuant to [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). The present appeal is brought pursuant to that section. The powers of this Court upon such an appeal, in relation to what the heading of [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) calls "ordinary cases", are set out in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) and [s 8.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s8.html) [Section 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) permits the Court to allow or to dismiss the appeal, to quash the conviction and to direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered. [Section 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s8.html) permits the Court to order a new trial. Where an appeal against sentence is allowed, [s 6(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html) permits the Court to quash the sentence and to pass another sentence in substitution for it. There are special provisions in [s 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s7.html) which permit the Court to substitute a verdict or a sentence where the appellant could have been found guilty of some other offence than that of which he has been found guilty, but none of the circumstances to which that section applies has any relevance to the present case.
Where the appeal against conviction concerns mentally ill persons, [s 6A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6a.html) permits the Court to make any finding, verdict, order or determination which could have been made in relation to the proceedings before the court of trial.
Where the appeal against conviction is from a trial in the Supreme Court, the
Land and Environment Court or the Court of Coal Mines Regulation in their respective summary jurisdictions, or from the Supreme Court or the District
Court when dealing with summary offences related to offences being dealt with on indictment ss 5AA-5AD provide that the appeal is by way of rehearing on the evidence given in the court of trial and any other further evidence given by leave of this Court, which is given the power to make any determination which the court of trial could have made on the evidence heard on appeal. None of those provisions has any relevance to the present case.
On an appeal against conviction pursuant to <case>, this Court acts as a court of error.
((1) AG versus Sillem <case>; [(1864) 10 HLC 704] at ); Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd versus Dignam <case>; [(1931) 46 CLR 73] at ; Regina versus Longshaw [(1990) 20 NSWLR 554] at 83-94.) Under the old practice at common law, a court of error, if it thought that error was established, could only order a new trial. ((2) "A History of English Law", Holdsworth (6th Revised Edition, ), at 643. See also Wiscart versus Dauchy [(1796) 3 Dall 321]; [(1922) 30
CLR 523] at 552.) This Court is in the same position, subject only to the proviso to <case> whereby it may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Except where specifically provided by <case>, it has no power under ss 5, 6 or 8 to rehear the issues at the trial. It has no power to make any finding which could have been made in the court of trial.
((3) cf Builders Licensing Board versus Sperway
Constructions (Sydney) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1976) 135 CLR 616] at 695.)
That is clear from the structure of the Act to which I have referred. Although this Court will - in well-defined circumstances ((4) (which are discussed in
Gallagher versus The Queen <case>; [(1986) 160 CLR 392] at 399, 402; Regina versus Gregory Mark
Hemsley (CCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) at 4-6) - permit further evidence to be admitted on the hearing of an appeal pursuant to <case>, that evidence is used by it only for the purpose of determining whether a new trial should be granted by reason of the miscarriage of justice resulting from the absence of that evidence at the original trial, and not for the purpose of deciding for itself what could or should have been found in the court of trial.
Where the appeal against conviction pursuant to <case> is from a trial by a judge alone pursuant to <case> of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), the position is exactly the same. This Court has no power to rehear the issues at the trial or to make any finding which could have been made in the court of trial. In some of such appeals in which this issue has arisen, the stated attitude of the
Court has been complicated by the fact that it has been considering a ground of appeal that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In such a case, it is the duty of this Court - whether the appeal is from a jury trial or a judge alone trial - to make its own independent assessment of both the sufficiency and the quality of the evidence, in order to see whether the jury (or judge trying the case alone) ought to have a reasonable doubt or whether this Court itself experiences such a doubt or is persuaded that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. ((5) M versus The Queen [(1994) 181 CLR 487] at 338-339.) It has nevertheless been accepted by this Court that an appeal against conviction from a trial by a judge alone pursuant to <case> of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) is not an appeal by way of rehearing. ((6) Regina v
William Francis O'Brien (CCA, 5 November 1993, unreported) per Wood J (at 8);
Regina versus Russell James Hetherington (CCA, 13 February 1995, unreported) at -11.) In the statutory context to which I have referred, this must be so. As the finding of a judge in such a trial is to be given the same effect as a verdict of a jury for all purposes, error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself or herself leading to a miscarriage of justice. ((7) [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html); Regina versus O'Donoghue (at 401); Regina v
Simmons [(1995) 79 A Crim R 31] at 35.)
Against that background, I turn to the issues raised in the present appeal. The Crown case was that the appellant had hit the victim a number of blows with a tomahawk, inflicting serious injuries to his head and upper body.
The victim received a compound and depressed fracture to his skull, and he required surgery to locate fragments of the bone and to elevate the fracture.
There was no issue at the trial that the appellant had inflicted these blows upon the victim or that they had caused grievous bodily harm.
The appellant raised the issue of self-defence. The issues which were fought were whether the Crown had established that the injuries were inflicted maliciously and that the appellant had not acted in self-defence in doing so. These issues depended entirely upon the judge's findings of fact.
The victim lived in the flat directly below that of the appellant. The
Crown case was that the appellant had annoyed the victim over a period of about six months by making a large amount of noise in his flat and by throwing food scraps and stones at and through the windows of the victim's flat. In the last month of that period, the victim complained to the appellant about his conduct, leading to an aggressive exchange of words between them. About a week later, the appellant went to the door of the victim's flat, accused him of making noise and offered to fight him at the back of the flats. A short scuffle followed, but the combatants backed off and walked away.
About a week later, the day of the incident in question, the appellant again threw stones through the victims window. It was early in the morning.
The victim, who had been asleep, dressed and went upstairs where he knocked on the appellant's door. The appellant opened the door and came out on to the landing. The victim accused him of throwing objects through his window. An argument followed. The victim took half a step towards the appellant's door, and the appellant struck him across the face. As the victim raised his arm to protect himself, he felt a heavy blow to the side of his face and then a
number of blows about his face and upper body. He escaped to return to his own flat, where he rang the police and they arrived shortly after.
The appellant's version, which he put forward in sworn evidence, was that, in one of the earlier arguments, the victim had threatened to kill him if he did not move out of the building. On the day when the incident in question occurred, the victim had pushed him into his unit, taking up a boxer's stance and had threatened to get him. Before being hit by the victim, he had hit the victim with the tomahawk in order to defend himself against the attack which the victim was threatening. He believed that his life was in danger. This had happened well inside his flat, at the door of the kitchen. He had at first hit the victim with the blunt edge of the tomahawk, then he had attempted to scare him by holding up the sharp edge. Then the appellant lost control of himself and, without turning the tomahawk around, he hit him with the sharp edge.
Although the appellant initially denied that he had ever thrown stones or foodstuff through the victim's window, he explained under cross-examination that some fruit or food had "accidentally" fallen from his window through the victim's window immediately below him. He called evidence of good character.
The victim is described as being six feet one inch in height, of ordinary build and not notably sturdy, with a bad back, and thirty-five years of age at the relevant time. The appellant was about five feet nine inches in height, of a substantially more sturdy build, employed at the time, and fifty-eight years of age.
The police who came to the flat gave evidence of the appellant's claim to them that he had been defending himself against his neighbour's attack. They saw no blood on the carpet inside the appellant's flat, but there was blood on the landing outside his door, continuing down the stairs to the victim's flat.
Blood was observed on the tomahawk and on a blue plastic bag inside the flat where the tomahawk had been placed. There was also some blood around the light switch near the front door of the appellant's flat, and spots on the wall between the kitchen and the bathroom. The blood was identified as being consistent with that of the victim and inconsistent with that of the appellant.
Dr Oettle, from the Institute of
Forensic Medicine, was called by the appellant to say that, if the victim had been hit inside the flat, the bleeding may not have reached the carpet during the period he was inside and, if it did, there would not have been much blood and it may well have been lost in the carpet fibres. The blood on the walls, inside the flat was not necessarily consistent with the blows having been struck there. On the other hand, if the blows had been struck outside the front door but near to it, Dr
Oettle would have expected to have seen some blood on the walls there. He expressed the opinion that a moderate amount of force had been applied by the appellant when hitting the victim with the tomahawk to have caused the injuries which were inflicted.
The judge formed a favourable view of the victim's credit as a witness, and a very unfavourable one of the appellant's credit. She referred to some matters as strongly indicating fabrication by the appellant in his evidence when he felt that an explanation was required, and she found that he was a
most unreliable witness. She accepted the victim's evidence as to the earlier incidents, and that the appellant's evidence about those earlier incidents was untrue to his knowledge. She accepted the victim's evidence as to the incident in question. She accepted that the appellant was the aggressor, that the blows were inflicted upon the victim outside the appellant's flat and not in response to any threat or aggression offered by the victim. I will have to expand upon those factual findings when I come to deal with the issue of self-defence.
That issue of self-defence did not arise until the Crown had first established each of the basic ingredients of the crime with which the appellant had been charged, for self-defence must be considered upon the basis that such ingredients have been made out. ((8) Regina versus Dziduch [(1990) 47 A
Crim R 378] at 511.) In determining whether those basic ingredients have been made out, the tribunal of fact is entitled to take into account the evidence which relates to the issue of self-defence, but care must be taken that there is no conflict between those facts accepted for the purpose of determining the latter and those accepted for the purpose of determining the former.
The first of the issues which arose and which had to be determined in the present case was therefore whether the Crown had established that the appellant inflicted the injuries maliciously. Section 5 of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) provides that any act which is done with an intent to injure without lawful excuse or done recklessly or wantonly shall be taken to have been done maliciously. Self-defence has been described as raising a plea by way of justification or excuse, ((9) This is discussed in Zecevic versus DPP <case>; [(1987) 162
CLR 645] at 657-661) but it seems to me that to introduce the issue of self-defence at the stage of considering whether the basic ingredients of the offence have been made out is productive of confusion and, to some extent, a danger of a circularity in reasoning.

In the present case, the judge found that the appellant had deliberately inflicted the blows upon the victim with the tomahawk. That finding was clearly open to her even without reliance upon the appellant's expressed intention of hitting the victim in order to defend himself. If intention to injure is to be relied upon to establish malice, the intention need not be to cause the grievous bodily harm which was in fact inflicted but simply an intention to cause some physical harm. ((10) Regina versus Coleman [(1990) 19 NSWLR ] at 40.) The obvious inference to be drawn from deliberate blows of moderate force with either edge of a tomahawk to the head is that they were done by the appellant with such an intention. ((11) cf Regina versus Stokes and
Difford (at 29-30).) Alternatively, the blows were obviously inflicted recklessly, in the sense of hitting the victim with the realization of the possibility that some physical injury might result but nevertheless proceeding to hit him with the tomahawk. ((12) Regina versus Coleman (at 471-476); Regina v
Stokes and Difford (at 39-40).) The finding by the judge that the appellant had acted maliciously was clearly open to her on the evidence.
Although the judge did introduce the issue of self-defence at this stage as a lawful excuse, she has not been guilty of any circularity of reasoning. In any event, as it was very properly conceded on the hearing of the appeal, a finding of malice was really inevitable however the issue was approached. I would therefore reject the appellant's complaint that she had erred in making that finding.
The second of the issues which arose and which had to be determined in the present case was whether the Crown had established that the appellant had not acted in self-defence. The better way of expressing the onus is to say that the Crown had to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the appellant acted in self-defence. ((13) Regina versus Dziduch (at 381-382); Regina versus Youssef [(1990) 50 A Crim R 1] at 511.) In order to do so the Crown had to prove either that the appellant did not believe that it was necessary in self-defence to do that act with that state of mind or that there were no reasonable grounds for such a belief. ((14) Zecevic versus DPP (at 661-663);
Regina v Dziduch (at 379-380).) The second of those tests is not wholly objective.
((15) Regina versus Hawes (1994) 35 NMA 294 at 305-306.
See Viro versus The Queen <case>; [(1978) CLR 88] at 467-468.
The High Court in Zecevic versus DPP made it clear that they did not intend to depart from the analogous questions posed in relation to self-defence in Viro: see Zecevic (at 655, 672). The matter is discussed in Regina versus Conlon [(1993) A Crim R 92] at -101) it was decided by me (at first instance) that, where there is evidence giving rise to the issue, the Crown had to eliminate any reasonable possibility that the appellant's appreciation of the gravity of the threat which he faced or the reasonableness of his response to that danger had been reduced by a particular characteristic personal to him. That case was concerned with the accused's voluntarily induced intoxication, and it was held to have been relevant to those issues. Although invited to do so, ((17) (at )) the Crown did not appeal against that decision. It was not challenged in this appeal. However, for reasons which will become clear, it is unnecessary in this appeal for this Court to say whether the decision was right or wrong, notwithstanding that the judge was bound by it (as she appears to have acknowledged). ((18) Fleming versus White [(1981) 2 NSWLR 719] at 298-299.) I remain of the view myself that the decision is correct in relation to the issue with which it dealt - that is, voluntarily induced intoxication.
In the present case, evidence was given by Dr Lewin (a consultant forensic psychiatrist) that, after an examination of the appellant, he had come to the opinion that a number of things in the history which he had taken from the appellant were based upon "a persecutory paranoid delusional set of beliefs". He instanced, in particular, the appellant's belief that the victim had entered his flat during the incident in question and that the victim had attempted to kill him. Dr Lewin also referred to the appellant as being the subject of such hallucinations. In his report, Dr Lewin said that material in the victim's statement and in the appellant's statement "suggests that he may have also been experiencing persecutory delusions involving the victim".
However, he went on to concede that the appellant's history did "not directly confirm this", and that he had insufficient information to form a definitive judgment about the appellant's mental state at the time of the incident in question. He repeated in his evidence that he was unable to give a very definite answer. He concluded by saying: "It appears to me that on the balance it was that he was suffering from a paranoid psychosis ... That he had delusional ideas, which influenced his behaviour and that had an impact upon his decision making process in acting the way he did." 
He was unable to detect any indirect clinical signs of psychosis at the time when he examined the appellant.
It was submitted in this Court that such a state of mind described by Dr
Lewin fell within the principle stated in Regina versus Conlon and was relevant to the same issues as an accused's voluntarily induced intoxication.
It will no doubt take some time to work out how far the decision in that case, if accepted by this Court as correct, can be taken.
((19) It would not appear to be excluded by the proposed [Pt 11A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/index.html#p11a) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), introduced by the
Criminal Legislation Further Amendment Bill 1995 (so far passed only by the
Legislative Assembly) which was intended to reverse the effect of the decision of the High Court in The Queen versus O'Connor <case>; [(1980) 146 CLR 64.)] There may well be some problem in seeking to stretch the principle which it states to apply to the present case, as the issue of whether there were no reasonable grounds for a belief that it was necessary in self-defence to do what was done - although not wholly objective - must nevertheless be at least partly objective. Whatever the effect a characteristic personal to the accused may have upon his perception of some particular action as a threat which he faced or upon the reasonableness of his response to what he perceived to be a danger, there must, in my view, be a reasonable possibility that at least some action in fact took place which could have been mistaken as a threat or danger to the accused before any decision can be made concerning the possibility that his perceptions of that action were affected by that personal characteristic.
There was, on the judge's findings, no such action in the present case.
However, because of a number of specific findings which the judge made relevant to the application of such a principle in the present case, it unnecessary to resolve the question of its application here.
It is trite law that the validity of any expert opinion such as that expressed by Dr Lewin, based as it was solely upon his interpretation of the history upon which it is based, depends upon the accuracy of that history.
((20) Ramsay versus Watson <case>; [(1961) 108 CLR 642] at 87-88; Regina versus Perry [(1990) 49 A Crim R 243] at 249.) Dr Lewin appears to have accepted that in cross-examination. That is of considerable importance in this case because - although the Crown must eliminate any reasonable possibility that the appellant acted in self-defence - the strength of the doctor's opinion was already weakened by the qualifications which he had placed on it, both in his report and in his evidence. If that history was not accepted by the tribunal of fact, then the opinion expressed by Dr Lewin which
I have quoted does not assist the appellant. What the judge said in her judgment was this: "Whilst I accept that the accused may have had certain delusional beliefs at some time, I certainly cannot be satisfied that they operated on his mind at the time of these events. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they did not extend to a delusional belief that the victim had made statements to him, which amounted to a threat to injure or kill him or do any other physical harm to him".

The second of those sentences rejects any reasonable possibility that the appellant had such delusional beliefs at the time of these events.
The judge appears to have accepted the application of the principle stated in Regina versus Conlon to the state of mind described by Dr Lewin, but she did not accept that there was any factual basis for his opinion. She repeated her acceptance of the victim's version of the attack upon him and that she was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant could not reasonably have believed that he was threatened with an attack, and she said that she was similarly satisfied that the appellant could not reasonably have believed that the violence which he offered to the victim was other than totally disproportionate to the verbal confrontation without threat or abuse from the victim. She said that she had taken Dr Lewin's evidence into account in coming to that conclusion.
Criticism was expressed by the appellant that the judge never expressly rejected Dr Lewin's opinion that the appellant had hallucinated in relation to those matters. She was not obliged to do so, as the relevance of that opinion (as opinion it necessarily was) disappeared once the truth of the factual basis upon which it was based had not been established. Criticism was also expressed by the appellant that, although it was open to the judge to have rejected the appellant's assertion that he was in fact about to be attacked by the victim (as clearly she was entitled to upon the evidence of the victim), it was not open to her to reject the reasonable possibility that the appellant had believed (by reason of an hallucination at the time) that he was about to be attacked. It is obvious that an accused person is entitled to rely upon an honest but mistaken belief that he is about to be attacked, provided that there are reasonable grounds for that belief, ((21) (I have disregarded the question of onus in stating this proposition) but it is emphasized time and again in Zecevic that it remains for the tribunal of fact to determine these questions. I can understand the difficulty involved in resolving this issue where it is accepted that the appellant did have certain delusional beliefs at some other time, but I do not accept that the judge was bound by such a finding to find also that the Crown had not eliminated the reasonable possibility that he had such beliefs at the time of this incident.
The judge went on to say: "I find the accused demonstrated an acute awareness of the disproportionate nature of the attack which he made by fabricating a version of the events which he gave to the police and which he maintained thereafter.

I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe, on a purely subjective test, that his response was reasonably proportionate to the limited actions of the victim.

I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable belief held by the accused that he was threatened by any form of physical violence. I have come to that view on a mixture of objective and subjective criteria operating on the mind of the accused at the relevant time.
 
Having come to that conclusion, no question of self-defence arises." 
That was sufficient to reach the ultimate conclusion that the Crown had established the appellant's guilt of the offence charged.
The appellant nevertheless submitted that these findings were not open to the judge because she had, it was said, misstated the evidence of Dr Lewin. As
I understand it, this was intended to be a submission that the judge had misdirected herself as to the effect of the evidence which the doctor gave.
Counsel for the appellant has pointed to her Honour's statement: "The evidence of Dr Lewin does not assist the accused there is nothing to suggest the accused was hallucinating at the time he attacked the victim." 
For the reasons which I have given, it was open to the judge to make the finding stated in the second of those sentences. Once that finding was made, so that the factual basis of Dr Lewin's already insecure opinion was destroyed, the conclusion stated in the first sentence in that quoted passage inevitably followed.
I do not overlook the assertion made by the judge, much earlier in her judgment, that there was no evidence to support a theory that the appellant was prone to delusional beliefs or that the evidence given by him constituted a set of delusional or hallucinating beliefs or were a paranoid interpretation of words used by the victim. There could perhaps be some debate as to whether there was no evidence of those matters. But it was not the absence of any such evidence which much later led the judge to reject the reasonable possibility that the appellant had delusional beliefs at the time of these events. I quoted earlier the relevant passage from her judgment.
In my view, it was open to the judge to make each of the factual findings which she made, and that she had not misstated the evidence of Dr Lewin or misdirected herself as to its effect. In those circumstances, both her finding that the appellant had not acted in self-defence and her verdict of guilty cannot validly be challenged in the way they have been challenged in this appeal. The appeal against the sentence imposed has not been pressed. Nor could it be. The decision of the judge to defer passing sentence pursuant to s was a humane one, as a much more substantial sentence could have been imposed. The reliance upon s 558 could not in any way be said to have been outside the range of options available to her.
Accordingly, I propose that the following orders be made: 
Leave to appeal out of time against conviction is granted. 
The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
Leave to appeal against sentence is refused. 
Time is to count.
JUDGE2
GROVE J I agree with Hunt CJ at
CL and with his reasons.
It is unnecessary in this appeal to make any judgment about the views earlier expressed by his Honour in Regina versus Conlon [1993 69 A Crim R 92.] I would prefer to reserve any questions about the validity of any of the aspects discussed in Conlon until an occasion when detailed analysis needs to be undertaken. To avoid misunderstanding, I expressly do not imply any disagreement with that judgment and simply seek to leave the matter open. I concur with the orders proposed by Hunt CJ at CL.
JUDGE3
BARR AJ I agree with Hunt CJ at CL.
