R versus Alqudsi [2016] NSWSC 1168 (4 July 2016) 
Last Updated: 24 August 2016 
Supreme Court 
New South Wales  
Decision: 
See paragraph 6  
JUDGMENT
By notice of motion filed on 1 July 2013, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police seeks orders pursuant to the Court Suppression Non-publication Orders Act 2010 and the [Surveillance Devices Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sda2004210/) (Cth). The application is supported by an affidavit of Michael Phelan, the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, who is presently also Deputy Commissioner National Security, sworn on 3 July 2016. I was provided with an unredacted copy of Mr Phelan's affidavit, with passages highlighted in yellow on which the Commissioner relies in support of the application. I have since returned that unredacted copy to the representative of the Commissioner for safekeeping. The Court file will retain the redacted copy which has been provided to the parties.
I am satisfied, on the basis of that affidavit, that it is necessary to make these orders by reason of [s 8(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sda2004210/s8.html) (necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice); and [s 8(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sda2004210/s8.html) (necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security) of the [Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/).
With the exception of the orders in prayers 3, 4 and 5 of the notice of motion, no time limitation is expressed. The orders in prayers 3, 4 and 5 are sought "until further order" with a view to their being made as interim orders pursuant to [s 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s10.html) of the [Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/).
In deciding the period for which an order is to operate I am obliged to ensure that the order operates for no longer than is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose for which it is made. I am satisfied, on the basis of the material in Mr Phelan's affidavit that it is not presently feasible to predict how long the orders need to be in place, although one can envisage a time in the future when the matters referred to might become part of common knowledge in which case these orders will no longer be required. However, on the basis of current information, I do not propose to specify a period for which the orders are to operate with the exception of orders 3, 4 and 5.
Accordingly, I propose, pursuant to the [Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/), to make the orders set out in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the notice of motion with the following amendments: * (1) Paragraph 2.1 is amended to read: "The fact of the existence of the technical means to obtain those protected images"; 
To paragraph 6 I shall add the words:  "or any photograph contained within the protected image".
I will read the orders on to the record because I note that there are persons in the courtroom who will be bound by the orders and who, accordingly, need to be made aware of the terms of the orders.

Orders

I direct the Commissioner to forward to my chambers and to the legal representatives for the Crown and the accused a redacted version of the documents referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the orders I have just made with a view to the order being reviewed to ensure that the non-publication is as limited as is necessary to protect the interests concerned.
I note that all images sought to be tendered by the Crown fall within paragraph 1. And, accordingly, are protected images.
