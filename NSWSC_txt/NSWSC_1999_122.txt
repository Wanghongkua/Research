JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On application to reconsider matters in judgment of 18 February 1999) HIS HONOUR: A further application has been made on behalf of the defendant framed in terms of a request that I reconsider the matters referred to in paragraph 3(i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of the ruling I gave on 18 February 1999.
 In support of that application Mr Nicholas rehearses in effect all that had been put to me on those issues by Mr Wheelhouse who has argued the matter on February.
 The ruling I gave on 18 February speaks for itself. I decline to give any of those matters further consideration.
