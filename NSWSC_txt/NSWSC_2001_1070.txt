Judgment on defendants "Expert" Form Objections-Statements of Mr Maconochie  The defendants have mounted a number of objections to sections of Mr
Maconochie's statements based upon the submission that these sections constitute bare assertions/lack of reasoning process.  The objections are identified in the schedules marked for identification D (1), 229 (1), 230 (1), 231(1).  The requirements for admissibility under section 79 were summarised in the judgment on the expertise of Mr Maconochie where the principles were set out.
The principles have been further clarified in the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd versus Sprowles (2001] NSWCA 305 (delivered on 4 September 2001) where Heydon JA refers to a number of the relevant authorities and summarises the essential propositions.  In the present proceedings there is often a narrow line between on the one hand, a ruling which would reject a section of a paragraph on the bases summarised in the judgment of Heydon JA , and on the other hand permitting the exercise to become an unacceptable vehicle for permitting the defendants by a backdoor route, to effectively cross-examine the witness.  I have endeavoured to keep a close eye upon this important distinction in the following rulings in a difficult area. The rulings are set out in the schedules to this judgment.  MFI D225(1) is a schedule prepared by the defendants summarising certain objections described as "Expert" Form Objections to the fifth statement of Mr
Maconochie. A copy of MFI D 225(1) is annexed to this judgment.  In my view none of the objections are of substance. Subject to the following matter, each paragraph is allowed. I note however that so much of Page 2 of
MFI D225(1) as relates an objection to paragraphs 10.1 - 10.5 has apparently earlier been dealt with on 22 October 2001.  MFI D225(2) is a further schedule prepared by the defendants summarising certain objections described as "Expert" Form Objections to the sixth statement of Mr Maconochie. A copy of MFI D225(2) is annexed to this judgment.  
As to issue 6.1 - Paragraph 8.2(ix) the ruling is 'Res/Leave'.  
As to issue 6.2 - The ruling is Res/Leave for paragraph 8.3  
As to issue 6.3 - The ruling is Res/Leave for paragraphs 8.2 (v), 8.5 - 8.7  
As to issue 6.4 - Paragraph 9.2.3 (a)-(e) are not pressed to the extent that they deal with regulatory authorities in Canada and UK.  
Paragraph 9.2.3 (a)-(c) - Res/Leave  
Paragraph 9.2.3 (d)-(e) - Allow 
Paragraph 9.2.3 (h) - Allow  
As to issue 6.5 - Paragraph 9.2.4 is rejected  
As to issue 6.6 - Paragraph 9.5 is allowed only on the basis that it is a convenient summary of the earlier evidence of Mr Maconochie  
As to issue 6.7 - The plaintiff accepts a ruling that to the extent that this evidence related to the Asia Pacific region it should be rejected. That is the ruling. The plaintiff apparently presses the last paragraph and the exhibit so far as it relates to USA, Australia and New Zealand. Hence, to that extent is allowed. 
Otherwise paragraph 9.6 is allowed and leave to supplement is granted.  
Save as aforesaid - the whole of the sixth statement is allowed.  MFI D 231(1) identifies the objections to Mr Maconochie's statement in reply to Mr Macpherson of 4 July 2001. Subject to a question which requires further attention, the rulings are as set out in the marked schedule appended. The question which I have in mind concerns whether the recent judgment disallowing
Mr Maconochie' opinions in relation to the similar or equivalent functionality issue may now mean that the defendants have an altogether different substantive objection to any parts of Mr Maconochie's statement reply to Mr
Macpherson of 4 July 2001 which if allowed might allow Mr Maconochie to give evidence on the area where his opinions have been disallowed. Hence these rulings may have to be the subject of further address and leave is reserved to the defendants to re-open the rulings on MFI 231(1) on this basis only.  MFI D249 identifies the objections to Mr Maconochie's affidavit sworn 2
June 1999. The rulings are set out in the attached schedule.  
I certify that paragraphs 1 - 10  are a true copy of the reasons  for judgment herein of the 
Hon. Justice Einstein  given on 16 November 2001

B Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie provides statistics relating to the size of the Australian superannuation market and of the various sectors of that market.

Mr Maconochie does not explain how it would be reasonable to assume some proportion of the bonds and shares markets will be channelled through AUSMAQ, nor how AUSMAQ could attract high profile broker-dealers such as E*Trade. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain what the term "disproportionately high share" of the market in shares and bonds means, nor how AUSMAQ would capture such a share.
 
Allow  .3 
Growth rate of superannuatio-n, mutual funds and individual securities markets.

D20 Australian financial services markets generally .10.2, 9.11-9.14 th and 7th paragraphs of 9.10.2, other paragraphs in their entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie states that AUSMAQ should be able to convert a "disproportionately high share of the market in individual securities" onto
AUSMAQ's books and that this should produce a rate of growth for AUSMAQ in these markets at least as great as the rate of growth he predicts for AUSMAQ in the superannuation market. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why this growth in the equities and bonds markets should equate to the predicted growth of AUSMAQ in the superannuation market.

Ability of AUSMAQ to contest the retail and wholesale markets for mutual funds, shares and bonds

AUSMAQ 2003 market share.

D20 Australian financial services markets generally .15, 9.24-9.27 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
In paragraph 9.15 Mr Maconochie states a niche market outcome equates to a market share of about 5%, while a mass market outcome equates to a share of up to 50%. He does not state why either market position should equate to such a percentage share, other than to say that 50% would be the highest sustainable level without opening a business up to a monopoly action. 
In paragraph 9.24 he states that ASGARD has a market share of about 16% and that this is the outcome AUSMAQ would be facing in 2003 had it not achieved mass market dominance. He provides no basis for this claim. 
In paragraphs 9.25-9.27 he states that if AUSMAQ continues its current performance against its competitors it could become a niche leader by 2003 and achieve a market share of 15%. He states that the delay in commercialising the service has allowed competitors to enter the market and therefore market share would be restricted to this amount. He concludes that a mass market position would amount to a 50% share of the Australian superannuation and individual asset markets. Mr Maconochie makes clear only the upper limits of AUSMAQ's alleged potential and does not explain how AUSMAQ could reach a market share of either 15% or 50%.

Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie does not explain how AUSMAQ has successfully penetrated the master fund market, which master funds became AUSMAQ's customers and which elements of the marketplace appreciated AUSMAQ's role as a settlement agent and in what way. Mr Maconochie does not explain what services AUSMAQ could offer smaller master trusts so that they may "exit the difficult functional activities easily performed by the AUSMAQ Service" nor how or why they would evolve into non-financial intermediaries or continue on as IFAs.

Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
In paragraph 9.33, Mr Maconochie does not explain how AUSMAQ could be distributed through non-IFA groups and internet portals.  
In paragraph 9.35, Mr Maconochie does not explain how his discussions with
Star Systems or E*Trade or his "general observations of the public awareness of on-line services" make is reasonable to believe AUSMAQ could have been developed so as to offer distribution via cable and the internet.  
In paragraph 1 of 9.36, Mr Maconochie does not state why he considers NMG's strategy to be risky, nor how AUSMAQ could have achieved the suggested market shares if his approach was preferred.  
In the remainder of 9.36, Mr Maconochie does not state why the above factors would lead to AUSMAQ being supplanted by IFA groups and emulators of AUSMAQ, nor why this situation would lead to low market share.  
In paragraph 9.37, Mr Maconochie does not state why the alleged failure to develop the AUSMAQ IP would make it difficult to keep pace with market needs and demands.

In paragraph 11.10, Mr Maconochie does not explain why "it would have been a straightforward matter to meet the RBA's needs with AUSMAQ as it then existed."

Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie asserts throughout these paragraphs that AUSMAQ could have acted as a settlement agent in the Australian and New Zealand markets for payments, cash management, debt securities, foreign exchange, insurance and shares and in the Australian market only for land titles and electricity. He claims that
AUSMAQ would have earned substantial revenue from each of these markets. In none of these cases does he address the issue of how AUSMAQ would have done this or why it would have been needed or why it would have succeeded.

Value of NZ settlement markets, 50% error margin 
D13 Australian payments market .49 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie states that a reasonable approach to sizing the revenue potential of NZ settlement markets is to estimate a gross revenue of 15% of similar Australian markets. He provides no analysis in support of this statement and applies the method in a blanket fashion across all product markets without discussion of its relevance to each. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why it is reasonable to allow a range 50% either side of his estimate of settlement revenues. Further, he does not explain why, when incorporating these figures into later damages calculations he includes only the upper estimate, including the 50% increase.

Services and calculates a performance bonus allegedly payable by taking a .5% share of these revenues. 
He makes no attempt to analyse the figures in any way that would be required for a bona fide calculation of the performance bonus. His calculations amount to assertions of the value of these bonuses without transparent reasoning.

Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Inter alia: 
In pars 22-23, Mr Maconochie does not explain how Mr MacPherson has failed to consider the AUSMAQ Service as defined in JM2 and JM3, commenting on two aspects only (products and customer-centricity). Mr Maconochie does not explain why the AUSMAQ Service was not limited to the tradeables described by
Mr MacPherson in his assumptions (see his par 1.2(c)), simply repeating part of his Second Statement (without identifying where it is from in that statement) and referring generally to the Consulting Agreement and AUSMAQ
Client Service Agreement. In par 23, Mr Maconochie does not explain how it follows that Mr MacPherson has ignored the customer-centric nature of the
AUSMAQ Service, from the simple fact that in a part of Mr MacPherson's assumptions about the AUSMAQ Service (his pars 1.2(d)-(e)) he does not "define
Customers (or Clients) as the principals". In any event, Mr MacPherson does note the facility for some products to be accessed directly by the investor;  
In par 26.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain why the assumptions made by Mr
MacPherson in par 1.2 are incomplete in comparison to AUSMAQ's functionality as set out in his Second and Third Statements. Nor does he explain what functionality he says AUSMAQ would have had at 15 January 2000; 
In pars 26.3 and 73.1, Mr Maconochie does not explain how and why AUSMAQ's functionality was not limited to that described in his Second and Third statements; 
In par 26.4, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Mr MacPherson's report has to be based on a description of AUSMAQ that could be independently verified by a due diligence examination in January 2000, if it is to have validity. Equally,
Mr Maconochie's report would lack validity on this criterion.

Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain how, if AUSMAQ lacked a functionality that the
Bank Services possessed at the time of his Second and Third Statements, it could have been modified and enhanced so as to be similar or equivalent by 15
January 2000 (or to meet target markets generally - see par 26.2).

The identification of the functionality of computerised (or partially computerised) services or programmes in the financial services industry , Appendix C (subpars (1), (2) & (3), Appendix C (as marked up in MFI document) 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Inter alia: 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why he makes a distinction, in relation to target markets and superannuation, between a self-managed superannuation target market and a general superannuation market; 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why different facilities are needed to address these markets, or what these facilities are. He does not explain how the facilities enable target customer segments to participate in the target markets, and what these are. Similarly, in relation to products, Mr Maconochie does not specify what these are for each of the markets, and how they "are the subject of the [distinct] target markets"; 
In relation to distribution media for the Service, Mr Maconochie does not explain how and why they would have included "dealers across a spectrum of financial planning intermediaries who offer comprehensive planning and investment advice to individuals and groups of individuals ..., stockbrokers, discount brokers and execution-only managed funds intermediaries and service resellers".

RM.4 Relationship between Bank Services

The identification of the functionality of computerised (or partially computerised) services or programmes in the financial services industry 
Second par 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain how the Remote Wealth Creation Service and the
Independence One Service were subsumed into other Bank Services (Operation
First Choice, Margin Lending and Gateway), or why the need to separately identify them disappeared. Nor does he explain how they overlapped with
Gateway and Operation First Choice. 
Mr Maconochie also does not explain why the target market and target customer segment identified the Independence One Service more than the functionality of the Service and which market and customers could be addressed by the various services embodied in Operation First Choice.

Appendix C (as marked up in MFI document) 
Conclusion, bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Inter alia: 
In pars 13.4, 70-71 and C1.7, Mr Maconochie does not explain why FEM is not relevant as a methodology to determine whether two services are similar but is applicable to determine whether a description of a service is internally consistent, relevant and complete; 
In pars 69.2 and C1.4, Mr Maconochie concludes that Mr MacPherson is using FEM for the first time, simply from the fact that Mr MacPherson allegedly gives no evidence that this is the commonly used name in the industry for this method; 
In pars 69.3 and C1.5, Mr Maconochie does not explain the basis of his view that FEM is not commonly used in industry (if at all) to compare two services and that Mr MacPherson's report is the first such use; 
In pars 69.4 and C1.6, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Mr MacPherson's use of FEM "to evaluate the functionality of a computerised service ...", applies to a manual-type service that has been computerised. Nor does he explain why
AUSMAQ is not such a service.

Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Inter alia: 
In pars 73 and 73.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain why FCM is not a valid methodology. Although he refers to 'reasons' given in pars 53-72, these do not relate to FCM - in any event, they are subject to the same objections as apply to his comments on FEM (set out above); 
In par 73.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain how application of FCM to Mr
MacPherson's examples can yield inconsistent and unreliable results; 
In pars 73 and 73.3, Mr Maconochie also does not explain why, if FCM is not a valid methodology, this necessarily renders Mr MacPherson's criticisms of Mr
Maconochie's own methodology invalid (eg, the criticisms referred to in pars .1, 73.4); 
In par 73.4, Mr Maconochie does not explain why re-ordering and re-grouping the functional items in the comparison tables in his Second and Third
Statements would make no difference to the results; 
In par 73.1, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Mr MacPherson is incorrect in his criticism that Mr Maconochie merely sought to show how each Bank Service emulated the AUSMAQ Service rather than undertaking a comprehensive qualitative comparison.

RM.7 Validity and application of Description of the Service, comprising six categories

Comparisons of the functionality of computerised (or partially computerised) services and/or programmes , 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.2, 42.1, 43.1, 43.2, 45.2, 50, 51, 57, 59.1-59.3, , 61, 62.1 65, Appendix A, Appendix C (entirety), 29 (sub-par (2)), 31-32 (entirety), 33 (last two sentences), 34 (third par), 35.2 (all except the first par and first sentence of the second par), 35.3 (all except the last par), 36.2 (last par), 36.3-36.4 (entirety), -38 (entirety), 42.1 (entirety), 43.1-43.2 (entirety), 45.2 (last par), 48 (as marked up in MFI document), 50 (first line of second par and second and third sentences of third par), 51 (entirety), 57 (last sentence), 59.1 (first two lines of third par), 59.2-59.3 (entirety), 60 (entirety), 61 (last six lines of second par), 62.1 (entirety), 65 (entirety), Appendix A (see markedup
MFI document), Appendix C (see marked up MFI document) 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Inter alia: 
In par 61, Mr Maconochie does not explain why he says the common practice of describing services using six categories, does not extend to making correlations between services; 
In pars 32 and 61, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Mr MacPherson's
Description of the Service, divided into six categories, is not the only one that could be used; 
In pars 28 and 31, Mr Maconochie does not explain why to say that "functionality of a service" refers to "description of the service" is a circular description; 
In pars 32 and A3.11, Mr Maconochie does not explain how Mr MacPherson has not correctly employed his Description of the Service; 
In par 42.1, Mr Maconochie does not explain why the need for the six categories to be considered individually and in aggregate differs from Mr
MacPherson's analysis. Nor does he explain why it follows from Mr MacPherson's par 4.1.10 that he has used his six category description for the first time in his report; 
In pars 29(2), 31, 43.1, 43.2, 45.2, 50, 51, 59.2, 57, 59.3, 60, 62.1, C1.2,
C3.4 and C3.6-3.7, Mr Maconochie does not explain why business functions and system processes are not relevant to description of the service. In par 43.1, he refers to "reasons" in pars [27-29. Pars 27-28] do not relate to this subject matter and par 29 contains assertions rather than reasoning (ie, because system processes support the functionality of a service); 
In par 48, Mr Maconochie distinguishes between functions and processes (a process appears to be the method by which a function is achieved and is irrelevant to the description of the function), but fails to explain how this affects Mr MacPherson's six categories of description or renders unreliable the results of his comparisons. Nor does Mr Maconochie explain why he believes that in the Consulting Agreement, two services may be similar or equivalent irrespective of the processes used to achieve the functionality; 
In par 50, Mr Maconochie does not explain why he says that not all the results of the iterative process (of identifying the description of the service, the business functions and systems processes) are relevant in identifying functionality; 
In par 43.2, Mr Maconochie does not demonstrate where there is confusion in Mr
MacPherson's description of the service between what functionality is to be delivered, why, and how. Nor does he explain how this is a flaw and why it follows that any resulting comparison is unreliable; 
In par 33, Mr Maconochie does not explain why certain examples of business objectives of a strategic nature are "more of a tactical nature and related to the achievement of a strategic objective", or the distinction he is making between use of the words 'strategic' and 'tactical'; 
In pars 34, 35.2-35.3, 36.2-36.4, 37-38 and Appendix A (eg, A5.1), Mr
Maconochie disagrees with Mr MacPherson's definitions of the categories of description (such as purpose of a service, key features, products, target market and distribution channels), but does not explain how the distinctions he (Mr Maconochie) makes impinge on the result of Mr MacPherson's comparisons so as to make them unreliable; 
In par 35.2, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Mr MacPherson's description of "Key features" "betrays ... a confusion of loyalties and focus between the objectives of the supplier of a service and the supplier's products and the objectives and needs of the customers of the service." Nor does he explain (in .3(4)) how Mr MacPherson's definition of key features leads to an unreliable result in any comparison; 
In par 65 and Appendix A, Mr Maconochie does not explain why his modifications of Mr MacPherson's six categories of description make them complete and unambiguous.

Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Inter alia: 
In pars 59.2, 59.3, 62.1, 62.3 and C1.2, Mr Maconochie does not explain why, if a service is shown to have a similar or equivalent correlation to another service at the level of first order description (here, the level of description of the service), then that is the proper conclusion and there is no need to resort to lower order analysis (here, the level of business functions and system processes); 
In par 59.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain why, to the extent that certain functions, functional categories and groups that are relevant, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive do not fit in the Description of the
Service, it is deficient and other categories must be added; 
In par 59.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain why all information available at the second level should be able to be categorised at the first level.

Inter alia: 
In pars 53.1-53.3 and C1.1, Mr Maconochie does not explain what effect a failure to distinguish between fixed-point-of-reference similarity and reciprocal similarity has on the results of Mr MacPherson's comparisons between services; 
In par 54, Mr Maconochie does not explain why, if it cannot be determined that service B is similar to service A at the Description of Service level, that can only be because there is a deficiency in the Description of the Service for one or both of the services; 
In pars 55 and 56, Mr Maconochie does not explain why, if the Description of the Service is complete, by definition it must be possible to determine whether service B is similar to service A and so consideration of business functions and system processes is irrelevant. Nor does he explain why, if consideration of business functions overturns a determination at the
Description of Service level, the particular functional item in the group of business functions should have been included at the higher Description of
Service level.

Inter alia: 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why a positive or negative comparison result based on yes/no comparisons at the functional item and category levels, each with a weighting of one unit, would be unlikely to be overturned by even extreme subjective weightings. Nor does he explain why if this occurred, some doubt must exist as to the weighting methodology. He is simply repeating material from par 65.4.

Inter alia: 
In par 76.1, Mr Maconochie does not explain why All in One is not a product that could be listed on AUSMAQ like a master fund but is a service distinct from the products it sought to list and offer customers. Nor does Mr
Maconochie explain how this is consistent with his claim that no master fund has been able to be listed on AUSMAQ, including All in One; 
In par 76.2, Mr Maconochie does not explain how Mr MacPherson has used semantics to try and show that the Bank Services are not similar and equivalent to AUSMAQ or how, if Mr MacPherson followed Mr Maconochie's methodology, he would have come to the same conclusion that Mr Maconochie reached in his Second and Third Statements; 
In par 76.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain why it is fact that the Automated
Margin Lending Service could be supported by the AUSMAQ Service under a similar if not identical service facility within the AUSMAQ Service. Nor does he explain why just because Mr MacPherson comes to an opposing view, Mr
MacPherson's analysis is unreliable; 
In par 76.5, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Mr MacPherson's conclusions as to the Bank Services are extreme, unreliable and cannot be reasonably justified by his methodology; 
In par 78.2, Mr Maconochie does not explain why Operation First Choice is not a strategy; 
In pars 78.4-78.5, Mr Maconochie does not explain how Operation First Choice could have been implemented through the AUSMAQ Service, or why it is similar and equivalent to the AUSMAQ Service.

Inter alia: 
In pars 39.1 and 41.3, Mr Maconochie does not explain how the example demonstrates blurring or ambiguity due to incorrect usage of terms such as target market. Nor does he explain how Mr MacPherson has not correctly applied the six categories of description to the example. (In paragraph 41.3, Mr
Maconochie largely repeats paragraph 39.1.); 
In par 39.2, Mr Maconochie does not explain why it matters that Mr MacPherson may have introduced "a synonym for business objectives", or why it means that
Mr MacPherson has not followed his own categorisation of description of a service; 
In par 44, Mr Maconochie does not explain why he concludes that: (1) Mr
MacPherson has attempted a comparison of business functions and system processes; and (2) it is not relevant to a comparison of the four Bank
Services with the AUSMAQ Service; 
In Appendix A, Mr Maconochie does not include the text of his footnotes; 
In par A2.4, Mr Maconochie does not explain why the inclusion in the name of the service of words which describe the access channel ("internet", "website") and purpose ("shopping") provides a bias which may inherently tend to either prejudge the outcome of the analysis or otherwise make it inherently unreliable; 
In par A2.12, Mr Maconochie does not explain why failure to distinguish between a service name identifier and a representational pointer name leads Mr
MacPherson to define functional categories that are not relevant, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

In pars 26.2, 47-48 and 51, Mr Maconochie's evidence as to what Mr MacPherson was (and was not) asked to do, is neither relevant nor admissible; 
In pars 65, 76.1 and Appendix A, Mr Maconochie does not explain why "four significant errors" which he claims Mr MacPherson makes, are fatal to the overall validity of Mr MacPherson's methodology and report. The alleged errors are: (i) lack of a distinction between business objectives, business purposes, business systems and processes and lack of a distinction between a "service name identifier" and a "representational pointer name" (par 65.1, A2.2-A2.13,
A3.3-A3.5); (ii) lack of a distinction between functional items and functional categories (par 65.2); (iii) lack of a distinction between fixed-point-of- reference similarity and reciprocal similarity (par 65.3, A4.1-A4.5); and (iv) the relationship between yes/no comparisons and relative weightings (par 6.4,

Reason for Objection  ---|---|---  .1 
Definition, description and comparison of "infomediary" and "market system service" concepts.

D3 
United States Financial Services .5-9.10 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process/lack of transparency in use of secondary materials 
Mr Maconochie states that "infomediaries" (from the Hagel and Singer book Net
Worth) and "market system services" (a term he has coined for systems such as
AUSMAQ) are the same concept, and seeks to draw conclusions as to AUSMAQ's attractiveness to its target markets. 
Mr Maconochie fails to define the terms "infomediary" and "market system service", then concludes that market system services and infomediaries are the same concept without providing any explanation. It is therefore impossible to test his overall conclusions that predicted success for infomediaries equates to likely success for AUSMAQ and that AUSMAQ will earn the type of revenues that infomediaries are allegedly capable of earning.  .2

D3 
United States Financial Services .14, 9.15, 9.18-9.20 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process/lack of transparency in use of secondary materials 
Mr Maconochie quotes at length from The Cerulli Reports and concludes each of these paragraphs with a conclusion about AUSMAQ's prospects in the US markets drawn from the quoted passages. 
In each case, the conclusion does not flow from the quoted material.  .3 
Comparison of AUSMAQ with "service agents".

D3 
United States Financial Services .33, 9.44, 9.54-9.71 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
In paragraphs 9.33 and 9.44 Mr Maconochie describes the characteristics and charging process of US "service agents". He states that AUSMAQ offered a similar service to these organisations but that it was their charging structure that represented a weakness in the service agent model capable of being exploited by AUSMAQ. 
These opinions underpin the development of the remainder of Mr Maconochie's arguments in relation to AUSMAQ's chances of success in the US market, set out in paragraphs 9.54-9.71. The essence of this argument is that service agents currently account for a large share of the US mutual fund market but AUSMAQ is capable of offering a similar service but with a more attractive pricing structure and AUSMAQ will therefore become the dominant player when more "developed" services replace service agents in the future, thus entitling
AUSMAQ to a market share and consequent revenues on par with the largest service agent in the US market at present. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain in what sense the services offered by AUSMAQ and service agents are the same, nor why AUSMAQ's charging process is a source or advantage over service agents. Accordingly, his entire US analysis rests on a logical foundation which cannot be tested.  .4 
Global commercialisation of AUSMAQ.

D4 
Structure, operation and size of worldwide financial markets .1-10.5 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie sets out global financial revenues by segment, including segments such as insurance, foreign exchange, mortgages, loans etc. He claims that these markets could have been addressed by AUSMAQ and that this may lead to an underestimation of AUSMAQ's revenue potential of 25%. 
Mr Maconochie does not set out any reasoning process as to how AUSMAQ could have been commercialised so as to address these markets.  .5 
Analogy between AUSMAQ and a game of sport.

D20 
Financial services markets generally .1-11.1.5 
Entirety 
Irrelevant/undue waste of time 
Mr Maconochie sets out a lengthy analogy between AUSMAQ and a game of sport played in a stadium. It is not relevant to any issue in dispute between the parties, nor to the balance of the evidence presented in the statement and is also an undue waste of time.  .6 
Identification of AUSMAQ's market share in Australia and the US.

D7 
Valuation of financial services businesses .1.6-11.1.12 
Entirety 
Bare assertion/lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie sets out a list of companies from around the world that he believes are capable of operating as a mass market leader in "market system services" such as AUSMAQ, and an assessment of how many niche players may emerge in the same market. On the basis of this he calculates the chance of
NMG/AUSMAQ being either a mass market leader, niche leader or niche "also ran" in this market and in turn calculates the market share he believes NMG/AUSMAQ would most likely achieve on the basis of these calculations. He then compares this to market shares held by other organisations and with the forecast market shares for "infomediaries" (see 9.5-9.10 above). 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why the companies selected (apart from NAB) have business which are "close cousins" to market system services. He does not explain why these and no other companies would be able to compete in this market. He does not explain why he believes a fourth contender will emerge, nor who that contender is. He does not explain why only five companies would aspire for a niche leadership role not who those companies might be nor why they would not be the same companies as aspired to the mass market leadership role. He does not explain why the mass market leader would have a 50% market share, why the niche leader would have a 15% market share, nor why a "niche contender" would be entitled to a 5% market share. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why the companies he has selected as comparators for his end result are valid points of comparison, nor why it is appropriate to compare his results to the predicted market shares of infomediaries.

Reason for Objection  ---|---|---  .1 Uniqueness of AUSMAQ's competitive advantage 
D20 & D5 
Australian and NZ financial services generally .2(ix) 
Entirety 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie provides no reasoning in support of his assertion that NMG and the AUSMAQ Service had a unique competitive advantage in Australia and New
Zealand due to the absence of any regulatory barriers and due to the possession of a unique exemption from the Australian Securities Commission. He does not explain how a unique competitive advantage arises from an ASC exemption - it does not necessarily follow. 
Mr Maconochie's conclusion that it would have been reasonable and practicable to implement the 1997 Business Plan for Australia and NZ because of the matters set out in 8.2(i)-(ix), is thus based in part on bare assertion.  .2 
Prospects for AUSMAQ Service had the 1997 Business Plan been implemented

Entirety 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain how he concludes had the 1997 Business Plan been implemented diligently and efficiently, the AUSMAQ Service would have had particular service features and the chance to gain and occupy a substantial market position, largely unopposed, in addressable markets. He does not specify particular service features, nor explain how and why these would give
AUSMAQ such a high chance. The portions of other statements and documents referred to in par 8.3 do not disclose anything like a reasoning process in support of this proposition.  .3 Assessment of JMG's Business Plans 
D20 & D5 
Australian and NZ financial services generally .2(v), 8.5-8.7 .2(v) (entirety), 8.5-8.6 (last two pars of each), 8.7 (last par) 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
In 8.2(v), Mr Maconochie does not explain how JMG's planned system developments could have been done with relative ease ("the degree of difficulty being much less and certainly no more than" that taken by JMG to establish the then existing system). Mr Maconochie's conclusion that it would have been reasonable and practicable to implement the 1997 Business Plan for
Australia and NZ because of the matters set out in 8.2(i)-(ix), is thus based in part on bare assertion. 
In 8.5-8.6, Mr Maconochie does not explain why it would have been reasonable and practicable to implement the 1998 and 1999 Business Plans for Australia and NZ due to the matters set out in 8.2(i)-(ix). See objection to 8.2(v), above. Mr Maconochie repeats the substance of 8.3. See objection to 8.3 above. 
Nor does he explain how, if the 1999 Business Plan been implemented diligently and efficiently, some of the "ground" lost through not implementing the 1997 and 1998 Business plans could have been gained and the loss of further ground prevented. Implicit in this is the further unsupported assertion that failing to implement the 1997 and 1998 Business Plans "lost ground". What Mr
Maconochie means by reference to 'losing ground' is also not explained. 
In par 8.7, Mr Maconochie does not explain why it was reasonable and practicable for JMG's recommendations in its report of 15 February 1999 to be implemented simply because they restated elements of the 1997, 1998 and 1999
Business Plans, which in turn were reasonable for the reasons in 8.1.2, 8.5 and 8.6. None of these paragraphs provides a reasoning process of this kind.
Paragraph 8.1.2 is directed at 1997 and contains no reasoning for why the 1997
Business Plan (or part of it) should have been implemented in 1999.  .4 Prospects for market entry in mid-1998

Japanese/ Taiwanese/ Hong Kong financial services. United States financial services .2.1(c), 9.2.3(a)-(e), 9.2.3(g)-(h) 
Entirety 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process. 
In par 9.2.1(c), Mr Maconochie does not explain why the 1997 and 1998 Business
Plans for Europe formulated by JMG were reasonable, without any further explanation. 
In pars 9.2.3(a)-(e), as the First Plaintiff agrees, many parts simply restate the evidence of Mr Joslin (eg, 9.2.3(a), 9.2.3(b) (first par)). This is repetitive and an undue waste of the Court's time, particularly as evidence relating to dealings with UK regulatory authorities is no longer pressed. 
The First Plaintiff presses sections of pars 9.2.3(a)-(e) which deal with regulatory authorities in North America [sic - the USA], Australia and New
Zealand, but no longer presses those which deal with regulatory authorities in
Canada, the UK and elsewhere. Consequently, pars 9.2.3(a), (b), (c) and (e) should be rejected. Par 9.2.3(d), should be rejected to the extent of the reference to Canada and the UK, at the least. 
In par 9.2.3(b), Mr Maconochie does not explain how or why, independently of
Mr Joslin's evidence, the UK regulatory environment would be favourable to
AUSMAQ/ EUROMAQ nor how and why approvals would have been obtained without substantial difficulty and with reasonable effort. The quoted material from Mr
Joslin's statement does not go so far as to support the broader conclusion of
Mr Maconochie. 
In par 9.2.3(d), Mr Maconochie does not explain what dealings he has had with regulatory authorities in New Zealand, Australia and the United States (other than to point to the dates of the application for exemption from the ASC, and subsequent exemption), which support the conclusion that giving authorities as much lead time and information as possible allows an approval to be issued almost immediately an application is made. 
In par 9.2.3(e), Mr Maconochie does not explain how this approach was successfully used in New Zealand. 
The First Plaintiff presses par 9.2.3(g) to the extent that actual matters within Mr Maconochie's knowledge are stated. However, Mr Maconochie does not explain what regulatory approvals were necessary in the UK, nor what indications were in favour of SIB processing EUROMAQ's application and issuing these approvals so as to enable the start of EUROMAQ operations in June 1998. 
In par 9.2.3(h), Mr Maconochie does not explain why there would have been no difficulty in securing the services of a Depositee and Custodian on favourable terms for the EUROMAQ Service. The only foundation he gives for this conclusion regarding the Depositee, is a report of Mr Hume concerning one entity which was said to be "interested in Euromaq and investigating potential roles as Depositee, Custodian, Product provider and Distributor". Mr
Maconochie's conclusion does not follow from this. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why the entities he mentions would have been suitable candidates for these roles, or why they would be interested in the proposition.  .5 Prospects for market entry in January 2001 
D2 
UK and European financial services .2.4 
Entirety 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process 
In par 9.2.4(a), Mr Maconochie does not explain why it follows that, if NAB and NMG had immediately implemented the JMG Report of 15 February 1999, it would have been possible for AUSMAQ to start operations in Europe within 2 years (ie, by about January 2001). 
In par 9.2.4(b), Mr Maconochie does not explain why it is not possible for
EUROMAQ to be established and operate successfully (or nearly as successfully) as it would have done. 
In par 9.2.4(c), Mr Maconochie merely repeats material from par 2.5 of Mr
Joslin's statement. He then states that E*Trade would have been a competitor to AUSMAQ at 1 January 2001, without explaining why. 
In par 9.2.4(d), Mr Maconochie does not explain why, in the absence of immediate action, there are no prospects for EUROMAQ.  .6 
Mr Joslin's assumptions 
D2 
UK and European financial services .5 
Entirety 
Conclusion, bare assertion, lack of transparent reasoning process 
Mr Maconochie concludes that had the JMG Business Plans been implemented, the facts and matters assumed by Mr Joslin would have materialised. By way of reasoning or support for this conclusion, he simply refers to pars 8.1.2, 8.5, .6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9 and 8.10. These do not directly and clearly address the issue and lead to an undue waste of time as the reader attempts to ascertain what parts, if any, of 8.1.2, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 (and the further documents to which they in turn refer) are relevant.  .7 Evaluation of general prospects in North America and Asia Pacific 
D1 and D3 
Japanese/ Taiwanese/ Hong Kong financial services  
United States financial services .6 
Entirety 
Bare assertion, lack of reasoning process 
The First Plaintiff now agrees that to the extent that this evidence relates to the Asia Pacific region, it should be rejected. 
The First Plaintiff presses the last paragraph and the Exhibit to which it refers, in so far as it relates to North America [sic - USA?], Australia and
New Zealand. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why the ability of NMG to exploit the AUSMAQ
Service and the AUSMAQ IP to their full potential in North America and Asia
Pacific was, and is, dependent on the implementation of the 1997, 1998 and Business Plans. He does not explain what such exploitation would involve, and why it is the sole route to success in those markets. His reference to
North America (here, and as discussed below) cannot be admitted, given that this case concerns only the United States and he has no expertise in relation to Canada. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain how and why completion of the system development component of the Plan was a prerequisite to the implementation of the Business Plan for the AUSMAQ Service in Australia and NZ as well as for
Europe and, probably North America and Asia Pacific. 
Mr Maconochie does not explain why it was reasonable to expect that Business
Plans which had as their objective the development of the AUSMAQ Service to its full global potential would include plans for the Service in North America and Asia Pacific, as well as Europe, simply because of the size and applicability of the addressable markets in those regions. In this regard he refers to Exhibit 57 in his Fifth Statement, which should not be admitted based on His Honour's earlier rulings. Apart from this, Mr Maconochie does not here identify markets, nor give his reasoning as to why those markets are applicable and addressable, nor give his reasoning as to their sizes.
