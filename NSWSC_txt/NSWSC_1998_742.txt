GRECEILA GRACE JOTA versus LEGAL & GENERAL LIFE OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED & ANOR /98 June 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Administrative Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Application is brought by the plaintiff to appeal from a decision of the Equal Opportunity Tribunal under the Anti Discrimination Act 1977 to this court. 
That Act provides by s.118 a right of appeal on a question of law within 21 days after the date of the decision.

It is common ground that that section affords the only right of appeal strictly so-called. It is common ground that the application to appeal was brought out of time and hence the appeal in itself, standing alone at least, is incompetent.

Application is made by Mr. Lynch on behalf of the first defendant to strike out the present proceedings. In answer to that application, counsel for the plaintiff has referred the court both to [s.65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s65.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) and additionally, has sought (on her feet) to rely on a passage from Craig v.
State of South Australia <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 163] to seek certiorari to re-open the decision of the Tribunal so that it might be ordered to undertake a duty which she contends it would then have to re-hear the matter or to further hear the matter by compelling the first defendant to call its witnesses so they might be cross-examined.

As things presently stand, the decision of the Tribunal is whole and completed and is not subject to being assailed by way of appeal since the time has expired.

Mr. Lynch has submitted that either certiorari would not lie in the light of the statutory appeal provisions or alternatively, that any discretion to issue certiorari should be exercised in his favour since the time limit during which those appeal provisions have been available has long expired.

Further, he asserts there is simply no jurisdictional error, nor any duty that might be performed by the Tribunal.

Counsel for the plaintiff has asserted that there was jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal erred, she says, in dismissing the plaintiff's complaint at the close of the evidence of the complainant, the Tribunal then being satisfied that there was no constructive dismissal and dismissing the complaint as it appears under s.111(1) of the Act which relates to, inter alia, frivolous and vexatious complaints.

Nothing has been put forward to persuade me that the Tribunal fell into any jurisdictional error such as to which certiorari might go. Had there been such an error in any event, I would have exercised such discretion as I might have had to refuse certiorari.

Section 65, it seems to me, is of little utility to the plaintiff because there is no current duty to be performed by the Tribunal and further, the plaintiff is out of time to appeal on a provision which seems to me mandatory.

In those circumstances, in my view there is no option but for this court to dismiss the summons. In the circumstances, the plaintiff is ordered to pay the costs of the first named defendant.
