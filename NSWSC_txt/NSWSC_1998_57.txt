PARK AVENUE NOMINEES PTY LIMITED versus SEARLE ROBERT McMULLEN & ANOR /97 March 1998 
Howie AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from the decision of a Master setting aside a default judgment obtained against the second respondent, Norma McMullen. A default judgment had been entered against each of the respondents and as a result a writ of possession had issued in respect of a property known as 17 Gore Street, Port Macquarie. That property was the subject of a mortgage dated 9 March 1994 between the appellant as mortgagee and the respondents as mortgagors. The mortgage was taken over the property as security for a loan of $115,000 made by the appellant to the son of the respondents. Before the Master the appellant consented to the default judgment being set aside as against the first respondent, Mr McMullen, but opposed the application to set aside the default judgement made by Mrs McMullen. 
The facts are that the respondents' son approached them in 1982 or 1983 to see whether they were prepared to mortgage the family home to secure a loan to him. They agreed to a mortgage in the sum of $30,000, being confident in his ability to repay the loan. In March 1994 Mrs McMullen was visiting her son in
Queensland. Her son told her that he was refinancing his loan from one finance company to another and he produced a mortgage which he asked her to sign. Mr
McMullen had not accompanied his wife to Queensland. When Mrs McMullen raised the need for her husband's signature on the mortgage, her son told her his signature was not required. Mrs McMullen signed the mortgage and returned it to her son. She says that at the time she signed the document there was no other person present. After she returned home, Mrs McMullen did not tell her husband that she had signed a further mortgage for her son.

Mrs McMullen is aged 72. She spent most of her life working in her family's drapery shop until she retired in 1985. She has sworn an affidavit stating that at the time that she signed the mortgage she did not know how much the loan was for as she did not read the document before signing it. In December , when she learned that the debt was not being repaid, she finally mentioned the matter to her husband. He told her that he had not signed any mortgage documents. Mr McMullen did not learn of the fact that action was being taken under the mortgage until July 1997. He made an affidavit in which he states that he never signed the mortgage document despite the fact that the mortgage purports to bear his signature and that his signature has been witnessed. The mortgage document indicates that Mrs McMullen's signature has been witnessed by an Edward Heatley although she denies that any person was present when she signed the document. There were two variations of that mortgage and a further mortgage dated 7 June 1996. Mrs McMullen denies that she signed any of those three documents although what purports to be her signature appears on each of them. There is evidence that the signatures of Mr
McMullen and of the witnesses to those signatures on those documents have been forged.

There are in evidence three Solicitors Certificates which the solicitor for the respondents received from agents for the solicitors for the appellant.
Each Certificate is in a standard form and purports to certify that certain mortgage documents were explained to the mortgagors, that the mortgagors indicated that they understood the documents and the consequence of the failure to fulfil the obligations imposed by the mortgage documents and that they signed the documents voluntarily. The first two Certificates also purport to certify that the mortgagors signed the mortgages in the presence of the solicitor giving the Certificate. The third indicates that the mortgagors were interviewed by the solicitor making the Certificate by telephone. None of the
Certificates actually refers to the respondents by name or the particular mortgage document to which they relate. There is material which tends to indicate that the first two Certificates are forgeries. The third is a genuine document signed by a solicitor.

I am prepared to accept that it can be inferred from the evidence that the appellant or its solicitor obtained the Solicitors Certificate dated 4 March in respect to the mortgage to which these proceedings relate, notwithstanding the fact that the Certificate does not refer to any particulars as to the mortgagors or the mortgaged property and that the date of the Certificate and the date of the mortgage do not correspond[1]. Although it was argued on behalf of the appellant that it could not be inferred that the Certificate had any reference to the mortgage under consideration, I think that there is material from which such an inference can be drawn. The
Certificate was sent to the respondent's solicitor by the agent of the solicitor for the appellant in respect of these proceedings. From the information that the Certificate contains it can be inferred that the
Certificate was obtained at the request of the appellant for the purposes of acting upon the mortgage document.

Upon default in the repayments under the mortgage, the appellant sought to obtain possession of the property by a statement of claim dated 13 March 1997.
Default judgement was obtained by the appellant on 16 June 1997. By notice of motion filed on 23 July 1997 the respondents sought to have that judgement set aside. As I have indicated, by agreement between the parties the default judgement was set aside so far as Mr McMullen was concerned. In the Grounds of
Defence filed on behalf of Mrs McMullen the principle defence claimed is non est factum. It is asserted in effect that she did not understand that by signing the mortgage, which she had not read, she would create a binding contract and that she never intended to enter into an agreement with the mortgagee. In the alternative it was claimed that the mortgage was unjust at the time it was made[2], or that it was unconscionable for the appellant to rely upon the mortgage by reason of the position of special disadvantage in which she was at the time of the signing the mortgage[3].

On 30 September 1997 the Master set aside the judgement in respect of Mrs
McMullen. The Master found both that there was an explanation for the delay by the respondent in filing a defence and that there was a bona fide defence on the merits disclosed by the facts relied upon by the respondent. There has been no attempt to litigate the first of those matters before me. What has been argued is that the Master was in error in finding that the evidence disclosed any defence on which the respondent should be entitled to rely. I must have regard to the discretionary nature of the decision of the Master[4] although here the matters in dispute are substantially matters of law, being whether the evidence presented would give rise to an arguable defence. The question is whether there is evidence "from which it appears that the second respondent has a defence that is fairly arguable in law or in fact and in respect to which it is desirable in the interests of justice that she should be allowed to obtain a decision from the appropriate tribunal after a hearing"5. Of course I am not to determine the merits of the defence but only whether a bona fide defence is available on the facts presented by the respondent.[6] 
The first defence upon which Mrs McMullen relies is a defence of non est factum. The Master in her judgment set out a passage from Petelin v
Cullen[7] as representing a statement of that defence. That passage is as follows: "The class of person who can avail themselves of the defence is limited. It is available to those who are unable to read owing to blindness or illiteracy and he must rely on others for advice as to what they are signing; it is also available to those who through no fault of their own are unable to have any understanding of the purport of the particular document. To make out the defence a defendant must show that he signed the document in the belief that it was radically different from what it was in fact and that, at least as against innocent persons, his failure to read and understand it was not due to carelessness on his part. Finally it is accepted that there is a heavy onus on the defendant who seeks to establish the defence."8 
The Master concluded that the defence was available on the basis that, although Mrs McMullen could not satisfy what the Master described as the "first part of blindness or illiteracy", the question whether the document was radically different was a matter to be argued at trial.

It has been made clear that the defence is to be kept within narrow limits[9] and that generally the defence will not be available to an adult of full understanding and capacity [10] particularly where such a person signs what on its face appears to be a legal document[11]. It is also clear that there is a heavy onus on a person to satisfy the defence[12]. Crucial to the availability of that defence in circumstances as here, where the document is signed by a person of apparent full understanding and capacity, is the belief that the person had about the document which the person signed. The person has to show that he or she believed the document to be radically different from what it was[13]..

The Master seems to have reached her decision on an assumption as to the belief held by Mrs McMullen as to the nature or content of the document she signed. The only evidence from Mrs McMullen is that she did not read the mortgage before signing it and did not know the principal sum secured by the mortgage. There is no doubt that she knew it was a mortgage and there is no evidence that she did not understand the nature of a mortgage or the obligation it imposed upon her. Rather the evidence is to the contrary as she had previously been party with her husband to a mortgage over the very same property in favour of her son. It appears that she had sufficient presence of mind and understanding of the document to raise with her son the need for her husband's signature on the document.

Although Mrs McMullen states that her son told her that he was refinancing his loan, there is nothing in either of her two affidavits as to what she believed about the terms of the mortgage which she signed. It appears she never gave the matter any thought because she trusted her son. The overwhelming conclusion is that the amount of the loan was irrelevant to her;- she did not know what was the amount secured by the mortgage and was not concerned to read the document or to ask her son[14]. If she formed no belief as to the terms of the document at all, then the defence is not available to her[15]. She has the onus of showing the facts upon which any defence would be based and the defence of non est factum requires clear and positive evidence before it can be established[16]. In my opinion in the absence of any evidence as to the belief of Mrs McMullen about what she was signing, and in particular as to the amount of the mortgage, the facts in evidence do not give rise to the defence.
There is no need to consider this defence further but in deference to the arguments before me and the Master's decision I will refer to the matters canvassed before me.

Even assuming in Mrs McMullen's favour that it could be inferred from the fact that her son told her that he was refinancing the loan that she believed that the mortgage was in the same terms as the previous mortgage (that is assuming that she understood "refinancing" to mean simply the substitution of one mortgage for another) it does not follow that the defence is open simply because she was wrong in that belief. I am prepared to accept that a mistake about the principal sum in a mortgage may be capable of giving rise to the defence. It seems that since the decision in Saunders versus Anglia Building
Society[17], the distinction between the character of the document and its contents is no longer, if it ever were, a valid distinction when determining whether the document signed was not what it was thought to be.
Rather the test now to be applied is whether the difference between the document as it was and as it was thought to be is radical or substantial considering the document as a whole[18]. A radical difference in the practical effect of the document can be sufficient[19].

But the matter is not determined merely by a consideration of the difference between what Mrs McMullen believed the document to be and what it was. It is clear from the passage cited from Petelin versus Culen, above, that this belief will not afford a defence against an innocent party, unless the person relying upon the defence can show that the failure to read and understand the document was not due to his or her carelessness. The High Court has stressed the fundamental importance of the person signing the document taking reasonable precautions to ascertain the character of the document to be signed when the defence is asserted against an innocent party who relies upon the document and its signature[20]. There was no finding by the Master that the appellant was not an innocent party[21].. No fraud by the appellant was asserted in the statements of defence filed on behalf of Mrs McMullen.

Carelessness when used in this context does not mean negligence as it is known in the law of tort but it is "a mere failure to take reasonable precautions in ascertaining the character of a document before signing it"22. I accept that whether an action was careless will generally be a matter for resolution on the particular facts, but I cannot see how it could be asserted by Mrs
McMullen that she was not careless in relation to her failure to read the document or even make inquiry as to the terms of the mortgage. It has generally been accepted that a person of full capacity and understanding who does not read a legal document relying upon a lawyer or another person upon who that person reposes trust cannot be heard to say that he or she was not careless[23]. On the evidence before the Master there was in my view no possible defence of non est factum available because Mrs McMullen could not show that she was not careless in signing the mortgage document without reading it or attempting to find out its terms. She knew its import and it is no answer to say her trust in her son was displaced.

Before me counsel for Mrs McMullen placed great weight upon the Solicitors
Certificates to assert that the appellant knew or must have known that there was something untoward in the signing of the mortgage and, therefore, should not be regarded as innocent. But I cannot see how the Certificates can have any bearing on the question of whether the document admittedly signed by Mrs
McMullen should be held against her. There is no possible basis for suggesting that Mrs McMullen's son was acting in some form of agency for the appellant, either actually or constructively, and no such suggestion was made. While it may be the fact that such Certificates are routinely used by mortgagees in order to protect themselves against later claims by mortgagors wishing to extricate themselves from the mortgage, I cannot see how the existence of such
Certificates, or any suggestion that the Certificates were forgeries, can be relevant to the defence of non est factum, whether or not they should have given rise to some question in the appellant's mind as to the circumstances of the signing of the mortgage after it was signed. The appellant was entitled to rely upon the signature of Mrs McMullen on the mortgage.

A somewhat similar argument to that relied upon by the second respondent was made to the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Bank of Australasia v
Reynell[24]. That case concerned a guarantee for 5000 which had been obtained by fraud from the respondent. The respondent's solicitor had filled in the guarantee for this sum but told the respondent that the guarantee was for 500. The respondent did not read the guarantee form which he signed relying upon his solicitor. The solicitor also had the respondent sign a certificate indicating that the guarantee had been read over to him and that he understood that he was liable for the amount expressed in it. A statement in the certificate that the respondent had read the document himself had been crossed out. The Court of Appeal held that the respondent was bound by the full amount of the guarantee. It was argued on behalf of the respondent that the bank had been negligent by accepting and acting upon the certificate which indicated that the respondent had not read the guarantee and which, therefore, should have put them on notice of the possibility that the guarantee was misrepresented to the respondent. The Court was completely unpersuaded by that argument. Richmond J, who gave the leading judgment, described such an argument as a "broken reed" as the bank were entitled to rely upon the respondents signature regardless of the certificate[25].

The next defence relied upon by Mrs McMullen was a defence under the [Contracts Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/). The
Master found that there was evidence to support a finding that the mortgage was unjust for the purposes of that Act[26]. The word "unjust" is not defined in the Act but it includes "unconscionable, harsh or oppressive"27.
Guidance is given to the court as to matters to which the court is to have regard when determining whether a contract is unjust, although these matters are not determinative of that question[28]. The Master does not make it clear in what way the facts support her conclusion that Mrs McMullen had a case under that Act, that is whether the injustice related to the terms of the mortgage or the procedure whereby Mrs McMullen came to sign the mortgage. If it is the latter, one of the obvious difficulties for Mrs McMullen making out a ground for relief is that the her son was not a party to the mortgage and there is no evidence that the appellant was in any way involved in the circumstances surrounding the execution of the mortgage by Mrs McMullen.

It is clear that there is a two stage approach under the Act; the first stage being to determine whether the contract is in the circumstances when it was made unjust and the second being a decision whether the court should grant relief[29]. The fact that a party was innocent of any injustice occurring to the other party, or that a party lacked knowledge of any matter within [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html) of the Act in respect of the contract, may be relevant to the second step, ie the decision to grant relief, but not to the first step[30]. But it is not sufficient for an entitlement to relief that a party can point to circumstances that fall within one or more of the paragraphs in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html)[31].
As McHugh JA explained in West versus AGC (Advances) Ltd[32], a contract may generally be unjust because its terms, consequences or effects are unjust[33], or because of the unfairness of the methods used to make the contract[34].
Most unjust contracts will be the product of both procedural and substantive injustice.

There is nothing in the terms of the mortgage upon which any relief could be based. What as relied upon is the conduct of Mrs McMullen's son in not disclosing to her that the sum secured by the new mortgage was so much in excess of that secured by the original mortgage. But, as I have already indicated, there is no evidence that Mrs McMullen thought that this was a relevant consideration to her signing the mortgage. She was prepared to rely upon her trust in her son and his ability to repay whatever he borrowed.
Although she did not have independent legal advice in respect of the mortgage[35], she neither wanted, or sought, advice or explanation about the mortgage. She had previously been party to a mortgage over her property for her son's benefit because she trusted him and had confidence in his ability to repay the money secured by the mortgage. The same situation applied in this case.

Although the fact that one or more of the matters referred to in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s9.html) apply does not determine whether or not a contract will be considered to be harsh or unconscionable, a number of the matters referred to in the subsection do apply in this case. Mrs McMullen was aged 72 and this may have been a factor in her inability to look after her interests properly[36]. The property subject of the mortgage is the family home in which she still lives and she and her husband are retired[37]. She did in fact have no legal advice[38] and the provision as to the principal sum secured by the mortgage was not explained to her[39]. There is no reference to the principal sum secured on the front page of the mortgage and the clause relating to the principal sum is contained in clause 50 which is on the second page of a schedule inserted in the body of the mortgage[40]. Although the Act does not refer to, and is not concerned with, unfairness in relation to a contract[41], it is concerned with the harshness of a contract in all the circumstances of the contract at the time it was made. I am conscious of McHugh JA.'s view that a contract cannot be unjust merely because it was not in the interest of a party to make the contract and the party did not receive legal advice[42], but the evidence in this case does seem to go further that those two matters.

The fact that the appellant may not have been aware of any of the matters to which I have referred is relevant to the exercise of discretion of the court rather than to a finding that the contract was not unjust. Although it may be rare that the discretion would be exercised against a party who did not know of matters which make the contract unjust[43], there is material in this case which a court may find relevant to the exercise of the discretion against the appellant. The fact that there was a discrepancy between the Solicitors
Certificate and the mortgage document ought to have alerted the appellant to the possibility the circumstances surrounding the signing of the mortgage were not as they appeared to be from the Solicitors Certificate. A question should at least have been raised as to whether Mrs McMullen did have independent legal advice and whether she did understand the provisions of the mortgage which she signed. There may be explanations which can be put forward by the appellant with respect to this issue[44], but I am not concerned with the merits of the matter. On all the material before me I think that there is evidence upon which relief under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) can be sought by Mrs McMullen and I also find that it is in the interests of justice that she should be able to have a decision made by a court as to whether such relief should be granted to her.

The remaining basis on which it is said that a defence arises on the evidence before me is that of general unconscionability upon an application of the principles laid down by the High Court in Amadio[45]. The Master by her decision appears to have held that there was evidence upon which such a defence could be raised although there is no analysis whatsoever of the facts as found by her to support the defence. What was submitted before me is that there was unconscionable conduct by the appellant in that it was aware, or ought to have been aware, of the position of special disadvantage which pertained between Mrs McMullen and her son. The awareness of the appellant is founded upon the discrepancy between the Solicitors Certificate and the mortgage document.

I accept that a court might find on the evidence that Mrs McMullen's son took the opportunity of his mother's presence away from her home and her husband to have her sign the mortgage. He did not alert her to the significant increase in the principal sum. He minimised the effect of the transaction by suggesting that it was a "refinancing" from one finance company to another. He indicated that it was unnecessary for her husband to sign the document although he clearly intended to forge the husband's signature. He used her trust in him to obtain her signature. In those circumstances it is open to the second respondent to argue that there was a position of special disadvantage suffered by Mrs McMullen in that she acted because of her trust in her son and her wish to assist him such that she could not take sufficient care of her own interests. The son was the stronger party and there was no consideration moving from him to her[46].

There is no doubt that a party to a contract can be fixed with knowledge of the position of the other party to the contract even though the party was not involved in the process by which the contract was entered into by that other party. The contract will be unconscionable if the party had knowledge of the special disadvantage suffered by the other party or, while not having actual knowledge, was aware of the possibility that a position of special disadvantage may exist or is aware of facts that would raise the possibility in the mind of any reasonable person[47]. In other words the contract may be found to be unconscionable if a party knew, or ought to have known (from facts which it did know), of the position of special disadvantage of the other party.

But the question to be considered on this appeal is whether there is evidence that the appellant had knowledge as to the disadvantageous position of Mrs
McMullen or knew of facts which would raise the possibility that such a situation existed in the mind of a reasonable person. There is no actual evidence as to what the appellant knew about the position between Mrs McMullen and her son or any of the circumstances in which the mortgage document came to be signed by her. There was an affidavit filed by Mr Boyce, a solicitor and director of the appellant, but that is of a formal nature proving the documents and facts relied upon by the appellant. There was no application made to cross-examine Mr Boyce before the Master. There is no evidence as to the financial situation of the son at the time of taking out the loan, and it cannot be inferred that at that time there was a risk that he may not be able to repay the loan such that Mrs McMullen ought to have been made aware of that fact.

The argument which was made on behalf of Mrs McMullen was that the Court should infer from the Solicitors Certificate that the appellant ought to have known of the discrepancy between it and the mortgage document and, from that fact, ought to have known that the son was a forger. It follows, so the argument ran, that the plaintiff ought to have known that Mrs McMullen's trust in her son was misplaced and, as a result, that she was in a position of special disadvantage. There seems to me to be considerable gaps in this line of reasoning. But even if it were available to a court to reason in this way, what is being relied upon is more akin to negligence on the part of the plaintiff rather than the constructive knowledge upon which a finding of unconscionability will be made. The evidence does not go so far as to provide a basis upon which it could be concluded that the appellant was "wilfully ignorant" of Mrs McMullin's position[48]. Nor, in my view has the second respondent proved the basic facts upon which the possibility of her position of special disadvantage would have arisen in the mind of a reasonable person.

It follows that I do not believe that the second defendant has adduced evidence to show that the defence of unconscionability can be fairly argued.
Perhaps this is not of great moment given that I do find that there is the possibility of a defence under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/). It is hard to imagine a defence which would succeed upon the ground of unconscionability at common law but would fail under the Act. It may be that as the matter proceeds further material may become available to the second respondent. At this stage, however I should give leave to the second respondent only to file a defence in respect of the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/).

Although there was an appeal against an order made by the Master that the appellant pay costs in respect of the first respondent, Mr McMullen, the matter was only faintly argued before me. The question of costs was a matter for the exercise of the Master's discretion and I see no reason why I should re-exercise that discretion.

I dismiss the appeal. I grant leave to the second respondent to file a defence based upon the Contract Review Act 1980 only. The defence and cross-claims are to be filed within 28 days from today. The appellant is to pay the costs of this appeal.
