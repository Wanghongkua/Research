Catchwords: 
PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - civil - notice of motion seeking leave to file amended summons - where summons and amended summons seek to challenge a decision of the Local Court - where both summonses are not in proper form and fail to articulate the basis upon which relief is sought - whether amended summons should be allowed - whether summons should be struck out  
PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - civil - notice of motion seeking summary dismissal of proceedings - where the Local Court Magistrate made findings of fact based on evidence before the Local Court - where the plaintiff seeks to challenge the
Magistrate's decision in the Supreme Court - whether the outcome of the proceedings is sufficiently certain to warrant summary dismissal  
JUDGMENT
After a hearing over two days in the NSW Local Court in September and December 2014, Bradd LCM, on 18 June 2015, delivered a reasoned judgment in which he dismissed proceedings brought by Mr Gary Young against Mr Bill Cooke and Mrs Helena Cooke.
On 16 July 2015, Mr Young filed a Summons seeking to challenge Bradd LCM's decision. The Summons named Mr and Mrs Cooke and the Local Court as defendants. The Local Court has filed a submitting appearance, and has taken no part in the proceedings.
On 27 August 2015, Mr and Mrs Cooke filed a Notice of Motion in which they sought orders that: * (1) Pursuant to r 13.4 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , the proceedings be dismissed.
* (2) Further, or in the alternate, pursuant to r 14.28 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , the Summons filed on 16 July 2015 be set aside.
* (3) Further, or in the alternate, pursuant to r 42.21 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , the plaintiff to provide security for costs.
On 31 October 2015, Mr Young filed a Notice of Motion in which he sought leave to file an Amended Summons.
This judgment deals with these two Notices of Motion.

Local Court Proceedings
The final pleadings in the Local Court have not been put before this Court. However, the following material appears from the evidence in this Court.
In August 2011, Mr Young commenced proceedings against Mr and Mrs Cooke in the NSW District Court. In November 2011, Johnstone DCJ ordered that Mr Young's Statement of Claim be struck out, but granted Mr Young leave to re-plead.
In March 2012, Mr Young filed a Summons in the Court of Appeal, seeking leave to appeal against the orders of Johnstone DCJ. That application for leave to appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in March 2013.
In the meantime, there were a series of interlocutory proceedings in the District Court dealing with attempts to ensure that the plaintiff's pleading was in proper form. On 29 April 2013, McLoughlin DCJ transferred the proceedings from the District Court to the Local Court.
On 15 May 2013, Mr Young filed a Statement of Claim in the Local Court proceedings. On 24 July 2013, Mr and Mrs Cooke filed a Defence.
It appears from the judgment of Bradd LCM that Mr Young claimed he was the owner of a cattle dog which, at least in the Local Court proceedings, he called "Apache Jack". Mr Young claimed that Apache Jack was unlawfully in the possession of Mr and Mrs Cooke. He sought damages for conversion and/or detinue.
Mr Young's claim was based on events which he said occurred in the period from 2007 to 2009. Mr Young's claim was that he purchased Apache Jack in March or April 2007 from a dog breeder in the Goulburn area and had it in his possession thereafter as a working dog. Mr Young accepted that there was no microchip inserted under the dog's skin and that, although the dog had worn a collar whilst in his possession, there was no identification tag attached to that collar.
Mr Young claimed that, in July 2008, Apache Jack disappeared from his property. He said that, in 2009, he discovered that Mr and Mrs Cooke were in possession of Apache Jack. He demanded Mr and Mrs Cooke to return the dog, but they refused to do so.
Mr Cooke gave evidence in the Local Court that a dog wandered onto his property in September 2008. He said he did not know the identity of the dog or its owner. He summoned the Council ranger to his property, who then took the dog to the Council's pound.
Mrs Cooke gave evidence that, on 4 October 2008, she attended the Council's pound and purchased the dog for $200. It was subsequently registered in her name. In evidence, Mrs Cooke produced a receipt dated 4 October 2008 for the purchase of the dog from the Council's pound. She also produced a Certificate of Registration issued by the NSW Companion Animals Register, indicating that she was registered as the owner of an "Australian kelpie-cross" on 20 October 2008. Mr and Mrs Cooke called their dog "Zac". They claimed that Apache Jack and Zac were not the same dog.
The Local Court determined two questions. The first concerned the identity of the dogs, namely whether Zac, the dog which Mrs Cooke purchased from the Council's pound on 4 October 2008, was Apache Jack, the dog which Mr Young bought from a breeder in 2007 and which disappeared from his property in July 2008.
The second question determined by the Local Court was whether the rights of Mr Young in relation to the dog had been extinguished by the applicable law, namely The [Companion Animals Act 1998](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) , by virtue of Mrs Cooke purchasing the dog from the Council's pound and having it registered in her name.
On the first question, namely the identity of the dog, the Local Court had before it evidence from both Mr Young and Mr and Mrs Cooke as to the circumstances surrounding the way in which the dog came into their respective possession. The Local Court also had evidence as to how the dog left Mr Young's possession. It also had before it photographs of the dog provided by each of the parties. Mr Young attached photographs of the dog to an affidavit which, he told the Court, were taken when the dog was between 5 and 7 months of age. Mrs Cooke attached a photograph of the dog taken while it was in her possession, although the precise date of that photograph was in issue.
There was other evidence from which the Local Court felt able to draw inferences as to the ownership of the dog. That evidence and the inferences drawn from it were referred to, albeit sparingly, in Bradd LCM's judgment.
Bradd LCM was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the dog which Mr Young claimed he owned was the same as the one in the possession of Mr and Mrs Cooke. Putting it shortly, Apache Jack was not Zac. This finding was made on the evidence before the Court, including the absence of a microchip (which a breeder was obliged by the legislation to insert into a pup before sale), the dog's appearance based upon the photographs provided by the parties, inconsistencies in Mr Young's usage of the dog's name and, as well, inferences of fact which were available and drawn.
Notwithstanding that finding which, without more, would result in a judgment for the defendants, the Local Court, appropriately, went on to deal with the second issue, namely what the consequences of [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/s69.html) of the [Companion Animals Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) were with respect to the entitlement of Mr and Mrs Cooke to the dog.
Bradd LCM held that [s 69(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/s69.html) of the [Companion Animals Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) gave Mrs Cooke good title to the dog, which the Council's pound had sold to her pursuant to its power of sale under the Act. Bradd LCM observed that the provisions of the [Companion Animals Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) had the effect that once a dog was surrendered to a Council pound and sold, the previous owner of the dog had no right of action against the person to whom the dog was sold, but had a right of action against the local council responsible for the pound, if it could be established that the local council, or its relevant officer, had not acted in good faith or had acted without reasonable care.
No proceedings have been brought against the Local Council.

Mr Young's Pleadings 
Amended Summons
It is convenient to deal with the proposed Amended Summons handed up in court by Mr Young.
The document is headed "Amended Summons - Judicial Review". It describes the type of claim as: "Judicial Review pursuant to [Local Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) [sect [1].](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s39.html)
In issue a QUESTION of LAW and a FINDING OF FACT made without evidence or reliable evidence." (sic)
The Decision Maker is described as Bradd LCM. The Grounds are described as follows: "GROUNDS 
His honour erred by making a finding of fact with no evidence or using unreliable evidence that the Court was pre-warned was unreliable evidence and in not considering that the Cookes were negligent in their actions pursuant to b SE SD 5F of the [Civil Liability
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) of 2002 and that this negated the defendants rights to rely on the [Companion Animals
Act 1998](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) to secure good title and that these actions by defendants Cooke caused plaintiff severe damages. That his honour mistakenly found the dog in Question to be an animal controlled by the [Companion Animals
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) of 1998.
THAT TO ALLOW THIS DECISION TO STAND WILL CREATE A METHOD BY WHICH STOCK
ANIMALS CAN BE STOLEN AND A GOOD TITLE OBTAINED BY UNLAWFUL MEANS IN VIOLATION
OF THE [CIVIL LIABILITY
ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) OF 2002." 
Under the heading "THE ISSUES AND ORDERS SOUGHT - THE PROOF AND THE MATERIAL FACTS BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT", Mr Young sets out 33 paragraphs of material. Included in the first 21 paragraphs are assertions of fact, many of which do not appear in the Local Court judgment, arguments and assertions of legal consequences, and allegations that Mr and Mrs Cooke committed perjury and fabricated evidence. As well, there are assertions that the evidence before the Local Court was unreliable and that the Court engaged in inappropriate fact finding.
Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the proposed Amended Summons are in the following form: "19. The court made a finding of fact and found the dog Zac and Apache
Jack were not the same dog. The court had no evidence to make this finding of fact or had unreliable evidence to make this finding and the court had been prewarned the evidence the court relied upon to make this finding was in fact unreliable evidence additionally the Court was aware of the perjury of the cookes before the Court.  . In making this finding of fact the court totally disregarded all other evidence, with no comment whatsoever, that proved in fact Zac and Apache
Jack are indeed one and the same dog." (sic)
The plaintiff then sets out the orders and declarations which he seeks. Those orders and declarations are as follows: "1. Order that defendants are not be entitled to receive the benefits of the [Companion Animals
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) without at the same time observing and complying with the Civil Liability Act 2000 sections 5B; 5D; 5E; and 5F; where the defendants are aware of the name of real owner of the animal or even if they consider they MAY know the name of real owner of the animal and  . Order that the finding of fact made by the magistrate's court regarding identification of the dog in question be set aside as having been made on no evidence or evidence the Court was prewarned was unreliable evidence  . A Declaration .. That the court made jurisdictional error, mistake in law and or an abuse of the court process occurred when the Court ignored the factual evidence that the defendants Cooke had prior knowledge plaintiff was the actual owner of Apache Jack and negligently failed to inform the plaintiff of the dog's whereabouts and further, negligently failed to inform the council rangers or the neighbours of the real owner of Apache Jack all pursuant to
Section SB 50 SE and 5F of the Civil Uability Act 2002 and thus the Cookes caused actual harm to plaintiff by the economic Joss plaintiff suffered by the loss of Apache Jack and the actual companionship between plaintiff and Apache
Jack and the damage done to the dog ;itself by destruction of its sexuality.  . A Declaration that this damage to plaintiff and the dog was obviously foreseeable by the Cookes {5B (1] [a] and that it was not an insignificant risk [5B[1] [b] and any reasonable person would have informed the council rangers that plaintiff was the owner of Apache Jack and that the dog was a valuable work stock dog 58 [1] [c] or informed Plaintiff of the neighbor's of the actual situation.  . A Declaration THAT THIS MATTER IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST, concern and importance to prevent the blatant misuse of the CAA to unlawfully obtain title over and against a legitimate owner of an animal, in this case the plaintiff and as such that defendants Cooke are not entitled to the protection of the CAA under which title to the dog was granted to them because the Cookes negligently failed lo comply with their duty under [section
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5b.html), [5E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5e.html), [5D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) and [5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5f.html) of the [Civil Liability Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) in NOT informing the council rangers on collection of the dog or during the time the dog was impounded that they were aware of the name and address of the legitimate owner of the dog and negligently failed to infonn those council officers of same and  . A Declaration that The title issued to the Cookes under CAA is extinguished by this court  . A Declaration that title of ownership to an animal give under the CAA can be defeated by the actual owner of an animal, the plaintiff, under the [Civil Liability
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) [sections
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5b.html) [5E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5e.html) [5D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5d.html) and [5F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s5f.html) where he plaintiff can demonstrate by evidence before a court that the persons who found and surrendered the animal to the local pound being the same persons who later take advantage of the CAA to claim ownership and title from the council pound under the CAA knew at all times the name of the legitimate owner of that animal and at the time they [the Cookes,] surrendered that animal to the local pound and negligently failed to give that information either to the animals legitimate owner or the council rangers at the time of surrender.  . A declaration that The Acts of the Cookes in not being forthcoming with this information as to true ownership of the dog did cause Plaintiff great particular harm and financial losses, that there was an obvious risk that plaintiff would never be aware that the dog was impounded to a pound so far away from his home and that plaintiff would never recover Apache Jack. In the circumstances a reasonable person would have been aware that this risk of serious harm, damage and loss to the Plaintiff was foreseeable and very real, that the risk was not an insignificant risk and in the circumstances a reasonable person would have taken the precaution of informing those council officers of the legitimate owner of the dog and the plaintiff's full name and address. All as set out in the [Civil Liability Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/s58.html) SE
SF 50.  . A Declaration that the damages claimed by the plaintiff in the local court in the amount of $78,750.00 be awarded to plaintiff as a judgement and against both defendants Cooke.  . Order that the order of his Honour Magistrate Bradd dated 18 June 2015 be vacated and quashed.  . A Declaration that the evidence given by both of the Cookes over the issue of an alleged discussion with Mr Lewis between the 25th of September and the 4th of October 2008 inclusive was in fact a fully fabricated pre- meditated and perjured attempt to mislead the trial court.  . An order for Costs to Plaintiff." (sic) 
Possible Basis for these Proceedings
One possible basis for these proceedings is the exercise by the plaintiff of his statutory entitlement to an appeal from the Local Court. A party to civil proceedings in the Local Court, who is dissatisfied with a judgment of that court, has a limited right of appeal to the Supreme Court. That right is conferred by Division 4 of [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/index.html#p3) of the [Local Court Act 2007](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/).
[Section 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s39.html) of the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) provides: "(1) A party to proceedings before the Court sitting in its General Division who is to dissatisfied with a judgment or order of the Court may appeal to the
Supreme Court but only on a question of law.  ..." [Section 40](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s40.html) of the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) provides: "(1) A party to proceedings before the Court sitting in its General Division who is dissatisfied with a judgment or order of the Court on a ground that involves a question of mixed law and fact may appeal to the Supreme Court but only by leave of the Supreme Court.  ..."
There is no appeal from the Local Court to the Supreme Court on a question of fact.
The principles of law as to what constitutes a question of law have been extensively canvassed in the authorities since at least the decision of the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Jordan in Australian Gaslight Co versus Valuer-General  <case> encapsulated the relevant authorities in this way: "Arising from these authorities, a number of broad propositions can be stated: 
First, there is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact, unless there is no evidence to support that finding. 
Second, it does not amount to an error of law if the finding of fact, or the inference (or the refusal to make a finding of fact or draw an inference) is perverse, in the sense that it is contrary to the overwhelming weight of evidence ... 
Third, it is not an error of law even if the reasoning process by which the court reaches its conclusion of fact is demonstrably unsound or illogical. 
Fourth, there is [a] limited exception in relation to decisions of fact in the context of a statutory description. In such a case there may be an error of law if the decision on the facts is one which could not be reasonably entertained, or supported, if the tribunal had properly understood the true construction of the relevant enactment." (citations omitted)
This Court has consistently applied these principles, particularly in the context of statutory appeals: see Lee versus Knapik <case> at <case>- <case>; Curtis versus Charles Darwin University <case>- <case>.
A second possible basis for the plaintiff's proceedings to challenge the judgment of the Local Court is [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), which provides that the Court's previous jurisdiction to grant any relief or remedy by way of a writ of prohibition or certiorari continues after the commencement of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). However, in such a case the Court proceeds by way of order rather than by way of writ. The seeking of relief under [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is commonly referred to as proceedings by way of judicial review.
Pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), this Court is exercising a supervisory jurisdiction over inferior courts and tribunals. It is not exercising an appellate function. The function which it exercises under [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) is distinct from the hearing of a statutory appeal under the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/). Relevantly here, if [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s69.html) is being relied upon, then Mr Young would be seeking an order for relief in the nature of a writ of certiorari.
Application under [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) for relief in the nature of a writ of certiorari is available for an error of law which amounts to either a jurisdictional error, or an error of law (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) that appears on the face of the record of the proceedings: ASIC versus Farley  <case> at <case>; <case>; [(2001) 51 NSWLR 494], where his Honour said: "17 While there is no right of appeal in respect of a decision refusing an award of costs under <case>, in limited circumstances an order in the nature of prerogative relief can be sought by enlivening the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). As there is no privative or ouster clause in respect of a decision under <case>, the power of this Court to provide relief under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is available on the grounds discussed in Craig versus State of South Australia <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 163] at -176; O'Brien versus Hutchinson <case> at <case>.
That is, this Court has the power to issue orders in the nature of certiorari for errors of law on the face of the record and for jurisdictional error.  Error of law on the face of the record includes the reasons of an inferior court or tribunal: [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/); see also
Craig at 176-180 and the discussion of Craig, along with the reasons generally, in Kirk versus Industrial Relations Commission ; Kirk Group
Holdings Pty Ltd versus WorkCover Authority [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [71]-[75].  Generally, jurisdictional error will be disclosed where a decision maker has: not taken into account a criterion required by law; taken into account an irrelevant criterion; utilised the wrong test or asked itself the wrong question; or misapprehended the nature or limits of its powers as a consequence of which it has performed an act or made a decision (or not done so), which is not sanctioned by authority: see, inter alia, Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs versus Peko-Wallsend Ltd <case>; [(1986) 162 CLR 24.]  Further, jurisdictional error will occur if there [was] a denial of procedural fairness. Yet, at all times, the distinction between a merit review and judicial review must be kept in mind, otherwise we are 'apt to encourage a slide into impermissible merit review': Swift versus SAS Trustee Corp <case> at <case>."
I agree with those principles and will apply them in the determination of this case.

Submissions on the Motions
The plaintiff submits that the proposed Amended Summons serves to clarify the claims he wishes to make and ensures that the Court is apprised of all relevant matters. He submits that the proposed amended summons should be allowed, and that no prejudice would flow from that course.
The defendants submit that the proposed Amended Summons, like the existing Summons, is an example of a document which obscures rather than reveals the true nature of the plaintiff's case in this Court. The defendants point to the fact that it is unclear on the proposed Amended Summons whether the proceedings are an appeal pursuant to [s 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s39.html) of the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) or proceedings for prerogative relief pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). They submit that the content of the Amended Summons is discursive, includes irrelevant material, and makes scandalous allegations against the defendants, which in combination mean that the Amended Summons causes "embarrassment" within the meaning of r 14.28 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) ("UCPR").
Further, the defendants submit that the Local Court's finding as to the identity of the dog in question was a finding of fact based on evidence before the Local Court and, accordingly, there was no error of law which could be the subject of an appeal to this Court. The defendants further submit that once the identity of the dog was determined in their favour, there was no other basis for the plaintiff to have succeeded in the Local Court, and there is no arguable case in this Court. Accordingly, they submit that the proceedings should be summarily dismissed pursuant to r 13.4 of the UCPR.
In response to these submissions, Mr Young accepts that the determination of the identity of the dog in the Local Court was a finding of fact by the Magistrate. However, he indicates that he wishes to argue that this finding of fact constituted an error of law. When the legal test, which I have described above, was outlined to Mr Young in the course of his submissions, he clarified his position by informing the Court that he wished to say that there was no evidence, or no reliable evidence of any weight, upon which the Local Court could properly and lawfully act in making the finding of fact with respect to the identification of the dog.
Mr Young also sought to identify for the Court an argument which appears to have been referred to in both the proposed Amended Summons and the existing Summons, namely that the provisions of the [Civil Liability Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) impacted upon the [Companion Animals Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/) in a way which meant that, in the factual circumstances here, the defendants were not entitled to rely upon any claim to title pursuant to the [Companion Animals Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1998174/).
The defendants accept that such a question of statutory construction, if adequately formulated, may constitute a question of law in respect of which Mr Young would have a right of appeal under the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/). However, they point out that such a claim was not made before the Magistrate in the hearing, and should not be allowed to be made now.

Plaintiff's Summons and Proposed Amended Summons
The plaintiff's Notice of Motion seeks an order permitting him to file a proposed Amended Summons in the form identified in the course of the hearing.
The plaintiff's current Summons and his proposed Amended Summons leave much to be desired in both their form and content. I accept the defendants' submissions that the documents are embarrassing and, accordingly, the proposed Amended Summons ought not to be allowed in the form in which it is proposed, and the existing Summons by which the proceedings were commenced ought to be struck out.
I come to that conclusion because of the following features of the documents: * (a) neither document clearly articulates the basis upon which the proceedings are brought. It is entirely unclear whether the proceedings are an appeal pursuant to [s 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/s39.html) of the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/), or proceedings for prerogative relief pursuant to [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), or proceedings based on both of those Acts; * (b) there is no identification in clear and appropriate terms of the questions of law said to arise from the Local Court judgment in respect of which the plaintiff has a right of appeal. As presently framed, both documents include allegations of errors of fact in terms which do not give rise to a right of appeal; * (c) both documents include allegations which the law would regard as scandalous. That is, allegations which, by being on the Court record, scandalise the Court or an individual. Assertions of deliberate falsehood and perjury, and other allegations of bad faith, ought not to be made in pleadings of this kind. Whether the proceedings are brought under the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) or the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), such allegations have no place in the determination by the Court of whether relief ought to be granted. The allegations should not have been made in the original Summons, and ought not to be made in the proposed Amended Summons; * (d) the extensive orders and the declaratory and other relief sought by the plaintiff travel well beyond the relief available under the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/) or the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). Claims for such relief are inappropriate in such proceedings and should not have been made in the existing Summons or the proposed Amended Summons.
There are other reasons why the documents are bad in form. The defendants' submission that they are discursive and rambling is correct. The Summons and the proposed Amended Summons seem to assert facts which may not have been before the Local Court and, generally, the documents are not in the form required by the UCPR.
Some latitude must be allowed to the plaintiff, given that he has drafted the documents himself and is not presently represented. Even allowing for this, I am nevertheless unpersuaded that the proposed Amended Summons should be allowed to be filed in its present form, or that the existing Summons should be permitted to stand on the Court record.
Accordingly, I refuse to grant the plaintiff leave to file his proposed Amended Summons. The consequence of this is that the plaintiff's Notice of Motion dated 31 October 2015 must be dismissed.
The order sought by the defendants' Notice of Motion dated 27 August 2015 - that the Summons filed 16 July 2015 be struck out pursuant to r 14.28 of the UCPR - ought to be made. To that extent, the defendants' Notice of Motion is upheld.

Summary Dismissal
The defendants also seek an order, pursuant to r 13.4 of the UCPR, that the proceedings be dismissed.
It is well settled that the exercise of the Court's discretion to summarily dismiss proceedings before a hearing must be approached with great caution. The Court has to be satisfied that the case for summary dismissal is clear, and that the plaintiff ought to be deprived of a hearing of his claim. As Gleeson JA recently stated in Pi versus Zhou <case> at <case>: "The test to be applied [for summary dismissal] has been variously expressed, including: 'So obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed'; and 'manifestly groundless'', but the underlying point is that there must be a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome of the proceedings if it were allowed to go to trial or a hearing in the ordinary way."
The defendants contend that the central question of the identity of the dog is purely a question of fact and that, as the Magistrate had evidence available to him upon which to make that decision, there is simply no basis for this Court to intervene.
I accept that the determination of the identity of the dog is a question of fact. However, the plaintiff's argument, properly understood, is that either there was no evidence before the Local Court which enabled the Magistrate to determine that the dog in the defendants' possession was not the plaintiff's dog or, alternatively, that the evidence relied upon by the Magistrate was so demonstrably unreliable that in making this finding the Magistrate committed an error of law.
It is fair to say, at least on the material referred to in the judgment of the Local Court and in the exhibits provided to this Court, that the plaintiff has a very difficult argument confronting him. As appears from his Honour's judgment, it seems clear that there was at least some evidence on which he based his findings as to the identity of the dog. As earlier mentioned, the Court was provided with photographs, taken at different times, of the dog which was in in the plaintiff's possession and in the dog currently defendants' possession. There were other facts from which the Magistrate drew inferences as to the identity of the dog. It was clearly open to the Magistrate as a matter of fact to come to the conclusion which he did on the basis of the material which has been drawn to my attention.
However, these observations ignore the somewhat more nuanced argument of the plaintiff which, in effect, is that although there may have been evidence before the Magistrate, that evidence was of such little weight that a court viewing it objectively would regard it as being the equivalent of no evidence at all. The plaintiff asserts that he wishes to argue that the evidence was demonstrated at the hearing to be obviously unreliable.
I do not have the transcript of the proceedings before the Magistrate. I do not have the pleadings in the Local Court, nor do I have all of the exhibits.
As I have said, it appears to me that the plaintiff faces a very difficult argument. However, I am not prepared to hold that the result of that argument is so certain to me, at this stage of the proceedings, that the proceedings ought to be summarily dismissed.
Accordingly, to the extent that the defendants seek summary dismissal of the proceedings, I would not be prepared to grant such relief.

Summary
In summary, the position reached has been this. The defendants have not succeeded in having the proceedings summarily dismissed, but have succeeded in having the existing Summons struck out. The plaintiff has sought leave to file an Amended Summons, but unsuccessfully.
Clearly, the proceedings being on foot and the plaintiff being in a position where he needs to file a proper pleading, the Court needs to make orders with respect to the appropriate procedure to enable that to be done.
In light of the plaintiff's failed attempts to produce a Summons in proper form, I am not prepared to grant leave without limitation to the plaintiff to amend his pleading. The appropriate relief is to enable the plaintiff to bring a further motion, if he wishes, for leave to file an Amended Summons. However, in that motion it will be necessary for the plaintiff to seek that leave by reference to a properly pleaded document which adequately identifies any question of law upon which the plaintiff wishes to exercise his right to relief under the [Local Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lca2007131/), or prerogative relief under the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/).

Referral for Pro Bono Assistance
The plaintiff sought an order in the course of his submissions for a referral by the Court for pro bono assistance to enable him to draft a Summons in an appropriate form.
Such referral is appropriate. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of r 7.36 of the UCPR, I will make an order that the plaintiff be referred for assistance with respect to the drafting or settling of a proposed Amended Summons.

Security for Costs
The final order sought by the defendants was that the plaintiff provide security for costs.
At the time the hearing took place in this Court, the Local Court was reserved upon a question relating to the costs of the proceedings in that Court. It was anticipated that judgment would be delivered shortly after the hearing concluded.
Having regard to the nature of the claim, the fact that the plaintiff will need to produce a Summons in proper form before being able to proceed any further, and the fact that the judgment of the Local Court remained outstanding at the time of the hearing of these proceedings, it is not appropriate, in my view, for this Court to proceed to consider the defendants' application for security for costs at this time. The balance of the Motion by which that order is sought will be stood over to a future date.

Costs
The general rule is that costs follow the event: r 42.1 UCPR. It is open to the Court, in its discretion, to make some other order.
Here, the defendants have been substantially successful - they have resisted the proposed amendment, and had the existing Summons struck out. There is no viable pleading. There will not be any basis for this matter to proceed until the plaintiff produces a proper pleading.
In those circumstances, the appropriate order is one which accords with r 42.1 of the UCPR, namely that the plaintiff must pay the defendants' costs of both Notices of Motion.

Orders
I make the following orders: * (1) Notice of Motion of the plaintiff dated 31 October 2015 be dismissed.
* (2) Order, pursuant to r 14.28 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/), that the Summons filed by the plaintiff on 16 July 2015 be struck out.
* (3) Dismiss the defendants' claim for summary judgment as set out in Order 1 of the defendants' Notice of Motion dated 27 August 2015.
* (4) Stand over the balance of the defendants' Motion of 27 August 2015.
* (5) Order that, in the event that the plaintiff seeks leave to file an Amended Summons, then he must do so by way of a notice of motion filed on or before 23 May 2016, accompanied by such affidavits in support as the plaintiff wishes to rely upon.
* (6) Order that such notice of motion and accompanying affidavits in support be served no later than 30 May 2016.
* (7) Order that the plaintiff be granted leave to make such motion returnable before the Common Law Registrar at 9 am on 6 June 2016.
* (8) Order that the plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of the proceedings on both Notices of Motion.
* (9) Pursuant to the provisions of r 7.36 of the UCPR, order that the plaintiff be referred to the Registrar for referral to a member of the Pro Bono Panel for assistance with respect to the drafting or settling of a proposed Amended Summons.
