RADIN versus VEKIC` ` 1891/97` `6 June 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, a former solicitor, seeks to extend a caveat pursuant to [s 74K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74k.html) of the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). Such caveat is said to protect an equitable mortgage. 
There is no doubt that on 3 May 1990, the defendants signed a mortgage in favour of the plaintiff to secure $2,281.70. The first defendant appears to have signed as a marksman.

There is also no doubt that on signing the mortgage, the plaintiff handed the defendants $2,000, the other $281.70 being his costs of acting on the mortgage transaction.

At the relevant time, the first defendant and his family were involved in a series of pieces of litigation in which the plaintiff was acting as their solicitor. In connection with that litigation, the Commonwealth Bank advanced $5,000 to the first defendant by way of a litigation loan. The principal and interest on this loan were duly repaid to the Commonwealth Bank on 16 August .

The evidence is sparse, but the material shows that the solicitor prepared a fees agreement under the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) for: acting on behalf of the mortgagor, $163.50, acting on behalf of the mortgagee in lodging the caveat, $120 and disbursements of $98.20, which by atrocious mathematics were added to total $281.70. This amount was then the subject of a memorandum of fees totalling $281.70 which the mortgagors signed, though the solicitor appears not to have signed. This was the only bill that the mortgagors ever received from the solicitor.

So far as the costs of $280 are claimed, these appear to be high for a small loan for what was thought to be a short period: they amount to 10% of the amount advanced. I know the plaintiff says that they were in accordance with the agreement and indeed, because of the mathematical error they were reduced by $100. As no particular challenge is made to the costs at this stage I need say very little about it except that the mere fact that costs are included in a costs agreement does not prevent the court from considering whether they are unconscionably high: Re Veron; ex parte Law Society of NSW (1966) 84 WN [(Pt )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s1.html) [136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s136.html);
D'Alessandro versus Legal Practitioners Complaints Committee [(1995) 15 WAR .] 
The solicitor's trust ledger shows $2,000 coming into the account from the solicitor and going out to the defendants. For simplicity, I will simply refer to "the defendants" without distinguishing any particular member of the Vekic family. The solicitor's ledger card F4119 "Vekic D Third Party" shows the deposit of $5,000 from the Commonwealth Bank on 17 July 1990, and then the following entries: 
Interim costs & refund adv for disb 013499 17.7.90 Radin & Associates 801.36 
By auty costs J67 23.7.90 To trf to F4130 Vekic D 1000.00 
By auty costs J67 23.7.90 To trf to F4131 Vekic D 1000.00 
By auty costs J67 23.7.90 To trf to F4132 Vekic M 1000.00 
Costs 013551 23.7.90 Gen A/c2 1198.64 that exhausted the whole of the $5,000. Journal Folio 67 was not put in evidence.

Mr Vekic says that shortly after the Commonwealth Bank moneys were received, he had a conversation with Mr Radin in which the latter said, "I've got the $5,000 from the Commonwealth Bank. I have taken back my $2,000 and I will keep the rest for doctors' reports." Mr Vekic said he believed Mr Radin and he assumed that the loan had been repaid in full. Mr Radin, in his affidavit, denies that the loan was used to repay the advance made under the mortgage and says that the terms of the loan were that it was to be used for the litigation.

In 1992, Miss Jean Sayer became the receiver of Mr Radin's practice. She indicated to the defendants' present solicitors that she would release the file to them upon receiving an undertaking that out of any moneys received by the new solicitors, the proper costs of Radin & Associates will be paid and that the file will be released to enable a bill of costs to be prepared.
That undertaking was given on 7 December 1992. However, by August 1993, the defendants' solicitors were alleging that they did not believe that those undertakings were still extant because conditions on which they were given were never fulfilled. What is clear is that the plaintiff did not complete the litigious matters for which he was retained on behalf of Mr Vekic and his family, and for which the solicitor had paid himself costs. It would seem that if a signed bill were rendered by the solicitor he would probably be entitled to some costs, but just how much is unclear until he actually renders a bill.

The defendants say that either they have paid out the mortgage from the litigation loan, or alternatively, they have a claim against Mr Radin for the payments he made to himself out of the trust account for costs which were never billed and probably never even earned.

A few further facts should be noted. The first is that the litigation was settled in July 1993 and after the Commonwealth Bank's litigation loan was repaid and after some correspondence with Mr Radin, the balance of the settlement moneys was paid over to the defendants.

The second fact is that on 15 July 1994, Mr Radin entered into a [Part
X](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p10)
Deed of Arrangement with his creditors by which he was to pay all his creditors in full within two years. There is no material either way to show whether the covenants were carried out under that deed or not. The plaintiff claims that with interest under the mortgage at the Commonwealth Bank's overdraft rate of interest, there is now approximately $6,400 owing under the mortgage as at the date of hearing.

The matter was heard by me in the Duty Judge list on 15 May 1997. Mr Beale, of counsel, appeared for the plaintiff and Mr Hallen, of counsel, for the defendants. Because there were some complicated matters which needed to be investigated more thoroughly I reserved my decision and invited further submissions. These were duly made by both sides. The particular matters which were of concern were: 
A. What limitations are there on a solicitor taking a mortgage from his or her own client? and 
B. Can there be any set-off between a mortgage debt and another debt? 
I will deal with these two questions first, and then consider the actual question raised in the summons, that is, whether the caveat should be extended.

A. A solicitor is in a position of influence over his or her client. Equity will closely examine transactions between solicitor and client if the client complains about them or they are on their face apparently of more benefit to the solicitor than to the client: Oldham versus Hand <case>; [(1751) Ves Sen 259]; [28 ER 167.] The onus is on the party seeking to uphold the transaction to establish that it is proper to enforce it: Johnson versus Buttress <case>; [(1936) 56 CLR 113], 134.

Thus, under the general law, a solicitor could not charge costs for a mortgage where the solicitor was the mortgagee: Re Roberts [(1889) 43 Ch D ];
Re Doody [[1893] 1 Ch 129] and Eyre versus Wynn-Mackenzie [[1894] 1 Ch 218.] This particular aspect of the general rule was ameliorated by ss 213 and 214 of the
Conveyancing Act. These sections were repealed by Act No 53 of 1984 and were re-enacted as <case> of the Legal Practitioners Act 1898 as amended. This was repealed and re-enacted as <case> of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).
Section 209 was repealed by Act No 87 of 1993. This repeal happened because the whole of Part 11 of the 1987 Act was repealed by Schedule 3 of the 1993
Act and no corresponding matter was re-enacted in respect of mortgages.

Because of this repeal, does the general law rule apply that solicitors are not able to charge in respect of a mortgage prepared by them when they themselves are the mortgagees, and if that is the position, what is the situation where at the time when the mortgage was granted, <case> was still in force but the mortgagee seeks to enforce the mortgage after <case> was repealed? [Section (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) provides that the repeal of an Act does not "revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the amendment or repeal takes effect". As Gibbs, J said in Majeau Carrying Co Pty Ltd versus Coastal Rutile Ltd <case>; [(1973) 129 CLR 48], 51-2, "This provision raised the presumption that the intention of Parliament, in repealing ... , was not to revive the common law rules (if any) that were displaced by the repealed enactment ...".

Two questions arise, the first is whether there is any intention of the
Parliament shown in the legislation, and secondly, whether [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html) of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) applies where the operation of a rule of equity has been partially modified by statute and the statute is then repealed.

I cannot see anything in the statute itself as to intention. Indeed, it appears to me that it is more likely than not that <case> was repealed by legislative mistake rather than by any intention to revive the common law.
Accordingly, this just leaves me with the second of my questions.

Francis Bennion in his Statutory Interpretation 2nd ed (Butterworths
London 1992) p 208 says of the English equivalent of our [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html), "The application ... to common law rules is unsatisfactory, and can be said to be contrary to principle. The principle is that the common law exists as a seamless webb of judge-made and customary rules and principles. It gives way to a statute while a statute is in force, but ought not to give way to it after the statute has gone. While it makes sense to say that a repealed statute does not revive when the repealing Act goes, this does not apply to the common law. ... It makes little sense to say that a rule of common law is occluded by statute when the statute in question has been repealed." Bennion is actually referring to D versus D [[1979] Fam 70], 78, where a 1971
Act abolished the general law defence of approbation in nullity of marriage proceedings but a 1973 Act repealed the 1971 Act. Dunn, J held that the general law had not been revived.

This passage, to my mind, goes further than merely saying that the author does not like what the statute says. It shows the difficulty of applying <case>(a) where the rule that has been affected by the statute is not one that merely makes a specific provision such as "whosoever steals apples to the value of one shilling or more shall be hanged", but rather one which says that a well- recognized rule of equity shall not apply in particular circumstances.

The nearest case that I have been able to find to the present is the decision of Glidewell, J in R versus Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs; ex parte Council of Civil Service Unions  <case>; [[1965] AC 75](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1965%5d%20AC%2075 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 143; Sabally N'jie versus HM Attorney General  <case>; [[1974] 131 CLR 477], Glidewell, J said, "From these authorities I derive the following propositions: 
When the prior existence of a prerogative power is established, it can only be superseded by statute by a clear and unambiguous provision in the statute.

A statute may by clear words abridge or restrict prerogative power, and to that extent the prerogative power may not be used while the statute remains in force.

If a statute so restrictive of the prerogative power is later repealed, `the prerogative power would apparently re-emerge as it existed before the statute'." The quote within the quote is from Lord Pearce's judgment in the
Burmah Oil case. 
Glidewell J's judgment was overturned in the Court of Appeal and the Court of
Appeal's decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Council of Civil
Service Unions versus Minister for the Civil Service [[1985] AC 374.] I have not seen the Court of Appeal's judgment, but the House of Lords did not cast any doubt on the proposition that I read from Glidewell, J's judgment; indeed, as the
House of Lords dealt with the relevant order as a decision under the prerogative power, it must be assumed that what Glidewell, J had said on this point was not the subject of any appeal, but was accepted by all parties.

It seems to me that, by analogy, the same applies to an equitable rule. The rule in Re Roberts was an application of a general principle that a person in a fiduciary position cannot make a profit out of the transaction. Statute stepped in and made provision for a case where a solicitor was the solicitor for the mortgagor and also the mortgagee, probably because very often the solicitor is in fact lending these funds on behalf of other clients and it would be no breach of the principle to make those other clients pay for the costs of the mortgage. However, when the statutory provision dealing with when part of the general rule was inapplicable was lifted, it seems to me that the court of equity again applies the general rule. Of course it is to be noted that in the instant case the moneys that were lent to the defendants would appear to be the solicitor's own moneys and not moneys of other clients.

While the rule in Re Roberts will apply from the coming into force of the
Legal Profession Reform Act of 1993, as at 1990 when the money was lent, the transaction was protected by the then <case>. The repeal of an Act does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the Act (Interpretation Act 1987, <case>(c)). That covers the situation where an Act which permitted personal obligations to be avoided is itself repealed: Smith versus Motor Discounts Ltd <case>; [(1935) 54 CLR 107.] 
Accordingly, the decision on the first point does not assist resolution of the problem in the instant case. I now turn to the second point.

B. Counsels' submissions on the set-off point were unfortunately couched in very general terms. They referred to the leading cases of D Galambos &
Son Pty Ltd versus McIntyre [(1974) 5 ACTR 10] and AWA
Ltd versus Exicom Australia Pty Ltd [(1990) 19 NSWLR 705.] In the latter case, Giles, J said at p 712 that no mechanical test can be applied when determining whether there should be equitable set-off. He applied what
Clarke, J had said in Tooth & Co versus Smith (5.9.1984, unreported) that "no general rule can be laid down except by stating that [an equitable] set- off will arise where there exist circumstances which make it unjust or inequitable that a plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with his claim."
See also Derham Set-Off 2nd ed (Clarendon Press Oxford 1996) pp 54-5. This means that one has to undertake an analysis of the cases involving set-offs in the law affecting mortgages.

A claim of set-off by a mortgagor will rarely entitle him to delay the mortgagee from enforcing his rights under the mortgage; Fisher &
Lightwood's Law of Mortgage Australian edition (Butterworths Sydney ) [1.39]. That proposition is supported by authorities such as Inglis v
Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia (1972) 126 CLR 161 at 166.

There are, however, some cases where a set-off will be allowed. It is customary to refer to the decision of Leach, VC in Piggott versus Williams <case>; [(1821) 6 Madd 95]; [56 ER 1027.] In that case there was a solicitor mortgagee who sought to foreclose on a security by a mortgage for costs. The client alleged the costs were occasioned by negligence and want of skill and the plea of equitable set-off succeeded. However, in Inglis' case, Walsh, J said at that the rationale of Piggott's case was that "nothing was due under the security, because the debt which it was intended to secure had never been incurred at all".

Another case where set-off was allowed is Parker versus Jackson [[1936] 2 All
ER 281.] In that case solicitors held [sterling]2000.0.0. for a client and later became the assignee of a mortgage to secure [sterling]700.0.0. The mortgage was then transferred to a third party. The solicitors went bankrupt.
It was held that the third party took subject to the equitable set-off that the client had when both the debt and the mortgage were in possession of the solicitors.

Derham in Set-Off 2nd ed, section 1.7.13 commencing at p 79 says that the cases show that a right to an equitable set-off against a mortgage debt has been recognized in a number of circumstances. One of the circumstances not applicable in the present case is where the mortgagor has been unable to repay because of the failure of the mortgagee to do what it should have done, such as the case where the mortgagee improperly fails to advance sufficient moneys to enable the building on the land to be completed and sold. Mr Derham says that modern authority both in England and Victoria show that the courts will permit an equitable set-off in claims for possession in an appropriate case. Thus in Newman versus Cook <case>; [[1963] VR 659], there was a mortgage over a boat to secure the balance of purchase money to the vendor. The purchaser brought an action for breach of warranty which under the [Sale of Goods
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/soga128/) diminished the price and succeeded. Hudson, J at 677, considered that equitable set-off reduced the amount owing under the mortgage. The other judges were not as explicit on this matter and may have decided the matter under the [Sale of
Goods Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/soga128/).
Newman versus Cook was not cited to the High Court in Inglis' case, the reason probably being that the mortgagor appeared in person and the matter probably was not raised in argument. Inglis' case is binding on me, however, because although it was a decision of a single Justice, a Full Court approved of the decision for the reasons which the trial judge gave.

As Derham points out at p 84, there are dicta in Ashley Guarantee PLC v
Zacaria [[1993] 1 WLR 62], to the effect that if the mortgagor has a liquidated equitable set-off in excess of the amount claimed by the mortgagee, the court may, at least in a case not involving possession, give relief. However, in
Australia, in view of what was said in Inglis' case, I do not consider that I can apply those dicta to the present case. In any event, it is unclear just how much is due from the solicitor to the defendants. One assumes that something is owing and it may be that if the solicitor failed to carry out an entire retainer, the whole $5,000 may be refundable plus interest at Schedule
J rates. However, it is certainly not established that the amount due by the solicitor to the mortgagors is less than what is due by the mortgagors to the solicitor if the court accepts the solicitor rather than the mortgagors as to whether the $2,000 was paid.

Accordingly, I cannot apply the doctrine of set-off to the benefit of the defendants.

This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether there was any laches or other conduct of the defendants which might dissuade a court from exercising its discretion to apply the rules of equitable set-off; see APM
Wood Products Ltd versus Kimberley Homes Pty Ltd (Cole, J 17.2.1989 unreported) and Derham op cit pp 66-7. I also do not need to consider Mr Beale's submission that, in any event, equitable set-off does not operate as an automatic extinction of the defendants' obligations: Aries Tanker Corp v
Total Transport Ltd [[1977] 1 WLR 185], 188 and see
Derham op cit pp 64 and seq.

I now have to deal with the simpler point as to whether I should extend the caveat. The simple facts are that there is a dispute between the parties as to whether there was a payment of the principal due under the mortgage back in when the litigation loan was drawn down. That matter will have to be decided by a tribunal of fact at some stage. However, the onus of showing payment would be on the mortgagors; see Young versus Queensland Trustees Ltd <case>; [(1956) 99 CLR 560.] 
Mr Beale submits that I could not come to any conclusion other than that for the purposes of [s
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74k.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), the caveator's claim may have substance. This is quite so, but it does not conclude the matter, because, even if the court forms this view, it still has a discretion whether or not to extend the caveat.

As I said in Jean-Pierre Cosmetics Pty Ltd versus Gary Truswell & Associates
Pty Ltd (1994) 6 BPR 13497, the power to extend a caveat under this section is discretionary. The court may both require an undertaking as to damages to extend a caveat or may lift the caveat on the basis that the registered proprietors give a substitute security.

Thus, the next question is whether I should make an order extending the operation of the caveat.

In the instant case, Mr Hallen says that the claim against the solicitor should be sufficient security. He submits that the solicitor has had a long time to forward a bill, but since 1993 has neglected to do so. The inference that might be drawn from this is that the solicitor either never intends to deliver a bill, or alternatively, would be embarrassed to do so because he has appropriated far more than he could ever justify by a bill.

I think, on balance, that what Mr Hallen puts is correct. Whilst the claim against the solicitor is not a security in the ordinary sense, if the mortgagors can show that there was money owing to them by the solicitor, then if those moneys exceed the claim, there would be an equitable set-off, at least once the quantum was established. The evidence shows that the first defendant had to pay the Bank some $4,l00 in interest and charges. The probabilities are that the solicitor would have known what the interest and charges would be so that he may be chargeable with that interest rather than
Schedule J interest, but in any event, as both the mortgage sued on and the litigation loan were loans at the rate of interest charged by the Commonwealth
Bank, the probabilities are that the interest rate would be much the same.
Accordingly, so long as the capital sum due to be paid by the solicitor exceeds $2,180, the amount due to the mortgagors will cancel out what is owed to the solicitor under the mortgage.

However, I perhaps should give one last opportunity to the solicitor to render a bill. Accordingly, I will extend the caveat for 14 days from the date on which these reasons are published. Unless within 14 days the solicitor delivers to the defendants a bill in taxable form showing a proper amount due to the solicitor of more than $2,180, I order that the plaintiff remove the caveat on the 15th day. If such a bill is submitted, then either party may have liberty to mention the matter before me at 9.30 am on a Tuesday or
Thursday morning to be arranged with my Associate.

I need to say that the reason why I must make an order that the plaintiff remove the caveat is that as an order extending a caveat which I made ex parte operates to make the notice lapsing the caveat spent, without an order that the caveat be withdrawn, the registered proprietor has to go to the expense of issuing a fresh lapsing notice.

As the plaintiff has failed, I believe he should pay the costs of these proceedings. However, it may be that the plaintiff's counsel wishes to argue this matter and he should be at liberty to do so. There must be some finality in the case so, if the matter has not been relisted for mention within 15 days of delivery of this judgment, my order is that the plaintiff pay the costs of these proceedings.

The exhibits may be returned after 15 days from the pronouncement of these reasons unless a party applies to the court in the meantime, in which case they shall be held until further order.
