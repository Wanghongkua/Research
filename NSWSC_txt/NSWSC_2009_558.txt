IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
SCHMIDT AJ 
Friday, 19 June 2009 /04 ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES versus MICHAEL BAR-MORDECAI 
JUDGMENT HER HONOUR: Mr Bar-Mordecai moves on a further amended notice of motion of 23 April 2009. The original motion was supported by an affidavit sworn by
Mr Bar-Mordecai on 24 February 2009, in which he explained that he was declared a vexatious litigant by the Supreme Court on 25 February 2005 (see
Attorney-General in and for the State of New South Wales versus Bar-Mordecai <case> Mr Bar-Mordecai seeks leave to file a notice of appeal pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) against judgments of the Medical Tribunal given on 21 January 2009 and 18 March 2009.
These judgments flowed from an inquiry conducted by the Tribunal under the [Medical Practice Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) into Mr
Bar-Mordecai's application to seek re-registration as a medical practitioner.
Mr Bar-Mordecai had been de-registered in 2000 by order of the Tribunal (see
In Re Dr Michael Jacob Bar-Mordecai and the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) (Medical Tribunal of New South Wales, 6 September 2000, unreported)). The
Tribunal's judgment was the subject of an unsuccessful appeal (see Bar-
Mordecai versus Health Care Complaints Commission <case> The orders which Mr Bar-Mordecai wishes to pursue are: That the judgments of the Tribunal dated 21.01.2009 and 18.03.2009 in
Bar-Mordecai versus NSW Medical Board matter no. 40015/07 be set aside.
 That the Court of Appeal make an order under [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s69.html) of the [Supreme [Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to have the Tribunal to re-determine the issue in accordance with the law; or That the Court of Appeal in the alternative make a Reinstatement Order without any conditions.
 Costs.
 The January 2009 decision was that of the Chairman of the Tribunal,
Murrell J, when her Honour refused to disqualify herself from hearing Mr
Bar-Mordecai's application, on grounds of apprehended bias. The March judgement was the Tribunal's judgment dismissing Mr Bar-Mordecai's application for registration. (See Re Mr Bar-Mordecai [2009] NSWMT 1).
 The motion which Mr Bar-Mordecai originally filed in February 2009 was only concerned with Murrell J's January disqualification judgment. The motion was later amended when the Medical Tribunal gave its substantive decision in
March. The question of costs in those proceedings remained outstanding; that application was listed for hearing in May.
 The draft notice of appeal in respect of which Mr Bar-Mordecai now seeks leave, indicates that the grounds of appeal which Mr Bar-Mordecai wishes to pursue are twofold. Firstly, apprehended bias exhibited by Judge Murrell and the second, bias. Mr Bar-Mordecai explained that the apprehended bias complaint related to both judgments and that the actual bias complaint was directed to the Tribunal's March decision.

The requirements of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) The application is governed by the [Vexatious Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/), which provides in [s :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) Application for leave to institute proceedings 
This section applies to a person (the applicant) who is: subject to a vexatious proceedings order prohibiting the person from instituting proceedings, or acting in concert with another person who is subject to an order referred to in paragraph (a).

The applicant may apply to an appropriate authorised court for leave to institute proceedings that the order would otherwise prohibit the person from instituting.

The applicant must file an affidavit with the application that: lists all occasions on which the applicant has applied for leave: under this section, or before the commencement of this section--as required by an order under section 70 of the [Land and Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) or section 84 of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), and lists all other proceedings the applicant has instituted in Australia, including proceedings instituted before the commencement of this section, and discloses all facts material to the application, whether supporting or adverse to the application, that are known to the applicant.

The applicant must not serve a copy of the application or affidavit on any person unless: an order is made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s16.html) (1) , and the copy is served in accordance with the order.

An appropriate authorised court may dispose of the application by: dismissing the application under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s15.html), or granting the application under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s16.html) 
Despite any other Act or law, the applicant may not appeal from a decision disposing of the application.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai's application must be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s15.html) and [s 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s16.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/), which provide: Dismissing application for leave 
An appropriate authorised court must dismiss an application made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) for leave to institute proceedings if it considers: the affidavit required by [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) (3) does not substantially comply with that subsection, or the proceedings are vexatious proceedings, or there is no prima facie ground for the proceedings.

The application may be dismissed even if the applicant does not appear at the hearing of the application.
 Granting application for leave 
Before an appropriate authorised court grants an application made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) for leave to institute proceedings, it must: order that the applicant serve each relevant person with a copy of the application and affidavit and a notice that the person is entitled to appear and be heard on the application, and give the applicant and each relevant person an opportunity to be heard at the hearing of the application.

At the hearing of the application, the court may receive as evidence any record of evidence given, or affidavit filed, in any proceedings in any
Australian court or tribunal in which the applicant is, or at any time was, involved either as a party or as a person acting in concert with a party.

The court may grant leave to institute proceedings subject to the conditions that the court considers appropriate.

However, the court may grant leave only if it is satisfied that: the proceedings are not vexatious proceedings, and there are one or more prima facie grounds for the proceedings.

In this section: relevant person, in relation to the applicant for leave to institute proceedings, means each of the following persons: the person against or in relation to whom the applicant proposes to institute the proceedings, the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, the appropriate registrar for the authorised court that made the vexatious proceedings order concerned if the registrar applied for the order in relation to the applicant, any person referred to in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) (4) or (e): who applied for a vexatious proceedings order in relation to the applicant, and who the appropriate authorised court dealing with the application considers should be served, any person: who made an application in relation to the applicant under section 70 of the [Land and Environment Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/laeca1979274/) or section 84 of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) before the commencement of this section, and who the appropriate authorised court dealing with the application considers should be served.
 This application is at the first stage which these provisions contemplate.
In Attorney General for State of New South Wales versus Bar-Mordecai <case>, Johnson J observed that: It seems clear from [s.15(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s15.html), that an ex-parte hearing of the application at the first stage will take place in open court. However, given the structure of the provisions in [ss.14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s14.html)-[16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s16.html), it might be expected that a brief oral hearing is envisaged, at which the only questions to be determined are whether the application ought be dismissed or, alternatively, whether more detailed argument ought occur following service of the application on affected persons, in the form of a contested hearing in open court under [s.16(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s16.html) of the Act.
 When the matter came before Hall J in March 2009, however, there was an appearance for the Attorney General, who had been served with Mr Bar-
Mordecai's motion. His Honour gave various directions about the service of certain documents and steps to be taken by the parties. At that time there was no transcript available of the proceedings before the Medical Tribunal, when the disqualification application was refused. His Honour took the view that the hearing of Mr Bar-Mordecai's motion should not proceed until the transcript was available, given the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/).
 In his Honour's view it was necessary for the Court to understand the basis of the approach taken by Murrell J, in refusing the disqualification application. His Honour accepted that if Mr Bar-Mordecai wished to press his application in the absence of the transcript, he could do so. He suggested, however, that such an approach would not assist Mr Bar-Mordecai, given the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html) and also suggested that steps be taken to expedite the production of the transcript of the proceedings before the Tribunal.
 The parties agreed that the hearing of the application should await the production of the transcript and the hearing was adjourned to 20 March. It was then further adjourned until April, because on 18 March 2009 the Medical
Tribunal gave its decision on Mr Bar-Mordecai's application for a review of the de-registration order made by the Medical Tribunal in 2000. The Tribunal refused Mr Bar-Mordecai's application and pursuant to [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s64.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), ordered that there be no review for three years. There were further delays while various transcripts were obtained. The final transcript relied on was filed on 11 June.
 Against that background, I turn to consider the matters which the parties argued.

Mr Bar-Mordecai's affidavits - [s 14(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html)­ and [15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html)(1)(a) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) The original affidavit in support of Mr Bar-Mordecai's application was that of 24 February 2009. It was supplemented by two further affidavits of 28
April and 7 May 2009. Mr Bar-Mordecai outlined the proceedings in which he has been involved, as well as those in which he is currently involved, as [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) required. As to what [s (3)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) required of him, he deposed to matters of background to his application, referred to his personal circumstances, what had transpired in the proceedings before the Medical Tribunal and why he sought to pursue his re-registration as a medical practitioner.
 It is Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence that he has become destitute as the result of his deregistration and the litigation in which he has been involved in the ensuing years. Beforehand, he was a registered general practitioner in private practice earning a significant income, owning considerable assets. He now resides with his aged parents and his income is a Centrelink Carer's benefit.
He owes the plaintiff and others substantial amounts, as the result of costs orders made against him in various proceedings. In the proceedings before the
Tribunal, he had sought to be re-registered as a medical practitioner. His application failed and he now faces a further period of three years deregistration, as the result of a judgment which he regards as being wrong and oppressive.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai explained that he wished to pursue his application to the
Court of Appeal, given his view that the Tribunal's conclusions evidenced bias, because they were erroneous; rested on material which was not before the
Tribunal; and ignored relevant evidence, as well as the provisions of the
Medical Board's policies, in relation to which the review proceedings were being conducted.
 There was no case advanced by the plaintiff that what Mr Bar-Mordecai advanced was not a sufficient basis to satisfy what [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) required of him. I, too, am satisfied that there is no basis for dismissing his application, for failure to comply with [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s14.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), having considered what has been advanced in the affidavits.
 [Section 15(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s15.html) - are these proceedings vexatious proceedings? The term 'vexatious proceedings' is defined in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s6.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) as: Meaning of "vexatious proceedings" 
In this Act, vexatious proceedings includes: proceedings that are an abuse of the process of a court or tribunal, and proceedings instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for another wrongful purpose, and proceedings instituted or pursued without reasonable ground, and proceedings conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose.
 The onus falls on Mr Bar-Mordecai to establish that the proceedings are not vexatious, as [s (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html) contemplates (see the discussion of Johnson J in Attorney General for State of New South Wales versus Bar-Mordecai).
 It was argued for the Attorney General that the proposed application in this case would amount to an abuse of process. This followed, it was submitted, from the frequency with which Mr Bar-Mordecai has made allegations of bias against judicial officers. Attention was drawn to the observations of
Mason P in Bar-Mordecai versus Rotman  <case>;
Bar-Mordecai versus Hillston  <case> at <case> - [12]. Reference was also made to complaints of bias brought against Patten
J, Bryson J, Einstein J; Sheller, Giles and Stein JJA, and Murrell
J and Rein J. In his own court documents, Mr Bar-Mordecai referred to having referred twenty one Australian judicial officers to the International Criminal
Court.
 This was argued for the Attorney General to provide a basis for the view that Mr Bar-Mordecai makes allegations of judicial bias on every occasion that he is unsuccessful in proceedings to which he is a party. Mr Bar-Mordecai denied that this was factually correct, referring to other proceedings in which he had been involved before Cohen J, Barr J, McCallum J, Watts
J, Windeyer J, Patten J and a host of other judicial officers over the years, where he had not succeeded in the applications he had made, but where he had not made complaints of bias.
 Reference was also made for the Attorney General to the Medical Tribunal's
March judgment, where it dealt with evidence before it of an assault on a judicial officer which Mr Bar-Mordecai had contemplated in the past, as well as a view that litigants should not to be held responsible for such an assault, if it occurs. This view has been developed by Mr Bar-Mordecai into a proposed 'battered litigant syndrome'. Expert evidence had been received about these matters, but the Tribunal's judgment finally did not turn on this issue.
 In the submissions which Mr Bar-Mordecai advanced, there were, it must be accepted, a dismaying number of arguments addressed to a view of what Mr Bar-
Mordecai perceives to be past judicial misconduct, by various judicial officers, not directly relevant to his application in this case.
 No doubt Mr Bar-Mordecai holds the views which he is presently pursuing in relation to the past conduct of various judicial officers in forums which include the International Criminal Court, for reasons which appear to him to be good ones. Nevertheless, it has to be said that the intemperate language in which Mr Bar-Mordecai advanced certain submissions about matters of no direct relevance to this application, was of no assistance at all to his case.
 Nevertheless, given what this application is ultimately concerned with, namely Mr Bar-Mordecai's pursuit of an application for re-registration as a medical practitioner, it is not appropriate, in my view, to refrain from giving proper consideration to those arguments which Mr Bar-Mordecai advances in support of his application for leave, which may have some foundation, because he also advances submissions which do not assist him. Proper account must be taken of the fact that while he is not only a frequent litigant and one who has been declared a vexatious litigant, Mr Bar-Mordecai is also an unrepresented litigant. Properly, no different approach was urged for the
Attorney General.
 That is consistent with the approach adopted in Bar-Mordecai versus Rotman;
Bar-Mordecai versus Hillston. There, Mason P referred at [7] to 'a plethora of baseless, often scandalous, allegations of judicial bias', but nevertheless then went on to consider and deal with what Mr Bar-Mordecai had there argued were incompatible conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal in two judgments, one finding that a de facto relationship had existed with A and the other that it had not.
 It was also here argued, however, that Mr Bar-Mordecai's submissions showed that he was now attempting to re-litigate matters already determined in other proceedings, particularly the correctness and legality of the original decision of the Medical Tribunal in 2000, when he had been deregistered. The
Court of Appeal dealt with the appeal of that decision in Bar-Mordecai v
Health Care Complaints Commission. It was argued for the Attorney General to be an abuse of process for Mr Bar-Mordecai to now seek to raise issues dealt with in those proceedings, afresh in these proceedings. (See Blair versus Curran,
Curran and Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd versus Blair <case>; [(1939) 62 CLR 464.)] The difficulty with that argument, it seemed to me, was that the Medical
Tribunal's 2000 decision and the basis upon which it was reached, were squarely before the Tribunal in the 2008 proceedings in which Mr Bar-Mordecai sought re-registration. The legislative scheme expressly provided for this in [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), which provided: 
A Inquiry into review application 
A review under this Division is a review to determine the appropriateness, at the time of the review, of the order concerned.
 
The review is not to review the decision to make the order, or any findings made in connection with the making of that decision, unless significant fresh evidence is produced that was not previously available for consideration, and the appropriate review body is of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the case, the decision to make the order, or any finding on which the decision was based, should be reconsidered.
 
In addition to any other matter that the review may take into account, the review must take into account any complaint made or notified to the Board about the person, whether the complaint was made or notified before or after the making of the order that is the subject of the review and whether or not the complaint was referred under Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/index.html#p4) or any other action was taken on the complaint.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai sought such a review of the 2000 decision during the course of the hearing before the Tribunal, seeking to rely on a decision of the Court of Appeal in Bar-Mordecai versus Hillston where, contrary to the view reached by the Medical Tribunal in 2000, the Court of Appeal had concluded that Mr Bar-
Mordecai had been in a de facto relationship with the patient (A), whose sister had made the complaint against him in 1999, which had led to the 2000
Medical Tribunal proceedings and his deregistration.
 The [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html) application was considered and refused by Murrell J, who, it would appear, took the view that it raised a question of law which fell to her Honour to decide, consistently with [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). The application was refused by her Honour, it was later explained in the
Tribunal's March judgment at [16], because: ... the Court of Appeal's decision was not 'fresh evidence'. The material before the Court of Appeal was previously available for consideration.
Consequently, the Tribunal could not review the decision for findings of the Tribunal.
 The Tribunal went on to explain that: . The 2000 Tribunal's decision did not depend upon whether the relationship between Mr Bar-Mordecai and A was a de facto relationship: p2.9 of the reasons for judgment.
The status of Mr Bar-Mordecai's relationship with A (whether it was a de facto relationship or fell short of that status) is not important to the findings of this Tribunal. Nor is this Tribunal influenced by the propriety or otherwise of financial dealings that occurred more than 15 years ago between
Mr Bar-Mordecai and A. The Court of Appeal's findings do not affect this
Tribunal's opinion about Mr Bar-Mordecai's past boundary transgressions and do not significantly impact on the critical issue of whether he now has a sufficient appreciation of the boundaries of the doctor/ patient relationship.
 The Tribunal then turned to consider, under the heading 'Understanding of
Doctor/Patient Boundaries', the question of whether Mr Bar-Mordecai had demonstrated that he now had an understanding and acceptance of the rule that it is improper for a doctor to treat his or her de factor partner, at [22] to [36]. That was the consideration upon which the Tribunal's refusal of Mr Bar-
Mordecai's application turned.
 The proceedings taken by Mr Bar-Mordecai before the Medical Tribunal in involved an application for re-registration which he was entitled to make, given the terms on which he was deregistered by the Medical Tribunal in , which precluded him from seeking re-registration until 2007. What arose for consideration in the review proceedings under [s
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html), was the appropriateness of the order made in the 2000 judgment, at the time of the 2008/09 review.
 It followed from [s
A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html) that Mr Bar-Mordecai was also entitled to ask the Medical Tribunal to review the decision to make the 2000 deregistration order, or any findings made in connection with the making of that decision, if he was able to produce 'significant fresh evidence' not previously available for consideration.
 That Mr Bar-Mordecai believed that a decision of the Court of Appeal in , which had concluded that he had a de facto relationship with A, which he had been unable to convince the Medical Tribunal in 2000 had existed, was significant, fresh and previously unavailable evidence, does not seem surprising. Whether he was correct in that opinion, is a different matter, but the making of that review application, it seems to me, does not involve any re-litigation of matters already dealt with, as the Attorney General argued.
 The Medical Tribunal had never before had occasion to consider the Court of
Appeal's 2004 decision, nor the basis upon which it was reached. [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html) permitted Mr Bar-Mordecai to raise that issue before the Tribunal and once raised, the Tribunal was obliged to determine it.
 In these proceedings, Mr Bar-Mordecai does not seek to appeal the
Tribunal's conclusion, but seeks to rely upon it, to establish the bias about which he wishes to complain. That is also not a matter which has previously been litigated.
 The Attorney General accepted that while there was no right of appeal from the Tribunal's judgment under the statutory scheme established by the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), a party to such review proceedings was entitled to bring an appeal with respect to a point of law, during the course of an inquiry being conducted by the
Tribunal, with leave (see [s (2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html) It must follow, in my view, that the application made by Mr Bar-Mordecai under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html) in relation to the Medical Tribunal's 2000 decision cannot have been an abuse of process. He was entitled to seek such a review, if he could establish that significant, fresh and previously unavailable evidence not previously considered, existed. He was unable to convince Murrell J that it did. Not having been granted leave to appeal that decision during the course of the inquiry, Mr Bar-Mordecai accepted he had no right to appeal either the merit of the decision, nor even the question of law determined by Murrell J.
 Nevertheless, he seeks to establish bias, having regard to this, as well as other aspects of the Tribunal's judgment. I will return to consider this further in the context of [s15(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s15.html), but, in my view, the mere fact that Mr Bar-Mordecai has the view that there was bias in the Medical Tribunal proceedings cannot, at this stage of these proceedings, lead to the conclusion that this application is an abuse of process.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai is a pensioner who wishes to resume his former profession as a medical practitioner, having been precluded from doing so since 2000, as the result of the Medical Tribunal's 2000 order. He was unsuccessful in his application for re-registration, given the conclusions reached by the
Tribunal in 2009 that he lacked the necessary good character, for such an order to be made. He is plainly dissatisfied with the Tribunal's decision, for various reasons which he has sought to explain. He accepts that under the statutory scheme, he has no general right to appeal the merits of the
Tribunal's decision, but seeks to pursue such rights which do exist, including those granted by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). That section provides: Proceedings in lieu of writs 
Where formerly: the Court had jurisdiction to grant any relief or remedy or do any other thing by way of writ, whether of prohibition, mandamus, certiorari or of any other description, or in any proceedings in the Court for any relief or remedy any writ might have issued out of the Court for the purpose of the commencement or conduct of the proceedings, or otherwise in relation to the proceedings, whether the writ might have issued pursuant to any rule or order of the Court or of course, then, after the commencement of this Act: the Court shall continue to have jurisdiction to grant that relief or remedy or to do that thing; but shall not issue any such writ, and shall grant that relief or remedy or do that thing by way of judgment or order under this Act and the rules, and proceedings for that relief or remedy or for the doing of that thing shall be in accordance with this Act and the rules.

Subject to the rules, this section does not apply to: the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, any writ of execution for the enforcement of a judgment or order of the
Court, or any writ in aid of any such writ of execution.

It is declared that the jurisdiction of the Court to grant any relief or remedy in the nature of a writ of certiorari includes jurisdiction to quash the ultimate determination of a court or tribunal in any proceedings if that determination has been made on the basis of an error of law that appears on the face of the record of the proceedings.

For the purposes of subsection (3), the face of the record includes the reasons expressed by the court or tribunal for its ultimate determination.

Subsections (3) and (4) do not affect the operation of any legislative provision to the extent to which the provision is, according to common law principles and disregarding those subsections, effective to prevent the Court from exercising its powers to quash or otherwise review a decision.
 Dissatisfaction with the Tribunal's decision and a desire to challenge it on available grounds, even in the case of a person such as Mr Bar-Mordecai, who has been declared a vexatious litigant, cannot, it seems to me, of itself be a basis for concluding that this application is an abuse of process.
 Such a declaration is not intended to deprive a person declared to be a vexatious litigant of all of his or her rights to pursue any and all legal proceedings before a court to which the declaration applies. It rather imposes a leave requirement, it must be accepted, in quite onerous terms, before such rights may be exercised in future. The fact that Mr Bar-Mordecai seeks to pursue what rights he may have in relation to his failure to achieve re- registration as a medical practitioner, cannot of itself be an abuse of process.
 Leave is sought to appeal to the Court of Appeal in relation to a decision upon which depends Mr Bar-Mordecai's right to resume the practice of a profession which he had engaged in for some 25 years before his deregistration. That is not a decision in respect of which Mr Bar-Mordecai has ever brought any other proceedings. I can see no general basis upon which it might be concluded that a desire to pursue the right to resume medical practice, involves an abuse of process in any general way, even if his application rests on allegations of bias. Such complaints certainly appear to have been raised by other litigants before the Tribunal (as to which see, for example Lindsay versus Health Care Complaints Commission (No 1) <case> at <case>).
 Undoubtedly, it is a fact that Mr Bar-Mordecai has made a significant number of earlier complaints about alleged bias in other proceedings. That does not mean that bias, whether apprehended or actual, could never arise in another case. In my view, in the circumstances here before the Court, the mere fact that Mr Bar-Mordecai has unsuccessfully alleged bias in other proceedings, is not a proper basis for concluding that this application involves an abuse of process.
 No other of the Attorney General's submissions were directed to the matters dealt with in the definition of 'vexatious proceedings'. On the material, I am satisfied that the proceedings which Mr Bar-Mordecai seeks to bring are not vexatious, as defined, even though this is another occasion upon which Mr Bar-
Mordecai seeks to show bias in those determining an application he has made.
 [Section 15(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s15.html) - are there prima facie grounds for the proceedings in relation to the Medical Tribunals' March decision, given the allegations of bias on which the application rests? 
Onus The onus imposed on Mr Bar-Mordecai under the [Vexatious Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) is a high one. In Hunter versus Commissioner of Police  <case>,
Pullin J had to consider applications brought under the [Vexatious
Proceedings Restriction Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consolact/vpra2002391/) (WA), where a similar onus is imposed by [s (5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consolact/vpra2002391/s6.html)
At [18], his Honour observed: To succeed on this application, <case> of the 2002 Act requires me to dismiss the application if there are no prima facie grounds for the proposed proceedings. The ordinary meaning of the words prima facie is "at first sight; on the face of it; as appears at first sight without investigation": North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation versus Queensland [(1996) CLR 595] at 615-616; Macquarie Dictionary. In the present context, the phrase "prima facie grounds" means, in my opinion, that there is a legal basis for the claim and that there is some evidence referred to in the affidavit in support of the application which, if accepted, would be capable of sustaining the proceedings: cf North Ganalanga (supra) at 639; May versus O'Sullivan <case>; [(1955) 92 CLR 654] at 658.
 Can it be concluded that this standard has been satisfied by Mr Bar-
Mordecai? Mr Bar-Mordecai does not appeal from the merits of the Tribunal's decision, even though he vehemently disagrees with the conclusions reached. This is because, as was common ground, there is no right of appeal from the Medical
Tribunal's judgments under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s90.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). The proceedings were not concerned with 'a person about whom a complaint is referred to the Tribunal', but with an application for the review of the
Tribunal's 2000 deregistration order. The application was brought under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s92.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). The
Act provides for no right of appeal, either on the merits of such a review, or even on a question of law.
 The supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) was, however accepted by the Attorney General as being available to Mr Bar-Mordecai and he seeks to pursue that right. It was also accepted that actual or apprehended bias can amount to jurisdictional error, so as to permit relief being granted. What was in issue was whether a prima facie basis for either apprehended or actual bias had been established, [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s15.html) imposing an onus on Mr Bar-Mordecai to establish such a case.
 As I have noted, the Attorney General also accepted that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) provides a right of appeal on questions of law, arising during the course of an inquiry before the Tribunal, including during a review such as here in question. Such an appeal would have required Murrell J's leave [(s (2)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html)
While Mr Bar-Mordecai believed that he had sought such leave, given the way in which he couched his request to her Honour and how she answered him, it is apparent that she did not understand that it was leave to appeal on a point of law pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html) which he was seeking. That is not to criticise either Mr Bar-Mordecai, nor
Murrell J, but to indicate that whatever be the reason, leave to appeal, if sought, was not granted, as [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html) required.
 Given the statutory scheme, it seems to me that such leave, if requested, would not lightly be refused, given that there is no right to appeal a decision on such a question of law, once the Tribunal's decision on the review is given. That is a curious and rather unsatisfactory feature of the appeal provisions of this statutory scheme (which has otherwise been discussed by the
Court of Appeal in Saville versus Health Care Complaints Commission & Anor <case> Nevertheless, in this case, leave to appeal was not granted.

The refusal of the [s
A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html) application I have earlier outlined what occurred in relation to this application. Mr
Bar-Mordecai's allegation of bias rested on her Honour's rejection of his application. Presumably Mr Bar-Mordecai put the judgment in question before the Tribunal. What other material was relied on to support the application is not clear, but the circumstances in which Mr Bar-Mordecai came to make the application are those which I have earlier set out.
 The Tribunal explained in its March decision that the reason for the view reached was that the Court of Appeal's 2004 findings were not 'fresh evidence'. Even if Murrell J was wrong in this conclusion, which has not been established, of itself that could not establish either apprehended, or actual bias.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai claimed by his analysis of the Medical Tribunal's decision, that the Tribunal's conclusion that he had not brought forward fresh evidence, as well as the Tribunal's factual findings and the inferences drawn from them, were in error in many significant ways. Being aggrieved with the decision reached, without more, cannot evidence bias. The Court of Appeal's observations in Bar-Mordecai versus Health Care Complaints Commission at [36] are binding in this respect. There it was said: A tribunal's preference for one witness's evidence over another cannot be the basis for any allegation of bias. That is the function of fact finding by a tribunal. Accordingly, that error of law, should it exist, has not been made out.
 Just as a preference for one witness's evidence over that of another, cannot be the basis of an allegation of bias, that being a matter of fact finding, a conclusion as to whether particular evidence is 'fresh' or not, in my view can likewise of itself not establish bias. Determining the question of whether or not the evidence sought to be relied on was fresh, was also a function which the Tribunal was obliged to exercise, given the application which Mr Bar-Mordecai had made.
 Something other than a conclusion contrary to that urged by Mr Bar-Mordecai had to be shown, if a prima facie case of bias was to be established. Nothing was relied on in this respect, which could have provided a basis for such a conclusion.

The application made under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) As well as the application Mr Bar-Mordecai made to have the Tribunal review the 2000 decision on the basis of fresh evidence, Murrell J also dealt with two other applications which Mr Bar-Mordecai made. I will deal with the disqualification application separately.
 At the outset of the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s92.html) review proceedings, Mr Bar-Mordecai sought of the Medical Tribunal that the decision under review be set aside, because of evidence which had emerged in 2002, which in his submission established that the decision of the Tribunal had not been made by the Tribunal, but by Campbell J, contrary to the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). The section provides: Decisions of the Tribunal 
The decision of the Chairperson or a Deputy Chairperson on any question of law or procedure arising during an inquiry or appeal at which the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson presides is the decision of the Tribunal for the purposes of the inquiry or appeal 
A decision supported by at least 3 members of the Tribunal with respect to a question (other than with respect to a point of law or procedure) arising during an inquiry or appeal before the Tribunal is the decision of the
Tribunal. If 2 members support the decision and 2 members oppose the decision, the decision of the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson presiding is the decision of the Tribunal.
 In the Tribunal's March 2009 decision it was noted that this application was rejected because: . As a matter of law, the Tribunal rejected that application.
First, [s154](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) of the Act does not confer the power that Mr Bar-Mordecai sought to invoke. Any attack on the bona fides of the 2000 decision must be made in the
Supreme Court. Second, when they signed the reasons for judgment, all Tribunal members purported to adopt the reasons and decision. There is no evidence that the adoption was anything other than genuine.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai seeks to rely on this aspect of the decision, to make out his bias case. That, it seems to me, is also a claim for which no prima facie basis was established.
 The [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) provided a right of appeal in relation to the 2000 decision which Mr Bar-
Mordecai exercised. He claims that subsequently, he obtained cogent evidence which cast doubt on the Tribunal's compliance in 2000 with the requirements imposed upon it by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) of that Act. It is clear from the provisions of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) that such a complaint is not a matter which the Parliament has empowered the
Medical Tribunal itself to deal with, in later proceedings brought under the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/).
 It seems to me that any failure to comply with the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) is a matter which might have been available to be relied on in the appeal against the Tribunal's decision which Mr Bar-Mordecai brought under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s90.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), if the evidence had then been available. Otherwise, Mr Bar-Mordecai would appear to have been left with whatever rights he might have had in relation to such a situation under the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). Such proceedings could not be pursued before the Medical Tribunal.
 It follows, in my view, that Murrell's J's decision on Mr Bar-Mordecai's s 154 application cannot provide any foundation for a complaint of bias, in relation to either Murrell J or the Medical Tribunal. As Murrell J concluded, the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) simply did not empower the Medical Tribunal to set aside the 2000 judgment, as Mr
Bar-Mordecai sought.
 It follows that no prima facie basis for this aspect of Mr Bar-Mordecai's case was established.

Factual findings As I have said, Mr Bar-Mordecai attacked the Tribunal's conclusions as being wrong and thereby exhibiting the bias which he seeks leave to pursue. If the Tribunal erred in its task of assessing the conflicting evidence before it, that could only amount to non-jurisdictional error. There is no right of appeal from such an error provided by the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), nor of itself, could such an error give rise to any relief under [s 69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/).
 For the Attorney General it was argued that it was not the case advanced by
Mr Bar-Mordecai that there was an absence of evidence for conclusions reached by the Medical Tribunal, or that the decision was irrational or unreasonable, to the standard required to constitute jurisdictional error, that being, it was conceded, a basis upon which relief under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) might be advanced.
 In his submissions in reply, however, as well as in his oral submissions,
Mr Bar-Mordecai explained that his case went to precisely such points. Mr Bar-
Mordecai argued that the Tribunal's judgment revealed that its findings were glaringly improbable, contrary to compelling inferences and incontrovertible facts, so as also to lead to the conclusion that there had been jurisdictional error (see Fox versus Percy <case>; [(2003) 214 CLR 118).] Mr Bar-Mordecai also argued that the Tribunal's judgment made it apparent that its decision had rested on evidence which he had withdrawn at the hearing and which was thus not available for the Tribunal's consideration.
(See Saville at [57]; Minister for Aboriginal Affairs versus Peko-Wallsend <case>; [(1986) 162 CLR 24] at 40).
 For the Attorney General it was submitted that before the Tribunal, Mr Bar-
Mordecai was cross examined on both his pleadings and affidavit evidence, as well as assertions made in submissions. Mr Bar-Mordecai gave evidence that he no longer adhered to views there expressed. The submission made against him was that what was contained in his pleadings, affidavits and submissions reflected his true belief and that the evidence which he gave in cross examination, that he had altered his opinions and so withdrew those aspects of his pleadings, affidavits and submissions, was opportunistic. That submission was ultimately accepted by a majority of the Tribunal, it concluding: . First, some Tribunal members consider that Mr Bar-Mordecai's belated "acceptance" of the rule that a practitioner should not treat his or her de facto partner was an opportunistic lie. For those members, the lie reflects adversely on his integrity.
 In light of the evidence on which Mr Bar-Mordecai advanced his argument in relation to factual findings, may it be concluded that he established a prima facie basis for his allegations of bias? The Tribunal's principal conclusions on Mr Bar-Mordecai's good character, namely, the 'capacity to intuitively recognise doctor/patient boundaries', on which its judgment turned, rested on evidence which it had earlier referred to under the heading 'Understanding of Doctor/Patient Boundaries'. The Tribunal expressed its decision in this way: . The Tribunal's decision does not turn on Mr Bar-Mordecai's competence, the absence of an appropriate "return-to-practice plan" or the
Tribunal's reservations about whether any such plan could be implemented.
Rather, the Tribunal is not satisfied that Mr Bar-Mordecai is a person of good character within the meaning of the Act. Inter alia, a person lacks the good character to practice medicine if he or she lacks the capacity to intuitively recognize doctor/patient boundaries and appreciate the reasons for those boundaries. Only true insight can provide adequate public protection. At most, Mr Bar-Mordecai has an intellectual understanding of the boundaries and a desire to avoid transgression.
The application is dismissed. Pursuant to [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s64.html) of the [Medical Practice Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), the
Tribunal orders that there be no review for three years.
 At the hearing of this application, given the way in which this issue emerged, the parties were given a further opportunity to consider the transcript of the proceedings before the Tribunal, in order to address the question of what had happened to affidavit evidence on which Mr Bar-Mordecai had initially relied, but which he claimed he had later withdrawn, so that his earlier evidence was no longer available to be relied on by the Medical
Tribunal, in the conclusions which it had reached.
 There were two obvious possibilities from what had been referred to.
Firstly, that Mr Bar-Mordecai had formally withdrawn, or not relied on the relevant parts of the affidavits in question, so that they were not before the
Tribunal by way of evidence. Alternatively, that in cross examination, Mr Bar-
Mordecai had recanted from those parts of his affidavit, giving oral evidence that he had altered the opinions which he had earlier expressed in his affidavits.
 If the correct situation were the former, then it would lend obvious support for Mr Bar-Mordecai's claim that the Tribunal was biased, that being evidenced from the fact that it had decided the case against him on material not even before it. If the situation was, however, the latter, with the result that both the affidavit material and Mr Bar-Mordecai's oral evidence were before the Tribunal, with it having to assess whether his oral evidence that he had altered his opinions should be accepted, notwithstanding his earlier affidavit evidence, then bias would be much more difficult to establish, because the foundation for Mr Bar-Mordecai's complaint in these proceedings would not have been established.
 In his submissions, Mr Bar-Mordecai pointed to cross examination where he was asked about allegations made in his pleadings, in relation to 'the second finding made on the de facto marriage issue was an acceptance of there being a de facto marriage for the prosecution of the applicant having written the medical certificate of cause of death' and his agreement that he had withdrawn that allegation. He also pointed to cross examination where he was asked about another allegation made in his pleadings, namely that 'the 2000 tribunal had demonstrated bias against you and your dissenting medical philosophy on the issue of a locked medical Schedule 8 storage facility'. He also agreed that he had withdrawn that part of his pleading.
 This, it was submitted by Mr Bar-Mordecai, showed that he had withdrawn 'his incompetent evidence and wrong submissions in relation to doctor/patient boundaries at the Tribunal hearing on 28 January 2008.' Mr Bar-Mordecai also referred to particular passages of evidence, to make out this part of his case. They were relatively short and it is convenient to reproduce them: a. T 240.29 - 39 with regard to withdrawal of the applicant's incompetent evidence: 
Q. So on that basis you're seeking to withdraw your sworn evidence in that affidavit that in fact in this case the tribunal should've accepted that your signing of the death certificate was not a problem? 
A. Sorry, I don't understand what your question is. Is it a question? 
Q. I'll rephrase it. So you are retracting the sworn evidence that you have given before this tribunal in your affidavit that in the circumstances of this case the tribunal ought to have accepted that you signing the medical certificate of cause of death was not problematic? You're asking the tribunal - you're withdrawing that evidence? 
A. I'm withdrawing that evidence.
 b. T 241.33-243.2 withdrawal of the Applicant's incompetent evidence: 
Q. Could you please turn over the page to paragraph 155 and in that paragraph in the last sentence you say, "Therefore in the absence of a de facto relationship the signing of a medical certificate of cause of death was not subject to ethical considerations on the tribunal findings of a personal and sexual relationship that was made"? 
A. That's wrong.

Q. Do you withdraw that as well? 
A. Yes, because it's not consistent with what I've just said.

Q. So you ask the Tribunal to withdraw that evidence that you gave on oath? 
A. That's right.

Q. Mr Bar-Mordecai would you please turn to page 52 of that affidavit. Do you see there in the first sentence you're referring to the fifth particular of the first complaint which is the particular in relation to the medical certificate as to cause of death and you can see there that in paragraph 140 and 141 you take issue with the tribunal's finding that it was inappropriate for you to sign the death certificate and you assert there that that was on the basis that you were - sorry, you say the tribunal had rejected the tribunal finding and therefore they should not have found it was inappropriate to sign the death certificate? 
A. No 
Q. Can you look at that evidence. Do you stand by that evidence? 
A. No, because it's wrong, obviously.

Q. And do you withdraw that evidence as well? 
A. Yes 
Q. Do you withdraw all of paragraph 140? 
A. Firstly, I don't think paragraph 140 was submitted.

Q. You're probably right. It's not been admitted.

A. So how can I withdraw something that's not admitted? 
Q. Well, the matter that you swore on oath Mr Bar-Mordecai and sought to have read and I'm cross-examining you on it? 
DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON 
Q. She is entitled to cross-examine you on that Mr Bar-Mordecai.

A. But do I need to withdraw it if it's not admitted? 
Q. Just answer her question. In other words looking at it and commenting on it.

RICHARDSON 
Q. You have sworn paragraphs 140 and 141 on oath and sought to have them read in November 2008, do you now looking at the content of those paragraphs do you stand by the statements you made there or do you seek to withdraw them? 
A. I seek to withdraw them. 
Q. In relation to paragraph 142 you state that the tribunal showed a flagrant inconsistency in relation to particular 5, do you see that? 
A. Yes.

Q. Do you seek to withdraw that as well? 
A. Yes.

Q. And in the last sentence at paragraph 143 you allege that in relation to particular 5 there was a wilful perversion of the administration of the course of justice? 
A. I withdraw all that. There was no mis-administration of the course of justice with regard to particular 5, with a caveat that only occurred in one instance and wasn't regular activity that I indulged in, so it only occurred once and there's case law to say that the tribunal can't indict someone for just doing something one occasion, but it's go to show that there's repetition of that sort of modus operandi.
 c. At T 244.36 - 47 withdrawal of the Applicant's incompetent evidence: 
Q. So you've rethought the matter since 14 October 2008 is that right? 
A. Yes 
Q. And you've rethought the matter since 10 November 2008 when you read the affidavit saying the exact opposite, is that correct? 
A. I can tell you what my insight is now. 
Q. No I'm just asking you, you took a position on 14 October 2008 and you took a position on 10 November 2008 when you read affidavits containing particular points of you(sic). You're now seeking to suggest - you are asking the Tribunal to withdraw that evidence on oath? 
A. That's correct.
 d. T 285.32 - 287.22 withdrawal of the Applicant's incompetent evidence and submissions: 
Q. Mr Bar-Mordecai in relation to particular 5 which is the particular dealing with the medical certificate, I just want to go back to that for a moment? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Do you recall that on the first day of the hearing in these proceedings on November you handed up some submissions entitled Applicant's Opening Speech to the Review Tribunal? 
A. Yes 
Q. Do you still rely on those submissions? 
A. Only in part now, and the reason is that - only in part. 
Q. Only in part? 
A. Only in part. 
Q. Why is that? 
A. Why is that, because some of it is actually wrong. 
Q. Some of it-- 
A. Some of the submissions are wrong, so I've given the tribunal four-page submissions, I'm going to make a final 1 and a half hour I believe presentation on my submissions and I think those are the submissions that the tribunal will consider. That's just an opening and it's superseded by the actual evidence at the hearing and the submissions that I make now. 
Q. Mr Bar-Mordecai you agree with me that in those opening submissions to the tribunal you submitted that the fifth particular remained unproved? 
A. Yes that's wrong. 
Q. That's what you submitted? 
A. That's wrong. 
Q. So you've changed your position since your opening submissions to the tribunal? 
A. That's correct. 
Q. Do you agree with me in your opening submissions you said that the reason why the fifth particular remained unproved was on the basis that "at the time of the patient's death on or about 25 June 1994 the practitioner was in a de facto marriage with the patient"? 
A. That's wrong because there couldn't have been a logical reason for me signing that certificate in terms of being in a relationship other than a doctor/patient with -- 
Q. Mr Bar-Mordecai you agree with that's what your submissions state? 
A. That's what it stated, but it was wrong. 
Q. So I'm just trying to understand; yesterday you gave evidence when you withdrew various statements on oath and you're now withdrawing these submissions, you suggest that you developed insight at some point. Are you suggesting that this change in insight happened sometime after you stood up and put forward opening submissions to this tribunal? 
A. I think it was more formalised after that time, yes. 
Q. You would agree with me that the submission you made in your opening submissions in relation to the medical certificate shows a lack of understanding of the tribunal's findings against you in relation to the medical certificate? 
A. Yes I agree totally, that's why I've withdrawn it. That's my insight. If I didn't have insight I'd stick to it. 
Q. Sorry what was that last sentence? 
A. If I didn't have the insight I'd stick to that submission, but I have the insight. Once you gain the insight the duration of the insight I don't think is of that import as having the actual insight, and that's what treatment by a doctor is all about, gaining insight. I've got the insight and in terms of having the insight the likelihood of re-offending is marginally or greatly reduced, re-offending, once I have the insight. But if I didn't have the insight and I kept on with those submissions then you'd have something to talk about. But the fact that I've gained the insight and I can see the errors of my way, even if it was yesterday, it shows that the potential of me re- offending is nil. 
Q. So you're asking the tribunal to accept your recent change in evidence that even though you've had -- 
A. No that's not evidence a submission, a submission is a submission, it doesn't -- 
Q. Mr Bar-Mordecai yesterday you withdrew statements made on oath? 
A. Yes. 
Q. You are asking this tribunal to accept that even though you have made statements on oath and in submissions attacking various findings of the tribunal that because you have gained insight sometime in November or December a few months ago that is enough for the tribunal to place weight on that you in fact have genuine insight? 
A. Yes. 
Q. That's your submission? 
A. That's your submission, you have to wait for my submission. 
Q. Sorry, that is your position? 
A. That's my position. e. T 295.1 295.45 withdrawal of the incompetent evidence: 
Q. My next question Mr Bar-Mordecai is, do you agree that in your first affidavit of 30 August 2007 on page 21 you state "the tribunal" this tribunal "ought to readily accept that I have been subject to the uncalled for embarrassment and humiliation of public ridicule with the attendant grave damage to my reputation in the eyes of my former patients friends medical colleagues and the consequent lowering of my status in the community by virtue of the (1) contrived findings of the Medical Tribunal with regard to
Particular 1, Particular 2, Particular 3, Particular 4, Particular 5 and
Particular 6". Would it help you if I showed you that affidavit? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Do you recall swearing that on oath? 
A. Yes.

Q. Do you see that on page 21? 
A. Yes. 
Q. I put it to you that what you swore on oath then reflects your current genuine belief? 
A. No it doesn't - complaint one was that I had a sexual relationship with
Evelyn Hillston-- 
RICHARDSON: Your Honour I'm just asking whether he's seeking to-- 
DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Yes, all that was required was a no answer. 
RICHARDSON 
Q. Do you seek to withdraw that sworn evidence Mr Bar-Mordecai? 
A. Yes I do, in part. Do you want the parts? 
Q. If you could just tell me which bits you seek to withdraw, without explanation, just so that we know what you withdraw? 
A. Complaint 1 Particular 1. Complaint 1 Particular 3. I don't withdraw
Complaint 2. I just forget what Complaint 4 is - Particular-- 
Q. Complaint 4 related to the morphine? 
A. Morphine - I don't withdraw the morphine issue. I forget - the medical certificate, Complaint 5, I withdraw. And I think number 6 comprised of three different parts.  Mr Bar-Mordecai argued: . The Applicant submits that he relies on Ms Richardson submissions made on 29.1.2009 at: a. T 397.37-39 as to change of evidence and withdrawal of evidence: "The Board's submission that this very late change in evidence in the witness box where he sought to withdraw statements he'd made in voluminous affidavits and submissions" b. T 398.3-6 no evidence as to insight to demonstrate a change in character: 
There has been no evidence as to what Mr Bar-Mordecai has actually done to demonstrate his change in character or his insight into his conduct and it is submitted that he has fallen well short of the heavy onus that he bears. to show that the Medical Board conceded that the Applicant has withdrawn voluminous affidavits and submissions with regard to late change in evidence on the issue of doctor/patient boundaries without any written or oral objections by the Medical Board.
 . The Applicant submits that his evidence in relation to the true insight he displayed at the hearing with the appropriate reasoning, was the only evidence open for the Tribunal to rely on to make an analytic determination on his genuine doctor/patient boundary evidence which was embodied in the amended submissions filed with leave on 14 April 2009.
The Applicant submits that his pleadings, evidence and submissions relevant to insight prior to 10 November 2008, and his opening submissions in relation to his insight into doctor/patient boundaries, were all formally withdrawn on the 27 and 28 January 2009 without objection, and were therefore not open for the 2009 Tribunal to rely on in paragraph 61 of its judgment.
The Applicant submits that in relation to the true insight he displayed at the hearing with the appropriate reasoning, he relies on paragraph 38 of his amended submissions of 14 April 2009 to the Supreme Court in Attorney
General versus Bar-Mordecai matter no. 10622/04.
The Applicant apprehended bias and actual bias exhibited by the 2009
Tribunal in having relied on the doctor/patient boundary pleadings, evidence and submissions which were no longer before it.
 The relevant parts of the transcript, from which these extracts were taken, were tendered, it being the submission advanced for the Attorney General that they had to be considered in context.
 At an earlier stage of this hearing, Mr Bar-Mordecai had explained that he had not objected or responded to the submission that his evidence that he had altered his opinions was an opportunistic lie, on the basis that it wrongly represented what had transpired in the proceedings. Nor in his submissions had he argued before the Tribunal that the parts of the affidavit which he had 'withdrawn' were not in evidence and thus not available to be considered by the Tribunal, as it had been invited to do. The transcript bore this out. It also showed that he had been extensively cross examined about his withdrawal of the opinions in question.
 The submission advanced against Mr Bar-Mordecai was that: 
The next topic is Mr Bar-Mordecai as a witness. The Board's submission is that Mr Bar-Mordecai should be rejected as a witness of truth, which has been demonstrated in the inconsistencies in his oral evidence and demonstrated in the plain and stark inconsistencies between his written submissions and affidavits put before this Tribunal and his changes in evidence which evolved during his cross-examination. The tribunal will recall that in cross- examination when I put various matters that he had sworn on oath in affidavits and matters he had put in his opening submissions as to his current belief, when he looked at them in the witness box and realised that purpose why I was putting those statements to him, that they showed a lack of insight, he then sought to withdraw them. Notwithstanding the statements made in affidavits he had sworn on oath were true and notwithstanding a series of those statements were made in the opening submissions that he handed up to this Tribunal on the first day. Mr Bar-Mordecai during his evidence this week suggested for the first time that the point in time at which he had gained insight was some time in November or December 2008 after the commencement of the Tribunal proceedings. Today in closing he suggested that the day he gained insight was November 2008. That was the first day of the hearing and that was the day that I commenced my cross-examination Mr Bar-Mordecai. That is the day that I commenced putting the series of statements he'd made in affidavits and submissions to him, which plainly showed that he was attacking the findings of the Tribunal and did not accept those findings. The Board's submission that this very late change in evidence in the witness box where he sought to withdraw statements he'd made in voluminous affidavits and submissions and in other court proceedings is plainly not a genuine reflection of his belief but rather was an opportunistic change in the face of cross examination. It is submitted that the Tribunal could not accept Mr Bar-Mordecai's statements made for the first time under cross-examination and re-examination that he has insight and remorse without considering the voluminous affidavits, submissions, pleadings in other court matters and correspondence where he states the exact opposite. So the fundamental submission of the Board is that not only does Mr Bar-Mordecai not have insight into his conduct as found by the 2000 Tribunal but that in large part he does not accept that he engaged in improper conduct.
 Extensive reference was then made in the submissions put to the Tribunal to the exhibits and transcript, to support the argument that Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence in cross examination, that he had altered his opinions, ought not to be accepted.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai argued in his written submissions in these proceedings, that he had formally withdrawn his pleadings, evidence, submissions and opening submissions, given prior to 10 November 2008 in relation to his insight into doctor/patient boundaries, without objection on 27 and 28 January and so they were not open to the Tribunal to rely on, in paragraph [61] of its judgment. Mr Bar-Mordecai submitted that the evidence on which he relied, established that in his evidence he had demonstrated that he had true insight, with appropriate reasoning into doctor/patient boundaries.
 The transcript of the Tribunal proceedings showed that in his reply submissions, Mr Bar-Mordecai's case was: 
Yes. I think insight is very important and I think that there is a voluminous evidence where she says my insight is disingenuous, but I think my insight is real. I think I have had many sleepless nights about this matter. I think I have been angry at this matter, as expressed by Dr Roberts, and I think he is right in saying that. I think I have been hard done by, but I don't think that for any reason I would break the law or re-offend after what
I've gone through. And now I'm going to go through another allegation, a false allegation, of sexual abuse. There has been a false allegation of arrest, there has been a false allegation of malicious prosecution by the police and that came from someone from the Attorney General's Department as figured out by the magistrate who dismissed the case. It didn't come directly from the police.
 
So there has been various things that have happened that make me very suspicious, but I think in the past I've been a very good GP, and I think there's a scarcity of GPs in the community, and I think I would have a genuine role in putting my expertise in general practice for the benefit of the community, because I'm 62 and a half. I want you to assume that you say that in four years he can reapply. If I reapply in four years, that will make me age 66. The changes of being reintegrated into the workforce are practically zero. So, if I don't make it on this occasion, I doubt whether mentally, physically, and all the rest of it, I will be able to negotiate a re- application, especially in the knowledge that I'm not legally represented, because, if I was legally represented, you would have seen a completely different approach, I would imagine, and the anger has come through in a whole voluminous submissions and affidavits that I've made, but the anger is separate from the insight, and insight is understanding - and I've been through each of the particulars to show that I understand why, and that won't change on re-application i another three or four years. It will remain the same insight. The affidavits might change, I might have gone to courses and medical courses, I might do more study, I might publish research, but the basic insight that I have today won't change; it can't change. Either I have insight or I haven't got insight, and I think I've demonstrated to the tribunal, and especially after I attended a few medical tribunal hearings, as
I've said before, that that gave me even further insight to see how other people can cope with it- not just reading transcripts and judgments, but actually seeing how people responded in Medical Tribunal proceeding. Thank you.
 For the Attorney General it was submitted that in the circumstances before it, the Tribunal was not obliged to disregard the inconsistencies in Mr Bar-
Mordecai's pleadings, evidence and submissions and the answers which he gave in cross examination. The Tribunal was not bound by the rules of evidence (see [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s16.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/) and
Gorman versus Health Care Complaints Commission <case> at <case>).
Even if it was, Mr Bar-Mordecai could have been cross examined as he was on his affidavit evidence, even in relation to parts of it, which were not read.
Mr Bar-Mordecai had been cross examined on that material and the Tribunal was invited to consider whether his answers in cross examination should be accepted. His credit was in issue in the proceedings. It followed that the
Tribunal's conclusions on Mr Bar-Mordecai's prior inconsistent statements could not establish either jurisdictional, or appealable error, let alone bias. To the contrary, its findings were reasonably open in the face of the sudden and marked change in Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence.
 In resolving this controversy, it must be remembered that in 2000, amongst the questions which the Tribunal had to consider, was whether Mr Bar-Mordecai was not of good character, so as to warrant his deregistration, that being amongst the criteria specified in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s64.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/).
Correctly, it seems to me, given what arose in the re-registration application under [s
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s94a.html), namely 'the appropriateness, at the time of the review, of the order concerned' and what the parties joined issue over, in the review proceedings the Medical Tribunal again had regard to the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s64.html) criteria. The section provides: Tribunal can suspend or deregister in certain cases 
The Tribunal may by order suspend a person from practising medicine for a specified period or direct that a person be deregistered if the Tribunal is satisfied (when it finds on a complaint about the person): that the person is not competent to practise medicine, or that the person is guilty of professional misconduct, or that the person has been convicted of or made the subject of a criminal finding for an offence, either in or outside New South Wales, and the circumstances of the offence render the person unfit in the public interest to practise medicine, or that the person is not of good character.

The Tribunal must by order direct that a person be deregistered if the
Tribunal is satisfied (when it finds on a complaint about the person) that the person has contravened an order or condition of the person's registration that is a critical compliance order or condition under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s61.html) 
An order that a person be deregistered is an order that the person's name be removed from the Register or (if the person has already ceased to be registered) that the person not be re-registered.

If the Tribunal makes an order under this section in respect of a person and it is satisfied that the person poses a substantial risk to the health of members of the public, it may by order (a prohibition order) do any one or more of the following: prohibit the person from providing health services or specified health services for the period specified in the order or permanently, place such conditions as the Tribunal thinks appropriate on the provision of health services or specified health services by the person for the period specified in the order or permanently.

Note. [Section
AK](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pha1991126/s10ak.html) of the [Public Health Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pha1991126/) provides that it is an offence for a person to provide a health service in contravention of a prohibition order.

If the Tribunal is aware that a person in respect of whom it is proposing to make a prohibition order is registered under a health registration Act other than this Act, the Tribunal is, before making the prohibition order, to notify the board constituted under that other Act of the proposed order and give that board an opportunity to make a submission.

An order may also provide that an application for review of the order under Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pha1991126/index.html#p6) may not be made until after a specified time.
 In its March decision the Medical Tribunal observed that the issues which arose for its determination in the proceedings were: 
Issues . Having regard to his past boundary transgressions, has Mr Bar-Mordecai established that he is now a person of good character whom it is appropriate to reinstate as a medical practitioner? . Having regard to past lack of integrity, has Mr Bar-Mordecai established that he is now a person of good character whom it is appropriate to reinstate as a medical practitioner? . Having regard to the lack of skill and judgment associated with the administration of morphine to A and the fact that he has not practised since , is Mr Bar-Mordecai now competent to practise medicine? The Medical Tribunal went on to consider matters such as Mr Bar-Mordecai's understanding of patient confidentiality, integrity, other matters relating to good character, and his mental state and competence. The conclusions reached in the March judgment, which led the Tribunal to reject his application, finally rested on the question of good character, specifically the question of
Mr Bar-Mordecai's understanding of 'boundaries'.
 In order to demonstrate his allegations of bias, Mr Bar-Mordecai referred to the Medical Board's policies in respect of which this assessment was being made. On Mr Bar-Mordecai's case those policies provided as to sexual misconduct: 
Sexual Misconduct
It is an absolute rule that a medical practitioner who engages in sexual activity with a current patient is guilty of professional misconduct.
While not detracting from the fundamental impropriety of such activity, the sanction applied as a result of a finding of misconduct may vary according to the circumstances of each case.
Factors to be considered include the degree of dependence in the doctor/ patient relationship, evidence of exploitation, the duration of the professional relationship and the nature of the services provided.
The rule refers to current patients. The termination of the doctor/patient relationship prior to sexual activity may be raised as a defence, but its strength will be dictated by consideration of the factors referred to in paragraph 3, as well as the time lapse after the end of the professional relationship.
The rationale for the Board's position has been supported in many contexts by medical disciplinary authorities. Reasons for the rule include the following.
 a. The doctor-patient relationship depends upon the ability of the patient to have absolute confidence and trust in the doctor.
 b. The doctor is in a unique position regarding physical and emotional proximity. Patients are expected to disrobe and to allow doctors to examine them intimately.
 c. The doctor-patient relationship is not one of equality. In seeking treatment, the patient is vulnerable. Exploitation of the patient is an abuse of power.
 d. The doctor's role is one of authority by virtue of the patient seeking assistance and guidance.
 e. Breaches of the doctor-patient relationship have often caused severe psychological damage to the patient.
 f. The community expectation of the medical professional is one of utmost integrity. The community must be confident that personal boundaries will be maintained and that patients are not at risk.
 g. Improper sexual conduct by doctors brings community censure and damages the credibility of the medical professional as a whole.
 h. The onus is on the doctor to behave in a professional manner and it is unacceptable to seek to blame the patient if a sexual relationship develops.
 i. Personal involvement with the patient will often lead to clouding of judgement.
The guiding principle is that there be no exploitation of the patient or abuse of the doctor's power. Each case must be examined in relation to the degree of dependency between patient and doctor and the duration and nature of the professional relationship.
The Board rejects the view that changing social standards require a less stringent approach. The nature of the professional doctor/patient relationship must be one of absolute confidence and trust. It transcends social values and no standard other than the highest can be acceptable.
 The policy in relation to medical practitioners treating relatives and themselves, provided: 
Medical Practitioners Treating Relatives and Self 
August 2001 . Background .1 The New South Wales Medical Board is of the view that wherever possible, medical practitioners should avoid treating members of their immediate family, because in these circumstances; * Professional objectivity may be compromised and their judgment may be influenced by the nature of their relationship with the patient. * Medical practitioners may fail to explore sensitive areas when taking a medical history or may fail to perform an appropriate physical examination. * The patient may feel uncomfortable disclosing sensitive information or undergoing a physical examination when the medical practitioner is a family member. * Patient autonomy may be compromised when a medical practitioner treats a member of their family.
 * The principles of informed consent may not be adhered to when a medical practitioner treats a member of their family.
 .2 The Board is also of the view that all medical practitioners should have their own, independent General Practitioner . Policy 
The Board endorses the following general principles; .1 All medical practitioners should have their own, independent General
Practitioner.
 .2 It is not advisable for medical practitioners to initiate treatment (including prescribing) for themselves or immediate family members.
 .3 In emergency situations or isolated settings where there is no help available, medical practitioners may treat themselves or family members until another medical practitioner becomes available.
 .4 It is not advisable for medical practitioners to serve as primary or regular care providers for immediate family members, although there are circumstances in which they may work together with an independent medical practitioner to maintain established treatment.
 .5 It is not advisable for medical practitioners to issue certificates for themselves or members of their family.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai also referred to another policy, which is not relevant to the question of good character. His argument was that in the conclusion which it had reached, the Tribunal had not even had regard to these relevant policies. The Medical Tribunal's conclusions in the March judgment were: 
Understanding of Doctor/Patient Boundaries
In Exhibit B, which was created on or about 10 November 2008, Mr Bar-
Mordecai stated: "The Applicant submits that sex in the context of a doctor treating his/her patient is not acceptable [wrong] whatever type of relationship there is i.e. social, domestic, de facto marriage or marriage irrespective of how the relationship arose, because irrespective of the ethics involved, in the context of a personal [familial] and/or sexual relationship that a doctor has with a patient, such a relationship is more than likely to blunt the doctor's objectivity in the treatment of his/her patient and that applies to: 
A sexual partners; 
A family member.

Of course, there are exceptions, where a doctor is obliged to treat the patient, namely: 
Emergency situations ...

Of course, there are exceptions, where a doctor is not obliged to treat the patient, but may treat the patient namely: 
Non-emergency simple medical problems e.g. impetigo, cyst, 
Trivial complaints e.g. lipoma, acne"
As far as this Tribunal is aware, Exhibit B is the first occasion upon which Mr Bar-Mordecai has acknowledged the impropriety of a medical practitioner treating his/her de facto partner. Up to November 2008, Mr Bar-
Mordecai erroneously believed that it was acceptable for a practitioner to treat his/her de facto partner.
Mr Bar-Mordecai's erroneous belief was based on the following statement made by Judge Cooper on 16 July 1999, when refusing an adjournment of the 2000 hearing.
 "It may well be that if a medical practitioner gives treatment to his or her spouse, be it a legal spouse or a de facto spouse, that that medical practitioner is not guilty of any lack of ethics. But, if, on the other hand, the relationship of medical practitioner and patient brings about a sexual relationship in circumstances where it arises out of a breach or abuse of the power which a doctor has over the patient, then that can be quite a different matter."
Dr Roberts, Mr Bar-Mordecai's treating psychiatrist, confirmed Mr Bar-
Mordecai's earlier belief that, had it found that he was in a de facto relationship with A, the 2000 Tribunal would have reached a different conclusion.
Mr Bar-Mordecai overlooked the 2000 Tribunal's statement that the de facto status of his relationship with A was irrelevant to its decision: page .9 of the reasons for judgment.
Because of his erroneous belief, Mr Bar-Mordecai has been particularly incensed when judges or tribunals have failed to acknowledge his de facto partnership with A.
Despite the statement in Exhibit B, the review Tribunal feels profound disquiet about Mr Bar-Mordecai's current appreciation of doctor/patient boundaries.
The Medical Board submitted that Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence of belated acceptance of the rule that it is improper for a doctor to treat his or her de facto partner was an opportunistic lie. The Board referred to the many past statements of Mr Bar-Mordecai to the effect that it was not improper for a doctor to treat his/ her de facto partner, including statements made at the commencement of the review proceedings.
The Tribunal is divided on the issue of whether Mr Bar-Mordecai now has an intellectual understanding and acceptance of the rule.
Regardless of his or her view about whether Mr Bar-Mordecai has acquired an intellectual understanding and acceptance of "the letter of the law" in relation to doctor/patient boundaries, each member of the Tribunal is puzzled and troubled by Mr Bar-Mordecai's apparent lack of emotional insight or intuitive appreciation of doctor/ patient boundaries. It has been necessary to "tell" him that a practitioner must not provide ongoing treatment to close family or friends, including a de facto partner. A practitioner should intuitively "know" that any close personal relationship with a patient is likely to impair the practitioner's professional objectivity and may cause serious psychological injury to the patient.
Mr Bar-Mordecai's lack of intuitive understanding was starkly illustrated when he defended his conduct in relation to BL. For a brief period in 1985, he lived with BL in a sexual relationship. Well after the relationship ended,
BL's sister asked him to institute the process by which BL would be made an involuntary psychiatric patient, telling him that "ten other doctors" had declined involvement. Without seeing BL, based on knowledge gained during the relationship, statements by BL's sister and a belief that there was an "emergency", he acceded to the request. In evidence, Mr Bar-Mordecai asserted that the prior relationship did not blunt his objectivity. Rather, it gave him "more acute" insight into BL's psychiatric health and made him "more objective".
Dr Roberts agreed that Mr Bar-Mordecai's understanding of boundaries was intellectual rather than emotional or intuitive. He was not convinced that Mr
Bar-Mordecai had developed true insight into his conduct. However, he pointed out that intellectual understanding is the first step to gaining true insight.
Nevertheless, Dr Roberts considered that, if reinstated as a practitioner, Mr
Bar-Mordecai was unlikely to commit boundary transgressions.
Dr Phillips, the psychiatrist briefed by the Medical Board, agreed. He said that "fear of the big stick" would probably prevent transgressions.
However, Dr Phillips remained concerned about the possibility of future transgressions. His concern arose from the number of past transgressions and
Mr Bar-Mordecai's "struggle" to appreciate the impropriety of those transgressions. He said that Mr Bar-Mordecai lacked an appreciation of the bases of the findings of the 2000 Tribunal, and his insight regarding boundary violations was and remained unsatisfactory.
Those members of the Tribunal who believe that Mr Bar-Mordecai now has an intellectual understanding and acceptance of boundaries consider that nothing short of true insight is adequate. It is essential that a practitioner have true insight into doctor/patient boundaries in the sense that he or she can identify the boundaries and intuitively appreciate the damage that may result from boundary transgression. Because of the variety and complexity of boundary issues that may arise in practice, protection of the public requires that a practitioner have true insight into such issues.
All Tribunal members accept that Mr Bar-Mordecai "fears the big stick".
Consequently, if he was reinstated, it is most unlikely that he would knowingly transgress boundaries. However, in the absence of true insight, the
Tribunal is not satisfied that the public would be adequately protected against the possibility of transgression.
 It is clear that the Tribunal did not refer to the policies in its judgment. It was assessing Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence, by which he finally sought to show that he accepted what the policies required of medical practitioners, this being an alteration, it observed, of his prior stance.
 Undoubtedly, given the basis upon which the Tribunal's judgment turned, its assessment of Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence as to his understanding of doctor/patient boundaries was a crucial aspect of its consideration of his application for re-registration. That assessment rested in part on the question of whether his professed change in attitude during the course of the hearing could be believed, and also in part on whether he had a real understanding of these boundaries. On the Tribunal's approach, this was the difference between an intellectual understanding of what was required and 'true insight into such issues'.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai's allegations of bias, rested on his complaint that the
Tribunal had reached its conclusions by reference to evidence which was not before it. Having carefully considered Mr Bar Mordecai's submissions, I am satisfied that this was not established on the evidence, on a prima facie basis.
 The evidence does not show that the Tribunal decided what was before it on the basis of evidence which had been withdrawn and was no longer available to be considered by it. Mr Bar-Mordecai gave evidence in the proceedings and was cross examined. His credibility was challenged. It was argued against him that his withdrawal of the critical evidence was an opportunistic lie, not reflective of his true beliefs. It follows that this issue was one which arose squarely in the proceedings and required the Tribunal's determination, indeed, it was critical in the decision to which the Tribunal ultimately came.
 Having considered what Mr Bar-Mordecai has advanced, I am satisfied that it must be concluded that the Tribunal did not err in the way he complained. It was entitled, indeed obliged, to resolve the question of whether or not his withdrawal of critical opinions, whether expressed in pleadings, evidence or submissions, should be believed.
 As the March decision showed, the issue was a difficult one for the
Tribunal to resolve. As the Court of Appeal has observed, fact finding is a function which the Tribunal was obliged to engage in. It was obliged to determine whether Mr Bar-Mordecai's evidence should be accepted, his evidence and its truthfulness being put in issue. Finding against him, of itself, cannot establish a prima facie case of bias. On the material relied on, Mr
Bar-Mordecai has not shown, on a prima facie basis, that the Tribunal's findings were glaringly improbable, contrary to compelling inferences and incontrovertible facts, so as to lead to the conclusion that there had been jurisdictional error, as he argued.
 It follows that it must be concluded that Mr Bar-Mordecai has not established a prima facie case of bias in relation to these aspects of the
Tribunal's March judgment. Mr Bar-Mordecai's application for leave in respect of this decision must be refused.
 To support his case Mr Bar-Mordecai also referred to what the Tribunal observed under the heading 'Competence' in relation to his failure to call evidence from his brother. There it was observed that: 
Competence
Mr Bar-Mordecai still maintains that the administration of a 30mg dose of morphine to A was appropriate. He has described the 2000 Tribunal's finding in relation to the dosage as a "bogus finding of fact" and a "wilful perversion of the course of justice". However, he says that he now appreciates that the prevailing view is otherwise. Consequently, if reinstated, he would not administer a 30mg dose of morphine but would dose in 5mg increments.
Since 2000, Mr Bar-Mordecai has updated his medical knowledge by researching and creating a computerized information system based on symptoms, signs and test results. The system is designed to enable practitioners to make differential diagnoses. Dr Phillips described the system as "very interesting" and "quite impressive", while noting that it had not yet been peer reviewed.
Dr Roberts considered that Mr Bar-Mordecai's theoretical knowledge is comparable to that of other general practitioners because of his many years of experience and the research associated with his computerised information system. However, he would need some retraining and may benefit from general practitioner supervision.
Dr Phillips said that, if Mr Bar-Mordecai was reinstated, initially he should practice in a hospital environment, where he could be closely supervised.
Mr Bar-Mordecai did not propose a firm "return-to-practice plan".
Mr Bar-Mordecai has significant interaction with his brother, who is a general practitioner. They discuss professional issues. Mr Bar-Mordecai said that, if allowed to return to practice, he may practice with his brother.
Unfortunately, Mr Bar-Mordecai's brother did not give evidence. There was no confirmation that he was willing to supervise Mr Bar-Mordecai.
It is nine years since Mr Bar-Mordecai engaged in general practice.
General practice involves clinical skills as well as intellectual knowledge.
Any appropriate "return-to-practice plan" would include supervision. Mr Bar-
Mordecai considers himself to be highly skilled and more knowledgeable than an average general practitioner. He considers hospital medicine to be irrelevant to general practice. The Tribunal doubts that he would accept -- let alone embrace -- close supervision, either in a hospital environment or in a general practice environment.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai complained that in this respect, the Tribunal had again failed to have regard to the applicable policy, which precluded supervision by a family member. He also complained that in reaching its conclusions the
Tribunal had ignored evidence that in August 2008 he had approached the
Medical Tribunal through Justice Blanch, in order to obtain approval to sit with a GP for eight hours a day, which was refused, but which showed his intention, in a practical way, of re-establishing his skills.
 Of all of Mr Bar-Mordecai's complaints, it seemed to me that this was the one which arguably had the most force. Still, there were two difficulties. The first, that the Medical Tribunal's decision to refuse him re-registration did not rest on these matters. Secondly, even if it be accepted that the Medical
Tribunal was in error in the conclusions reached as to these matters, of itself that was not a sufficient basis upon which a finding that a prima facie case of bias had been established could rest. Error alone, especially in relation to findings not crucial to the decision reached, could not establish such bias.

Denial of natural justice The Medical Tribunal heard the parties on costs on 5 May 2009. Mr Bar-
Mordecai filed a motion in Court that day, seeking that the Tribunal review its findings, alleging that the Tribunal's discretion had miscarried, because of the reliance placed on pleadings, evidence and submissions in relation to doctor/patient boundaries, which he had withdrawn, with the result that he had been denied natural justice.
 The motion failed and in these proceedings, Mr Bar-Mordecai submitted that
Murrell J looked tense and he heard her speak in an angry tone of voice towards him, when she announced that: 'The Tribunal is unanimous in that you have not undergone sufficient change with regard to your understanding of doctor/patient boundaries to be allowed to be registered'.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai submitted that a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that her Honour's anger and tone of voice was a consequence of this application having been filed. This was confirmed when her Honour said 'for the sake of completeness' as she proceeded with the making of costs orders, which Mr Bar-Mordecai claimed were made in breach of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), which provided: 
If the inquiry or appeal conducted by the Tribunal has not been completed when an appeal with respect to a point of law is made to the Supreme Court, the inquiry or appeal before the Tribunal is not to continue until the appeal to the Supreme Court has been disposed of.
 It must be immediately observed that Mr Bar-Mordecai mistook the effect of [s (3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html)
It only applies in circumstances where a party seeks and is granted leave to appeal on a point of law during the course of an inquiry before the Tribunal.
Mr Bar-Mordecai has not sought, nor been granted such leave by the Tribunal.
These proceedings concern a different matter, namely whether leave to proceed with the application Mr Bar-Mordecai seeks to bring in the Supreme Court should be granted under the [Vexatious Proceedings
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/).
 Mr Bar-Mordecai also argued that a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend bias in the form of prejudgment, in that the Tribunal refused to alter its conclusions, irrespective of the evidence he had presented in relation to the withdrawn pleadings, evidence and submissions in relation to doctor/patient boundaries. The Tribunal refused to consider the matter afresh and was not open to persuasion.
 That the Tribunal had the power to review its own findings, as Mr Bar-
Mordecai sought, is not clear on the face of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). Mr
Bar-Mordecai argued that the Tribunal was entitled to alter its findings, because of a slip, or actual bias, where the reasons given did not reflect what the four member Tribunal intended to say, or where there was some infelicity of a major finding which the Tribunal wished to remedy, relying on
Bromely versus Bromely [[1965] P 111] at 116.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai invited the Tribunal to correct errors in relation to
Medical Board policies, as well as the substance of the judgment. By his motion, he urged the Tribunal to reconsider its reasons, in the public interest, so as to achieve finality in the litigation and to permit him to resume his general practice. Mr Bar-Mordecai relied on an affidavit in which he drew to the Tribunal's attention to the transcript references on which he relied in these proceedings, to make good his argument as to bias.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai's application failed and a costs order was made against him.
 Having in mind the conclusions which I have reached, that the Tribunal did not err in the approach which it had adopted; that it was obliged to resolve the question of whether or not the withdrawal of Mr Bar-Mordecai's earlier expressed opinions in relation to patient/doctor boundaries should be accepted or not and that the conclusions which it reached did not wrongly rest on material which was not before it, in my view, it is apparent that the
Tribunal's rejection of Mr Bar-Mordecai's application that it review its decision, cannot have evidenced bias.
 That Mr Bar-Mordecai's impression of Murrell J's demeanour was that she was angry, must be taken into account, of course. The six pages of the transcript of the proceedings that day were in evidence. They disclosed that initially Mr Bar-Mordecai sought and was given the opportunity to go to his motion, but Murrell J announced that the Tribunal's view was that it could not review its decision, as Mr Bar-Mordecai sought, because, having given its decision, it was functus. The view was also taken that it should not defer considering the question of costs, given that Mr Bar-Mordecai was seeking to have this application referred to the Court of Appeal. Mr Bar-Mordecai was then given the opportunity to make oral submissions on costs. That was what the hearing had originally been programmed to deal with. Mr Bar-Mordecai then shortly addressed his oral submissions to a written submission on costs, which it was indicated that the members of the Tribunal had already read.
 Counsel for the Health Care Complaints Commission then referred shortly to the written submissions which had been filed for it. A decision on costs was then given.
 While it might have been preferable for Mr Bar-Mordecai's motion not to have been dealt with quite so peremptorily, the transcript of the proceedings on 5 May does not establish a prima facie case of bias. If Mr Bar-Mordecai's impression that Murrell J spoke to him in an unnecessarily short way that day was accepted, and I observe that no submissions to the contrary were advanced, that alone cannot evidence bias. On its face, the decision to deal with costs as programmed and a refusal to review its decision, because the
Tribunal regarded itself as functus (as to which, albeit in the context of the
Supreme Court, see for example the discussion in Sirius Shipping Corporation v The Ship Sunrise [[2007] NSWSC 766] at [[37]](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%20NSWSC%20766#para37) - [42), evidenced neither error, nor bias. As Palmer J there observed at [42] in relation to the power to review a decision: 
However, the jurisdiction is always exercised with great caution and is never available where a claim has in fact been finally determined on the merits in accordance with the requirements of justice and what is sought is, in truth, a review of such decision by way of appeal: R versus Bow Street
Magistrate (supra) at 132; Postiglione versus R <case>; [(1997) 189 CLR 295], at 300; R versus Burrell (supra) at [22].
 Assuming that the Tribunal also had the power to review its own decision, that, in reality, what Mr Bar-Mordecai was seeking was that the Tribunal review its decision by way of appeal, was apparent. His motion sought to agitate the same matters on which he here seeks to rely. Thereby, he sought to urge the Tribunal to come to a contrary view to that which it had reached on the merits of the matter lying at the very heart of its decision, on a basis which he had not advanced at the earlier hearing. Mr Bar-Mordecai's endeavour to have the Tribunal review its decision may be entirely understandable, given the importance of what was in issue, namely his right to resume his medical practice. Such an appeal on the merits of the Tribunal's decision was not, however, available to him, by the review which he sought. Its rejection cannot evidence bias. Nor can the tone of voice in which advice of the refusal of his motion was delivered to him by Murrell J, have the result which Mr Bar-
Mordecai now urges, namely establishing a prima facie case of bias.

Did Mr Bar-Mordecai establish prima facie grounds for the application in relation to Murrell J's disqualification judgement? Mr Bar-Mordecai's complaint to the International Criminal Court about
Murrell J followed her Honour's dismissal of his oral application on 10
November 2008, that the findings of the 2000 Medical Tribunal in its judgment of 6 September 2000 (In Re Dr Michael Jacob Bar-Modecai and the [Medical
Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/)) be dismissed, because the Tribunal as then constituted was in breach of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s154.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). I have earlier dealt with this application. As I have explained, her Honour's decision was correct. It was this refusal which led to Mr Bar-Mordecai's complaint about her Honour.
 Mr Bar-Mordecai's original submissions in these proceedings sought to establish that Murrell J had an association with a party who had an interest in the litigation, namely himself, which required her Honour to accede to the application that she disqualify herself. That interest arose from his complaint to the International Court of Justice about her Honour. This complaint, Mr Bar- Mordecai sought to explain, was not an appeal from her
Honour's refusal to disqualify herself, but a punitive measure designed to have her incarcerated in the Netherlands, for 'perpetuating the perversion of the course of justice'.
 On Mr Bar-Mordecai's approach, it followed that Her Honour had a personal interest in what will be found against her by the International Criminal Court and, accordingly, she ought to have acceded to the disqualification application, which Mr Bar-Mordecai had pressed in the Medical Tribunal proceedings.
 In its March judgment, the Tribunal observed: . In January 2009, Mr Bar-Mordecai complained to the
International Criminal Court that, in refusing to set aside the 2000 decision, the Deputy Chairperson of this Tribunal had perpetuated a perversion of justice. He asked her to disqualify herself on the basis that, if she continued to sit on the Tribunal while the ICC complaint was unresolved, there may be a perception of bias. She declined to disqualify herself, holding that there was no possibility that such a perception would arise in the mind of a reasonable person.
 The hearing proceeded before the Tribunal over 5 days in November 2008 and
January 2009. It was on 3 January 2009 that Mr Bar-Mordecai made his complaint about Murrell J to the International Criminal Court, providing a copy of the written complaint to Murrell J and to the respondent. Her Honour then relisted the matter on her own initiative, to enquire whether either party wished to make any application in relation to her continuing to sit in the proceedings. On 21 January, Mr Bar-Mordecai made an application for Murrell
J to disqualify herself. Her Honour refused, giving ex tempore reasons for her decision.
 It was Mr Bar-Mordecai's case that the way in which her Honour had dealt with his advice of the complaint, as well as the dismissal of his application, revealed her Honour's bias.
 I am satisfied that no prima facie case of apprehended, or actual bias has been established.
 As was submitted for the Attorney General, a decision of a judge not to disqualify, is not one generally susceptible to appeal, other than as an issue raised in the appeal from the final order in the proceedings, or on any interlocutory issue in respect of which there is a right to appeal. (See R v
Watson ; Ex parte Armstrong <case>; [(1976) 136 CLR 248], followed in Barton versus Walker [[1979] 2 NSWLR 740] at 751 and numerous subsequent cases.) Reference was also made to Household Financial
Services Ltd versus Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales [(1992) 26 ALD ], where Newman J had to consider whether an appeal lay to this Court on grounds of apprehended bias, before a decision had been given. His Honour took the view that it did not, applying the approach of Kirby J in Raybos
Australia Pty Ltd versus Tetracan Corporation Pty Ltd [No 9] (unreported, 27
November 1990 per Kirby P, Mahoney and Priestley JJA).
 The provisions of the [Commercial Tribunal Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cta1984192/) being considered in Household Financial Services Ltd, were in relevantly similar terms to those in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s90.html) of the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/). It was accepted for the Attorney General, however, that under the [Medical Practice
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/), in review proceedings brought under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s92.html), in so far as any refusal to disqualify raised a question of law, such a refusal could be appealed during the course of the inquiry, with leave, under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/mpa1992128/s89.html)
No such leave was however sought, nor granted, in this case.
 Accepting that bias was also a matter which Mr Bar-Mordecai was entitled to raise under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s69.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), it has to be remembered that in considering his application, her Honour was bound by various authorities which had to be applied to the circumstances which had arisen in the proceedings. Having those authorities in mind, I am satisfied that it must be concluded that Mr Bar-Mordecai has not established a prima facie case of bias.
 There was no error on her Honour's part in raising with the parties whether they wished to make any application. Given that Mr Bar-Mordecai was unrepresented, that was plainly appropriate. Thereby he was given the opportunity to make any application he thought appropriate. (See S & M
Motor Repairs Pty Ltd versus Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd <case>; <case> - [107].) Once made, the application had to be dealt with by her Honour, in the light of the authorities which bound her.
 It has long been accepted that a mere complaint about a judicial officer can not give rise to an apprehension of bias. (see Livesey versus New South Wales
Bar Association <case>; [(1983) 151 CLR 288] at 294). Litigants are not entitled to pick and choose who will hear their cases, by the making of complaints during the course of proceedings. In Ebner versus Official Trustee in Bankruptcy <case>; [(2000) 205 CLR 337] it was observed at 348: [19] Judges have a duty to exercise their judicial functions when their jurisdiction is regularly invoked and they are assigned to cases in accordance with the practice which prevails in the court to which they belong. They do not select the cases they will hear, and they are not at liberty to decline to hear cases without good cause. Judges do not choose their cases; and litigants do not choose their judges. If one party to a case objects to a particular judge sitting, or continuing to sit, then that objection should not prevail unless it is based upon a substantial ground for contending that the judge is disqualified from hearing and deciding the case.
 [20] This is not to say that it is improper for a judge to decline to sit unless the judge has affirmatively concluded that he or she is disqualified.
In a case of real doubt, it will often be prudent for a judge to decide not to sit in order to avoid the inconvenience that could result if an appellate court were to take a different view on the matter of disqualification.
However, if the mere making of an insubstantial objection were sufficient to lead a judge to decline to hear or decide a case, the system would soon reach a stage where, for practical purposes, individual parties could influence the composition of the bench. That would be intolerable.
 [21] It is not possible to state in a categorical form the circumstances in which a judge, although personally convinced that he or she is not disqualified, may properly decline to sit. Circumstances vary, and may include such factors as the stage at which an objection is raised, the practical possibility of arranging for another judge to hear the case, and the public or constitutional role of the court before which the proceedings are being conducted. These problems usually arise in a context in which a judge has no particular personal desire to hear a case. If a judge were anxious to sit in a particular case, and took pains to arrange that he or she would do so, questions of actual bias may arise.
 [22] The particular principle or principles which determine the grounds upon which a judge will be disqualified from hearing a case follow from a consideration of the fundamental principle that court cases, civil or criminal, must be decided by an independent and impartial tribunal.
 [23] Bias, whether actual or apprehended, connotes the absence of impartiality. It may not be an adequate term to cover all cases of the absence of independence.
 In Attorney General of New South Wales versus Klewer  <case>, the complaint in question, which it was claimed had given rise to apprehended bias, had been made to the Independent Commission Against Corruption ('ICAC').
There it was observed that: Levine J agreed with Magistrate Rheinberger that the earlier proceedings concerning Mrs Klewer, with which his Worship had been concerned, did not raise any reasonable apprehension that his Worship would not bring to bear the impartiality expected of him. I agree with his Honour's remarks and need not elaborate on them. Levine J also considered that the complaint to the
Independent Commission Against Corruption provided no adequate basis for the
Magistrate to disqualify himself. Levine J said:- "Without doubt no litigant whether represented or otherwise should consider that the making of a complaint to an investigatory body such as ICAC or the Judicial Commission about a Judge hearing that litigant's case will automatically involve that Judge self-disqualifying. The reasons are obvious.
It would be a mechanism of much mischief in the administration of justice if that course could be taken with such facility." I agree with the view which his Honour expressed, particularly in the circumstances of the present case. From what counsel for Mrs Klewer said at the hearing on 5 December 2001, it appears that the complaint was directed generally to the judicial officers and staff of the Local Court at Coffs
Harbour and to the New South Wales Police Service at Coffs Harbour and alleged a climate of hostility and bias rather than being directed to particular matters concerning Magistrate Rheinberger. Counsel referred to a non-criminal conspiracy against Mrs Klewer. Unsubstantiated allegations of this type made by disappointed litigants provide no basis upon which a judicial officer, who has been allocated to a particular matter, should recuse.
 Thus, the position was that neither the previous matters which
Magistrate Rheinberger had had with Mrs Klewer nor the complaint to the
Independent Commission Against Corruption provided grounds upon which his
Worship ought to have disqualified himself. Nor did a reasonable apprehension of bias arise from the fact that Hill J had ruled that another magistrate was disqualified from hearing further matters concerning Mrs Klewer. The factors which applied in that case did not apply to Magistrate Rheinberger. Nor did the transfer of other matters involving Mrs Klewer to the Downing Centre by
Magistrate Rheinberger provide a reasonable apprehension that the Magistrate would not be impartial in the proceedings before him. The Magistrate made it plain that his hearing of the Social Security case would prevent him from dealing with the other matters in which Mrs Klewer was involved.
 However, counsel submitted that a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the Magistrate's remarks, which I have set out. Counsel referred to the principle that the conduct must be judged from the point of view of a fair-minded lay observer. In Johnson versus Johnson <case>; [(2000) 201 CLR 488] at 492-493, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ expressed the principle in this way:- "It is not contended that Anderson J was affected by actual bias. It has been established by a series of decisions of this Court that the test to be applied in Australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (which, in the present case, was said to take the form of prejudgment) is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide eg, Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw [(1980) 55 ALJR 12] ...;
Livesey versus NSW Bar Association <case>; [(1983) 151 CLR 288]; Vakauta versus Kelly <case>; [(1989) 167 CLR 568]; Webb versus The Queen <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 41.] 
That test has been adopted, in preference to a differently expressed test that has been applied in England cf Locabail (UK) Ltd versus Bayfield Properties
Ltd <case>; [[2000] QB 451], for the reason that it gives due recognition to the fundamental principle that justice must both be done, and be seen to be done cf R versus Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy [[1924] 1 KB 256] at 259, per
Lord Hewart CJ. It is based upon the need for public confidence in the administration of justice. 'If fair-minded people reasonably apprehend or suspect that the tribunal has prejudged the case, they cannot have confidence in the decision' R versus Watson; Ex parte Armstrong <case>; [(1976) 136 CLR 248] at 263, per Barwick CJ, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ. The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge's conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by some judges of the capacity or performance of their colleagues. At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to be reasonable; and the person being observed is 'a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial' Vakauta versus Kelly [(1988) NSWLR 502] at 527, per McHugh JA, adopted in Vakauta versus Kelly <case>; [(1989) 167 CLR 568] at -585, per Toohey J.

Whilst the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge Webb versus The Queen <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 41] at 73, per
Deane J, the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice." Levine J did not find that a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the Magistrate's remarks of 31 July 2001. I agree with his Honour.
Although, his Worship's remarks were somewhat elliptical, their only possible meaning was that, as the Magistrate was part heard in relation to the Social
Security case, he would transfer the other matters to Sydney to be dealt with by other magistrates. No inference could be drawn from the remarks that the
Magistrate would not bring an impartial, unprejudiced mind to the matter which he retained.
 However, Levine J considered that a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from remarks of Magistrate Rheinberger in the last paragraph of his reasons of 5 December 2001, which I have set out above. Levine J said:- "I am troubled by his Worship having disposed as it were of other matters yet coming to the view represented in the elliptical paragraph of his reasons which I have cited. Exceptionally, and I cannot stress that too strongly, in that context, what his Worship said leads to the standard of reasonable apprehension to which the courts have referred being met and, accordingly, I direct that those proceedings proceed no further before him." In my view, the last paragraph of his Worship's reasons raised no apprehension of bias on his part. He had already made it clear that his handling of the proceedings in which Mrs Klewer had been involved did not, in his view, raise any reasonable apprehension of bias. In this circumstance, his
Worship's remarks did not suggest that, in his view, there was any reasonable apprehension of bias. His Worship simply referred to what he regarded as "good policy". His Worship was incorrect in that view for it is not good policy and certainly not appropriate that a judicial officer should disqualify himself just because one of the parties before him has lodged a complaint with the Independent Commission Against Corruption. A judicial officer should disqualify himself only if there are facts which raise a reasonable apprehension of bias on his or her part. Nevertheless, the reference to "good policy" did not suggest that Magistrate Rheinberger would fail to be impartial and unprejudiced in his handling of Mrs Klewer's case. Indeed, the reference to what he regarded as good policy showed that the Magistrate kept in the forefront of his mind the need to be and to be seen to be without bias.
 In this case, Mr Bar-Mordecai claimed that a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the fact that her Honour had herself listed the matter to enquire whether either party wished to make an application, in light of Mr
Bar-Mordecai's complaint and that she had not then disqualified herself, treating the complaint to the International Criminal Court as if it had been an appeal.
 I am satisfied that this submission may not be accepted. Her Honour was not entitled to treat a complaint to the International Criminal Court any differently to a complaint to ICAC or to the Judicial Commission (as to which see for example Kumeragamage versus Rallis (No 2) <case> at <case> - [21]). Her Honour's refusal of Mr Bar-Mordecai's application cannot have given rise to a prima facie case of bias, apprehended or otherwise. What was observed by the High Court in Re JRL ex parte CJL <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 342] at 352, as to acceding to disqualification applications too readily, has to be remembered: 
It seems that the acceptance by this Court of the test of reasonable apprehension of bias in such cases as Watson <case>; <case>; [(1983) 151 CLR 288] has led to an increase in the frequency of applications by litigants that judicial officers should disqualify themselves from sitting in particular cases on account of their participation in other proceedings involving one of the litigants or on account of conduct during the litigation.
It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party. There may be many situations in which previous decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact and law may generate an expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely to one of the parties. But this does not mean either that he will approach the issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in the sense in which that expression is used in the authorities or that his previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will approach the issues in this way. In cases of this kind, disqualification is only made out by showing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment and this must be "firmly established": Reg versus Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration
Commission; Ex parte Angliss Group (1969) 122 CLR 546, at pp 553-554;
Watson (1976) 136 CLR, at p 262; Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw [(1980) 55 ALJR ], at p 14; [32 ALR 47](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=32%20ALR%2047 "View LawCiteRecord" ), at pp 50-51. Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.
 It follows that Mr Bar-Mordecai's application for leave in respect of this decision must also be refused, no prima facie case of apprehended bias having been established.

Orders For the reasons given, the application for leave must be refused and the usual costs order in favour of the plaintiff must follow. I order accordingly.
