Worldwide Resources Ltd & Ors versus Global Medical Industries` `Pty Ltd & Ors` ` 1906/97` `20 May 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` `  `
 `1906/97 - WORLDWIDE RESOURCES LTD & ORS versus GLOBAL MEDICAL INDUSTRIES PTY LTD & ORS` `  `
 `JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application for interlocutory injunction, in proceedings involving alleged infringement of a registered design. 
The plaintiffs today seek an interlocutory injunction. When the matter was called on, Mr Douglas QC, who appeared with Mr Morris for the defendants, submitted that his clients were prepared to keep all proper records and suggested that the better course would be to have an urgent hearing on a final basis rather than spend time on an interlocutory application. Mr Catterns QC, who appeared with Mr Reuben for the plaintiffs, did not wish to take that course; he wished to press for interlocutory relief.

I have read the material which Mr Catterns and Mr Reuben would say supports an interlocutory injunction. I regret to say that most of the evidence, which was presented is not admissible even on an interlocutory application. Indeed, the principal affidavit is so permeated through with inadmissible material that the court would be tempted to do what Myers J used to do and to say that as the percentage of inadmissible material to admissible material exceeds 100 per cent none of the affidavit should be read. However, it seemed to me appropriate to read all this material, pretend it was admissible and then to make an assessment as to whether I would grant interlocutory relief.

I took this course because I believe that if a plaintiff seeks an interlocutory order, it is entitled to have that application considered.
However, assuming that the material is relevant, I would not be prepared to grant an interlocutory injunction the principal reasons being those advanced by Mr Douglas QC earlier, that there has been delay in coming to the court and that there is confusion with the facts. So I dismiss the application for interlocutory relief with costs.
