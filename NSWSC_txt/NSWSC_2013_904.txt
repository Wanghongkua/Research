JUDGMENT
By summons filed on 1 March 2013, the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, sought orders under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) in respect of the defendant, Mr Namoa, as well as orders under [s 31D(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s31d.html) and (c) of that Act. Orders under [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) for interest were also sought, as well as orders for costs.
The summons was accompanied by a statement of facts and circumstances signed on 25 February 2013 by the plaintiff's solicitor, Ms Bishop. Annexed to that statement was a New South Wales police facts sheet which indicated that Mr Namoa had been the subject of a police investigation as the result of which he had been arrested on 20 February 2013. He was then found to be in possession of a very large sum of Australian currency, which was seized. That was then estimated to amount to something between $500,000 and one million dollars. 
The proceedings came before the Registrar in March, when orders were made requiring the application be served on Mr Namoa. There was today no appearance again by Mr Namoa, who it has been revealed is presently in custody.
Today the Crime Commission presses for orders to be made pursuant to <case>, requiring Mr Namoa to be examined on oath before a Registrar. That application is supported by a number of affidavits. 
An affidavit of service sworn by Sergeant Brendan Donnellan on 5 March 2013 attests that the sergeant served a sealed copy of the summons and statement of facts on Mr Namoa at the Silverwater Correctional Centre on 5 March 2013. An affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the director financial investigations of the New South Wales Crime Commission attests that various correspondence and an affidavit which Mr Spark swore on 6 June have also been served on Mr Namoa. 
In the circumstances the Crime Commission sought to have the hearing proceed ex-parte. I am satisfied that a basis for that application has been established.
Mr Spark deposed in his June affidavit as to various investigations which have been conducted as to the circumstances in which the application presently before the Court came to be made and pressed. Mr Spark deposed to his belief as to the truth of the contents of a New South Wales police force facts sheet prepared by Detective Candace Williams which was annexed to his affidavit and the basis of that belief. Also annexed to the affidavit is a court attendance notice which reveals that Mr Namoa has been charged with offences under [s 193B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of knowingly deal with proceeds of crime; under [s 193B(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of recklessly deal with proceeds of crime; and under [s 527C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s527c.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of unlawfully obtained goods personal custody.
Searches of the COPS database in relation to Mr Namoa indicates that the amount of currency seized by police in February 2013, when Mr Namoa was arrested, amounts to approximately one million dollars. It is in those circumstances that the Crime Commission presses for orders under [s 31D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s31d.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) which provides that the Court may, on application of the Commission, make orders for the examination of a person on oath. [Section 31D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s31d.html) provides for the orders sought to be made when an application for a confiscation order is made. A confiscation order is defined in [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) to mean an assets forfeiture order, proceeds assessment order, or unexplained wealth order. It is the latter order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the Act which the Commission seeks in these proceedings.
It is settled that the fact that criminal charges are outstanding is not of itself a basis upon which an application for examination orders will be refused (see New South Wales Crime Commission versus Jason Lee  <case> I also note that in the event of questions and answers given at an examination being considered to prejudice a criminal trial there are protections available under [s 13A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s13a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) as to self-incrimination (see Lee and New South Wales Crime Commission versus Choi [[2012] NSWCC 658).]
In all of the circumstances, on the material on which the applicant Crime Commission relies, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made in the terms proposed. I order accordingly.
