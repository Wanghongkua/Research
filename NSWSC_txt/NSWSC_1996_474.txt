The News Corporation Ltd versus Lenfest Communications Inc [1996] NSWSC 474 (4
October 1996) 
THE NEWS CORPORATION LIMITED versus LENFEST COMMUNICATIONS INC /96 
TUESDAY, 13 AUGUST 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMERCIAL DIVISION 
GILES J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The News Corporation Limited ("News") is an Australian company with media interests including the development and operation of pay television in Australia. Lenfest Communications Inc ("Lenfest") is a United States corporation with media interests including the operation of cable television in America and, via subsidiaries, the development and operation of pay television in Australia. Australis Media Limited ("Australis") is an Australian company engaged in the development and operation of pay television services in Australia.

By its summons filed on 3 May 1996 News claims damages, alternatively equitable compensation or damages, from Lenfest, alleging that - 
Australis was seeking substantial funds from investors; in early April 1996 News, Lenfest and Tele-Communications Inc ("TCI") negotiated together for the purpose of putting a financing proposal to
Australis; it was agreed by News, Lenfest and TCI that, in consideration of each forbearing from making any offer to Australis either separately or in conjunction with third parties, none of News, Lenfest nor TCI would make separately or be involved in the making by a third party of a financing proposal to Australis without first notifying the others; in breach of the agreement, prior to 19 April 1996 Lenfest conferred with third parties and put a financing proposal to Australis; on 19 April 1996 Australis accepted a funding package of approximately $200m from a group of investors including Lenfest; and by reason of the breach of the agreement News suffered loss, being the value of the opportunity "to reach an agreement which was acceptable to
Lenfest and Australis".

The same matters are put forward not as an agreement breached by Lenfest, but in the alternative as a representation by Lenfest on which News acted to its detriment and in the further alternative as misleading or deceptive conduct by
Lenfest in contravention of ss.51A and [52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/). For present purposes it is unnecessary to go into the detail, or validity, of these alternatives.

The summons was served on Lenfest in America: as I understand it, there is no dispute over the regularity of the service. On the return of the summons on 7
June 1996 Lenfest foreshadowed an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, and in anticipation of the notice of motion next mentioned News was directed to inform Lenfest's solicitors on or before 12 June 1996 of the provisions of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A on which it relied to establish the jurisdiction and to file and serve by June 1996 the affidavits on which it proposed to rely to establish jurisdiction. On 13 June 1996 Lenfest filed a notice of motion seeking a declaration that the Court has no jurisdiction over it in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings and an order that the originating process or its service be set aside, and in the alternative (though not so expressed) an order that the Court decline in its discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in the proceedings. The application was made pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p11) r 8 of the Rules and, as permitted by [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p11) r 8(2)(a), was made without the entry of an appearance: as specifically stated in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p11) r 8(3), the making of the application shall not be treated as a voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the Court. As required by [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p11) r 8(2)(c), the notice of motion bore a note stating Lenfest's address for service.

On the return of the notice of motion on 21 June 1996 Lenfest was directed to file and serve its affidavits in support of the application by 12 July 1996, subsequently extended to 2 August 1996. The notice of motion now stands adjourned to 16 August 1996.

On 1 July 1996 News served on Lenfest at the address for service stated in the notice of motion a notice to produce requiring that it produce to the Court on July 1996 documents falling within three fairly broad descriptions. On 10
July 1996 Lenfest filed a notice of motion seeking orders that the notice to produce be set aside or alternatively that it not be required to produce to the Court the documents referred to therein. With the assistance of prior written outlines of submissions, the notice of motion was heard on 2 August
For the following reasons I consider that Lenfest should not be required to produce the documents yet, leaving open whether it may be required to do so at a future time.

The notice to produce 
The notice to produce annexed a media release issued by Australis on 19 April announcing agreement with Lenfest and three other entities for the funding package of approximately $200m and giving details of the arrangements for that funding. In the notice to produce Australis was referred to by the acronym AML and the three other entities by the acronyms UIH, GPG and PBL. By August 1996 discussions had narrowed the documents in question to those described in a fax dated 31 July 1996 from the solicitors for News to the solicitors for Lenfest. The present extent of the notice to produce is documents - "... recording any written or oral communication in the period 9 to 19 April (inclusive) made or received in New South Wales in relation to: 
Any approach by Lenfest to, or to Lenfest by, any one or more of UIH, GPG or PBL to participate in a recapitalisation or refinancing proposal to AML; and 
Negotiations by Lenfest with one or more of UIH, GPG, PBL or AML about the financing proposal which was accepted by AML on or about 19 April 1996 and was the subject of the media release which is attached and marked 'A'." 
The foundation for the notice to produce 
The direct foundation for the notice to produce is [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p36) r 16 of the Rules - "16 (1) Where a party to any proceedings serves on another party notice requiring the party served to produce at the trial or hearing in the proceedings, or with the leave of the Court, on any day, or before any judge, officer, examiner or other person having authority to take evidence in the proceedings any document or thing for the purpose of evidence and the document or thing is in the possession, custody or power of the party served, the party served shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, produce the document or thing in accordance with the notice, without the need for any subpoena for production.

Where leave is given under subrule (1) for production on a day or under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p37) [rule 2(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s2.html) for the issue of a subpoena for production on a day, any party may serve on any other party a notice under subrule (1) for production on either day.

Where there is a clerk of the Court at the place for production, the party on whom a notice under subrule (1) is served may produce the document or thing to that clerk either by hand or by post, in either case so that the clerk receives them not later than two days before the date required under subrule for production.

A party may not, except with the leave of the Court, search for, or inspect, any document or thing produced, except by him, pursuant to this rule and not admitted into evidence." 
News relied principally upon [Pt 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p36) r 16 for the validity and efficacy of the notice to produce, in the alternative on s.76A of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), [s.23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s23.html) of that Act, or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. Lenfest acknowledged that, looked at alone, the words of [Pt 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 were sufficient to authorise and give effect to the notice to produce, but contended that when seen in context and with its purpose in mind the rule was to be read down so that it does not empower service of the notice to produce and that the alternative foundations did not enhance News' position; alternatively, Lenfest contended that as a matter of discretion the Court should order that it is not obliged to comply with the notice to produce. For its part News accepted that if [Pt 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 were to be read down in the manner and for the reasons suggested it would fare no better by appeal to s.76A, s.[23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s23.html) or inherent jurisdiction. Thus the argument concentrated upon [Pt 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16.

The position of a foreign defendant 
A plaintiff need not obtain prior leave before serving originating process on a defendant outside Australia. If the defendant files a notice of appearance, he waives any objection to the jurisdiction of the Court and any irregularities in the manner of the commencement of the proceedings or the service of the originating process. But if the defendant does not file a notice of appearance, the plaintiff cannot proceed against him except with the leave of the Court (Pt 10 r 2(1)), and as part of obtaining leave must sufficiently show that the proceedings fall within one of the cases for service of originating process outside Australia set out in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A of the Rules. (I use the words "sufficiently show" as a general and imprecise description of what is required of the plaintiff, putting aside whether he must establish the jurisdictional link on a prima facie basis, on an arguable case basis, or as some lesser degree of satisfaction that it is appropriate that the plaintiff be permitted to proceed: Pendal Nominees Pty
Ltd versus M & A Investments Pty Ltd [(1989) 18 NSWLR 383]; Esanda
Finance Corporation Ltd versus Wordplex Information Systems Ltd [(1990) 19 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281990%29%2019%20NSWLR%20146 "View LawCiteRecord" ); Williams versus Lips-Heerlen BV (Giles J, 1 November 1991, unreported; CA, August 1994, unreported); C.E. Heath Underwriting & Insurance
Pty Ltd versus Barden (Rolfe J, 19 October 1994, unreported)). The plaintiff must obtain leave to proceed even if in an application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 the defendant unsuccessfully contests the Court's jurisdiction, although as a practical matter the defendant's failure in that endeavour will normally entail the grant of leave to proceed if sought. Hence it is not uncommon for a defendant's application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 and a plaintiff's application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 2(1) to be heard together.

But a defendant may raise matters other than whether the proceedings fall within one of the cases set out in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A. [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8(1) refers to orders, inter alia, setting aside the originating process, setting aside the service of the originating process on the defendant, declaring that the original process has not been duly served on the defendant, declaring that the Court has no jurisdiction over the defendant in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings, and declining as a matter of discretion to exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings, together with the catch-all of such other relief as is thought appropriate. [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 6A refers to an order of the kind referred to in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 on the ground that service of the originating process was not authorised by the Rules or the ground that the Court is an inappropriate forum for the trial of the proceedings. A defendant may contest the jurisdiction by contending that the proceedings do not fall within any of the cases set out in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A, but may do so also by reference to a fatal deficiency in the originating process (for example, that it does not disclose a cause of action maintainable against the defendant) or the service of the originating process (for example, if the service was not as would be required if the originating process was served in Australia and was also not in accordance with the law of the country in which service was effected, see [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) rr 4 and 5, with further complications in the case of service in a convention country or in such other country as the Attorney General may direct, see [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) rr 7-13). A defendant may also, where the Court does have jurisdiction, ask it to decline to exercise jurisdiction because the Court is a clearly inappropriate forum (the so-called forum non conveniens ground, see Voth v
Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 538]; Henry versus Henry <case>; [(1996) 70 ALJR 480)] and possibly on more general discretionary grounds (Kuwait
Asia Bank EC versus National Mutual Life Nominees Limited [[1990] 1 AC 187]; Williams v
Lips-Heerlen BV).
 "Party" is defined in [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s19.html) of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) as including "any defendant"; "defendant" is defined as including any person served with a statement of claim or summons, or served with notice of or entitled to attend any proceedings. Hence, no doubt, the acceptance that the words of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16, taken alone, were sufficient to authorise and give effect to the notice to produce, because Lenfest was a defendant which had been served with a summons and was entitled to attend the proceedings. But it follows from the matters in the preceding paragraph that there may be different kinds of parties to a proceeding. Relevantly, it may be appropriate to distinguish parties served outside Australia from parties served within Australia and, within the first group, to distinguish between parties who have filed a notice of appearance, parties who have not filed a notice of appearance but have contested the jurisdiction pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8, and parties who have done nothing; within the second sub-group again, one may distinguish between parties who deny the Court's jurisdiction and parties who seek a favourable discretion not to exercise jurisdiction.

Notices to produce in general 
In earlier times a notice to produce did not compel the party served to produce the documents to which it related, but was a pre-condition to giving secondary evidence of the documents in the event that they were not produced:
Dwyer versus Collins <case>; [(1852) 7 Ex 639]; 86 ER 770; Morgan versus Babcock & Wilcox Ltd <case>; [(1929) 43 CLR 163]; Ewart versus Royds [(1955) 72 WN 58]; Moffitt, "Procedures in a Common Law Trial Regarding Subpoenae Duces Tecum, Notices to
Produce and Documents of Parties and Strangers" in Glass (ed), Seminars on
Evidence 1. Pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16(1), service of a notice to produce now imposes an obligation akin to that imposed by a subpoena for production issued and served in accordance with [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p37) of the Rules (see Ccom Pty Ltd versus Jiejung Pty Ltd [(1992) 37 FCR 1).] Further, under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p18) r 4(3), when a party serves on another party a list of documents pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p23) of the Rules those parties shall be in the position that they would be in if the latter party had, on the date of service of the list, served on the party serving the list a notice requiring production at the trial of such of the documents specified in the list as are in the possession, custody or power of the party serving the list.

It would be wrong to equate a notice to produce with a subpoena for production, or to draw too close an analogy between them, because a notice to produce operates between parties whereas a subpoena for production normally operates between a party and an outsider to the proceedings. It has been said that it is an abuse of process to use a subpoena for production to a party as a substitute for discovery of documents by that party (see Commissioner for
Railways versus Small (1938) 38 SR 564 at 574; Waind versus Hill [[1978] 1 NSWLR ]
at 382), and in principle the position would be the same for a notice to produce. The subpoena-like obligation of a notice to produce may be supplementary to discovery of documents (as under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p18) r 4(3)) and in some circumstances independent of discovery of documents, and the relationship of a notice to produce with a subpoena and discovery of documents is relevant to the proper use of a notice to produce. Nonetheless each can be seen as a mechanism with the same objective of compulsorily making documents available for inspection, not necessarily for tendering in evidence (see Waind versus Hill at 380-81), by a party to proceedings.

There is specific provision in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p37) r 8 of the Rules for setting aside a subpoena wholly or in part, of the
Court's own motion or on the motion of any person having a sufficient interest, but there is no specific provision for setting aside a notice to produce. Applications to set aside a notice to produce are commonly made, and may be seen as a way in which the Court might otherwise order as provided in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16(1). That provision permits flexibility whereby an order otherwise might, for example, regulate the time at which or the terms on which documents are to be produced, and may permit a general discretion going beyond the recognised circumstances in which a subpoena will be set aside.

Reading down [Part 36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) [rule 16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s16.html) 
Lenfest submitted that [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 was to be read down so as not to apply where one of the parties is a foreigner who has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court and has on foot an unresolved contest over that jurisdiction. In effect, it said that "party" in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 did not mean a party served outside Australia within either of the second and third sub-groups of that group, but went beyond that by saying that "party" did not mean the serving party either.

Lenfest's first argument, although put in terms of the way the rule "ought" be construed, was really that [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 was to be read down because it could not (as distinct from should not) apply to the parties. According to the argument, it could not apply to the parties because (a) there was no power to make interlocutory orders unless there was there was jurisdiction to grant final relief in the proceedings and by extension, there was no power to enforce production of documents while jurisdiction or the exercise of jurisdiction was in question. Even if otherwise to be accepted, the argument would not extend to a party seeking a favourable exercise of discretion not to exercise jurisdiction. But I do not think that the argument should be accepted.

Lenfest cited The Siskina [[1979] AC 210], Channel Tunnel
Group Ltd versus Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd [[1993] AC 334] and Mercedes
Benz AG versus Leiduck [[1996] 1 AC 284.] Those cases were concerned, inter alia, with power to grant a Mareva injunction against a foreign defendant where the Court had no jurisdiction over the defendant for the substantive judgment in aid of which the Mareva injunction would be granted. The holdings in The Siskina and Mercedes Benz AG versus Leiduck that there was no such power turned on the rules relating to service on a foreign defendant and the nature of an interlocutory injunction as "merely ancillary and incidental to the pre-existing cause of action" (The Siskina at 256 per Lord Diplock) or, reassessed, on the special nature of a Mareva injunction as unconcerned with ascertaining or enforcing substantive rights and merely ensuring "that once the mechanisms of enforcement are set in motion, there is something physically available upon which they can work" (Mercedes Benz AG versus Leiduck at 299, 302). In Channel Tunnel Group Ltd v
Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd it was held that an interlocutory injunction could be granted where a stay of the proceedings in favour of arbitration was mandatory, that is, where the Court could not enforce the plaintiff's rights by final judgment, because the Court had jurisdiction although the exercise of the jurisdiction was stayed, and that case supports the view that the present argument would not extend to a party seeking a favourable exercise of discretion not to exercise jurisdiction.

The basis for the decision in The Siskina, as interpreted in Channel
Tunnel Group Ltd versus Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd, can not be transposed to the situation before me. Accepting that the Court has no power to make orders against persons outside its territorial jurisdiction unless authorised by statute and that there is no inherent extra-territorial jurisdiction (see
Waterhouse versus Reid [[1938] 1 KB 743] at 747 per
Greer LJ, cited in Mercedes Benz AG versus Leiduck at 296-7), under the authority of statute [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 confers a power. The invocation of the power is controlled by the need for prior leave or confirmation in the case of service of a notice to produce upon a foreign defendant who does not have an address for service (see [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 3), and by the provision for an order otherwise in the case of service of a notice to produce upon a foreign defendant who has, by applying pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8, provided an address for service and is at least to the extent of his application participating in the proceedings. Production of documents is part of the Court's procedures to arrive at a final judgment including the steps towards that result such as resolving any dispute over the Court's jurisdiction or the exercise of its jurisdiction, and differs from the grant of a Mareva injunction; further, absence of power when there is no jurisdiction over the defendant for a substantive judgment does not mean that there is no power for the purpose of determining whether there is jurisdiction or whether jurisdiction should be exercised. (Compare Altertext Inc v
Advanced Data Communications Ltd [[1985] 1 WLR 457] at 426-3, holding that an interlocutory injunction of the Anton Piller kind against a foreigner before service of originating process had a "provisional" or "suspended" effect until the assumption of jurisdiction was complete; but note the doubt expressed in ANZ Grindlays Bank PLC versus Hussein [(1991) 4 WAR ] at .) 
In my view, therefore, unless on its proper construction it does not extend to that situation (which was Lenfest's second argument), [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 empowers service of a notice to produce where one of the parties is a foreigner who has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court and has on foot an unresolved contest over that jurisdiction. It is not excluded simply because jurisdiction or the exercise of jurisdiction is in question. It might be observed that if the argument were correct there would be no power for the
Court to make interlocutory orders, at Lenfest's request, binding upon News, for the purposes of or pending the outcome of its application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8. The validity of the notices to produce served by a party in the position of Lenfest, at least so far as it was seeking a favourable discretion not to exercise jurisdiction, was upheld in Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd versus CSR
Ltd (Rolfe J, 10 November 1995, unreported), with the observation that it may well be that a similar conclusion would be reached if the application were brought under the other provisions of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8.

Lenfest's second argument was that [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 was to be read down because it should not (as distinct from could not) apply to the parties. This was an exercise in construction, invoking the approach in Mercedes Benz AG versus Leiduck at 299 - "It is not enough simply to read the words of the rule and see whether, taken literally, they are wide enough to cover the case. Regard must be paid to their intent, their spirit: see, for example, Johnson versus Taylor Bros & Co Ltd [[1920] AC 144], 153 per Viscount Haldane and GAF Corporation versus Amchem Products Inc [1975] 1 LLR 601, 605 per Megarry J and the cases there cited." 
As will be seen, the argument really addressed only the position of the party served, and (unlike the first argument) did not justify the wider proposition that [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 should be read down so as not to apply where one of the parties is a foreigner who has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court and has on foot an unresolved contest over that jurisdiction.

The argument was that the respect which a state has for the sovereignty of another state requires restraint in the imposition of the Court's compulsory processes upon a person outside Australia, a restraint particularly called for when that person is actively contesting the Court's jurisdiction and the compulsory process is directed to establishing, against the person, the jurisdiction in question. It would be incongruous, it was said, and contrary to "the established criteria of international law with regard to comity" in conformity with which [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 should be construed (citing Arhill Pty Ltd versus General Terminal Co Pty
Ltd [(1990) 23 NSWLR 545] at 553, in turn taking up observations in Re Tucker ex parte Tucker [[1990] Ch 148)], that the foreigner should be imposed upon in those circumstances. It was further said that an application under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 should be dealt with as a brief and relatively informal matter, as described in Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd at 565, not to be complicated by the full panoply of interlocutory processes and in particular not to be complicated by deployment of notices to produce.

Regrettably, the position envisaged in Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd is not often achieved, and this element in the argument was undermined by
Lenfest's own assertion that the hearing of the notice of motion now standing adjourned to 16 August 1996 would be complicated and would occupy over a day.
I do not think that the desirable means of dealing with applications persuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 can lead to a reading down of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 so that it is not available for those applications which can not be dealt with as brief and relatively informal matters.

The other element in the argument has more substance. The jurisdiction in specified cases over persons served with originating process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the state has been described as "exorbitant" jurisdiction (The Siskina at 254 per Lord Diplock), and it was said in
Arhill Pty Ltd versus General Terminal Co Pty Ltd, adopting a distinction drawn in Federal Trade Commission versus Compagnie de Saint-Gobain-Pont-a-Mousson <case>; [636 F2d 1300] , that service of a subpoena, part of a court's compulsive processes, is even more intrusive upon the foreigner than service of originating process: the same can be said of a notice to produce, although the compulsion may be by means other than punishment for contempt. However, the distinction between service of originating process and service of a subpoena has been doubted (see
Simon, [13 Law and Policy in International Business 847] and Treichler, 16 Texas Int L.J. 565 at 571, both commenting on Federal Trade Commission versus Compagnie de Saint-Gobain-Pont-a-
Mousson); and both finding relevant principles of international law and balancing interests competing with a generalised idea of comity have proved to be difficult. Resistance to impinging on foreign sovereignty has not been universal (see the discussions in Collins, [(1991) 10 LQR 10]; Baum, 5 NYL Sch of Int & Comp L 457 (particularly a subpoena where production would violate foreign law) and Soiret, 28 Tort Ins
LJ 533). It may be accepted that generally a state should "refrain from demanding obedience to its sovereign authority by foreigners in respect of their conduct outside the jurisdiction" (Mackinnon versus Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jeannette Securities Corporation [[1986] Ch 482] at 493 per
Hoffmann J), but modern trade and communications and the prevalence of the multinational conglomerate will often undermine the principle, a substantial inroad has been made upon it by [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A, and it may be thought that processes ancillary to giving effect to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A should not be excluded by respect for the sovereignty of foreign states.

It is not entirely clear whether Arhill Pty Ltd versus General Terminal Co Pty
Ltd relevantly involved construction of the rule providing for service of subpoenas to exclude service on a foreigner (no power) or refusal of leave to serve the subpoena (power but adverse exercise of discretion). I am inclined to think the latter (as for example it is seen in Nygh, Conflict of Laws, th ed, 67), but whether or not that is so I do not think [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 should be read down in the manner suggested. In combination with the definition of "party" it clearly empowers service of a notice to produce on a foreign party; the argument for reading it down on comity grounds is not compelling; and there is appropriate control over the exercise of the power through the need for prior leave or confirmation and the provision for an order otherwise already mentioned. There may be circumstances in which, while jurisdiction is still in question, the foreign party will want to serve a notice to produce on the party in the jurisdiction (as in Cigna Insurance
Australia Ltd versus CSR Ltd) and if [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 not be read down so as to exclude that situation, construing it to exclude service of a notice to produce in the opposite direction would call for re-writing going beyond construction.

In my view, therefore, [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p36) r 16 is not to be read down so that it does not empower the service of the notice to produce. The power is conferred, but is controlled by (here) the provision for an order otherwise.

An order otherwise 
The position is complicated by the alternative matters raised in Lenfest's application persuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8. They are essentially of two kinds, whether the Court has no jurisdiction at all and whether, although it has jurisdiction, the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction. An order otherwise may be appropriate for the first kind of matter but not for the second.

For the application persuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8, News was directed to notify Lenfest of the cases in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A on which it relied. They included the cases in paras (b), (c)(i), (iii), (c)(iv) and (d) of that sub-rule, but at the hearing of the present notice of motion it was said that the primary cases were those in paras (b) and (c)(iv). They are - "(b) where the proceedings are founded on a breach within the State of a contract wherever made, whether or not the breach is preceded or accompanied by a breach wherever occurring that renders impossible the performance of any part of the contract which ought to be performed in the State." "(c) where the subject matter of the proceedings is a contract and the contract - ....
 is one a breach of which was committed in the State." 
The point of the notice to produce was said to be to enable, or assist in, proof that the agreement alleged by News was breached in New South Wales.

During the hearing of the notice of motion I raised with the parties whether the discretion to order otherwise should be exercised without regard to the evidence already available to News, or otherwise to be put before the Court, on the application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8. Neither party was concerned to refer to that evidence or to wait until the affidavits on which the application would proceed had been filed and served. I infer that News considers that it needs whatever may be produced in accordance with the notice to produce in order to sufficiently show that the proceedings fall within one of the cases for service of originating process outside Australia, or at least that it considers it possible that without production it may fail to fulfil the burden which it bears in that respect.

So far as Lenfest's application raises whether the Court has jurisdiction at all, at least in relation to the cases in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A (and possibly more widely) it throws up for consideration the same matters as would be raised if News sought leave to proceed under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 2(1). It is proper to approach it bearing in mind that requiring compliance with the notice to produce would assist News to discharge a primary burden, not just to repel Lenfest's contest over jurisdiction, being a primary burden borne by News in the absence of Lenfest's application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8. In my opinion an order otherwise should be made.

Restraint in the imposition of the Court's compulsory processes on Lenfest is rather qualified by its involvement, via subsidiaries, in the commercial pursuits in Australia with which these proceedings have a strong connection; further, if the agreement alleged were made (and I appreciate that it is not established, although it did not seem in dispute) Lenfest itself reached out to Australian commerce. It may be thought not repugnant to American sovereignty, in those circumstances, to require Lenfest to obey the obligation imposed upon service of the notice to produce, when as well Lenfest has participated in the proceedings to the extent of a positive application contesting the Court's jurisdiction, so that it is appropriate to subject
Lenfest to the Court's compulsory processes relevant to determining the contest over jurisdiction. Subpoenas against persons within Australia have been upheld although for the purpose of determining whether an order giving leave to serve originating process outside Australia should be discharged, see
WSGAL Pty Ltd versus Trade Practices Commission <case>; [(1992) 111 ALR 126.] Nor would it necessarily be futile to leave on foot compliance with the notice to produce (concern for the integrity of the
Court's commands requires that it not make futile orders, and that has been seen as reason enough for refusing leave to serve subpoenas on persons outside
Australia where the subpoenas could not be enforced, see Arhill Pty Ltd v
General Terminal Co Pty Ltd and Aetna Pacific Securities Ltd versus Hong Kong
Bank of Australia Ltd (Giles J, 29 April 1995, unreported)). Failure to comply with the notice to produce could be sanctioned by, for example, refusal to entertain Lenfest's application. All these are reasons for declining to make an order otherwise.

But against them stands the compelling consideration that Lenfest is a foreign corporation, served out of Australia, over which the Court asserts jurisdiction only when it is sufficiently shown by News that (inter alia) the proceedings fall within one of the cases in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A. It is difficult to conceive of leave to serve a subpoena or a notice to produce upon such a foreign defendant who does nothing, that is, does not apply pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 (or [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 6A), in order to assist the plaintiff to establish the Court's jurisdiction.
Whatever its strength, and whether or not its strength varies according to the circumstances, from the comity earlier discussed a foreign defendant served outside Australia should not lightly be subjected to the jurisdiction of this
Court, but more important should not have imposed upon him one of the Court's compulsory processes in aid of establishing the jurisdiction itself. That position is not changed when, while contesting the jurisdiction, the defendant participates in the proceedings with a view to establishing the absence of jurisdiction. As was said in re Sherlock [(1991) 102 ALR 156], at 159, in connection with leave to serve outside Australia, "it would not be right ... to make the orders and allow the persons served to take the objection, rather the objection is one the Court ought to take at this stage", and a person served outside Australia should not have to submit to a partial exercise of jurisdiction as the price of contesting whether there is jurisdiction at all. And it may be added that there would realistically be futility in leaving on foot compliance with the notice to produce, since if
Lenfest's application were not heard it would simply continue to deny that the
Court had jurisdiction over it - there would be no determination against
Lenfest, and News would still have to obtain leave to proceed under [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 2(1).

So far as Lenfest's application raises whether, although it has jurisdiction, the Court should decline to exercise that jurisdiction, the position may be different. On the hearing of that application questions of comity will not arise, or if they do will arise in limited ways (such as regard to existing proceedings elsewhere) or with less significance. There will no longer be a question of News discharging from Lenfest's own documents its burden of sufficiently showing that the proceedings fall within one of the cases in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p10) r 1A. But it will be more readily said be that Lenfest is properly subjected to the Court's compulsory processes relevant to determining the contest over the exercise of jurisdiction: for example, if Lenfest can serve a notice to produce on News to assist it to establish something relevant to forum non conveniens (see Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd versus CSR Ltd), why should News not serve a notice to produce on Lenfest for the same purpose and have the notice to produce upheld? News referred in this regard to Partenreederei M/S "Heidberg" versus Grosvenor Grain and Feed Co Ltd (The "Heidberg") [1993] 2 LlR for acceptance that the principle that "if you join the game you must play according to the local rules" extends to defendants who give notice of intention to defend, but that is different from contesting the jurisdiction on forum non conveniens grounds, and it may even be that the documents sought by the notice to produce have no relevance to that aspect of the application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8.

I do not express a concluded view upon an order otherwise so far as Lenfest's application asks that the Court decline in its discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in the proceedings. In the manner the present notice of motion was argued, I do not think a decision upon such an order otherwise can properly be made without knowing what the issues will be on that aspect of the application, and it may be that the parties would wish to put further arguments specifically directed to the notice to produce so far as relevant to forum non conveniens. The present order otherwise should therefore leave future compliance with the notice to produce subject to further order.

There are, it seems to me two possible courses - receive further evidence and hear further argument specifically directed to the notice to produce so far as relevant to forum non conveniens, and further adjourn the notice of motion now standing adjourned to 16 August 1996; or deal first with Lenfest's application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 so far as it raises whether the Court has jurisdiction at all, without the documents called for by the notice to produce, and depending on the result do as in (a) and hear the balance of the application at a later time.

When these reasons are published I will invite submissions on these or any other course, with a view to avoiding wasted expense through uncertainty over what is to occur on 16 August 1996.

I order that the defendant is not obliged to produce the documents referred to in the notice to produce served by the plaintiff on 1 July 1996, as varied by the fax dated 31 July 1996 from the solicitors for the plaintiff to the solicitors for the defendant, until further order.

THE NEWS CORPORATION LIMITED versus LENFEST COMMUNICATIONS INC /96 
FRIDAY, 20 SEPTEMBER 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMERCIAL DIVISION 
GILES J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: By a summons filed on 3 May 1996 The News Corporation Limited ("News") claimed damages from Lenfest Communications Inc ("Lenfest"). The summons was served on Lenfest in the United States of America. Pursuant to [Pt 11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/index.html#p11) r 8 of the Rules, on 13 June 1996 Lenfest filed a notice of motion seeking a declaration that the Court has no jurisdiction over it in respect of the subject matter of the proceedings and an order that the originating process or its service be set aside, and in the alternative (though not so expressed) an order that the Court decline in its discretion to exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings. The notice of motion was heard on 16 and 21 August 1996, and is the subject of these reasons.
 
The claims in the proceedings 
The summons was twice amended, and in its present form (a further amended summons filed on 2 August 1996) claims damages, alternatively equitable compensation or damages, on three causes of action. On the hearing of the notice of motion they were referred to as the contract claim, the estoppel claim, and the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) claim. News stated that it would not proceed with the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) claim, which can therefore be ignored.

In its summary of contentions in the summons News first stated that Australis
Media Limited ("Australis"), the holding company of a company licensed to provide in Australia four pay television services by satellite, was in March seeking substantial funds from investors.

The contract claim was then put forward in the terms - "5. In or about early April 1996 News, Lenfest and Tele-Communications Inc. ("TCI") engaged in negotiations together for the purpose of putting a financing proposal to Australis.
 . It was agreed by each of News, Lenfest and TCI that, in consideration of each forebearing from making any offer to Australis either separately or in conjunction with other third parties, none of News, Lenfest nor TCI would make, separately or be involved in the making by a third party of, a financing proposal to Australis without first notifying the others ("the Agreement").
 
Particulars 
The Agreement was oral and was made during a telephone conference on 9 April 1996 (London time) among Bruce McWilliam and Sam Chisholm on behalf of News, Sam Morris on behalf of Lenfest and Steve Brett and Mary Willis on behalf of TCI. The Agreement was confirmed in a telephone conference on 10 April 1996 (London time) among Bruce McWilliam, Malcolm Turnbull and Cass O'Connor on behalf of News, Fred Vierra, Steve Brett, Mary Willis and Jack Reema (sic) on behalf of TCI, and Sam Morris and Henry Nasser (sic) on behalf of Lenfest.
 . Prior to 19 April 1996, Lenfest conferred with others and put forward a financing proposal to Australis.
 . On or about 19 April 1996, Australis accepted a funding package totalling approximately $200 million from a group of investors which group included Lenfest.
 . By reason of the conduct of Lenfest alleged in paragraph 7, Lenfest has breached the Agreement.
 . By reason of the breach alleged in paragraph 9, News has suffered loss and damage.
 
Particulars 
News has lost the opportunity to reach an agreement which was acceptable to Lenfest and Australis." 
The estoppel claim was then put forward in the terms - "11. Further, or in the alternative, on 9 April and again on 10 April 1996 Lenfest represented to News on each occasion that it would not make separately, or be involved in the making of by a third party, a financing proposal to Australis without first notifying News (referred to respectively as 'the 9 April representation' and the '10 April representation').
 
Particulars April 1996 representation - the representation was oral and was made by Sam Morris of Lenfest during the telephone conference on 9 April 1996 referred to in paragraph 6 above.
 April 1996 representation - the representation was oral and was made by Sam Morris of Lenfest during a telephone conference on 10 April 1996 (London time) among Bruce McWilliam, Malcolm Turnbull and Cass O'Connor on behalf of News, Fred Vierra, Steve Brett, Mary Willis and Jack Reema on behalf of TCI and Sam Morris and Henry Nasser on behalf of Lenfest.
 . Based upon the 9 April representation and 10 April representation together or, alternatively, separately, News assumed that Lenfest would not make separately, or be involved in the making of by a third party, a financing proposal to Australis without first notifying News.
 . In reliance on the assumption referred to in paragraph 12 News: with the consent and knowledge of TCI and Lenfest, put forward a financing proposal to Australis which proposal, inter alia, included provision for News to purchase certain assets of Australis and provisions for the repayment of loans by Australis to Lenfest and did not put forward or consider putting forward, either alone or jointly with others, any other proposal.
 
Particulars 
A proposal dated 11 April 1996 and an amended proposal dated 18 April 1996.
 extended the time by which Australis could accept the proposal from 15 April 1996 to 18 April 1996 and from 18 April 1996 to 19 April 1996.
 . Lenfest knew or ought to have known that News was relying on the assumption referred to in paragraph 12 in putting forward the proposal referred to in paragraph 13(a) and in extending the time by which Australis could accept the proposal as referred to in paragraph 13(b).
 . Without notifying News, prior to 19 April 1996 Lenfest conferred with others and put forward a financing proposal to Australis which was accepted by Australis on or about 19 April 1996.
 
Particulars 
Lenfest conferred with Guiness Peat Group Plc, Publishing & Broadcasting Limited and United International Holdings Limited which group put forward a financing proposal to Australis which was accepted by Australis on or about 19 April 1996.
 . As a result of Lenfest's actions referred to in paragraph 15, News has suffered detriment.
 
Particulars 
News repeats the particulars set out in paragraph 10 above.
 . In the circumstances, Lenfest has failed to act to avoid detriment to News and engaged in unconscionable conduct." 
Para 7 in the contentions did not include that what occurred was without notice to News, nor was that paragraph particularised: compare para 15. On the hearing of the application it was confirmed that para 7 should be treated as if supplemented to correspond with para 15.
 
The burden(s) of proof 
Lenfest could have been passive, reserving for later endeavours to enforce any judgment obtained against it the contention that the Court did not have jurisdiction over it because the Rules did not authorise service of the summons outside Australia. But it was open to Lenfest actively to seek to preclude News from proceeding against it by an application pursuant to [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p11) r 8, in which it contended that the Court did not have jurisdiction over it because the Rules did not authorise service of the summons outside Australia and in the alternative asked the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction on forum non conveniens grounds or on more general discretionary grounds. That is what Lenfest did.

Under the Rules, it was not necessary for News to obtain prior leave of the
Court before serving the summons on Lenfest outside Australia. But because
Lenfest did not enter an appearance within the time limited for appearance (or at all), News could not and can not proceed against it except with the leave of the Court [(Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s10.html) r (1)), and an application for leave to proceed would require consideration of whether the Rules authorised service of the summons outside Australia and whether on forum non conveniens grounds or otherwise in the exercise of discretion it was inappropriate that the leave be granted. Even though News is the respondent to Lenfest's application, because it needs leave to proceed it follows from the observations in Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 538] at 564-5 that for the purposes of the application News bears the burden of persuading the Court that it has jurisdiction (see also Rideout versus Glaxo Group Ltd [[1996] 1 QdR 200] at 202, 208).

To what does that extend? It clearly includes the burden of establishing that the Rules authorised service of the summons outside Australia, but the position is less clear so far as Lenfest asked the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction on forum non conveniens grounds or on more general discretionary grounds. Where the Court otherwise has jurisdiction a defendant bears the burden of persuading the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction (Ocean Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc versus Fay <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 197] at 247-8; Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd at 564;
Henry versus Henry <case>; [(1996) 70 ALJR 480] at 483). What is the position when whether the Court is a clearly inappropriate forum or for some other reason it should not exercise jurisdiction is relevant to a necessary grant of leave to proceed? In that situation, on a defendant's application to set aside the originating process or its service does the defendant still bear the burden of persuading the
Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction? Or is satisfaction that jurisdiction should be exercised part of establishing jurisdiction, with the burden of satisfying the Court falling on the plaintiff (Lenfest submitted that Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd at 564 so stated), and if so is there a separate burden of satisfying the Court that jurisdiction should not be exercised falling on the defendant so far as (as here) the application is accompanied by an application that the Court decline in its discretion to exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings? There is the potential for decision of the same issues, particularly the issue of whether the Court is a clearly inappropriate forum, twice in the same hearing and differently according to how the burden of proof falls.

It is unnecessary to explore these questions, since I can determine the notice of motion without answering them.

Service of the summons outside Australia: general [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1) of the Rules sets out in paras (a) to (x) the cases in which originating process may be served outside Australia. Where there are multiple claims, each of the claims must come within one or more of the paragraphs, and a plaintiff can not proceed against the foreign defendant on claims not falling within a paragraph (see r 1A(1)(x) and Australian Iron & Steel
Pty Ltd versus Jumbo Scheepvaart Maatschappij (Curucao) NV [(1988) 14 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281988%29%2014%20NSWLR%20507 "View LawCiteRecord" ); Williams versus Lips-Heerlen BV (Giles J, 1 November 1991, unreported);
Tycoon Holdings Ltd versus Trencor Jetco Inc <case>; [(1992) 34 FCR 31]; WFM Motors Pty Ltd versus Maydwell (Bryson J, 23 April 1993, unreported); C E Heath Underwriting (Insurance) Australia Pty Ltd versus Barden (Rolfe J, 19 October 1994, unreported); Williams versus The Society of Lloyds <case>; [[1994] 1 VR 274).] 
For the contract claim News relied on the cases in paras (b), (c)(iii) and (iv) of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1) - "(b) where the proceedings are founded on a breach in the State of a contract wherever made, whether or not the breach is preceded or accompanied by a breach wherever occurring that renders impossible the performance of any part of the contract which ought to be performed in the State." "(c) where the subject matter of the proceedings is a contract and the contract - ...
 is governed by the law of the State; or is one a breach of which was committed in the State." 
For the estoppel claim News relied on the case in para (a) of [Pt 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1) - "(a) where the proceedings are founded on a cause of action arising in the State." 
For present purposes the standard of proof required of News is sufficiently expressed in terms of a prima facie or arguable case, but bearing in mind, as noted by Rogers J in Pendal Nominees Pty Ltd versus M & A Investments Pty Ltd [(1989) 18 NSWLR 383], suggested a generally higher test of "strong probability" or the like I do not agree.
 
A summary of material facts 
News is an Australian company with world-wide media interests. Its chairman is
Mr Rupert Murdoch, who lives in New York where News has offices. Its television interests outside the United States of America are in the charge of
Mr Sam Chisholm, the chairman of a division of News named News International
Television. Mr Bruce McWilliam is the director of legal and business affairs of News International Television. Messrs Chisholm and McWilliam live in
England, where News also has offices. Lenfest is an American corporation also with media interests, in particular in cable television: it is one of the major cable television operators in America. At the relevant times Mr Sam
Morris was a vice president and secretary of Lenfest, living in Pennsylvania where Lenfest had its principal offices. Lenfest is half owned by Tele-
Communications Inc ("TCI"), also an American corporation and the largest cable television operator in that country. Its principal offices are in Colorado. Mr
John Malone is president of TCI, Mr Fred Vierra is its executive vice president, and Mr Steve Brett is its vice president and secretary. At the relevant times Mr Malone was also a director of Lenfest.

Australis distributes subscription television services in Australia by microwave transmission, satellite, and cable. It transmits on eight channels a variety of programmes making up what was called in the hearing the Galaxy package. It has raised considerable amounts of capital and debt financing in
Australia and America. In 1995 News acquired, in a joint venture with Telstra
Corporation Ltd ("Telstra") known as Foxtel, convertible notes in Australis and options to obtain shares and further convertible notes, and Foxtel entered into an agreement with Australis' relevant subsidiary whereby some of the programmes in the Galaxy package were licensed to Foxtel for distribution over
Telstra's cable network. Through subsidiaries with media interests in
Australia, in the period from 1993 Lenfest effectively lent money to Australis and sold a satellite licence to Australis in return for shares and convertible notes, and by early 1996 Lenfest held, via subsidiaries, a substantial number of such securities. In early 1996 Australis obtained some funding from TCI, and TCI also held, via subsidiaries, shares and convertible notes in
Australis. In general terms, it is tolerably clear that News, Lenfest, TCI and, when the financing proposal involving Guinness Peat Group Plc ("GPG"),
Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd ("PBL") and United International Holdings
Ltd ("UIH") was put forward, those corporations, each had an eye to involvement through Australis or its subscription television services in the emerging Australian subscription television industry.

In February 1996 Australis was negotiating with TCI for further funding. On 14
February 1996 a meeting was held in Colorado attended by representatives of
Australis, TCI and Lenfest. A little later Mr Vierra contacted Messrs Chisholm and McWilliam about the possibility of News providing funding to Australis; Mr
Rodney Price, the chairman of Australis, had also made the same approach to
Messrs Chisholm and McWilliam.

That lead to discussions in London between Mr Vierra, Mr Brett, Mr Price, Mr
Kleeman (also of Australis) and Mr McWilliam, at which it was agreed (inter alia) that TCI and News would purchase fifty per cent of Australis' programming assets for $125m and would lend Australis $50m on condition that
Australis' bankers, a syndicate of banks in Australia, also advanced $50m and that TCI and News shared in the security. Draft heads of agreement reflecting this were prepared in Sydney by News' solicitors and sent to Australis' solicitors, also in Sydney, on 13 March 1996. The draft heads of agreement provided that the agreement was to be governed by New South Wales law. On 14
March 1996 News' solicitors sent to TCI's solicitors, also in Sydney, a draft joint venture letter between TCI and News directed to their relationship in the agreement with Australis.

That proposal did not proceed. First, it seems that TCI asked that Lenfest participate as a joint venturer with it and News. Secondly, Lenfest was not in favour of the then proposed structure of the funding, for taxation and other reasons including that in certain events News could do away with a minimum guarantee requirement and Lenfest would be prejudiced as a shareholder in
Australis. In lieu of the purchase and loan it was proposed that TCI, Lenfest and News would provide a guarantee for $US150m to Australis' bankers on a short-term basis, to be replaced by public financing of about $US200m underwritten by Salomon Brothers.

How this came about, and with what discussion with Australis, was not entirely clear. More meetings were held in Colorado on 21 and 22 March 1996 between representatives of Australis, TCI and Lenfest, preceded and accompanied by meetings with representatives of Salomon Brothers. On about 21 March 1996 Mr
McWilliam was told by Mr Murdoch that he (Mr Murdoch) had agreed with Mr
Malone to participate in the new proposal, and it seems that a deal was struck and recorded in a letter of 4 April 1996 signed by Mr Malone for TCI, Mr Gerry
Lenfest for Lenfest, and Mr Murdoch for News to do with their control over
Australis and the carrying of certain News programmes on Lenfest's cable television in America. On 22 March 1996 Ms Mary Willis of TCI sent to Mr
McWilliam, then in Sydney, a draft recapitalisation letter addressed by TCI and Lenfest to Australis whereby they agreed to a short-term guarantee of
Australis' borrowings in return for rights to the issue of shares in Australis and to convert the borrowings to equity. The draft letter provided that it should be governed by and construed under the laws of Colorado. On 25 March Ms Willis faxed to Mr McWilliam, to Mr Morris in America, to Mr Henry (also of Lenfest) in Nassau, and to the solicitors for TCI and Lenfest, News, and Australis in Sydney, a redraft of the recapitalisation letter, with a memorandum stating that TCI wished to discuss adding News as a signatory thereto.

The solicitors in Sydney corresponded on further redrafts of the letter, with communications also to Lenfest and TCI in America. As at 9 April 1996 the new proposal had been developed to provide for a guarantee by TCI, Lenfest and
News (TCI and Lenfest through a joint venture company, Shenlake Pty Limited) and heads of agreement for a joint venture between TCI, Lenfest and News governing their relationship in providing the guarantee. Both the draft recapitalisation letter and the draft joint venture agreement as they then stood were expressed to be governed by the law of New South Wales: why the change from the earlier drafts providing for the law of Colorado was not explained. But it does not seem that the draft joint venture agreement had gone to Australis - indeed, the extent of contact with Australis over the draft recapitalisation letter in the period up to 9 April 1996 was not clear.

News had engaged Turnbull & Partners Limited, an Australian merchant bank, to review Australis' business plans and prospects so far as relevant to News' participation in the proposed funding. Mr Malcolm Turnbull is the managing director of Turnbull & Partners Ltd, and Ms Cass O'Connor is an executive director of that company. Messrs Murdoch, Chisholm and McWilliam became concerned that Australis would not be viable without significant capital injections. That led to the telephone conferences on 9 and 10 April 1996 underlying both the contract claim (9 April 1996) and the estoppel claim (9 and 10 April 1996). The evidence of the telephone conferences was uncontested.

As to the conversation on 9 April 1996, Mr McWilliam and Mr Chisholm in
England spoke on a conference call with Mr Morris, Mr Brett and Ms Willis in
Colorado and Pennsylvania. They indicated that News would prefer to purchase programming assets (that is, in concept return to its original proposal) rather than become a creditor of Australis. In the course of the discussion Mr
McWilliam said words to the effect, "Sam [Morris], I know that this may not be your preferred mode of proceeding, however, we are all in this together and we must all agree that no one strike out on their own without first advising the other as we are only going to get this done if there is a united front". Mr
Morris said "Yes", and Mr Brett said "We agree".

As to the conversation on 10 April 1996, Mr McWilliam in England spoke on a conference call with Mr Morris, Mr Nassau (a lawyer engaged by Lenfest), Mr
Vierra, Mr Brett, Ms Willis and Mr Roemer (also of TCI) in Colorado and
Pennsylvania (Mr Vierra may have been in Argentina - it was unclear) and
Messrs Turnbull and Ms O'Connor in Sydney. According to a file note made by Mr
McWilliam, whose account of the conversation was not otherwise in evidence, the Lenfest participants were not persuaded that the new proposal for funding was undesirable, and wanted to proceed with it. The note included - "Lenfest has a desperation to do the deal and have written to KRM [Mr Murdoch] to tell him that unless the deal is done the deal discussed for 890,000 cable subscribers for new channels is off. KRM says he is quite happy and will not be stood over. He says at the end of the day we would only be doing this because of our friendship with TCI but that doesn't mean that we should not warn TCI of the risks. If at the end of the day they still want to go ahead we will go with them. Otherwise he doesn't want them to go on their own and the inter-relationship is such that if TCI does go on its own they will force a merger later on and demand more of Foxtel so we may as well stick together. He says we must keep fighting to get the best deal but if at the end of the day he goes with TCI so be it.
 
At the end of the conference call I asked TCI and Lenfest to confirm that no party would strike out on their own without first notifying the others and they each said they would not do so. I said to Sam Morris of Lenfest that re his threat about the cable carriage deal, he should appreciate that all we were doing was trying to get the best deal for the 3 of us: he said he understood that but his instructions were firmly that the carriage deal was conditional on us doing their deal." 
It would seem that the portion commencing "KRM says ...." records a different conversation between Mr Murdoch and Mr McWilliam. On 9 April 1996 Mr Lenfest in Pennsylvania had sent a letter to Mr Murdoch in New York stating that the deal whereby (inter alia) News' programmes were to be carried on Lenfest's cable television in America was off if News did not join in the then proposed funding. It may well be that mention of no party striking out on its own was provoked by News' desire that it not be left out of the then proposed funding through Lenfest and TCI proceeding with the new proposal in the absence of News, with consequences for carriage of its programmes on Lenfest's cable television in America.

More direct evidence of the conversation on 10 April 1996 was given by Ms O'Connor. According to her, at the end of the call Mr McWilliam said words to the effect, "Steve [Brett] and Sam [Morris], just before I go, our understanding is no one is going to make a move on their own without at least coming back or telling that to the others first. That's a fair assumption isn't it?" Mr Brett replied, "That's a fair assumption", Mr Morris said words to the effect "That's fine", Mr Brett said, "No one disagrees with that then?" and Mr Morris said, "No, no I don't".

There was evidence on information and belief that, based on what was said in the telephone conferences, Mr McWilliam assumed that Lenfest would not make separately, or be involved in the making of by a third party, a financing proposal to Australis without first notifying News. News itself made a separate financing proposal to Australis on 11 April 1996, after a number of drafts ultimately an amended proposal on 18 April 1996, with prior notice to
TCI and Lenfest and in effect their blessing. The amended proposal of 18 April involved purchasing programming assets of Australis for $275m, satisfied by taking over the loans from TCI and Lenfest and otherwise in cash, plus a limited guarantee in favour of Australis' bankers, with an option to Australis to repurchase 49% of the programming assets. According to the same evidence,
Mr McWilliam relied on what was said in the telephone conferences and the assumption it engendered in putting forward those proposals, in extending deadlines for their acceptance so that the proposals could be structured in ways requested by TCI and Lenfest, and in not putting forward, alone or with others, any other proposal.

At 11.34 am on 19 April 1996 there was sent from CPH Corporate in Sydney to a fax number in Sydney said to be that of Australis (but maybe not) a letter of that date from PBL and PBL Film Library Pty Ltd ("PBL Film") to Australis and
Australis Holdings Pty Ltd ("Australis Holdings"). It read - "We hereby offer to provide your bankers with a guarantee subject to and upon the Terms and Conditions set out in the attached Guarantee Facility Term Sheet.
 
The offer is also subject to the parties listed in Schedule 3 all agreeing to join this offer by executing this document in the relevant spaces indicated below.

The Guarantee Facility Term Sheet faxed together with the letter recorded that PBL and PBL Film would guarantee or procure the provision of a guarantee of the obligations of Australis Holdings Pty Limited under what was described as the Bank Facility in a particular amount and that Lenfest, UIH Asia/Pacific, Inc and GPG would guarantee or procure the provision of guarantees of the obligations of Australis Holdings Pty Limited under the Bank Facility in certain other amounts. The purpose of the guarantee facility was stated to be to enable Australis to arrange for an increase in the Bank Facility, with the proceeds to be applied in a particular way, and the Guarantee Facility Term Sheet went on to deal with terms, priority, security and various other matters. One of the matters was a right of first refusal, on certain conditions, of Australis' programming assets. From the detailed terms, it is unlikely that the offer of funding which it embodied would have been made on behalf of (inter alia) Lenfest unless Lenfest had been involved in the drafting thereof.

At 12.10 pm, 12.11 pm and 12.35 pm there were sent from CPH Corporate to the same fax number copies of the page in the earlier fax providing for signature for and on behalf of the Schedule 3 parties by way of agreement to join the offer bearing, respectively, signatures on behalf of GPG, UIH Asia/Pacific,
Inc and Lenfest. The fax of 12.11 pm included a copy of the page providing for acceptance for and on behalf of Australis and Australis Holdings with a signature on their behalves.

The fax number may not have been that of Australis: it was not the same as the fax number on an Australis letterhead in evidence, and I do not think the number was otherwise identified. Some additional cryptic fax headers did not give a clear picture of the communications. The relevant documents in evidence were produced on subpoena by GPG. Lenfest did not call evidence to explain its participation.

According to the evidence, all this was done without notice to Mr Chisholm or
Mr McWilliam: in so far as the evidence went, there was otherwise no prior notice to News. The evidence on information and belief earlier mentioned included that, had Lenfest told Mr Chisholm or Mr McWilliam that it proposed to go ahead with a funding proposal substantially in accordance with the draft recapitalisation letter, Mr McWilliam would have been directed to agree to an increase in the price to be paid by News to Australis for the programming assets, or to decline to extend the then current deadline for News' own proposal and participate in a proposal of the kind in fact put to and accepted by Australis.
 
Service of the summons outside Australia: the contract claim 
Lenfest submitted, and News accepted, that for each of paras (b), (c)(iii) and (iv) of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1) it was incumbent on News to establish, to the requisite standard of proof, that there was a contract: that is, in order to prove that the proceedings were founded on a breach in the State of a contract wherever made, or that the subject matter of the proceedings was a contract and the contract was governed by the law of the State or was one a breach of which was committed in the State, the first step was to prove the contract. The submission is supported by Seaconsar Far East Ltd versus Bank Markazi Jomhouri
Islami Iran [[1994] 1 AC 439] at 453-4, where Lord Goff (with whose speech Lords
Templeman, Griffiths, Browne-Wilkinson and Mustill agreed) observed that four members of the Appellate Committee must be taken to have decided in
Vitkovice Horni a Hutni Tezirstvo versus Korner [[1951] AC 869] that, when considering the paragraph equivalent to para (c)(iv), "all three elements of contract, breach and place of breach must be established ... before the plaintiff can successfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court under that paragraph". It is therefore necessary to address whether the contract alleged was made, and if so whether it was governed by the law of New South Wales, whether it was breached, and whether the breach was committed in New South
Wales.

The making of a contract 
News submitted that there was an agreement on 9 April 1996 because Mr
McWilliam asked for agreement and Mr Morris and Mr Brett expressed agreement, that the agreement was part of negotiations between commercial men apt to have been regarded by them as intended to create legal relations (referring to
Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd versus Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty
Ltd [1988] 5 BPR 97326 at 11,117), and that although the words were informal the Court would if possible give effect to the intention of the parties (referring to York Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (A/sia) Pty Ltd versus The
Commonwealth <case>; <case>; [(1967) 118 CLR 429] at 436-7) and would do so by finding the contract alleged in the summons. The commercial and hence legal significance of the exchange on 9
April 1996 was reinforced, it was said, by the repetition of the same matter on 10 April 1996. (It was also said that the same reinforcement could be found in subsequent conduct in conformity with the alleged contract, that is, in
News' conduct after 10 April 1996 in keeping Lenfest and TCI informed of its separate proposal to Australis, but that is not a strong point: News had its own reasons for acting as it did, and on News' case in these proceedings
Lenfest did not act in conformity with the alleged contract.) 
Lenfest submitted that the exchange on 9 April 1996 did not rise above a consensus that unanimity was required if any proposal for funding Australis was to be consummated, that it was but a passing incident in the course of joint consideration of whether and how to proceed not apt to give to rise to legal relations, and that it should not be found that sophisticated commercial parties with teams of lawyers behind them would commit themselves to a binding contract of the kind and in the manner alleged. Further, and supporting these matters, it was said that the words used suffered from such obscurity that the contract alleged could not be found in them, being obscurity in the meaning of "strike out on their own", in the time for which the parties were to be bound and in particular when they might become free to act alone should the common negotiations with Australis drag on, change their content, or break down, and in the requirement of prior notice. Would notice five minutes before striking out on one's own suffice, and if so what was the utility of the agreement? It could not be accepted, Lenfest said, that commercial men would have intended to bind themselves so casually and so obscurely, and the exchange was no more contractual than if Mr McWilliam had said that they would not get the deal done unless they met face to face the next week to resolve their different views on the funding proposal and that had been agreed to.

Whether a contract was made will be an ultimate issue in the proceedings, so looking for a greater degree of assurance as suggested by Rogers J would not be appropriate. It is plain from the competing submissions that there are considerations both for and against whether a contract was made, but in my view there is a prima facie or arguable case, a sufficient case so far as the making of a contract is an element in establishing that the Rules authorised service of the summons outside Australia, that a contract was made. TCI,
Lenfest and News were prospective joint venturers in providing funding to
Australis. A difference had arisen over whether they should do so by continuing with the new proposal or should in concept return to the original proposal. As appears from the letters of 4 and 9 April 1996 and that part of
Mr McWilliam's note recording his conversation with Mr Murdoch, sticking together was commercially significant to News for reasons going beyond the immediate funding of Australis, and as appears from the same letters and the surrounding parts of Mr McWilliam's note participation by News in the funding was commercially significant to Lenfest for a reason going beyond the immediate funding. The context gave to the exchange an importance far beyond recognition of a need for unanimity or future cooperation, there were unequivocal expressions of agreement, and in the circumstances commercial men could well have intended to create a legally binding agreement, without the involvement of their lawyers, in order to deal with the possibility that the newly arisen difference between them would lead to separate dealings with
Australis. There may be difficulties in the words used, and uncertainty in what was agreed is relevant to whether there was a contractual intention (see
Australian Broadcasting Corporation versus XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd [(1988) NSWLR 540)], but the Court will endeavour to give content to an expressed agreement. The obscurity is not so great that, with the assistance of closer examination of the context, the actions of the parties, and appropriate inferences and implications than is appropriate on this application, the making of the contract alleged is not well arguable.

The proper law of the contract 
It was common ground that, in the absence of an express choice of law clause, in order to identify the proper law of the contract it was necessary to enquire into the presumed (or inferred actual) intention of the parties and, if no presumed intention could be found, to identify that system of law with which the contract had the closest and most real connection: see Mendelson-
Zeller Co Inc versus T & C Providores Pty Ltd [[1981] 1 NSWLR 366]; John
Kaldor Fabricmaker Pty Ltd versus Mitchell Cotts Freight (Australia) Pty Ltd [(1989) 18 NSWLR 172.] 
News submitted that the contract should be seen against the background that all parties had commercial links with Australia (and in particular with
Australis, a New South Wales company), and that the strength of those links was underlined by the fact that all parties used solicitors in Sydney for drafting and/or redrafting the original proposal and the draft recapitalisation letter and draft joint venture agreement for the new proposal. The lastmentioned documents came to provide that they would be governed by the law of New South Wales, which again showed that (relevantly)
News and Lenfest regarded their relationship in connection with the funding of
Australis as a New South Wales relationship. When as well the commercial subject-matter of the contract was the funding of a New South Wales company, and as part thereof the possible acquisition of equity in Australis or of some of its programming assets situated in New South Wales and elsewhere in
Australia, either the parties should be presumed to have intended that the contract be governed by the law of New South Wales or it should be found that the contract had the closest and most real connection with the system of law in New South Wales. In particular, said News, if it were asked what other system of law provided the proper law for the contract, there was no credible alternative. The only connection with English law was that Messrs Chisholm and
McWilliam happened to be telephoning from England. Lenfest and TCI were
American corporations and their participants were wholly or mostly in America, but they were in different states and thus threw up different systems of law.
If TCI's representative was in Argentina, it otherwise had no claim to provide the proper law. Where a contract was made between corporations with world-wide media interests in a conference telephone call between continents, little significance should be attached to the happenstance that the contract may have been made, in the eyes of the law, in a city in America or possibly in
England.

On the other hand, Lenfest submitted that the contract was tripartite (although not joined in the proceedings, TCI must have been a party to it), and that all parties had substantial connections with America. Lenfest and TCI were American corporations, and although they had commercial interests and a degree of indirect involvement in subscription television services in
Australia, their principal focus was overwhelmingly American and their external attentions were relevantly to Australia rather than New South Wales in particular. Lenfest had no registered office in New South Wales or elsewhere in Australia, and no physical presence by employees or a place of business. Although News was incorporated in South Australia (not New South
Wales), seven of its twelve directors were resident in America, Mr Murdoch had his principal office in New York and was a United States citizen, and only one of News' directors was resident in New South Wales. All the negotiations between Australis and TCI and between TCI, Lenfest and News prior to the lawyers getting down to drafting and redrafting took place outside New South
Wales, mostly in America, and while the underlying occasion for the contract was a proposal for funding Australis the contract itself did not involve
Australis but was between, in substance, American financiers. Little weight could be given to the provisions in the draft recapitalisation letter and joint venture agreement that they should be governed by the law of New South
Wales, because it was not known why or how that provision came to be made,
Australis had not had the opportunity to agree to it, and in any event a contract between prospective American financiers in the course of and for the purposes of coming to terms with Australis was more aptly governed by an
American system of law than by the system of law which might govern the financing. So, Lenfest said, it should be presumed that the contract was intended to be governed by a system of American law, or alternatively the closest and most real connection was with a system of American law, but if it was in the balance then, in conformity with the approach of Sheppard J in
Stanley Kerr Holdings Pty Ltd versus Gibor Textile Enterprises Ltd [[1978] 2
NSWLR 3728] at 380, the matter must be resolved in favour of Lenfest.

The proper law of the contract may or may not be an ultimate issue in the proceedings. It is too early to tell, but at least for this application it was not suggested that success or failure in the contract claim would turn on or be affected by a finding as to the proper law and I will assume that it will not be an ultimate issue.

As with the making of a contract, there are considerations both for and against whether the proper law of the contract was the law of New South Wales or whether it was some other system of law. The diversity in the location of the corporations and their representatives, the lack of clear connection with the law of one state in America rather than another (eg Colorado rather than
Pennsylvania), and, at the Australian end, a degree of connection with
Australia rather than New South Wales, give added significance to the selection of the law of New South Wales as the governing law in the draft recapitalisation letter and joint venture agreement. Even if the contract could be seen as in substance between American financiers, which is certainly an over-simplification, where no system of law obviously applied to their relationship those financiers chose New South Wales law to govern their joint venture, and that is a strong ground for presuming an intention that New South
Wales law would also govern the contract as a side agreement on the way to finalising the joint venture. Alternatively, it provides a clear pointer, amongst a number of unclear and inconsistent indicators, to New South Wales law as the system of law with which the same contract was connected. In my view there is a prima facie or arguable case, indeed a strong one, that the proper law of the contract was New South Wales.

Breach of the contract 
I have set out the offer faxed from CPH Corporate and the faxes of signature pages. No point was taken that the offerors included PBL Film, that the offerees included Australis Holdings, or that one of the participants was UIH
Asia/Pacific, Inc rather than UIH. CPH Corporate was in effect PBL and PBL
Film. Notwithstanding uncertainty as to the fax number, in my opinion it is a proper conclusion that the various pages were exchanged between the offerors, the participants, and the offerees on 19 April 1996. News submitted that it should be inferred that the dispatch of the offer was on behalf of (inter alia) Lenfest, and in my view that inference is readily available. It submitted that Lenfest's participation as offeror was involvement in the making by a third party of a financing proposal to Australis, which again can readily be found. There was no prior notice to News. There is a sound case of breach, and Lenfest's submission that there was no evidence of Lenfest's negotiations with PBL and others in the period leading up to the offer is of no consequence: the dispatch of the offer on its behalf was enough.

The place of breach 
Where the contract was breached is unlikely to be an ultimate issue in the proceedings, and I approach this question in the manner of which Rogers J spoke.

CPH Corporate was the offices of PBL in Sydney. News submitted that the substance of the breach was Lenfest "striking out on its own". That was done, it said, by the dispatch of the offer, and so the breach was committed in New
South Wales. Lenfest submitted that the substance of the breach was involvement in the making of a financing proposal to Australis without first notifying News, not only because the contract and the breach were alleged with absence of prior notice as an essential element but also because News claimed to have suffered loss and damage through loss of an opportunity to reach an agreement which was acceptable to Lenfest and Australis. What was critical was the absence of prior notice, because the involvement in making the offer of itself, had there been prior notice, would not have been a breach and would not have caused loss and damage. Indeed, News had put forward a separate proposal, with notice to TCI and Lenfest, underlining that what mattered was notification. It was therefore necessary to ask, where did the breach of failure to notify take place, and the answer was that it took place where the notification would have been given had it been given (referring to Voth v
Manildra Flour Mills Ltd for the proposition that in that case the relevant failure to warn occurred where the warning would have been given had it been given, namely in Missouri). The notification would have been given to Mr
Murdoch in New York or to Mr Chisholm and/or Mr McWilliam in London, but on the evidence not to any representative of News in New South Wales, and so (said Lenfest) the breach was not committed in New South Wales.

In Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd the plaintiff sued an accountant practising in Missouri for damages for professional negligence, claiming that the defendant had acted without due care in failing to draw to its attention, and to the attention of a related company in America to which the plaintiff sold products, that the plaintiff was liable to pay tax on interest payable by the related company and the related company was obliged to deduct and withhold the tax. One question was whether the plaintiff's cause of action was a foreign tort for the purposes of the double actionability rule in Phillips v
Eyre [(1870) LR 6 QB 1.] To resolve the issue it was asked what was the place of the act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff its cause of complaint. In the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ it was said (at 568-9) - "The present case is one that may properly be described either as failure to advise (ie, an omission) or as a negligent misstatement of fact (ie, a positive act). Strictly, the complaint is one of negligent omission, namely, failure to do various things, including failure to draw the attention of MMC and the members of the Manildra Group (including the respondents) to the requirement to pay withholding tax on MMC's interest payments to the first respondent. However, there are cases where, when information is being imparted, the failure to draw attention to some particular matter is, for practical purposes, the same as a positive statement as to that matter. That was the situation in Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd versus Parramatta City Council (No 1). And it would seem that that is also the present case, for, in a context in which the appellant was providing professional accountancy services on the basis that withholding tax was not payable, the failure to draw attention to the requirement that it be paid was, for all practical purposes, equivalent to a positive statement that it was not payable. When the case is approached on that basis it is clear that, in substance, the cause of complaint is the act of providing the professional accountancy services on an incorrect basis. The same is true if the matter is approached as an omission, for the omission takes it significance from that same act of providing those services. That act is in no way comparable to an act, such as that in Diamond and 'The Alberforth', which passes across space to be completed in some place different from the place where it was initiated. The act of providing accountancy services was an act complete in itself, or, if not complete in itself, one that was initiated and completed in the one place. That place was Missouri. The fundamental significance of that simple fact is not diminished merely because it may be possible, for the purpose of legal classification, to treat that act as equivalent to a statement that was received or acted upon in Australia.
 
The act of the appellant giving the respondents their cause of complaint was committed in Missouri and thus the tort, if there was one, was committed in Missouri ....." 
The issue was not where a breach of contract was committed, and the reasoning addressed the act of providing accountancy services rather than the act or omission of failure to advise. However, in my opinion the reasoning supports the view that in determining where a breach of contract was committed one must ask where, in substance, the act giving the plaintiff his cause of complaint took place, and, if that act is a failure to notify, must answer that it took place where the provision of notice should have occurred. In my view the substance of the breach alleged was the failure to give prior notice, and if notice had been given it would have been given to Mr Chisholm or Mr McWilliam in England (as News' evidence of acting on an assumption indicated). I do not think that News has made out a prima facie or arguable case that the breach of contract was committed in New South Wales.

My conclusion as to place of breach does not affect the result. News has not established that the contract claim comes within para (b) or para (c)(iv) of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1), but has established that it falls within para (c)(iii). In relation to the contract claim, service of the summons outside Australia was authorised.

Service of the summons outside Australia: the estoppel claim 
If it is to be held that, in relation to the estoppel claim, the proceedings are founded on a cause of action arising in New South Wales, it must be held that there is a cause of action: apart from common sense, see the similar reasoning in Vitkovice Horni a Hutni Tezirstvo versus Korner and Seaconsar
Far East Ltd versus Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran in relation to a contract claim. A cause of action in estoppel was disputed, as was whether any such cause of action arose in New South Wales.

A cause of action 
For a cause of action News relied on Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v
Maher <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 387] and The
Commonwealth versus Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394. In Waltons Stores (Interstate)
Ltd versus Maher it was held that although for want of an exchange of parts no binding agreement for a lease had come into existence, Waltons was estopped from denying the existence of a binding agreement. An award of damages in substance for breach of an agreement for lease was upheld. Mason CJ and Wilson
J saw the doctrine of promissory estoppel as leading in some cases to the enforcement of voluntary promises (see in particular at 402, 406); Brennan J contemplated that equitable estoppel could justify a decree that a party's expectation be specifically fulfilled by the party bound by the equity (see at ); with reference to the assertion that estoppel can be used only as a shield and not as a sword, Deane J said that an estoppel which precluded the defendant from denying the existence of a binding contract "provides the factual foundation of an ordinary action for enforcement of that 'contract' notwithstanding that those facts demonstrate that no binding contract was actually made" (at 445). The facts in The Commonwealth versus Verwayen did not postulate a cause of action in estoppel, but Brennan J observed (at 429) that although the remedy yielded by equitable estoppel was not designed to enforce a promise, in some situations (of which Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v
Maher was an example) the minimum equity would not be satisfied by anything short of enforcing the promise, and said (at 430) that a party who was entitled to equitable relief to make good some detriment suffered in reliance on a promise "has a cause of action rather than an answer to a plea raised by a defendant-promisor in proceedings to enforce another cause of action".
McHugh J said (at 500) that the equitable doctrines of estoppel create rights, giving rise to equities which are enforceable against the party estopped, and (at 501) that although the enforcement of promises was not the object of the doctrine of equitable estoppel often the only way to prevent the promisee suffering detriment would be to enforce the promise. It is true that Deane J said (at 445) that estoppel by conduct does not of itself constitute an independent cause of action, but his Honour went on to say that the assumed fact or state of affairs which one party was estopped from denying might be used aggressively as the factual foundation of an action arising under ordinary principles with the entitlement to ultimate relief being determined on the basis of the existence of that fact or state of affairs.

The present application is not an occasion for deeper consideration of the jurisprudential nature of estoppel. Estoppel has long been known in the law, but has developed in recent years (as the discussions in The Commonwealth v
Verwayen in particular show) and is still developing. Where [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1) refers to a cause of action it should not be given narrow scope, confined to something like the old forms of action, but should extend to possibly new sources of legal rights. In Williams versus Milotin <case>; [(1957) 97 CLR 465] at 474 a cause of action was described as "the essential ingredients in the title to the right which it is proposed to enforce": other descriptions have been given, including in Papps versus Mahon [[1966] NZLR ] at "all the facts and circumstances necessary to give rise to a right to relief in law or equity". The emphasis is on the material facts from which relief flows, not on the label given to the legal institution, and the observations in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd versus Maher and The
Commonwealth versus Verwayen to which I have referred make it strongly arguable, in my view, that for the purposes of para (a) of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1) it can be said that a claim in the nature of the estoppel claim is a cause of action.

Lenfest submitted that, even so, the estoppel claim as framed by News was deficient, because it did not allege that Lenfest was estopped from denying the existence of an otherwise accepted cause of action (or from denying anything at all). A cause of action in estoppel, it said, could not rise above the state of affairs given the relevant assumption, and here if there was no contract the assumed state of affairs did not give News any legally enforceable rights because there was no entitlement to damages simply for action on a misrepresentation. I do not think this gives sufficient recognition to the way in which principles of estoppel operate. If a party claiming the benefit of an estoppel has adopted an assumption as a basis of action or inaction, such that he would be significantly disadvantaged if departure from the assumption were permitted, and the other party has played such a part in the adoption of the assumption that departure from it would be unconscionable, relief may be given designed to overcome the disadvantage. The relief may be, but need not be, by erecting (in the words of Deane J noted above) a factual foundation of an action arising under ordinary principles.
But, as other statements in The Commonwealth versus Verwayen also noted above show, the relief may be by enforcing a promise even though there is no contract or by otherwise making good the claiming party's detriment. Relief is not limited to where the estoppel precludes the other party from denying the existence of an otherwise accepted cause of action, and an allegation of such an estoppel is not necessary. In my view the summons sufficiently alleges facts from which it is well arguable that principles of estoppel would lead to relief by way of damages to compensate for the detriment of loss of the opportunity to reach an agreement acceptable to Lenfest and Australis.

Where did the cause of action arise? 
News submitted that the cause of action arose in New South Wales because, looking at the substance of the matter (see Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty
Ltd at 567), the representation giving rise to News' assumption was intended to be acted upon in New South Wales, it was acted upon in New South Wales, and the detriment was suffered in New South Wales. The representation was intended to be acted upon in New South Wales because it was there that any separate funding proposal by TCI, Lenfest or News would have been put forward to
Australis: Australis was based in Sydney, the dealings with Australis in relation to the original proposal and the new proposal were in the main by communication with its solicitors in Sydney, and the funding proposal by
Lenfest, PBL, GPG and UIH on 19 April 1996 was communicated to Australis in
Sydney. So refraining from involvement in a separate financing proposal would take place in Sydney. The representation was acted upon in New South Wales because News refrained from increasing its own offer price and extended time for Australis to accept its offer, and refrained from any other separate financing proposal, all by acts in Sydney or omissions to act in Sydney. The detriment was suffered in New South Wales because an agreement acceptable to
Lenfest and Australis would or could (it did not matter which when the loss was loss of a chance) have been governed by New South Wales law and involved an immediate or a contingent right to acquire or gain equity in Australis' programming assets situated in New South Wales and because the loss "came home" to News at its principal place of business in Sydney. On this last point, reference was made to Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd versus Spanish-
Polish Shipping Co Inc (The Katowice II) [(1990) 25 NSWLR 568] at 577.

As before, there are competing considerations which Lenfest's submissions brought out. To say that loss was suffered by News in Sydney is artificial: it is a South Australian company, it operated world-wide, and even if it had a significant office in Sydney that was no reason to treat any detriment as suffered in New South Wales. Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd versus Spanish-
Polish Shipping Co Inc (The Katowice II) was quite a different case: damage in New South Wales by depletion of the assets of the plaintiff, which carried on its business in that state, in order to pay for repairs to the goods was seen as sufficient, but that did not apply when the plaintiff carries on business and has assets all over the world. That a separate agreement acceptable to Lenfest and Australis might have been governed by New South
Wales law mattered not, because that was no reason to treat any detriment as suffered in New South Wales, and loss of the prospect of acquiring or gaining equity in Australis' programming assets pointed to an Australia-wide impact, not one confined to New South Wales. Most important, what was critical to the representation, as it was critical to the breach of contract in the contract claim, was the absence of prior notice, as was clearly demonstrated by the fact that News did proceed with its separate proposal to Australis but with notice to TCI and Lenfest. Looking at News' position, the substance of the estoppel claim was reliance on the assumption, and the reliance lay in News' conduct in giving notice of its separate proposal to TCI and Lenfest in
America and in Mr McWilliam deciding in London that News would not otherwise put forward a separate funding proposal. Looking at Lenfest's position, what would make it unconscionable for Lenfest now to depart from the assumption was its conduct in America (or possibly England) contributing to adoption of the assumption, and its failure to disabuse News of the assumption by telling News that it was conferring with others and putting forward a financing proposal to
Australis: as with the contract claim, that failure took place in England.

It is unlikely that where the cause of action in estoppel arose will be an ultimate issue in the proceedings. I consider that the better view is that the cause of action arose in America or England, where there took place the conduct which generated the assumption (the telephone conferences), the adoption of the assumption (Mr McWilliam's reliance), and the second element of that which could make departure from the assumption unconscionable (failure to give notice to News). The argument for the cause of action arising in New
South Wales is, in my view, far from strong, and I do not think it achieves a prima facie or arguable case sufficient for satisfaction that News has established that the estoppel claim comes within paragraph (a) of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p10) r 1A(1). In relation to the estoppel claim, service of the summons outside
Australia was not authorised.

Forum non conveniens 
In Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd at 564 it was held by 
Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ that the principles to be applied in applications for a stay on inappropriate forum grounds are those stated by 
Deane J in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc versus Fay at 247-8.
Deane J saw the basis of the power to stay in the general principle whereby a court could dismiss or stay proceedings which are vexatious or oppressive or an abuse of process, its rationale being the avoidance of injustice between the parties in the particular case. His Honour said that "oppressive" should be understood as meaning seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging, while "vexatious" should be understood as meaning productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment. Summarising what he described as the modern content of the traditional principles governing the power of a court in this country to order that proceedings which have been regularly instituted within jurisdiction should be dismissed or stayed on inappropriate forum grounds, his Honour said - "That power is a discretionary one in the sense that its exercise involves a subjective balancing process in which the relevant factors will vary and in which both the question of the comparative weight to be given to particular factors in the circumstances of a particular case and the decision whether the power should be exercised are matters for individual judgment and, to a significant extent, matters of impression. The power should only be exercised in a clear case and the onus lies upon the defendant to satisfy the local court in which the particular proceedings have been instituted that it is so inappropriate a forum for the determination that their continuation would be oppressive and vexatious to him. Ordinarily, a defendant will be unable to discharge that onus unless he can identify some appropriate foreign tribunal to whose jurisdiction the defendant is amenable and which would entertain the particular proceedings at the suit of the plaintiff. Otherwise, that onus will ordinarily be discharged by a defendant who applies promptly for a stay or dismissal if he persuades the local court that, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case and the availability of the foreign tribunal, it is a clearly inappropriate forum for the determination of the dispute between the parties. The reason why that is so is that, once it is accepted that the adjectives 'oppressive' and 'vexatious' are not to be narrowly or rigidly construed and are to be applied in relation to the effect of the continuation of the proceedings rather than the conduct of the plaintiff in continuing them, the continuation of proceedings in a tribunal which is a clearly inappropriate forum would, in the absence of exceptional circumstances being established by the plaintiff ..., be oppressive or vexatious to such a defendant if there is some available and appropriate tribunal in another country. Admittedly, that approach to the 'vexatious' and 'oppressive' test is less stringent and less rigid than would have been accepted in the nineteenth century. Under it, the applicable test pursuant to traditional principles can, in the ordinary case, properly be seen as an 'inappropriate forum' test. It cannot, however, properly be seen as a 'more appropriate forum' test since the mere fact that a tribunal in some other country would be a more appropriate forum for the particular proceeding does not necessarily mean that the local court is a clearly inappropriate one." 
The "clearly inappropriate forum" test was affirmed in Henry versus Henry, in which Dawson, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ emphasised (at 489) that whether the chosen forum is a clearly inappropriate forum is to be determined by considering whether continuation of the proceedings would be oppressive or vexatious, in the extended sense in which those words were used by Deane J in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc versus Fay.

On 6 June 1996 Lenfest filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in which it sought a declaration that there was no agreement between News and Lenfest on or about 10 April 1996 as alleged by News in these proceedings. News was served on 7 June 1996. On 27
June 1996 News filed a motion to dismiss or stay the Pennsylvania litigation, which motion was denied in an order dated 5 August 1996: no Opinion or statement of reasons was given, as is not unusual. According to the evidence of Mr Ralph A. Jacobs, an attorney licensed to practise law in Pennsylvania and acting for Lenfest in the Pennsylvania litigation, Pennsylvania law recognises a cause of action for breach of contract, the relief available including damages, and a cause of action based on promissory estoppel (sometimes referred to as detrimental reliance) in which damages are available in an amount that is just and equitable under the circumstances. It appears, therefore, that the Pennsylvania court accepts jurisdiction at the suit of
Lenfest and over News in relation to at least the contractual consequences of the telephone conferences, and that in general terms it recognises a cause of action in estoppel. In the absence of evidence or a submission to the contrary, it may be inferred that the Pennsylvania court would entertain the contract claim and the estoppel claim at the suit of News, and there was reference to a cross claim by News in the Pennsylvania litigation although it was unclear whether News had lodged a cross claim. I consider that in the present case there is an available foreign tribunal.

The availability of a foreign tribunal does not mean that this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the proceedings. However, the foreign tribunal is not only available: the Pennsylvania litigation is on foot. In Henry v
Henry particular attention was given to the significance of parallel proceedings in another country with respect to the same issues, and it was said (at 490) that there are more compelling considerations in favour of a stay of the local proceedings if, as can happen, there are proceedings in another country which has jurisdiction to entertain those proceedings and the proceedings are between the same parties and with respect to the same issue or controversy. After pointing out the inconvenience and embarrassment of two independent actions involving the same question of liability contemporaneously in different courts, it was then said - "It is prima facie vexatious and oppressive, in the strict sense of those terms, to commence a second or subsequent action in the courts of this country if an action is already pending with respect to the matter in issue. And although there are cases in which it has been held that it is not prima facie vexatious, in the strict sense of that word, to bring proceedings in different countries, the problems which arise if the identical issue or the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the matter are such, in our view, that, prima facie, the continuation of one or the other should be seen as vexatious or oppressive within the Voth sense of those words.
 
It does not follow that, because one or other of the proceedings is prima facie vexatious or oppressive within the Voth sense of those words, the local proceedings should be stayed. However, it does follow that the fact that there are or, even, that there may be simultaneous proceedings in different countries with respect to the same controversy is highly relevant to the question whether the local proceedings are oppressive in the sense of 'seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging', or, vexatious, in the sense of 'productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment'. And it also follows that courts should strive, to the extent that Voth permits, to avoid that situation." 
In Henry versus Henry the proceedings in Monaco were brought well before the proceedings in Australia. In the present case the proceedings in this Court were brought before the proceedings in the Pennsylvania court, and the Pennsylvania litigation was clearly enough a response to the bringing of these proceedings by News. So much is underlined by the nature of the Pennsylvania litigation, seeking a negative declaration specifically addressed to News' claim in these proceedings. Proceedings for negative declaratory relief brought in an appropriate forum will not necessarily be deprecated as forum shopping or a tactic to influence a jurisdictional contest (see the discussions in Collins, "Negative declarations and the Brussels Convention", [(1992) 108 LQR 545], Dicey and Morris on The Conflict of Laws, 12th ed (1993) 406-408, and Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd versus CSR Ltd (Rolfe J, 15 August 1995, unreported)), but the timing and nature of the Pennsylvania litigation are relevant to whether, in striving within the principles in Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd to avoid duplication of proceedings, the continuation of the proceedings in this Court should be seen as vexatious or oppressive. The existence of Pennsylvania litigation, a fairly blatant tactic, does not in my view weigh heavily in favour of continuation of the proceedings in this Court being vexatious or oppressive.

Regard should be had to "connecting factors" (as discussed by Lord Goff in
Spiliada Maritime Corporation versus Cansulex Ltd [[1987] 1 AC 460] at 477-8, see
Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd at 564-5). The connecting factors were canvassed extensively in submissions, and it is impracticable to detail all that was said. In Voth versus Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd at 565 it was said that ordinarily it will be unnecessary to do more than briefly indicate that, having examined the material in evidence and having taken account of the competing written or oral submissions, he is of the view that the proceedings should or should not be stayed on forum non conveniens grounds. In deference to the attention given to the question by the parties, I propose to go further, even at the risk to which Kirby P referred in Bank of America v
Bank of New York at 40,336.

I have taken account of all the matters said to be relevant to whether this
Court is a clearly inappropriate forum, and the following are the principal factors to which attention was given.

I have already set out the reasons for the view that the proper law of the contract was New South Wales law. Apart from that, it was not suggested that, if some other system of law were to govern resolution of the contract claim (or for that matter the estoppel claim) there was statutory or other divergence from the legal principles which would be applied in this Court, and
I do not think it can be said with any force that regard to the law to be applied detracts from the appropriateness of this Court as a forum.

Likely witnesses are spread around the world. I have already referred to the participants in the telephone conferences, based in England, America and
Australia, and although the details were unclear it is likely that other
Australian based witnesses (for example from Australis and maybe PBL) would be called in relation to the loss alleged by News. In the Pennsylvania court testimony by depositions taken in, for example, Sydney, could be received if the court thought fit, but that might not be appropriate where credit is in issue. For less vital evidence the use of a videolink or the taking of evidence on commission by and for this Court tends to match the Pennsylvanian procedure. There was evidence that a Colorado court would make orders to assist in obtaining evidence and documents from persons in that state for the purpose of these proceedings, but the value of that assistance is not as complete as the evidence suggests: see AllState Life Insurance Co v
Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No 29) (Lindgren J, 28
February 1996, unreported). In general, in transnational litigation between parties such as News and Lenfest travel between countries, with attendant expense and inconvenience, should not be given undue weight, and whether the litigation is in the Pennsylvania court or in this Court a number of witnesses would have to travel. Lenfest called evidence that it would be inconvenient for certain Lenfest witnesses to travel to Australia (Mr Morris and Mr Nassau) and that certain TCI witnesses refused to travel to Australia (Mr Brett, Ms
Willis and Mr Roemer), but I was left with an unfortunate impression that
Lenfest embraced an unwillingness which in some cases became elevated to refusal. I find it difficult to believe that employees of or professionals retained by Lenfest or TCI, a half owner of Lenfest, would not step forward (or be pushed forward) as necessary.

Although it was said that Lenfest's relevant documents were in America, to balance that it was said that News' relevant documents were in New South
Wales: not many details were given in either case. The documents of the parties are unlikely to be of such volume that they can not readily be transported to any forum. I am not satisfied that a great burden would be placed on Lenfest in this respect, and it is probable that a greater burden would be placed on News in its endeavours to establish, by regard to the affairs of Australis, the value of the opportunity it alleges it lost. In particular, and relevant also to the availability and convenience of witnesses, News' case on damages will require an assessment of the chance it lost and the value of that chance. Documents of Australis and evidence from
Australis' representatives of what would have been acceptable to it will probably be required, as may evidence going to possible fulfilment of conditions to any funding proposal such as Stock Exchange approval, banker's concurrence, and approval of regulatory authorities, all to be found in
Australia. Valuation of the programming assets may be necessary, because the prospect of acquiring those assets or some part of them under an arrangement acceptable to Australis was prominent in News' case on damages - as it stressed, the offer of 19 April 1996 included a right of first refusal of the programming assets.

To sum up the two preceding paragraphs, regard to the location of witnesses and documents in my view suggests that, on balance, this Court is the more appropriate forum: it is certainly not an inappropriate forum.

In general terms, in the Pennsylvania court costs would not be awarded in favour of or against a successful party. In this Court, in the normal course costs would be awarded in favour of the successful party and against the unsuccessful party. There is thus an advantage to News, if it is successful, in the continuation of the proceedings in this Court; if it is unsuccessful, it will be disadvantaged but chooses to take the risk. There is a corresponding disadvantage to Lenfest, but not a corresponding advantage, in a stay of these proceedings in favour of the Pennsylvania litigation. Nothing in relation to costs makes this Court an inappropriate forum.

Looking more widely at the connection of these proceedings with New South
Wales, while for the reasons I have given I am of the view that the breach of contract was committed in England (and the cause of action for the estoppel claim arose in England), it can not be said that these proceedings have no worthwhile connection with New South Wales. News does have a significant office in Sydney, all parties used Sydney solicitors in February - April 1996, and although Australis' programming assets are Australia-wide New South Wales is part of Australia and Australis is significantly present in Sydney. The summary of material facts earlier set out shows that the overall transaction of providing funding to Australis was seen by all concerned as connected with
New South Wales.

Weighing up all relevant matters, I do not think that this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum. I am of that view whether News had the burden of establishing that it was not or whether Lenfest had the burden of establishing that it was. Although my view is necessary only for the contract claim, I would be of the same view if, contrary to what I have held, the cause of action in estoppel arose in New South Wales and the proceedings included the estoppel claim.

Other considerations 
It was faintly suggested by Lenfest that the contract claim and the estoppel claim were both so weak that, in the exercise of discretion, the Court should decline to accept jurisdiction: Williams versus Lips-Heerlen BV (Giles J; and
CA, 16 August 1994, unreported). I am unable to agree. Neither for weakness of the contract claim nor for any other general discretionary reason do I think the Court should decline to accept or exercise jurisdiction in relation to that claim: if I were incorrect in my view that the cause of action in estoppel did not arise in New South Wales, I would equally not decline to accept or exercise jurisdiction in relation to that claim.

The result 
The appropriate relief is probably that the proceedings be stayed so far as they embody the estoppel claim, but not otherwise. News still needs leave to proceed on the contract claim, but it may be that nothing more can be said on that matter and leave to proceed will be granted. News must decide whether it wishes the proceedings to continue only on the contract claim. I stand the proceedings over to 9.30 am on 4 October 1996, to be informed of its decision and to make orders to give effect to these reasons and, if appropriate, that decision. News should bring in short minutes.
