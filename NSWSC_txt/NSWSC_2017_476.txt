In the matter of FAL Healthy Beverages Pty Ltd and FAL Retail Pty Ltd [2017] NSWSC 476 (27 April 2017) 
Last Updated: 4 May 2017 
Supreme Court 
New South Wales  
Decision: 
The Defendant breached his statutory and general law directors' and officers' duties in respect of the transactions identified in the Plaintiffs' Further
Amended Statement of Claim (with the exception of transactions 6, 10 and 25 to
Schedule B). The Defendant's liability in respect of those transactions is not reduced by reason of the Plaintiffs' settlement with other parties. It has not been established that the Defendant breached his directors' or officers' duties in respect of the alleged misapplication of funding provided for equipment and factories in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, and the evidence would not allow the Court to make an award of damages in respect of the latter claim.  
Catchwords:

JUDGMENT
By Further Amended Statement of Claim filed, by leave, on 24 February 2017, the Plaintiffs, FAL Healthy Beverages Pty Ltd ("FAL HB") and FAL Retail Pty Ltd ("FAL Retail") seek a range of relief against Mr Tim Xenos (also known as Efthymios Xenos). The relief sought by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Mr Xenos includes a compensation order under [s 1317H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317h.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) in respect of alleged breaches of directors' duties under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); further or alternatively, equitable compensation or damages or an account of profits; and declarations that the benefit of certain funds alleged to have been obtained in breach of duty from FAL HB or FAL Retail are held on resulting or constructive trust for those entities. FAL HB and FAL Retail contend, although it is not necessary to determine, that Mr Xenos' assets would not be sufficient to satisfy a judgment against him for the range of claims originally brought against him, and only a subset of the matters originally raised were pursued at the hearing. In particular, the Plaintiffs did not press their claims for relief in respect of losses allegedly arising from various sponsorship agreements involving FAL HB.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also initially brought claims against several other parties which are no longer pressed. Those claims were brought, inter alia, against the Second Defendant, EZI Group Pty Ltd ("EZI Group"), the Third Defendant, Fence All Australia Pty Ltd ("Fence All"), the Fourth Defendant, Ashton Accountants & Business Advisors Pty Ltd ("Ashton Accountants") and the Fifth Defendant, Mr Andrew Ashton. FAL HB and FAL Retail did not pursue those proceedings against those entities where EZI Group and Fence All have been deregistered and Mr Ashton has declared bankruptcy. FAL HB and FAL Retail also brought claims against the companies trading as Yates Beaggi, a law firm, and against a principal of that firm, Mr Farshad Amirbeaggi, who are the Sixth to Eighth Defendants. FAL HB and FAL Retail subsequently settled their claims against Yates Beaggi and its principals, by deed dated 8 February 2017 (Confidential Exhibit D4) on terms of a payment of $[amount redacted] made by Yates Beaggi. Mr Xenos seeks to set off the recoveries made by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Yates Beaggi against the damages that may be ordered against him in the proceedings and I will address that question below.
By way of background, FAL HB carried on business as a producer, manufacturer and distributor of products including coconut water. Mr Xenos was the director of FAL HB at regular intervals after its incorporation, interrupted by periods in which his late father was the director of FAL HB. FAL Retail carries on, or carried on, business as a retailer of FAL HB products, and operates, or operated, "Cocojoy" retail stores in Bondi Junction and Parramatta. Mr Xenos' late father was the director of FAL Retail for parts of the relevant period until 23 December 2015, and Mr Xenos was the director of FAL Retail until January 2016. FAL Holdings Arabia Co Limited ("FAL Arabia"), a company incorporated in Saudi Arabia, held 92.5% of the shares in FAL HB; Sheikh Fahad Al-Athel held 5% of the shares in FAL HB; Mr Xenos held 2.5% of the shares in FAL HB; and FAL HB held all of the shares in FAL Retail.
By letter dated 1 November 2013, FAL Arabia offered Mr Xenos, and he accepted, employment to establish a business operating out of Australia that would manufacture and distribute coconut water and juice products worldwide. Mr Xenos caused FAL HB to be incorporated for the conduct of that business (Ex P6, 2811). Mr Xenos was chief executive officer of FAL HB from November 2013 until January 2016. FAL Retail was incorporated in December 2014 (Ex P6, 2817) and was also under Mr Xenos' management. At the time of his appointment as chief executive officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail, and for a considerable time thereafter, Mr Xenos was an undischarged bankrupt and was prohibited from managing FAL HB and FAL Retail under [s 206B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206b.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Mr Xenos resigned from his position and FAL Arabia commenced an investigation into matters concerning the companies in January 2016.
I will refer below, in dealing with the particular matters in issue, to the pleading of claims for breach of contract and general law and statutory directors' duties against Mr Xenos. Broadly, the issues for determination in the proceedings appear to be, first, whether Mr Xenos was subject to duties to FAL HB and FAL Retail under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html), [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and/or fiduciary duties at general law as a director, officer or employee. Issues then arise as to whether Mr Xenos breached any such duties in respect of several payments to Fence All, EZI Group and himself identified in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim; payments to Yates Beaggi identified in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim; and payments to the Office of State Revenue identified in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim. A further issue relates to whether Mr Xenos breached [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the corresponding general law duty by failing to provide letters of credit to or make payments to a third party, FB Propak Pty Ltd ("FB Propak"). Questions of causation and quantification also arise and are of greater significance in respect of the issues relating to FB Propak.

The affidavit evidence led by FAL HB and FAL Retail
FAL HB and FAL Retail relied on the evidence of Mr Khaled Refaat, the Senior Vice President, Finance and Investments of FAL Arabia. Mr Refaat led evidence as to the background to Mr Xenos' employment, pursuant to an offer of employment by letter dated 1 November 2013 from FAL Arabia to Mr Xenos, by which FAL Arabia advised Mr Xenos that he would be appointed as chief executive officer of FAL HB, referring to his monthly salary, a shareholding to be allocated to him in FAL HB and other aspects of his employment. That letter was countersigned by Mr Xenos (Ex P6, 511). Mr Refaat's evidence, led without objection, was that Mr Xenos was employed to establish and manage a new business venture of FAL Arabia that would manufacture and distribute coconut water and juice products, and was later requested to assist FAL Arabia in making operational an existing juice factory it owned in Saudi Arabia. Mr Refaat also gave evidence as to FAL Arabia's group procurement authority matrix and standard operating procedures, and as to the introduction of a financial authority and responsibility matrix that would apply to FAL HB. Those matters were ultimately of limited relevance to the narrower case run by FAL HB and FAL Retail at the hearing.
Mr Refaat gave evidence of the development of a proposal that FAL Arabia develop a new factory in Malaysia which would produce juice, ice cream and coffee, and of funding provided by FAL Arabia to FAL HB. I will refer to that evidence below in dealing with FAL HB's and FAL Retail's claim in respect of those matters. Mr Refaat also refers to the circumstances in which FAL Arabia was informed of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy in early May 2014 and to subsequent conversations with Mr Xenos as to that matter, to which I will refer below in dealing with the claim against Mr Xenos relating to payments to Yates Beaggi.
By a further affidavit dated 6 December 2016, Mr Refaat responded to Mr Xenos' affidavits dated 31 October 2016 and 6 November 2016, to which I refer below. Mr Refaat took issue with significant aspects of Mr Xenos' evidence.
In cross-examination. Mr Refaat accepted that he had ultimate responsibility for approving funding recommendations for the various FAL entitles around the world, including FAL HB (T61). Mr Refaat was cross-examined as to the process of obtaining approval for such funding and acknowledged that direct requests for funding to the Chairman of the FAL Group were sometimes made and approved outside the formal process for approval of such funding (T61) and he would then be made aware of approval given in that manner after the fact (T62). Mr Refaat's evidence was that he would not have approved a request for an expenditure approval made without following that process (T72). He accepted that FAL HB did not adopt or use the process put in place by him for expenditure approvals throughout Mr Xenos' period as its chief executive officer, other than for the arrangements concerning equipment to be supplied by FB Propak for the Malaysian and Saudi Arabian factories (T73, 78). Mr Refaat's evidence was that he had raised Mr Xenos' failure to follow that process with Mr Xenos in telephone calls, during management meetings and by email and that he was not aware of Mr Xenos raising any concern with those controls with him or with the Chairman of the FAL Group (T79).
Mr Refaat's evidence was that financial reports provided by Mr Xenos contained gaps and regular requests for additional information were not answered by Mr Xenos (T76); that it was impossible to determine whether expenses incurred by FAL HB were in the ordinary course of business because no breakdown of those expenses was provided by Mr Xenos, despite repeated requests (T77); and that, although monthly reporting was required, Mr Xenos only ever provided "very, very few" income statements in his period as chief executive officer, although he had made repeated requests of Mr Xenos to provide that information (T77-78). Mr Refaat's evidence was also that FAL Arabia could not extract further details about expenses for FAL HB from staff in FAL HB's accounts team since Mr Xenos put a system in place for all requests for information to go through him (T77). It is, of course, notable that FAL Arabia did not address these issues over a considerable period, but I accept that is plausible given distance and its reliance on Mr Xenos in respect of a business in which he claimed expertise.
Mr Refaat's evidence was that funding to FAL HB was approved as needed for specific purposes, such as stock purchases, and that the only approval to acquire fixed assets that was sought by FAL HB and given was in relation to the Malaysian and Saudi Arabian factories, the equipment for which was to be acquired from FB Propak, and that the process put in place by Mr Refaat for approval of fixed asset purchases was followed as to those purchases (T78). That evidence, of course, does not suggest that FAL HB did not have at least some fixed assets, but only that it did not follow the approval process set by FAL Arabia in respect of their acquisition. Mr Refaat was also cross-examined as to the application of funds provided to FAL HB for equipment to be purchased for the factories in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia and as to his knowledge of Yates Beaggi and I will refer to that cross-examination in dealing with those matters below.
Mr Arnott, who appears for FAL HB and FAL Retail, submits that Mr Refaat's evidence should be accepted by the Court. Mr Refaat's evidence was consistent with the documentary evidence and the objective probabilities as to the matters in issue and I accept that evidence.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also relied on the affidavit of Ms Sarah Healey sworn 29 July 2016. Ms Healey was the financial controller of FAL HB, initially for a relatively short period from October 2015 and then for a further period after Mr Xenos' resignation. Ms Healey gave evidence as to accounting practices at FAL HB and the accounting systems which were used, and also referred to Mr Xenos having had "super user access" to one of the accounting systems used by FAL HB, such that data could be changed or deleted without leaving a record, although that matter was in contest. Ms Healey also gave evidence as to the "NAB Connect" banking portal used by FAL HB; as to Mr Xenos' access to a second on-line banking portal titled "Business Banking" provided by National Australia Bank Limited ("NAB"); as to preparation of cashflow reports for FAL Arabia; and she identified adjustments that she claims to have been instructed to make to those reports. That issue was ultimately not material to the narrower case pressed by FAL HB and FAL Retail.
Ms Healey's evidence in cross-examination was that she worked at FAL HB initially from 6 October 2015 to 3 December 2015 (T139) and reported to Mr Tarun Chawla when he was appointed as chief financial officer of FAL HB around November 2015. Ms Healey's evidence was that she first discovered altered transactions in the accounting records after Mr Xenos had ceased as chief executive officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail, and she then identified transactions where the audit trail disclosed an issue as to the transactions but was not provided with an answer to the issue by the third party software consultants for the accounting system (T141). Ms Healey confirmed that she had not supplied financial information to Mr Refaat or the Chairman of FAL Arabia in her role as financial controller, and did not have communications with Mr Refaat until she joined FAL HB for the second time.
Ms Healey was cross-examined as to the internal authorisation process for expenditures adopted by FAL HB during her employment in late 2015 (T144-145). She accepted that the general process was that, when an invoice was received, it would be provided to the relevant department head for authorisation; the department head would then authorise it by signing the invoice and approving it for payment; if the department head accepted the invoice, it was entered into the JD Edwards accounting system for the next payment run; and, if the department head did not accept the invoice, it would be escalated to the accounts department for approval. However, her evidence was that instructions were also given to enter amounts into the JD Edwards accounting system for payment of rejected invoices. Her evidence was that the accounts team were not required to check the invoice against the source document such as a purchase order or delivery docket and a payment authorisation form would not be completed and attached to the invoice. I will refer to Ms Healey's cross-examination as to a particular payment made to Fence All in dealing with that transaction below.
Ms Healey's evidence on cross-examination was also that Mr Xenos processed his own pay manually through the NAB Connect portal and that "[w]e just saw the payment leave the bank account and coded" that payment to reflect that he was being paid as a contractor and not an employee (T146). Ms Healey's evidence was that payment of traffic penalty notices were entered manually as they were BPay transactions (T153), and, as an example, a traffic penalty notice (Ex P6, 3206) was manually entered and paid by NAB Connect and was signed off by Mr Xenos (Ex P6, 3208; T155). Mr Arnott submits that Ms Healey's evidence should be accepted by the Court. It seems to me that Ms Healey's evidence was consistent with the objective probabilities, and was not significantly impeached by a vigorous cross-examination by Mr O'Connor, who appears for Mr Xenos. I accept that evidence.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also relied on an affidavit of Mr Paul Fontanot sworn 29 July 2016. Mr Fontanot was at the relevant time a partner in the Fraud Investigation and Disputes unit of Ernst & Young, although his evidence was not led as expert evidence, but as recording the results of searches made by Ernst & Young to locate documentation relating to financial transactions of FAL HB and FAL Retail that are in issue in these proceedings. Mr Fontanot set out, in detail, the process which was adopted to locate that documentation. Mr Fontanot observed that narrations of transactions in the FAL HB bank account statements did not always correspond with the party who received the funds, and referred to an example where a payment was made to Fence All although the narrative in the bank account records recorded a payment to EZI Group. Mr Fontanot also referred to steps taken to identify other relevant information, including emails, third parties' supporting documentation, company records such as expense claim forms and travel records and hard copy documents.
Mr Fontanot referred to steps which were taken to identify documentation relating to outgoing transfers from FAL HB's bank accounts including searches of emails and correspondence to identify support for the relevant transactions. Mr Fontanot also referred to steps which had been taken to review bank statements for accounts in the name of Fence All and EZI Group which were produced on subpoena and dealings in other bank accounts. Mr Fontanot identified 111 transactions for which he had been unable to identify any documentation or information that would show the transactions were for FAL HB's benefit, totalling $1,013,330. (That evidence was admitted with a limiting order under [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) as an explanation of the process adopted by Mr Fontanot, and not as proof, in itself, that any transaction was not for FAL HB's benefit.) Mr Fontanot also referred to the identification of transfers to Fence All and EZI Group. The appendices to the exhibit to Mr Fontanot's affidavit contained documentary evidence in respect of each of the impugned transactions, including banking records, extracts of FAL HB and FAL Retail's accounting records, and emails. I will refer to some documents of particular relevance in dealing with particular transactions below.
Mr O'Connor put the process for approval of expense payments to Mr Fontanot in cross-examination. Mr Fontanot of course had no independent knowledge of the content of that process, but acknowledged that the process as put to him by Mr O'Connor was consistent with the information provided to him by Ms Healey (T119). Mr Fontanot was also cross-examined at length as to the search strategy that had been adopted by his staff and himself in identifying relevant documents, although that cross-examination seems to me to have established that the search strategy was adequately designed and comprehensive in its scope, utilising key word searches and date ranges in respect of relevant transactions (T125-126). In particular, Mr Fontanot confirmed his belief that, if documents recording the approval or authorisation of transactions existed, then he would have located them in his searches (T129).
Mr Arnott submits that Mr Fontanot's evidence, or the process he adopted, was not challenged in cross examination in any serious way and that his evidence should be accepted. With no disrespect to Mr Fontanot, his evidence largely consisted of presenting, in an organised way, the documents identified by the searches he and his team had made on behalf of FAL HB and FAL Retail. There was little room for a challenge to him as to the inferences to be drawn from those documents, which was properly a matter for the Court. I address the issue of the adequacy of those searches and the documents identified from them below.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also relied on the affidavit of their solicitor, Mr Benjamin Allen dated 16 March 2016, which identifies email exchanges between Mr Xenos and Yates Beaggi. I will refer to relevant correspondence in addressing the claim in respect of payments to Yates Beaggi below. FAL HB and FAL Retail also relied on a further affidavit of Mr Allen dated 8 June 2016 which identified payments from FAL HB's operating account to Yates Beaggi, and annexed associated emails and invoices. FAL HB and FAL Retail relied on a further affidavit of Mr Allen dated 29 July 2016, which identified correspondence and documents extracted from FAL HB's servers, books and records relating to Mr Xenos' dealings with EZI Group, Fence All and Ashton Accountants and correspondence between Mr Ashton and Mr Xenos and between Yates Beaggi and Mr Xenos in respect of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy. Mr Allen's evidence largely related to identifying relevant documents and he was not cross-examined.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also served, but did not rely on, an affidavit of the Chairman of FAL Arabia, Sheik Fahad Al-Athel.

Mr Xenos' evidence
Mr Xenos relied on his affidavit dated 31 October 2016. Mr Xenos gave his account of his initial introduction to the FAL Group and referred to his signature of an offer of employment made to him by FAL Arabia. He referred to the circumstances in which FAL HB was incorporated. Mr Xenos also referred to the circumstances in which he came to be the sole signatory for FAL HB accounts with NAB and to circumstances in which FAL Arabia provided funding to FAL HB and to financial and other reporting which he claimed FAL HB made to FAL Arabia. Mr Xenos also led evidence as to FAL Group's procurement matrix and to the circumstances in which that was not used in FAL HB. As I noted above, that matter is now of limited significance to the narrower case now pressed by FAL HB and FAL Retail. Mr Xenos also referred to licence agreements and sponsorship agreements with third parties, which are also no longer relevant to the narrower case now pressed by FAL HB and FAL Retail. In leading evidence as to discussions about supply of the juice market, Mr Xenos led evidence that EZI Group was no longer trading as at August 2014 (Xenos 31.10.16 [80]).
Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that FAL HB's expenditures were "within the forecast and cashflow projections approved by the Board and final sign-off by the Chairman [of FAL Arabia]". Putting aside the fact that that statement is in the nature of a bare assertion, there was no evidence that any such a forecast, cashflow projections, board approval or sign-off by the Chairman of FAL Arabia extended to particular expenditures of the kind now challenged by FAL HB and FAL Retail, or that Mr Xenos made adequate disclosure of the nature of that funding. Mr Xenos also gave evidence as to his dealings with Yates Beaggi to which I will refer below in dealing with the claim against him in respect of payments to that firm.
Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he was never employed by EZI Group but that his salary from FAL HB was paid into EZI Group on a monthly basis (Xenos 31.10.16 [175]). Mr Xenos also gave evidence as to a letter provided to his trustee in bankruptcy indicating falsely that he was employed by EZI Group. His evidence was that, at the end of 2013, he needed to show his trustee in bankruptcy and his finance broker that he was working and had a history of working for the past two years; that he had previously worked for EZI Group and his salary from FAL HB was paid into EZI Group's account; and that: "I therefore asked Andrew Ashton, to sign the Ezi Group letter of employment which he did. I then provided this to the finance broker and [the trustee in bankruptcy]. However from August 2013, I undertook no work for Ezi Group as I was engaged full time with F[AL] HB and the FAL Group. [The trustee in bankruptcy] discovered my relationship with FAL in about April/May 2014. I was concerned at that time that my relationship with FAL would be terminated." (Xenos 31.10.16 [175(d)]).

This is one of several instances in which Mr Xenos provided false or misleading information to his trustee in bankruptcy. Mr Xenos was cross- examined as to the misleading character of this information and his responses could only be described as incoherent. I have had regard to this matter as one of several matters that indicate that Mr Xenos is not a witness of truth and that no reliance should be placed on his evidence unless it is against his interests or corroborated by other evidence.
Mr Xenos also relied on his affidavit dated 6 November 2016 which described the accounting systems of FAL HB, and referred to the use of Quick Books accounting software, the engagement of Mr Andrew Ashton as FAL HB's external accountant, the employment of a financial controller for FAL HB and the subsequent employment of additional accounting staff. Mr Xenos also referred to FAL HB's later implementation of the JD Edwards accounting system from April 2015, although FAL HB retained Quick Books for payroll purposes. Mr Xenos also referred to an internal control process which he claimed was in place for the payment of invoices, and claimed that he was not directly or indirectly involved in the authorisation of invoices. He referred to the circumstances in which Mr Chawla was employed as chief financial officer of FAL HB and in which Ms Healey ceased employment with FAL HB. Mr Xenos claimed that invoices and statements for his expenses were given to given to a member of the accounts staff or the then financial controller, that one of those persons completed expense forms on Mr Xenos' behalf and attached supporting documents and approved them for payment and that he was not directly involved in the authorisation or payment process for such expenses.
Mr Xenos' affidavit also set out a detailed response to categories of expenditure that were challenged by FAL HB and FAL Retail, and addressed in Mr Fontanot's affidavit, although aspects of Mr Xenos' affidavit were inadmissible and were rejected, and many of the explanations given for particular transactions are bare assertions, inconsistent with the objective evidence or implausible. I will address those explanations in dealing with particular transactions below. I should also note that Mr Xenos, in cross-examination, indicated a lack of recollection of the nature of particular payments that significantly qualified his affidavit evidence as to the nature of those payments.
Mr Xenos relies on his third affidavit dated 27 February 2017, which led evidence as to matters addressed in his affidavits dated 31 October 2016 and 6 November 2016 which had not been admitted by reasons of objection as to form, as to which he had been granted leave to lead further evidence.
Mr Xenos accepted several matters in cross-examination that were adverse to his case, generally when there was no alternative to doing so. Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination that, as chief executive officer of FAL HB, he was responsible for making decisions about how that company would be managed on a day-to-day basis, for managing and growing its business, for managing its financial affairs, for supervising its staff, for preparing its budgets, with the assistance of the accounting and finance team, and for making decisions about how the business was conducted, and also for managing the affairs of FAL Retail (T178). Mr Xenos' evidence in cross-examination was that he was bankrupt between 9 August 2011 and the annulment of his bankruptcy in mid-September 2015, although he could not recall the exact date that his bankruptcy ceased in cross-examination (T180). Mr Xenos claimed in cross-examination that he had been advised by his solicitors, Yates Beaggi, that he should continue in his role as a director of and managing FAL HB and FAL Retail while he went through legal proceedings to have the bankruptcy overturned (T185). Mr Xenos' current solicitors wrote to Yates Beaggi on 1 March 2017 requesting any documents which may record that advice or a meeting at which that advice was given, and the solicitors for Yates Beaggi responded that that firm did not have any documents recording the alleged legal advice and denying that the firm gave legal advice to Mr Xenos to the effect asserted by him (Ex P7).
Mr Xenos also accepted that he was, until January 2016, the sole signatory on all of FAL HB's and FAL Retail's bank accounts (T178) and that he also authorised payments through the NAB Connect platform (T179). Mr Xenos' evidence, in cross-examination, was that he had internet banking access to FAL HB's and FAL Retail's accounts but payments were always made from NAB Connect and he denied that he processed payments from the NAB Connect system (T179). I do not accept that evidence, since there are several occasions in the detailed transactions below where Mr Xenos had informed accounting staff that he had already made the relevant payment, prior to any involvement on their part.
Mr Xenos also accepted that he authorised all payments conducted through NAB Connect, as sole signatory, although only in the sense that payments were recorded in his name, and he claimed that the electronic token to use the system and his password were available to members of the accounts staff (T179). I do not accept the latter evidence given the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit. Mr Xenos also accepted that he was responsible for authorising all payments that came out of FAL HB and FAL Retail's bank accounts as its sole signatory, although he claimed that he relied on a process involving accounts staff to do so (T178-179, 226-227). Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination that he signed all cheques on behalf of the companies; he authorised all payments through the NAB Connect online banking platform as the sole signatory; he had NAB Connect user access for all of FAL HB and FAL Retail's accounts and was the sole signatory for each of those accounts; and he had access to the companies' internet banking portal besides NAB Connect (T179, T228, T239). Mr Xenos also accepted that he was the only director of FAL HB in fact until January 2016, despite the references to his late father as a director on the ASIC register (T219).
Mr Arnott submits that Mr Xenos' evidence should not be accepted on contentious issues; that his conduct evidences that he is a person who does not take seriously his obligations to act truthfully and regularly engaged in the production of false documents; and that he had demonstrated himself to be a person who does not take his obligations under the law seriously, having managed FAL HB and FAL Retail as chief executive officer while a bankrupt. Mr Arnott also submits that the Court cannot be satisfied that Mr Xenos has complied properly with his oath to tell the truth. The correspondence in evidence in the proceedings indicates multiple occasions on which Mr Xenos was prepared to lie, or did lie, to advance his interests. As Mr Arnott points out, Mr Xenos appears to have provided false information that he was employed by and needed to travel for EZI Group to his trustee in bankruptcy to support travel requests (T197, 199, 202) and also to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and his creditors in respect of his bankruptcy.
For example, by a letter dated 15 December 2013, signed by Mr Ashton on behalf of EZI Group, although not signed by Mr Xenos (Ex P6, 652), EZI Group purported to offer Mr Xenos employment as sales representative, on the basis that he would be paid an annual salary of $75,000. The content of that letter appears to have been false. As I noted above, Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence (Xenos 31.10.16 [175(d)]) was that he asked Mr Ashton to sign the letter of employment from EZI Group and that he provided that letter to a finance broker and his trustee in bankruptcy, although Mr Xenos equivocated as to those matters in cross-examination (T192-193). Mr Xenos' evidence in cross-examination was also that he could not recall that letter, notwithstanding that he had addressed it in his affidavit evidence (T194).
By email dated 14 March 2014 to Yates Beaggi, copied to Mr Ashton, Mr Xenos raised the possibility that a point could be taken that Mr Tim Xenos and Mr Efthymios Xenos were not "one and the same", although there is no doubt that Mr Xenos goes under both names (Ex P6, 717). Mr Amirbeaggi responded by rightly recognising that that proposition could give rise to a "proper fraud charge" exposing Mr Xenos to "proper jail time". On 30 April 2014, Mr Xenos sent an email to Yates Beaggi enclosing a request for permission to travel overseas whilst bankrupt, in the form required by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, which stated, falsely, that Mr Xenos' current employer was EZI Group; stated, also falsely, that his current gross income was $60,000; and stated, also falsely, that Mr Andrew Ashton of Mode Drinks was paying for the trip. The falsity of that information was made clear by the attached itinerary which indicated that the travel was charged to FAL HB. By email dated 30 April 2014, Mr Xenos then sent a letter to his solicitors, on the letterhead of EZI Group, and addressed to his trustee in bankruptcy, signed by Mr Andrew Ashton, which falsely stated that Mr Xenos was required to travel to Asia Pacific and the Middle East as part of his work, implicitly for EZI Group and that Mr Ashton was funding the cost of the trip including accommodation.
Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination (under a certificate given under [s 128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)) that the statement of his employer in the permission to travel overseas form (Ex P6, 876) dated 30 April 2014 was false, although he sought to maintain that the statement of his gross annual income was correct, if that was limited to income on which PAYG tax was paid and excluded consulting income (T197). Mr Xenos also accepted in cross-examination that the statement of who was paying for the trip, referring to Mr Ashton of Mode Drinks, was also false, because FAL HB (or, on Mr Xenos' account, possibly Mr Xenos) was paying for the trip (T199-200). Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination (again under the protection of a certificate under [s 128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)) that he provided the relevant letter to his solicitor, to provide to his trustee in bankruptcy, knowing that it was false, although he was not prepared to accept that he wanted the trustee in bankruptcy to think, as the letter stated, that the trip was being paid for by EZI Group (T202). Mr Xenos' willingness to have that false information provided to his trustee in bankruptcy reinforces my view as to his credit.
By letter dated 28 May 2014, Yates Beaggi advised the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy that Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy's calculations of his income were inaccurate and that his income from his business endeavours was pursuant to a contract with EZI Group with a value of $75,000 per annum from January 2014 and a copy of that contract was attached to that letter (Ex P6, Tab 64). I infer that letter was sent on Mr Xenos' instructions and it was plainly false, whether or not Yates Beaggi were on notice of its falsity, since Mr Xenos was not employed under such a contract and derived substantially greater income from FAL HB and not EZI Group.
By email dated 4 July 2014, Mr Xenos requested Mr Ashton to sign a letter, on the letterhead of EZI Group, addressed to his trustee in bankruptcy, which confirmed that EZI Group or Mr Ashton was funding the cost of another overseas trip (Ex P6, 1174). Again, that confirmation was false. Mr Xenos again sent such a letter to Mr Ashton on 30 July 2014, again requesting a letter on the letterhead of EZI Group confirming similar information, which again was false. Those letters also stated that it was a condition of Mr Xenos' employment, necessarily by EZI Group, that he consistently travelled and requested permission for that travel. Mr Xenos was not then employed by EZI Group, as he accepted in cross-examination.
On 11 August 2015, Mr Mitchell of Yates Beaggi sent Mr Xenos a copy of a proposed scheme of arrangement for creditors under [s 73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s73.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act 1966](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Cth), in respect of Mr Xenos' bankrupt estate, which referred to the establishment of a pool of funds to pay the trustees' unpaid expenses, a Commonwealth realisation charge and creditors to a minimum of 10 cents in the dollar. That pool of funds was described as $90,000 and the source of monies as constituting a "loan from Andrew Ashton". That description was also plainly false, since the relevant monies were sourced from FAL HB not from Mr Ashton. On 27 August 2015, Mr Mitchell sent that proposal, containing the same false information in the same terms, to Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy (Ex P6, tab 220) and I infer that he had Mr Xenos' instructions to do so. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he was never employed by EZI Group (Xenos 31.10.16 [175]), contrary to the information provided by EZI Group, Mr Xenos and his solicitors to his trustee in bankruptcy (T187). Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was also that EZI Group was no longer trading in August 2014 (Xenos 31.10.16 [80]) and his evidence in cross-examination was that it was no longer invoicing or doing any business by August 2014 (T188). Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he undertook no work for EZI Group from August 2013 (Xenos [175(d)]) although he resiled from that evidence in cross-examination, suggesting that he did consulting work for EZI Group although he was not directly employed by it (T191).
The documentary evidence also establishes that Mr Xenos procured the preparation of false or at least misleading invoices by Mr Ashton in order to provide a basis to pay money to an account with Fence All that he controlled, and requested Yates Beaggi to include false or at least substantially misleading and incomplete descriptions of the nature of work done in invoices relating to his personal bankruptcy which were sent for payment by FAL HB. I will refer to these matters further below.
By reason of all of these matters, I am satisfied that Mr Xenos is not a witness of credit and that his evidence should not be accepted unless it is adverse to his interest or otherwise corroborated by documentary evidence.

Evidentiary onus
Mr Arnott acknowledges that, where a plaintiff has the legal onus of proving a matter, then it must do so to the reasonable satisfaction of the court. However, Mr Arnott also submits, and I accept, that where relevant facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant or where the defendant has greater means to produce evidence relating to those facts, then provided the claimant provides sufficient evidence from which the matter can be inferred, the defendant "comes under an evidential burden, or an onus of adducing evidence": Hampton Court Ltd versus Crooks  <case>; <case>. In BCI Finances Pty Ltd (in liq) versus Binetter (No 4) above at [123], Gleeson J observed that: "[w]here a fact is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party to litigation, slight evidence of that fact may suffice to prove the fact unless that evidence is explained away by the party with the knowledge of the fact".
Mr Arnott points out that that approach was taken in Artcraft Pty Ltd versus Dickson <case>, where Kelly J relied on unexplained deposits into various accounts in the name of a director's wife. Mr Arnott also points to the approach taken by Sifris J in a somewhat similar case to this case, KQ International Trading Pty Ltd versus Yang <case>, where a company brought proceedings against its former director for breach of his fiduciary and statutory duties arising out of the defendant's alleged misappropriation of substantial funds from the company. Sifris J there found that the defendant's evidence lacked credibility and was, in many respects, deliberately false and also observed (at [118]-[119]) that the defendant produced no documents supporting his version of events and gave no acceptable explanation for the impugned transactions. His Honour noted (at [132]) that: "All of the transactions called for an explanation. The very person able to give the explanation failed miserably at all levels. He did not produce any relevant document, itself a startling feature of the case and in particular a case of this kind. Further, his recollection and oral evidence lacked coherence and credibility."
His Honour inferred (at [91], [115]) that there was no credible explanation or justification for the transactions entered into by the defendant and the company succeeded in establishing that the defendant breached his directors' duties under [ss 181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Mr Arnott submits that the Court should adopt the same approach with respect to the transactions entered into by Mr Xenos in the present proceedings, each of which, he submits, "call for an explanation" on the part of Mr Xenos and in respect of which no satisfactory or credible explanation has been forthcoming.
Mr O'Connor submits (T381) that the Court must weigh the merits of each impugned transaction on a transaction by transaction basis, and having regard to the approach identified in Briginshaw versus Briginshaw <case>; [(1938) 60 CLR 336] at 449-450, the plurality observed that: "The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities.
That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud. On the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary 'where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found'. Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct." [citations omitted] [Section 140](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s140.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) similarly provides that, in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities and that, without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account the nature of the cause of action or defence, the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged. I approach the evidence in this matter by on that basis and having regard to the circumstances of the particular transactions.

Applicable legal principles
FAL HB and FAL Retail bring several of their claims against Mr Xenos for breach of his duties as a director and officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html), [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and at general law and as an employee at general law. FAL HB and FAL Retail claim compensation under [s 1317H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or as equitable compensation or damages at general law. The claim in respect of dissipation of monies provided for the Saudi Arabia and Malaysia factory equipment is brought only under [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the corresponding equitable duty of care and diligence.
The Plaintiffs plead that Mr Xenos was from time to time, from incorporation of FAL HB and FAL Retail until 22 February 2016, either appointed as or a de facto director of each of FAL HB and FAL Retail (FASC [12]). Mr Xenos admits that he was a director of FAL HB and FAL Retail over part of the relevant period. FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that Mr Xenos was, from November 2013 to 22 February 2016, employed as chief executive officer of those entities (FASC [12(c)]) and also that Mr Xenos acted as chief executive officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail and was closely involved in the day-to-day management of their business (FASC [19]). Mr Xenos denies, in his Defence, that he was employed by those entities and says that any purported employment was agreement was with FAL Arabia although he also denies the efficacy of his employment letter with FAL Arabia. It will not be necessary to determine that question to resolve these proceedings. Mr Xenos admits, in his Defence, that he was engaged to act as the chief executive officer of those entities and that he was closely involved in the day-to-day management of the business, but contends that matters and strategies were communicated to the Chairman of FAL Arabia who made the ultimate decision (Defence [13]).
FAL HB and FAL Retail plead that it was an express term of Mr Xenos' employment agreement that Mr Xenos would comply with the terms of a financial authority and responsibility matrix introduced within the FAL Group and with a procurement authority matrix introduced within the FAL Group when acting on behalf of FAL HB and FAL Retail. Mr Xenos denies that the financial authority and responsibility matrix was implemented by FAL HB and FAL Retail; contends that it was agreed between him and the Chairman of FAL Arabia that that financial matrix was unworkable and not in the best interests of the business outside Saudi Arabia; denies that he was obliged to comply with the procurement authority matrix; and contends that there was other ongoing reporting in respect of FAL HB and FAL Retail. It is also not necessary to determine those matters, since the allegations that are pursued by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Mr Xenos will succeed or fail, for the reasons noted below, irrespective of whether he complied or did not comply with those procedures.
FAL HB and FAL Retail plead that there were implied terms of Mr Xenos' employment agreement (FASC [21]) and that Mr Xenos owed fiduciary duties to FAL HB, FAL Retail and the FAL Group during the term of his directorships or employment with the FAL Group. Mr Xenos admits that he owed fiduciary duties to FAL HB and FAL Retail "to the extent that such duties are matters arising from law as a director". FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that Mr Xenos was an officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail for the purposes of [Pt 2.1D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p2.1d) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and was subject to statutory duties under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (FASC [23]). Mr Xenos does not admit that he was an officer for the purposes of that Part of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).
As I have noted above, Mr Xenos was a statutory director of FAL HB and FAL Retail for part of the relevant period. The definition of the term "director" in [s 9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s9.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) also extends, in paragraph (b)(i) (unless the contrary intention appears), to a person who is not validly appointed as a director but who is acting in the position of director. In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation versus Austin <case>; [(1998) 28 ACSR 565], the Full Court of the Federal Court observed (at [66]) that whether the roles and functions performed by a person are such as to constitute that person a director for the purposes of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) will often be a question of degree having regard to the "nature of the functions or powers which are exercised and the extent of their exercise"; the relationship of a person with a company may evolve over time into that of a de facto director (at [67]); the question is one of substance and not simply how the person has been described in or by the company (at [68]); and whether a person is a director will turn on the nature and extent of the functions he or she performs (both in and beyond the engagement) and on the constraints imposed on him or her (at [68]). The Full Court also observed that perceptions by others that the person was a director can have evidentiary significance, particularly if those perceptions were "independently formed, reasonable in the circumstances and support the appearance that the person was acting 'under colour of office'" (at [75]).
It is common ground that Mr Xenos had immediate management control of FAL HB and FAL Retail during the period in which his late father was nominally the director of those entities, at least as chief executive officer, until January 2016, and Mr O'Connor opened Mr Xenos' case on that basis (T32). Mr Xenos' own evidence as to his role within the companies, including his dealings with third parties and control of financial functions, made clear that he exercised, and third parties and the companies' staff would have understood him to have, executive control of the companies, subject to a somewhat distant oversight by FAL Arabia. It seems to me that there can be no doubt that Mr Xenos was a de facto director of FAL HB and FAL Retail, even in periods that he did not hold a nominal appointment as a director of those companies in that capacity, and that he was an "officer" of both companies for the purposes of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) throughout the relevant period, and subject to both the general law and statutory duties applicable to a director and officer of a company.
First, FAL HB and FAL Retail bring their claim against Mr Xenos, in respect of the transactions with Fence All and EZI Group and other transactions, under [s 180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). That section provides that a director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of a corporation in the corporation's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within the corporation as, the director or officer.
The statutory duty of care and diligence under [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) overlaps with directors' duty of care arising at general law: Vines versus Australian Securities and Investments Commission <case>; <case> that: "In determining whether a director has exercised reasonable care and diligence, as [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) expressly contemplates, the circumstances of the particular corporation concerned are relevant to the content of the duty. These circumstances include the type of company, the provisions of its constitution, the size and nature of the company's business, the composition of the board, the director's position and responsibilities within the company, the particular function the director is performing, the experience or skills of the particular director, the terms on which he or she has undertaken to act as a director, the manner in which responsibility for the business of the company is distributed between its directors and its employees, and the circumstances of the specific case ..."
Mr Arnott also submits that a determination whether the statutory duty of care and diligence has been contravened imports an objective inquiry; and the test is what an ordinary person, with the relevant director's knowledge and experience, might be expected to have done in the circumstances. Mr Arnott submits that a question of breach of the duty of care and diligence can only be answered by balancing the foreseeable risk of harm against the potential benefits that could reasonably have been expected to accrue to the company from the conduct in question: Vrisakis versus Australian Securities Commission <case> as follows: "In Australian Securities Commission versus Gallagher above at 52-53, Pidgeon J observed that the test whether the statutory duty of care and diligence had been contravened was an objective one, that a director need not exhibit a greater degree of skill in the performance of his or her duties than may reasonably be expected for a person of his or her knowledge and experience, in the relevant circumstances, and that it was relevant to consider the way in which the work of the company was distributed between its directors and other officers, provided that distribution was reasonable. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus Adler above at <case>; [(2003) 179 FLR 1)], Santow J noted that the duties imposed by the section are essentially the same as directors' duties at general law; that, in determining whether a director had exercised reasonable care and diligence, the test was what an ordinary person, with the director's knowledge and experience, might be expected to have done in the circumstances if he or she was acting on his or her own behalf; and that the duty of care and diligence would require special vigilance in a situation of potential conflict, requiring scrupulous concern on the part of those officers who become aware of that transaction to ensure that any necessary corporate approvals are obtained and safeguards put in place. That decision has been cited with approval in recent case law, including Parker versus Tucker <case>; <case> per
Gordon J and Diamond Hill Mining Pty Ltd versus Huang Jim Mining Pty Ltd <case>; <case> per
Croft J."
Second, FAL HB and FAL Retail bring their claim against Mr Xenos, in respect of the transactions with Fence All and EZI Group and other transactions, under [s 181(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). That section provides that a director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. That statutory duty reflects directors' duties at general law to act in good faith in the interests of and for the benefit of the company as a whole. As Mr Arnott points out, that section is directed to preventing abuses of directors' powers for their own or collateral purposes. Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus Maxwell above at <case>-[73].
The second limb of [s 181(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) requires that directors' powers may be exercised only for the purpose for which they were conferred and not for any improper purpose: Permanent Building Society (in liq) versus Wheeler <case>; Re Colorado Products Pty Ltd (in prov liq) above at [432]-[433]. Mr Arnott also rightly submits that, to establish a contravention of [s 182(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), it is sufficient to establish that the conduct of the director was carried out in order to gain an advantage and it is not necessary to establish that such an advantage was actually achieved nor that the company in question actually sustained a detriment: Chew versus R above at 633.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also brought a claim for breach of duties owed by Mr Xenos to FAL HB and FAL Retail as an employee. It is by no means clear that Mr Xenos was an employee of FAL HB or FAL Retail, since the offer of employment which he accepted was made by FAL Arabia, which is not party to these proceedings, although Mr Xenos' remuneration (whether or not it could be properly characterised as a salary) was paid by FAL HB. It is not necessary to determine this claim since the matters on which FAL HB and FAL Retail rely would either breach both Mr Xenos' statutory and general law duties and his duties as employee or none of those duties. There is no prospect, on the particular facts, that determination of this claim would lead to a different result from the claim for breach of director's and officer's statutory and general law duties on the facts that I have found.
Mr Xenos relies on the absence of adequate documentary support for many of the impugned transactions to contend that FAL HB and FAL Retail have not made out their case that they were improper. FAL HB and FAL Retail respond that Mr Xenos, as a director and chief executive officer of those entities, was obliged to keep (or at least to cause to be kept) proper records. FAL HB and FAL Retail rightly point out that a company is obliged under [s 286(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s286.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) to keep written financial records that correctly record and explain its transactions, financial position and performance, and that would enable true and fair financial statements to be prepared and audited. They also point out that a director who fails to take all reasonable steps to comply with or to secure compliance with that obligation contravenes [s 344(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s344.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). Mr Arnott also draws attention to the observations of Barrett J in Fodare Pty Ltd versus Shearn  <case>; <case>-[28] that: "A cardinal rule binding on a director is that the director's personal interest must always be subordinated to that of the company and the director must account to the company for any profit or gain obtained or received by reason of the fiduciary position. It follows that, if money of the company comes into a director's hands or under a director's control, the director must put it into the company's possession so that it is [sic] can be recognised as the company's property or, if that has not been done, stand ready and able to explain why the money was not been [sic] put into the company's possession and how and why the application of it in some other way was consistent with its status as an asset of the company. 
The need for records to be kept which enable receipts and payments by a company to be recognised and the reasons why moneys were received or paid by the company to be understood is not only a matter of prudent stewardship but also the product of statutory requirements to which a company is subject: [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s286.html) A director who fails to take all reasonable steps to comply with, or secure compliance with, those requirements contravenes [s :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s344.html) see [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s344.html) [...] In a case such as the present, where there is only one director, the need to ensure that adequate records are kept should be regarded as reflected in a duty of a fiduciary kind, akin to that to which a trustee is subject [...] to ensure that there is available to the company a means of being aware of what its property is and how it has been applied."
Barrett J there found that the defendant had breached her duties as a director in causing the company's monies to be applied in ways that were inconsistent with the company's interests, and also observed (at [26]) that the company's director "was duty bound to safeguard [the company's] funds and to expend them only in discharge of liabilities properly incurred by the company and otherwise in pursuit of corporate purposes" and that "[d]ue and proper discharge of the director's duties in this respect does not allow the payment of funds to herself or members of her family by way of gift benefiting the payees or the other persons for the personal benefit of the director or her family members".
Barrett J there noted the absence of records and information as to the disposition of a first cheque of approximately $383,000, other than that it went into a bank account maintained by the defendant, that she then withdrew the whole and she claimed that she "paid debts that were owing and I took out of it what was owing to me" and held the director was liable for a serious breach of duty with respect to that cheque as she caused the relevant funds to be applied in ways that could not, on any objective basis, be seen as consistent with the company's interests. His Honour reached the same result in relation to a second cheque of approximately $250,000, in relation to which there was no direct evidence of what occurred after its receipt and observed (at [31]) that the director was "required to ensure the availability of means for [the company] to see how the proceeds were applied and whether the manner of application was proper" and (at [61]) that here evidence did "nothing to counter the strong inference that she caused the money to be spent in ways that had nothing to do with the welfare of [the company]". I will reach similar conclusions in respect of aspects of the claim against Mr Xenos below.
As I noted above, the relief sought by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Mr Xenos includes a compensation order under [s 1317H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317h.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) in respect of alleged breaches of directors' duties under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and, further or alternatively, equitable compensation or damages or an account of profits. It is, of course, well-established that equitable compensation is available for breach of an equitable duty, including breach of fiduciary duty, and also for equitable non-fiduciary duties such as the equitable duty of care and skill applicable to directors: Permanent Building Society (in liq) versus Wheeler above; Nicholls versus Michael Wilson & Partners Ltd [2012] NSWCA 383. [Section 1317H(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317h.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) in turn provides that a Court may order a person to compensate, relevantly, a corporation for damage suffered by the corporation if that person has contravened a corporation/scheme civil penalty provision (as defined) in relation to the corporation or scheme and the damage resulted from the contravention. The case law indicates that the words "resulted from" in these sections refer to damage which, as a matter of fact, was caused by the contravention and that they should be given their ordinary meaning of requiring a causal connection between the damage and the contravening conduct: Adler versus Australian Securities and Investments Commission  <case>; <case>-[160]. No issues of controversy arise as to the application of that section in this case, if the factual and legal basis of the claims against Mr Xenos is otherwise established.

The impugned transactions in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim
FAL HB and FAL Retail seek to recover the amounts of transactions engaged in with Fence All, EZI Group and Mr Xenos set out in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim, which they contend were paid in breach of Mr Xenos' duties to FAL HB and FAL Retail. This category involves transfers to Fence All, EZI Group and Mr Xenos totalling $502,342.33.
The first matter in issue was several payments to Fence All, EZI Group and Mr Xenos. These matters were raised in a somewhat indirect way in the pleading. Paragraphs 45-46 of FAL HB's and FAL Retail's Further Amended Statement of Claim plead allegations of Mr Xenos' involvement in other business opportunities while employed by or a director of FAL HB and FAL Retail. FAL HB and FAL Retail plead (FASC [45(c)]) that Mr Xenos engaged in business unrelated to his work as chief executive officer of the FAL Group and FAL HB and FAL Retail, and also plead (FASC [45(d)]) that, during the time he was employed by or was a director of FAL HB and FAL Retail, Mr Xenos pursued business opportunities with the EZI Group and other entities (FASC [45(d)]). These allegations are particularised by reference, inter alia, to these payments, although the link between those particulars and the pleaded allegations is not entirely clear.
Paragraphs 47-48 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim approach this issue in a somewhat more direct matter, pleading that, at all relevant times, Mr Xenos had a financial interest in Fence All which is particularised by reference to his being a sole shareholder of Fence All. FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that, between 19 November 2013 and 8 February 2016, Mr Xenos effected, or caused to be effected, transfers of funds from FAL HB to Fence All and also to other entities including EZI Group and himself. FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that, in effecting these transfers, Mr Xenos took steps to financially benefit himself or persons other than FAL HB and FAL Retail to their detriment, and that those transfers were not authorised by or disclosed to those entities. Mr Xenos denies these allegations and, in his Defence, pleads that such payments were not made to the detriment of FAL HB or FAL Retail, were remuneration payments or reimbursements of expenses or were authorised by virtue of Mr Xenos being a director of FAL Retail. Paragraphs 65, 67 and 69 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim in turn particularise the loss or damage claimed by FAL HB and FAL Retail in respect of Mr Xenos' alleged breach of the express and implied terms of his employment and his breach of statutory duties as including these amounts as set out in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim.
FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that Mr Xenos breached the express and implied terms of his employment contracts by reason of these matters. As I noted above, that claim may not be available to FAL HB and FAL Retail, where any such employment contract was with FAL Arabia rather than FAL HB and FAL Retail. However, it is ultimately not necessary to determine that question in order to determine these proceedings. FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that Mr Xenos' conduct relating to the relevant payments was in breach of his fiduciary duties, and that FAL HB and FAL Retail have suffered loss, relevantly the amount of $502,342.33 applicable to those payments. FAL HB and FAL Retail also plead that those payments amounted to breaches of statutory duty by Mr Xenos by which FAL HB and FAL Retail have suffered loss or damage. I will first set out the facts and evidence relating to that claim, then deal with the application of the legal principles that I have set out above to that claim.
Several of the impugned transactions set out in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim involved payments to Fence All and EZI Group. Fence All was a residential fencing construction company incorporated in October 2010 and, at least initially, operated by Mr Xenos' father, Denis Xenos (Ex P6, 1049). There is no suggestion that FAL HB was required to make numerous payments to Fence All in respect of its fencing business. Mr Xenos' evidence in cross-examination was that he was a signatory to the bank accounts of Fence All, although Fence All was handed over to Mr Valentino Kovacic in June 2015, when Mr Kovacic "needed a company" (T222). Fence All has now been deregistered.
EZI Group was incorporated in February 2012 and Mr Ashton was a director of that company. I have referred above to several letters sent by EZI Group directed to misleading Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy, by claiming that Mr Xenos was employed by EZI Group, above, in dealing with Mr Xenos' credit. The issue of invoices from EZI Group, after August 2014, is inconsistent with Mr Xenos' evidence that, from at least August 2014 until it was deregistered, EZI Group "wasn't invoicing or it wasn't doing any business" (T188). Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination that he was a signatory on the bank accounts of EZI Group (T223). EZI Group has now been deregistered.
I will refer to the transactions by the transaction numbers used in the schedules to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (and also the Plaintiffs' opening submissions), cross-referenced to the different transaction numbers used in Mr Fontanot's evidence which were also adopted in Mr Xenos' affidavit dated 6 November 2016. Transaction 1 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.1) is a payment on 28 September 2015 of $22,000 transferred to Fence All by FAL HB. This transaction originated with an email dated 22 September 2015 from Mr Xenos to Mr Ashton (Ex P6, 2864) which read as follows: "Can you do me a favour if you think this is viable.  . 1 invoice for say $22,000 for consulting and  . 1 invoice for transfer of Trademarks and also transfer of license [sic] agreements for say $50K, which I can put in the system and pay over the next few months. I will pay you your GST. 
What do you think?"
The reference in that email to Mr Xenos paying GST implied that the balance of the amount, other than the GST, would not be paid to the invoicing party. Mr Ashton responded on 22 September (Ex P6, 2864) indicating that he did not "have a problem" and would pay the GST and would put the first transaction through Ashton Accountants and the second through Ashton Accountants as well, since "we cant [sic] use Ezi group". Mr Ashton appears to have understood the suggested transactions as involving a deception of FAL HB, since he also observed that: "Now that your [sic] CFO [chief financial officer] and FC [financial controller] are leaving, this wont [sic] be an issue. ... good timing."
Mr Ashton then sent an email to Mr Xenos (Ex P6, 2865-2866) which attached an invoice dated 22 September 2015 addressed to FAL HB for "Conferences, Financial Reports, Telephone attendances for the period 1 July 2015 to 22 September 2015" in the amount of $22,000. Mr Xenos replied asking Mr Ashton "Can you please send to Ella [Do, a member of FAL HB's accounting staff], without me seeing it". That approach was plainly intended to mislead Ms Do, since Mr Xenos had both requested and seen the invoice. Mr Ashton responded in a manner that made clear that he had recognised the impropriety of the transaction (Ex P6, 2865) to the effect that: "Wont [sic] she come back and query this? 
Wouldn't it be best to send it after she left? 
I don't trust accountants and when they leave they have a habit of opening their mouth ... I will if you want but she will come back and say that I haven't been there for months."
An invoice was subsequently issued by Ashton Accountants addressed to FAL HB with the narrative "conferences, financial reports, telephone attendances for the period 1 July 2015 to 22 September 2015" in the amount of $22,000 inclusive of GST and paid from FAL HB's account. That invoice was paid to Fence All, then under Mr Xenos' control, and then dispersed to what appear to be personal expenditures associated with Mr Xenos, by a transaction of $5,500 described as "Tim Xenos Instalme" and a transaction of $16,000 described as "Xenos Loan" (Ex P6, 2868).
Mr Xenos' evidence in respect of this transaction was that he had requested that Mr Ashton issue an invoice in respect of Mr Ashton's work for FAL HB, that the charge for the work actually done by Mr Ashton would be substantial, that Mr Ashton had asked him what he should charge and that Mr Xenos had suggested that Mr Ashton charge $20,000 plus GST for his services. Mr Xenos acknowledges that the monies invoiced by Mr Ashton's firm were in fact paid to Fence All, but claims (in evidence that was admitted with a limiting order that it was not proof of the fact) that Mr Ashton had asked Mr Xenos to deposit payments of the consulting services to Mr Xenos' account for a while. That account of the transaction seems to me to be wholly implausible, having regard to the content of the email correspondence between Mr Xenos and Mr Ashton and the fact that, far from holding the amount paid to Fence All in the account on Mr Ashton's behalf, Mr Xenos applied that amount for Fence All's or Mr Xenos' purposes as soon as it was received. I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in this respect. I am comfortably satisfied that that transaction was not properly founded and involved transfer of the relevant funds to Mr Xenos or for his benefit.
Transaction 2 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.2) is a transfer on 6 October 2015 of $22,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, which was initiated by an email from Mr Xenos to Mr Ashton on 6 October 2015 requesting "Can you please send us an invoice for consulting for say $20K, or do you think it should be less?". Mr Ashton replied that "$20 is ok...I am worth it" and then sent another invoice (Ex P6, 2872) dated 6 October 2015, which stated that it was for professional services rendered for the period ended 30 September 2015 in the amount of $22,000 for "Attending to Financial and Taxation Matters, including weekly conferences, telephone and email attendances." That invoice overlaps with the period claimed in the earlier invoice. That invoice was processed through FAL HB's accounting systems and a payment of $22,000 was made to Fence All (Ex P6, 2874), although recorded as a payment to Ashton Accountants. Mr Xenos gave the same explanation in respect of this transaction as he gave in respect of transaction 1 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim. That account is also implausible for the reasons noted above in respect of the previous transaction and I do not accept it. I am satisfied that that transaction was also improperly made for the benefit of Mr Xenos.
Transaction 3 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.1) is a transfer on 12 December 2013 of $13,870 to EZI Group by FAL HB and is recorded in FAL HB's accounting system as "internet transfer telephone system 1" (Ex P6, 3072). FAL HB's journal entry records that Mr Xenos was to provide invoice support for the transaction, although no documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence as a payment for the purchase of office furniture and equipment and other items from EZI Group, and his evidence was that he was not able to provide further particulars of the transaction without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which he made no attempt to obtain by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Mr Arnott points out that a search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot has not revealed any supporting documentation that would justify the payment and Mr Xenos has not put forward any records of EZI Group that might justify the payment, such as its invoices for buying the alleged equipment, its asset register or any work papers demonstrating how the alleged prices for the equipment were set. I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 4 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.3) is a transfer on 12 December 2013 of $4,850 to EZI Group by FAL HB. The payment description states that payment was a "Rental Payment" and a journal entry states the payment was for "Office Furniture". Transaction 5 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.5) is a transfer on 12 December 2013 of $11,230 to EZI Group by FAL HB. The payment description states that payment was for "Telephone System" and a journal record states that payment was for "Office furniture" and "Tim [Xenos] to confirm re: invoice". No documents providing any support for these payments were led in evidence. Mr Xenos adopted the same explanation for these transactions in his affidavit evidence as for transaction 3 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.1) and I do not accept that explanation for the reasons I did not accept his explanation for that transaction.
Transaction 6 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction F.2) is a transfer on 12 December 2013 of $9,715 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB and the payment description refers to "Airfares Houston". No supporting documentation was led in evidence. Mr Xenos sought to explain this transaction in his affidavit evidence by a bare assertion of his recollection that the payment was a reimbursement of travel expenses, and that he was unable to confirm further particulars of the transaction without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which (I interpolate) he made no attempt to obtain by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Mr Arnott submits that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment and that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which any reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so. While there is force in that submission, there is evidence that Mr Xenos had some dealings with the FAL Group in the United States and I am not satisfied that FAL HB has shown that this transaction was not a reimbursement for proper business expenses for travel to the United States. FAL HB does not succeed in its claims against Mr Xenos under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and at general law in respect of this transaction.
Transaction 7 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.6) is a transfer on 19 December 2013 of $12,860 to EZI Group by FAL HB. The payment description states that the payment was for a "License Fee" and a journal record states that payment was to be made to the Australian Communications and Media Authority for licensing fees. No evidence of such a payment was led by Mr Xenos. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence as a reimbursement for licence fees that related to the Disney licence fee, although that is not consistent with the description of the transaction in the journal record. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he was unable to confirm further particulars of the transaction without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents. Mr Arnott submits that a proper basis for such a reimbursement has not been established by the evidence; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was within Mr Xenos' power to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission, and I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 8 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction F.3) is a transfer on 2 January 2014 of $4,500 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB. The description provided was "Travel" and no supporting documentation is in evidence. Transaction 10 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction F.4) is a transfer on 23 January 2014 of $2,480 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, described as "Jazan Tripexpenses", which is a reference to the location of FAL Arabia's proposed factory in Saudi Arabia. No supporting documentation is in evidence. Transaction 11 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction F.1) is a transfer on 28 January 2014 of $1,841.46 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, described as "NZ travel". No supporting documentation is in evidence.
Mr Xenos sought to explain these transactions in his affidavit evidence by a bare assertion of his recollection that those payments were reimbursements of travel expenses, and that he was unable to confirm further particulars of the transactions without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which (I interpolate) he made no attempt to obtain by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Mr Arnott submits that a proper basis for such a reimbursement is not established by the evidence; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. There is force in that submission, but there is evidence to support the fact that Mr Xenos was required to travel to Saudi Arabia for business purposes. I am not satisfied that FAL HB has shown that transaction 10 was not a proper reimbursement for expenses of such travel and FAL HB does not succeed in that claim. There is no evidence to establish such a business purpose in respect of the payment for the unidentified travel or the "NZ travel" that is the subject of transactions 9 and 11 and FAL HB succeeds in respect of those claims.
Transaction 9 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.8) is a transfer on 6 January 2014 of $14,180 to EZI Group by FAL HB, described as "Office Equipment". No documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence as a payment to EZI Group for a photocopier/scanner and various computers owned by EZI Group and sold to FAL, and his evidence was that he was unable to provide further particulars of the transaction without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which (I interpolate) he again made no attempt to obtain on subpoena or discovery. Mr Arnott points out that a search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot has not revealed any supporting documentation that would justify the payment and Mr Xenos has not put forward any records of EZI Group that might justify the payments, such as its invoices for buying the alleged equipment, its asset register or any work papers demonstrating how the alleged prices for the equipment were set. I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 12 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.4) is a transfer on 13 February 2014 of $5,000 to EZI Group by FAL HB. The payment description and journal record states that payment was for "Warehouse Fees". No documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence in the amount of $5,000 as a reimbursement of warehouse storage costs and stock, (which, I interpolate, there is no evidence were incurred) and he says that he is unable to provide further particulars of the transaction without authorisation forms and supporting documents which he made no attempt to obtain by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Transaction 13 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.7) is a transfer on 13 February 2014 of $2,000 to EZI Group by FAL HB. The payment description states that payment was for "Marketing and Crea" [sic]. No documents providing any support for this transaction are in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence as reimbursement of a marketing expense on behalf of FAL HB and relied on his explanation in respect of transaction 3 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.1) in respect of that transaction. Mr Arnott submits that a proper basis for these transactions has not been established; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payments; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made the payments which were appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission. Having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of these transactions.
Transaction 14 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (which may refer to Fontanot transaction E.5, although there are discrepancies as to date, payee and amount) is a transfer on 13 June 2014 of $16,020 to EZI Group by FAL HB, described as "CEOSalaryUSD145". Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence as payment of his monthly salary of USD$14,500. I do not accept that explanation, where the evidence indicates that Mr Xenos' June 2014 salary was paid to him directly on 19 June 2014.
Transaction 15 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction D.2) is a transfer on 30 September 2014 of $4,500 to EZI Group by FAL HB, described as "Commission Payment", and a journal entry states that the payment was to be made to Commander NSW Sales Pty Ltd. No documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos sought to justify this transaction in his affidavit evidence as commission paid to unidentified persons for incentives or licence payments, and again indicated that he could not provide further particulars without authorisation forms and supporting documents which he made no attempt to obtain by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 16 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.36), a transfer on 10 October 2014 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, was described as "Consultancy". Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence by relying on his evidence in respect of transaction 28 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.15). I do not accept that evidence for the reason set out in respect of that transaction. Mr Arnott submits that this payment occurred after August 2014, when Mr Xenos accepted that EZI Group was no longer trading. I note, for completeness, that that submission would not have been a complete answer to Mr Xenos' evidence, had I accepted it, since payments for proper fees could have been made in arrears after EZI Group had ceased ongoing trading activities.
Transaction 17 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.11) is a transfer on 20 October 2014 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, described as "Inv 29 EZI", made by reference to an invoice from EZI Group which refers to payment for "Consultancy - October" (Ex P6, 2907). Transaction 18 (Fontanot transaction C.12) is a transfer on 11 November 2014 of $10,000.00 to Fence All by FAL HB, also described as "Consultancy", paid on the basis of an invoice dated 11 November 2014 in the amount of $10,000 from EZI Group which refers to "Consultancy" (Ex P6, 2912). Transaction 19 (Fontanot transaction C.13) is a transfer on 1 December 2014 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, described as "Consultancy Licens", made by reference to an invoice from EZI Group dated 29 November 2014 in the amount of $10,000 which refers to "Consultancy - Month of November 2014" (Ex P6, 2917). Transaction 20 (Fontanot transaction C.14) is a transfer on 24 December 2014 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, described as "Inv33 EZI", by reference to an invoice from EZI Group referring to "Consultancy" (Ex P6, 2922). Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence in respect of transaction 17 (Fontanot transaction C.11), which he also adopted for transactions 18-20 (Fontanot transactions C.12-C.14), was partly inadmissible and not admitted, and otherwise that his monthly salary was paid in instalments between November 2013 and December 2014. His evidence is that he is unable to provide further particulars of the transaction without the authorisation forms, which he did not seek to obtain on subpoena or on discovery, and the transaction was authorised by the accounts department. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that Mr Xenos' evidence that this payment related to his entitlement to salary was disproved by the unchallenged evidence in Schedules E and F to the Plaintiffs' opening submissions. .
Transaction 21 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction E.2) is a transfer on 15 January 2015 of $11,936.23 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, by reference to an employee expense form submitted by Mr Xenos in relation to a list of expenses for which no invoices are in evidence and which relate to a period well before the submission of the claim form. The majority of the claim relates to a "Qantas flight fare", for which there is no evidence. Mr Arnott submits that a proper basis for this payment is not established by the evidence; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission. Having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 22 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction E.3) is a transfer on 2 February 2015 of $12,495.54 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB. Mr Xenos explains this transaction in his second affidavit as a reimbursement of travel expenses for Mr Xenos to travel to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Chairman of FAL Arabia. In his third affidavit dated 27 February 2017, Mr Xenos gave additional evidence in respect of this transaction, referring to an email exchange dated 18 November 2013 (nearly 15 months prior to the payment) with Mr Biswas in respect of reimbursement for expenses including travel expenses and to the steps which he contends were involved in the reimbursement of business expenses. There is evidence that Mr Xenos travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet with FAL Arabia from time to time. However, I am not satisfied that this payment was a proper reimbursement of expenses for such travel, given the lack of specificity in the evidence as to when or how any expenses for the travel were paid, the lack of supporting documentation and, most importantly, the delay in the claim for reimbursement. It seems to me that the long delay in making a claim of this size raises an inference that the claim is not genuine, which Mr Xenos' evidence does not displace, and that distinguishes this claim from transactions 6 and 8 above.
Transaction 23 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction E.1) is a transfer on 19 February 2015 of $14,500 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, made by reference to an employee expense form submitted by Mr Xenos in relation to an invoice which was dated 4 January 2014 from RJA Investments (Aust) Pty Ltd ("RJA"). This transaction was explained in Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence by a bare assertion that it was a purchase of office equipment from RJA and was reimbursed to Mr Xenos, for reasons that are not explained. I do not accept that explanation. Mr Arnott points out that the sole director of this company was Mr Ashton and its registered office and principal place of business was Ashton Accountants in Cremorne. The invoice states that it was for the sale of office furniture located at offices in Mascot, which by that stage were occupied by FAL HB. Mr Arnott submits that several factors indicate that the invoice was false, namely that the invoice was dated over a year before payment was sought by Mr Xenos; the connection of the company to Mr Ashton, who had issued other false invoices at Mr Xenos' request, as I have found above; that payment was made to Mr Xenos and not to RJA as the purported owner of the furniture; that there is no evidence of Mr Xenos having paid RJA the amount for which he sought reimbursement; and the absence of supporting material to support the claim. I infer that invoice was false for these reasons. Mr Arnott also submits that a proper basis for such a reimbursement is not established; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission. Having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of this transaction.
Transaction 24 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction E.6) is a transfer on 17 March 2015 of $1,584.01 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, described as "FAL Reimbursement". No supporting documentation is in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence, by way of bare assertion, as a reimbursement of expenses and his evidence is that he was unable to provide further particulars of the transaction without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which he made no attempt to obtain by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Mr Arnott again submits that a proper basis for such a reimbursement is not established by the evidence; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission. Having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 25 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction E.7) is a transfer on 31 March 2015 of $130.09 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, described as "reimbursement". No supporting documentation is in evidence but I am not satisfied, given the small amount involved, that it was not a genuine claim.
Transaction 26 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.37) is a transfer on 25 May 2015 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, described as "EZI Group Final". Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence by relying on his evidence in respect of transaction 28 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.15). I do not accept that evidence for the reason set out in respect of that transaction. Mr Arnott also submits that this payment occurred after August 2014, when Mr Xenos accepted that EZI Group was no longer trading. As I noted above, that submission would not have been a complete answer to Mr Xenos' evidence, had I accepted it, since payments for proper fees could have been made in arrears after EZI Group had ceased ongoing trading activities.
Transaction 27 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.27) is a transfer on 5 June 2015 of $6,500 to Fence All by FAL HB, similarly described as "EZI Final Payment". Transactions 28-38, 40 and 43-45 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transactions C.15-C.18, C.30, C.19-C.22, C.29 and C.28, C.23 and C.24-C.26 respectively) are payments of various amounts attributed to EZI Group licensing to Fence All.
Transaction 28 (Fontanot transaction C.15) is a transfer on 7 September 2015 of $5,000 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "Inv 34 EZI", referable to an invoice from EZI Group which refers to payment for "Transfer of License Fees and Agreements". Mr Xenos' explanation of this payment in his affidavit evidence was that it was on account of a fee charged by EZI Group for the transfer of is Disney licence agreements to FAL HB and that he approved the fee and requested the accounts department to make payments in instalments over a period of time. No documents justifying this payment are in evidence and I do not accept Mr Xenos' explanation of these transactions. Mr Arnott also submits that this payment occurred after August 2014, when Mr Xenos accepted that EZI Group was no longer trading. As I noted above, that submission would not have been a complete answer to Mr Xenos' evidence, had I accepted it, since payments for proper fees could have been made in arrears after EZI Group had ceased ongoing trading activities.
Transaction 29 (Fontanot transaction C.16) is a transfer on 8 September 2015 of $5,000 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "EZI Group Part Pay", referable to the same invoice from EZI Group which refers to payment for "Transfer of License Fees and Agreements". Transactions 30-38 (Fontanot transactions C.17-C.18, C.30, C.19-C.22, C.29 and C.28), 40 (Fontanot transaction C.23) and 43-45 (Fontanot transactions C.24-C.26) are transfers on 12, 16 and 26 November, 4, 10 and 18 December 2015 and 4 January 2016, 11 January 2016 (two payments) and 13 January 2016 of $5,000, on 21 November 2015 of $22,000, on 21 December 2015 of $20,000, and on 24 December 2015 of $8,000, each made to Fence All by FAL HB and described as "EZI Group Payment" or "EZ Payment", by reference to an invoice dated 22 October 2015 for $120,000 from EZI Group for "Transfer of License Fees and all rights to FAL Healthy Beverages. All rights, access and licensing transfer, non claim of product and royalty rates" (Ex P6, 2941).
An email dated 2 November 2015 from Mr Xenos to a member of FAL HB's accounting staff indicates that he was going to make the payment of $22,000, indicating personal involvement in making at least that payment, and that he directed FAL HB's accounts staff to "Please just mark it off" (Ex P6, 3025). Ms Healey was also cross-examined as to that payment and her evidence was that that the transaction was paid by a manual entry, since it could not be entered into the JD Edwards accounting system for it to be able to generate the file for an automated payment without an attached invoice (T149-150). I do not find that evidence implausible given the size and nature of the transaction. No documents justifying these transactions are otherwise in evidence. Mr Xenos adopted the same explanation in his affidavit evidence for transactions 29-38, 40 and 43-45 of Schedule B (Fontanot transactions C.16-C.30) as for transaction 17 (Fontanot transaction C.11). I do not accept that explanation for the reasons set out in respect of that transaction, and an explanation by reference to salary entitlements is also not consistent with the description of several of the payments as relating to licence fees.
Transaction 39 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.38) is a transfer on 31 December 2015 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "Ranging Fees". An email dated 31 December 2015 from Mr Xenos to a member of FAL HB's accounting staff indicated that he "had to pay a ranging fee" for which he would send her the invoice, indicating that that amount was paid by him personally (Ex P6, 3060). No documents providing any support for such a payment by Mr Xenos are in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this payment in his affidavit evidence as a reimbursement of an expense he incurred for a ranging fee to a retailer, which he could not recall, although he speculated as to the identity of that retailer. No further documentation supports that explanation and Mr Xenos made no attempt to obtain such documentation by discovery or subpoena and which I infer would not have assisted him. Mr Arnott submits that a proper basis for such a reimbursement has not been established by the evidence; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission and, having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction.
Transaction 41 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.31) is a transfer on 6 January 2016 of $5,000 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "Yates Beaggi Licen". Mr Xenos' explanation in his affidavit evidence of this transaction refers to a discussion with a solicitor of Yates Beaggi, who is alleged to have suggested that he could get FAL HB's products into restaurant chains although FAB HB would need to pay "ranging fees" and to have requested a payment of $5,000 for the first instalment. Mr Xenos claims to have made that payment from an unidentified personal account, when an invoice had not been provided by Yates Beaggi to him, and then to have requested the accounts staff to pay the invoice to him. Transaction 42 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.32) is a transfer on 8 January 2016 of $5,000 to Fence All by FAL Retail described as "Commission Payment". Mr Xenos' explanation in his affidavit evidence of this transaction is that it was a reimbursement of cash incentives and gift cards provided to staff. Transaction 46 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.33) is a transfer on 18 January 2016 (although dated to 16 January 2016 in the Further Amended Statement of Claim) of $5,280 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "Domain and IP Tran". An email dated 16 January 2016 from Mr Xenos to a member of FAL HB's accounting staff indicated a claim to have paid a fee for transferring domains to a new holding entity for FAL Group and for reimbursement of those fees, indicating his personal involvement in that payment (Ex P6, 3040). Mr Xenos' explanation in his affidavit evidence of this transaction is that it was a payment for domain and IP charges from "Go Daddy". None of those explanations is supported by documents and Mr Xenos made no attempt to obtain such documents by discovery or subpoena.
Transactions 47 and 48 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transactions C.34-C.35) are transfers on 19 and 22 January 2016 each of $6,000 to Fence All by FAL Retail described as "Repair Costs". No documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos' explanation in his affidavit evidence of the second transaction is that it was a reimbursement for unidentified improvements on behalf of FAL HB. It seems to me that Mr Xenos' explanation in his affidavit evidence of this transaction (Fontanot transaction [C.35]) in the amount of $6,000 was a reimbursement for unidentified improvements on behalf of RHB. Mr Arnott again submits that a proper basis for a claim to reimbursement of these transactions has not been established by the evidence; that the search of FAL's records by Mr Fontanot did not reveal any basis for the payment; that it was open to Mr Xenos to lead evidence of the primary payments for which the reimbursement was claimed, although he does not do so; and that Mr Xenos could have, but did not, tender his own bank statements or credit card statements or other records that demonstrated that he in fact made payments which it was appropriate to have reimbursed by FAL HB or FAL Retail. I accept that submission. Having regard to these matters and the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of these transactions.
Transaction 49 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.39) is a transfer on 25 January 2016 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL Retail described as "EZI Scheduled". No documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos explained this transaction in his affidavit evidence by relying on his evidence in respect of transaction 28 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.15). I do not accept that evidence for the reason set out in respect of that transaction. Mr Arnott also submits that this payment occurred after August 2014, when Mr Xenos accepted that EZI Group was no longer trading. As I noted above, that submission would not have been a complete answer to Mr Xenos' evidence, had I accepted it, since payments for proper fees could have been made in arrears after EZI Group had ceased ongoing trading activities.
Transaction 50 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.40) is a transfer on 25 January 2016 of $10,000 to Fence All by FAL HB, described as "Entitlements Tarun". The reference to Tarun was to Mr Chawla. No documents providing any support for such a payment are in evidence. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he was unable to provide further particulars of this payment without authorisation forms and supporting documents which, I interpolate, he made no attempt to obtain on subpoena or discovery. That evidence provides no substantive explanation of the transaction, quite apart from the fact that I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence generally. Mr Xenos' evidence is also that Mr Chawla authorised the transaction and he, oddly, seeks to explain the description of the transaction in the bank statement as "entitlements Tarun" as referring to Mr Xenos' entitlements as authorised by Mr Chawla and paid to Fence All. I do not accept that explanation.
Transaction 51 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.10) is a transfer on 27 January 2016 of $28,000 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "Staff Leave Entitl". No documents justifying the calculation of the amount or any entitlement to it are in evidence. Mr Xenos' explanation of this payment in his affidavit evidence, by way of bald assertion, is that the payment was owed to him in lieu of entitlements and holidays that were not paid to him and was approved by the then chief financial officer, presumably Mr Chawla. I do not accept that evidence.
Transaction 52 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.3) is a transfer on 29 January 2016 of $2,100 to Fence All by FAL HB, described as "Salary entitlement". Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence in respect of this transaction is that he typically directed FAL HB's accounts department to pay his salary and entitlements or reimbursements of expenses to either EZI Group or Fence All's bank account; that he was a signatory on those accounts at that time and, after receipt of those payments, he disbursed the monies; and, in evidence which is no more than speculation, that the payment was either an "unpaid expense, salary shortfall or unpaid payments". Mr Xenos made no attempt to obtain, on subpoena or on discovery, documents which might support that characterisation and I do not accept that characterisation. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that Mr Xenos' evidence that this payment related to his entitlement to salary was disproved by the unchallenged evidence in Schedules E and F to the Plaintiffs' opening submissions.
Transaction 53 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.9) is a transfer on 29 January 2016 of $18,000 to Fence All by FAL Retail, described as "Final salary". Mr Xenos explained this payment in his affidavit evidence as his "final salary" and his evidence was also that he did not make the payment or authorise the transaction. There is no explanation why that amount was then paid by FAL Retail as well as FAL HB and no documents justifying the payment or any entitlement to it are in evidence. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that Mr Xenos' evidence that this payment related to his entitlement to salary was disproved by the unchallenged evidence in Schedules E and F to the Plaintiffs' opening submissions that Mr Xenos' salary payments had been up-to-date by other payments at that time.
Transaction 54 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction E.4) is a transfer on 2 February 2016 of $21,490 to Mr Xenos by FAL HB, described as "Salary Payment" (Ex P6, 3132). That payment was made after the date of Mr Xenos' resignation, and in circumstances that there is evidence that Mr Xenos' salary had been paid in full by other payments (Plaintiffs' opening submissions Schedule E). No documents justifying the payment or any entitlement to it are in evidence. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he was unable to confirm particulars of this transaction without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which he made no attempt to obtain on subpoena or discovery. Transaction 55 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction C.6) is a transfer on 8 February 2016 of $11,280 to Fence All by FAL HB described as "Staff Expenses rec". No documents justifying the payment or any entitlement to it are in evidence. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that he could not recall exactly what this payment was for, although he referred to the description recorded in the bank statement to suggest that it was a reimbursement on account of staff expenses. His evidence was that he did not make the payment and did not authorise the transaction. Having regard to the view that I have formed as to Mr Xenos' credit, I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in explanation of the transaction, which remains unexplained.

The parties' submissions and conclusions as to the transactions in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim
I now turn to the parties' submission as to these transactions. The Plaintiffs' case in respect of these transactions is, subject to the matters which I will address below, largely established by the nature of the particular transactions, which I have addressed above. Mr Arnott submits that the impugned transactions with Fence All, EZI Group and Mr Xenos follow a similar pattern of having no supporting documentation or invoices which had no proper basis and represent a concerted scheme by Mr Xenos, assisted by Mr Ashton, to misappropriate funds from FAL HB. Mr Arnott points out that many of the payments made by FAL HB and FAL Retail were processed through FAL HB's internet banking portal, to which Mr Xenos had personal access, even if (as Mr Xenos contends) FAL HB's accounting staff also had such access.
Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that it is not essential to the Plaintiffs' case that they prove that Mr Xenos directly conducted the transactions, and that his breach of duty is made out if he otherwise procured, permitted or authorised the payments (through requesting the payments or submitting false invoices to the accounting staff) or if he knew that the payments were to be or had been made and did nothing to stop or return those payments. In my view, it would be sufficient to establish a breach of [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) if Mr Xenos, as a director and chief executive officer of FAL HB, allowed procedures to subsist which permitted the relevant payments to him and interests associated with him, and sufficient to establish a breach of [ss 181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) if he allowed such payments to be made for an improper purpose or to FAL HB's detriment, whether or not he personally made them. Mr Arnott also submits that Mr Xenos had the opportunity to respond to each of the impugned transactions in his second (and also his third) affidavits and that his explanations of those transactions are unconvincing and should not be accepted by the Court, including for the reason that his evidence cannot be accepted on contentious issues.
Mr O'Connor accepts that Mr Xenos was the chief executive officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail and was at various times the sole director of FAL HB. Mr Xenos' evidence in re-examination was that his late father, Mr Denis Xenos, was appointed as a director of FAL HB because the company required financing for vehicles and he was to be a guarantor of that financing. Mr O'Connor contends that Mr Xenos provided a satisfactory explanation of that appointment for that reason. It is not necessary to determine that matter, since the circumstances of Mr Denis Xenos' appointment as a director of FAL HB are not determinative of any issue in the proceedings. Whether or not Mr Denis Xenos was appropriately, or inappropriately, appointed as a director of FAL HB, Mr Xenos remained the chief executive officer of both entities and at all times had effective control of those entities so as to be a shadow director of those entities and an officer of those companies for the purposes of the relevant statutory duties. Mr O'Connor also submits that the FAL Group's procurement authority matrix and procedures were not incorporated into the constitution of FAL HB and did not impose additional limitations on Mr Xenos as a director or officer of FAL HB. It is not necessary to determine that question since breach of the procurement authority matrix or procedures is not necessary to the findings that I reach below.
Mr O'Connor submits that Mr Fontanot's evidence is not sufficient to establish the basis of the claim against Mr Xenos. Mr O'Connor submits that Mr Fontanot failed properly to complete his investigation by obtaining information and confirmation from external sources as to each transaction, and that the evidence cannot be sufficiently relied upon, and the Court cannot be satisfied of Mr Xenos' alleged breaches by reference to bank statements or invoices without further inquiries made from the relevant party. I do not accept that submission, which does not seem to me to have sufficient regard to the extent of documentary evidence, including bank statements, which exist in respect of the relevant transactions. I have referred to the detail of that evidence in dealing with those transactions above. It does not seem to me that it was necessary for Mr Fontanot to make inquiries of third parties, where any evidence which would have been available from third parties to provide justification for the relevant transaction could equally have been led by Mr Xenos.
Mr O'Connor also refers to various aspects of Mr Fontanot's inquiries which he contends were incomplete, including the fact that Mr Fontanot did not investigate further or review audit trails to determine whether any accounting records of FAL HB or FAL Retail were not accurate or may have been altered (implicitly, by Mr Xenos or at his direction), a possibility to which Ms Healey had alerted him; did not carry out an audit or review of FAL HB's or FAL Retail's fixed asset register; did not make external inquiries of third parties, for example travel suppliers to FAL HB, to confirm whether Mr Xenos had incurred expenses to support claims for reimbursement by him; did not make external inquiries to confirm whether FAL HB or FAL Retail had purchased telephone systems or office equipment, where reimbursements had been claimed in that respect; and did not make inquiries with Mr Ashton as to the two invoices of $22,000 each to which I have referred in paragraphs 72-77 above.
Mr Arnott responds that there is no basis for any suggestion that the evidence presented by FAL HB or FAL Retail is selective, or that insufficient work was done to find documents which might provide innocent explanations for any of the impugned transactions, although the documentary trail of authorisations for the transactions is plainly incomplete. Mr Fontanot's evidence, which I accept, is that he and his team thoroughly checked each of the documents that he was able to find that matched the transactions recorded in his affidavit (T120, T121, T129) and that this involved searching emails and hard copy documents captured using optical character recognition technology (T124). It seems to me that these criticisms of Mr Fontanot's inquiries do not advance Mr Xenos' position. It was open to Mr Xenos to seek production of documents relating to any of these matters on discovery or subpoena; tender, for example, any fixed asset register of FAL HB or lead evidence, for example, as to its fixed assets and the manner in which it had acquired them; and lead evidence as to dealings with third parties, either by issuing a subpoena for production of documents by them or a subpoena to their employees or officers to give oral evidence, if he wished to do so. It was notable that Mr Xenos did not seek to lead evidence of any substance, other than by bare assertion in his affidavit evidence, of the matters which he suggests should have been the subject of further inquiry by Mr Fontanot.
Mr O'Connor also submits that Mr Xenos took reasonable steps to put into place means by which FAL HB and FAL Retail would comply with the requirements under [Pt 2M.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p2m.2) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) regarding books and records and, if FAL HB and FAL Retail are unable to satisfy the evidentiary obligations regarding their claim, then the claim for such losses should be dismissed. Mr O'Connor refers to various steps which, on Mr Xenos' evidence, were in place in respect of the payment of invoices and expenses (Xenos 6.11.16 [23]). Mr Arnott responds that Mr Xenos has not established that such a process was properly applied in all cases. As Mr Arnott points out, the evidence indicates several occasions on which Mr Xenos directly processed and authorised payments and then told the FAL accounts staff of the payments after the fact. Mr Arnott also points to the lack of admissible evidence about the process in Mr Xenos' third and final affidavits after Mr Xenos was given leave to address the inadmissibility of the bare assertions in his second affidavit as to that process. Mr Arnott also points out that Mr Xenos was the sole signatory and authorised all payments and submits that the suggestion, first raised in cross-examination, that accounts staff used his account log-in details should be rejected. I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in that regard, not least because there was no apparent benefit to accounts staff personally in making numerous payments to Mr Xenos, Fence All or EZI Group, when he received the relevant funds, or to pay his personal legal expenses in respect of his bankruptcy, a matter to which I will refer below. Mr Arnott also points out that Mr Xenos was a signatory to EZI Group's and Fence All's and his own bank accounts (T222-223) and points to the significance of the fact that, if any funds came to him from FAL HB or FAL Retail that he had not authorised, an honest person would have returned them, and Mr Xenos did not do so.
I will assume, without deciding, that the procedures to which Mr Xenos referred generally existed and may well have been applied in respect of some or many transactions of the business which did not involve payments to Mr Xenos or his associated entities. It does not seem to me that assists the existence of those procedures Mr Xenos, where they did not prevent the particular transactions to which I have referred above, and where Mr Xenos plainly had knowledge of those transactions, so far as he received their financial benefit, irrespective of whether he personally authorised the transactions. It seems to me that FAL HB and FAL Retail have established their claims on the evidence, since they have shown that numerous payments were made to Mr Xenos and entities associated with him which, if not adequately explained, were not consistent with the exercise of care or skill by Mr Xenos as a director, shadow director or chief executive officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail and were contrary to FAL HB's and FAL Retail's interests and to its detriment. Those transactions are, collectively and individually, not adequately explained by the evidence led in the proceedings, including the evidence led by Mr Xenos.
Mr O'Connor also submits that, so far as the transactions involved a conflict between Mr Xenos' interests as a director (or, by extension, as a shadow director or officer) of FAL HB or FAL Retail and Mr Xenos in his personal capacity, it was necessary that Mr Xenos ensure that "necessary corporate approvals are obtained" and "safeguards" were put in place, and that he satisfied that requirement by appointing relevant individuals to the accounting department of FAL HB and FAL Retail and ensuring that department was responsible for approving and recording the payment of monies by FAL HB and FAL Retail. It also does not seem to me this submission assists Mr Xenos. First, there is no evidence that many of the transactions were approved, in any substantive sense, by the accounting department of FAL HB or FAL Retail. Second, to the extent that such approvals were obtained, the evidence as to the particular transactions to which I have referred above shows that they were often described in a false or misleading manner. Even if Mr Xenos relied on FAL HB's and FAL Retails' accounts staff in some respects, the impugned transactions noted above are such that they should not have been authorised, and he must have known they were improper, even if accounts staff had been misled by, for example, false invoices that he had a role in procuring. Mr Xenos also claims that some of these payments were in respect of remuneration and superannuation to which he was entitled. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that the evidence (set out in Schedules E and F to his opening submissions) shows that Mr Xenos' salary and superannuation entitlements were paid in full throughout the period, by other transactions. I am satisfied that the impugned transactions did not represent Mr Xenos' salary or superannuation.
Mr O'Connor also relies on principles of ratification and acquiescence and refers to the observations of Brereton J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus Maxwell above at [103] (omitting citations) that: "where there is an identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders, so that in effect the directors are the shareholders, the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing, constrain management and strengthen shareholder control -- which is [the] fundamental purpose and rationale of these duties -- is much less acute. That is a circumstance which can impact considerably on the content of the duties. The significance of a correspondence between the identity of the directors and the shareholders is illustrated by the circumstance that, at general law, a fully informed general meeting can prospectively or retrospectively ratify the actions of directors of the company, though they involve negligence, breach of fiduciary duty or the exercise of the directors' powers for an improper purpose ... . Where the directors and the shareholders are one and the same, ratification is implicit.
Although the shareholders of a company cannot release the directors from their statutory duties imposed by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html), [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) and [182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) ..., their acquiescence in a course of conduct can affect the practical content of those duties, including any question of whether directors acted with a reasonable degree of care and diligence, and whether they made improper use of their position ...."
I should note that there is a degree of tension between this view and Gordon J's observation in Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus Warrenmang Ltd <case>; <case> per McColl JA, with whom Handley and Santow JJA agreed.
Mr O'Connor submits that the transactions conducted by Mr Xenos were effectively approved by FAL Arabia as FAL HB's major shareholder and by Mr Xenos as a shareholder of 2.5% of shares in the company, and that an inference should be drawn that FAL Arabia acted on its Chairman's behalf in that respect, where its Chairman did not give evidence. Even if I were to draw an inference that the evidence of FAL Arabia's Chairman would not assist FAL HB's and FAL Retail's case, in circumstances that he was not called, it seems to me plain that fair or adequate disclosure of Mr Xenos' conflict or the nature of the particular transactions was not made to FAL Arabia or its Chairman so as to permit effective ratification of the transactions.
Mr O'Connor also submits that Mr Xenos "was not shaken under cross-examination that all relevant transactions were agreed to by FAL Arabia", although he recognised Mr Refaat's evidence to the contrary. I accept that, as the evidence indicates, there were meetings between Mr Xenos and FAL Arabia at regular intervals. However, Mr Xenos did not give evidence that he made full disclosure of the specifics or circumstances of any or all of the relevant transactions to FAL Arabia or its Chairman at those meetings, and a general discussion of FAL HB's or FAL Retail's business or general financial reporting would not give rise to ratification or acquiescence in respect of the particular transactions. Mr O'Connor also points to the possibility of subsequent ratification of the transactions. While I accept that possibility exists, at least in respect of the general law, there is again no evidentiary basis for a finding that the particular transactions were sufficiently disclosed to FAL Arabia or its Chairman to give rise to any subsequent ratification of the transactions. I am satisfied that Mr Xenos did not make full disclosure of the material circumstances, the nature of his conflicts or the character of the particular transactions to FAL Arabia or its Chairman in their capacity as shareholders in FAL HB, or to FAL HB (by any independent person, as distinct from Mr Xenos who was implicated in the relevant transactions) as shareholder of FAL Retail, to allow Mr Xenos to avoid liability on the basis of ratification.
These transactions (with the exception of transactions 6, 10 and 25 in Schedule B to the Further Amended Statement of Claim) would not have been implemented or permitted by a director or chief executive officer who exercised the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if he or she was a director or officer of a corporation in FAL HB's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within FAL HB as, Mr Xenos. Mr Xenos also did not exercise his powers or discharge his duties in respect of these transactions in FAL HB's best interests or for a proper purpose, and Mr Xenos' involvement with the transactions as director or officer of FAL HB involved the improper use of his position to gain an advantage at least for Fence All and to cause detriment to FAL HB. FAL HB is entitled to succeed in its claims against Mr Xenos under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and at general law in respect of these transactions, excluding transactions 6, 10 and 25 in Schedule B to the Plaintiffs' opening submissions.

Transactions with Yates Beaggi
Second, FAL HB and FAL Retail seek to recover the amounts of transactions engaged in with Yates Beaggi totalling $354,949.95 as set out in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim. These matters were also raised in a somewhat indirect way in the pleading. Paragraphs 45-46 of FAL HB's and FAL Retail's Further Amended Statement of Claim plead allegations of Mr Xenos' involvement in other business opportunities while employed by or a director of FAL HB and FAL Retail. FAL HB and FAL Retail plead (FASC [45(c)]) that Mr Xenos engaged in business unrelated to his work as chief executive officer of the FAL Group and FAL HB and FAL Retail, and also plead (FASC [45(d)]) that, during the time he was employed by or was a director of FAL HB and FAL Retail, Mr Xenos pursued business opportunities with the EZI Group and other entities. These allegations are particularised by reference to payments, inter alia, to Yates Beaggi, although the link between those particulars and the pleaded allegations is not entirely clear. Paragraphs 65, 67 and 69 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim in turn particularise the loss or damage claimed by FAL HB and FAL Retail in respect of Mr Xenos' alleged breach of the express and implied terms of his employment and his breach of statutory duties as including the amounts set out in Schedule C being the payments to Yates Beaggi. The Court should determine those matters where the parties have conducted the case on the basis that they are in issue and a substantial amount of time at the hearing was devoted to this issue.
FAL HB and FAL Retail submit that, in dealing with Yates Beaggi, Mr Xenos procured false or misleading invoices that stated or implied that the work to which the invoices related was for the benefit of FAL HB, when in fact that was not the case. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence was that Yates Beaggi had acted on his behalf for approximately the last 8-9 years and that firm acted for FAL HB for approximately 18 months until the end of 2015 (Xenos 31.10.16 [150]).
Mr Xenos engaged Yates Beaggi to provide legal services in respect of his financial affairs on the terms of an engagement letter dated 12 March 2014, which identified the scope of work as including acting on Mr Xenos' behalf against his trustee in bankruptcy; representing him on an annulment of the bankruptcy under [s 73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s73.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/); and services on a general retainer basis. Yates Beaggi required an initial payment of $10,000 on account of anticipated professional fees and anticipated disbursements. By an email dated 12 March 2014 (Ex P6, 715), Yates Beaggi rendered an invoice for fees in the amount of $10,000, which was described as rendered in respect of "legal fees incurred by attending upon commercial matters relating to [FAL HB]". I draw the conclusion, having regard to the timing of that invoice, that those fees related to the initial payment in respect of advice relating to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy. Transaction 1 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.44) is a payment made on 14 March 2014 in the amount of $10,000 and was paid into Yates Beaggi's trust account as required by that firm's engagement letter with Mr Xenos. Mr Xenos acknowledged in cross-examination that the paid stamp on that invoice included his handwriting and was dated by him, and he accepted that he applied that date after he went into NAB Connect and put through the relevant payment for $10,000 (T239).
Mr Xenos volunteered, for the first time in cross-examination, that this payment was made after a telephone conversation with Mr Refaat and Mr Biswas of FAL Arabia, where they discussed Mr Xenos' bankruptcy and the fact that he had to take legal advice in respect of having the bankruptcy overturned and they authorised payments for such advice from FAL HB's account (T238). Mr Xenos' evidence was that he could not recall the date of the conversation, and he was non-committal as to whether it had occurred before or after 12 March 2014, although his evidence necessarily implied that it must have occurred at about that time, if it was the basis on which he claimed that Yates Beaggi's invoice dated 12 March 2014 was paid from FAL HB's account. Mr Xenos' evidence of this earlier conversation in cross-examination was inconsistent with his affidavit evidence as to a conversation with representatives of FAL Arabia on 8 May 2014, to which I refer below, so far as he suggested that it was in the prior conversation that he first received authorisation from FAL Arabia to expend funds of FAL HB on his legal costs (T249-250).
Mr Xenos sought to explain the omission of any reference to this conversation from his affidavit evidence on the basis that it occurred in a telephone call and there was no documentation for it (T260). I do not accept that explanation, since Mr Xenos gave evidence of other conversations, not recorded in documentation, in his affidavit and would hardly have omitted a conversation of that significance merely because it was not recorded in an email or other correspondence. In cross-examination, Mr Xenos sought to avoid the inconsistency between his account in his affidavit of a conversation on 8 May 2014, relating to a future engagement of Yates Beaggi, and his evidence in cross-examination that he had been authorised to engage Yates Beaggi in this earlier conversation by explaining the words "I will need to engage Yates Beaggi" as "reiterating the fact that Yates Beaggi were being engaged in this matter" (T262). The difficulty with that explanation is that, on Mr Xenos' account in cross-examination, he had previously been authorised to engage Yates Beaggi and a reference to a present "need to engage" that firm would make no sense. Mr Xenos then sought to reinterpret his affidavit evidence of the later conversation on 8 May as having reflected a conversation to the effect that "I will need to engage to continue on with this case", which was different in substance to the conversation set out in his affidavit evidence.
Mr Arnott submits that Mr Xenos' evidence in cross-examination that he was authorised by FAL HB to pay Yates Beaggi's fees in respect of his bankruptcy in this earlier conversation should be rejected, where there is no reference to that matter in Mr Xenos' affidavits, which were prepared with the assistance of his legal advisers. I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence of this earlier conversation. Quite apart from the issues as to his credit to which I have referred above, the suggestion of such an earlier conversation is inconsistent with the fact that his email dated 8 May 2014 to Mr Refaat and Mr Biswas (to which I refer below) did not refer to any previous disclosure of those matters to FAL Arabia. There is no reason that Mr Xenos would not have referred to such an important previous disclosure in that email, had such previous disclosure been made, and reminded FAL Arabia that his trustee in bankruptcy's letter to FAL Arabia disclosing his bankruptcy should come as no surprise to FAL Arabia since he had previously disclosed his bankruptcy and FAL HB was paying the fees of his solicitors in respect of the matter. That suggestion is also plainly inconsistent with his email dated 8 May 2014 to Mr Amirbeaggi (to which I also refer below) which referred to FAL Arabia's receipt of the letter from his trustee in bankruptcy disclosing his bankruptcy and expressed the view that that letter had "finalised my agreement with FAL" and "effectively ended my relationship with FAL Group" (Ex P6, 942). Mr Xenos plainly then expected that FAL Arabia would terminate his employment, after it became aware of his bankruptcy, although that did not occur. That expectation is inconsistent with his having previously disclosed those matters to FAL Arabia.
By emails between Mr Xenos and Mr Amirbeaggi on 17 March 2014 (Ex P6, 723), Mr Amirbeaggi stated: "We're going to need more funding tomorrow for court. Can I have Brooke send you an invoice for say a further $10k? And, how do you want me to invoice the work already completed? Just a bulk invoice for review of documentation for
FAL Group?".

Mr Xenos responded "Send me the invoice for payment. Make this one to Ezi
Group Pty Ltd so Andrew [Ashton] can say he paid for it" (Ex P6, 729).
On 17 April 2014, Yates Beaggi invoiced Mr Xenos in the amount of $6,600 under the heading "General Advices". That invoice related to matter number "FAA.14038", which I am satisfied related to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy, and the narrative of attendances provided with that invoice (but largely not with later invoices) made clear that the attendances related to correspondence between Mr Xenos and that firm in respect of his bankruptcy, and that firm and his trustee in bankruptcy. That invoice was initially addressed to Mr Xenos and then reissued in a form addressed to FAL HB on 17 April 2014, and sent to Mr Xenos under cover of an email which described it as the "amended invoice ... as requested" (Ex P6, 863). In cross-examination, Mr Xenos denied that he directed Yates Beaggi to change the invoice previously issued on 17 April 2014 and reissue it so that it was addressed to FAL HB, and speculated that FAL HB's accounts department may have taken that course. Mr Xenos' denial of that matter was inconsistent with his lack of recollection of other matters and the suggestion that staff within FAL HB's accounts department requested that change was inconsistent with the objective probabilities. I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence as to that matter.
Transaction 2 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.42) was made on 30 April 2014 in the amount of $10,000. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains this transaction by reference to his claim that the payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy were authorised by FAL Arabia. I have addressed the earlier conversation on which he relied, in cross-examination, for that authorisation above and address the balance of the evidence below. Subsequent fee invoices that apparently related to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy, and were issued on the file number referable to that bankruptcy, were issued by Yates Beaggi to FAL HB under the heading "general advices" and included descriptions such as, in an invoice dated 1 May 2014: "Various attendances upon Company consultation, legal, franchise and trademark advice (Ex P6, 887)."
Transaction 3 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.46) is a payment made on 1 May 2014 in the amount of $6,600 under that invoice. Mr Xenos again explains this transaction in his affidavit evidence by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. I now turn to the next conversation on which he relies to establish that authorisation.
In his affidavit dated 6 November 2015, Mr Xenos gave evidence of a conversation on 8 May 2014 with Mr Biswas, and then with Mr Refaat and Mr Biswas, concerning a letter sent by his trustee in bankruptcy to FAL Arabia concerning his bankruptcy and his inability to be a director. Mr Xenos' evidence was that he said, in that conversation, that: "... yes I am a bankrupt and it is a matter from a previous business and does not affect the business we have set up." 
Mr Xenos' evidence was that he said that: "If you believe this is a matter of concern for FAL then I tender my resignation effective immediately and you can find someone else to run the business." 
Mr Xenos' evidence was that Mr Refaat then responded that that was the
Chairman's decision and that the Chairman "would like you to ensure that FAL is not affected by this and that you do what is required to ensure that you can continue your role". Mr Xenos then refers to a further exchange to the following effect: [Xenos]  "I will need to engage Yates Beaggi to act on my behalf in this matter but
FAL will need to pay for this to be expedited."  [Refaat]  "Please do what needs to be done and keep me informed as I will need to inform the Chairman." (Xenos 6.11.16 [46])
Mr Xenos' account of this conversation, as set out in his affidavit, indicates that this was the first occasion that FAL Arabia became aware of the bankruptcy, after the receipt of the letter from Mr Xenos' bankruptcy trustee, and the last part of the conversation indicates that Mr Xenos for the first time sought permission to engage Yates Beaggi to act on his behalf, on the basis that FAL HB would pay for that engagement. As I noted above, Mr Xenos contradicted that account, in fundamental respects, in cross-examination, by claiming that FAL Arabia was previously informed of his bankruptcy in March 2014 and had previously authorised the engagement of Yates Beaggi. It seems to me that Mr Xenos' evidence of the earlier conversation in cross-examination cannot stand together with his account of the later conversation in his affidavit evidence. After this contradiction had emerged in Mr Xenos' cross-examination, Mr Xenos' evidence was that he could not recall "what exactly happened" on 8 May 2014, although he had previously set out the conversation that he claimed had occurred on that date, in direct speech, in his affidavit (T250). Mr Xenos then revised his account of the 8 May conversation, in cross-examination, to return to the proposition that he had again been given authority in that conversation to fund his solicitor's costs from FAL HB, and indeed "to finish the bankruptcy as quick as possible, at whatever cost" (T250). I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in that respect.
Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence is that he then contacted Mr Amirbeaggi from Yates Beaggi and relayed the telephone conversation of 8 May to Mr Amirbeaggi and said to him: "[C]an you please expedite a resolution of this matter and that all further invoices are to be made out to FAL."
Mr Refaat also gave evidence of the circumstances in which FAL Arabia was informed of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy by a letter from his trustee in bankruptcy on 8 May 2014 and refers to Mr Xenos' advice that that matter was "nothing to worry about" and did not affect his position at FAL. Mr Refaat also refers to an email sent by Mr Xenos to Mr Refaat and Mr Biswas of FAL Arabia on 8 May 2014 which referred to that matter and stated that: "My solicitor is currently actioning and I can assure you this has no affect [sic] or impact on FAL Healthy [B]everages or any FAL company or person, and I will be forwarding a letter confirming. 
This is a past issue of mine and will be resolved shortly." 
That email is consistent with Mr Refaat's account of the conversation. In cross-examination, Mr Refaat denied that, in the conversation in May 2014, Mr
Xenos informed Mr Refaat that he was a bankrupt and offered his resignation, and denied the statement attributed to him in Mr Xenos' evidence that that was a matter for the Chairman, and also denied that there had been reference to engagement of Yates Beaggi to act on Mr Xenos' behalf in that conversation. I prefer Mr Refaat's evidence to Mr Xenos' evidence in that respect, given the issues as to Mr Xenos' credit generally.
On 9 May 2014, Mr Xenos was in further correspondence with Mr Amirbeaggi, suggesting that Yates Beaggi might inform his trustee in bankruptcy that that firm had been appointed to handle all affairs for FAL Arabia and thereby prevent further contact between the trustee in bankruptcy and FAL Arabia (Ex P6, 953). By an email dated 10 May 2014, Mr Xenos advised Mr Ashton that: "I am nervous about Saudi meeting if I don't stop [his trustee in bankruptcy] contacting them and get to show all is clear and I am in the right, it could be last one." (Ex P6, 955) 
That nervousness is inconsistent with Mr Xenos having previously disclosed his bankruptcy to FAL Arabia, as he claimed in cross-examination.
By email dated 12 May 2014 to Mr Biswas of FAL Arabia (Ex P6, 958), Mr Xenos sought to explain the circumstances of his bankruptcy, by reference to a previous business dispute and the dishonesty of a previous partner and advised that: "I can categorically say the following:  . This has nothing to do with FAL;  . This does not affect the FAL business or any FAL businesses;  . The letter requests for any payments made directly to me because as I say above, that they believe I am hiding funds;  . My solicitor and legal team are now all over this matter;  . This occurred in 2011, and is near the end. 
I have always done the best for FAL, even leaving Mode [a former business] and all stocks behind. 
I am committed to FAL, yourself, the Chairman and everyone involved. 
I am ethical, honest and would never jeopardise the company or any people within it."
Mr Xenos then forwarded FAL Arabia a letter dated 8 May 2014 from Yates Beaggi which referred to the notice issued by Mr Xenos' bankruptcy trustee under [s 77A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s77a.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) and advised that: "We are working with Mr Xenos to bring an end to this matter with negotiation and financial proposal. We expect to complete that course over the following 4 weeks. 
We are of the opinion, and have advised Mr Xenos that, the notice issued by [Mr Xenos' bankruptcy trustee] upon you is not an enforceable one. 
We have dispatched correspondence to [Mr Xenos' bankruptcy trustee] demanding that it withdraw the notice forthwith. If it is not withdrawn, we will approach the Court for an Order so to do."
Mr Xenos relies on the earlier conversation to which he referred in his cross-examination and the conversations in May 2014 as authorising the payments made by FAL HB to Yates Beaggi in respect of legal costs relating to his bankruptcy, amounts paid to his trustee in bankruptcy, and amounts paid to his creditors in respect of a compromise that terminated his bankruptcy. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that Mr Xenos' claim that he was authorised to use FAL HB's and FAL Retail's funds to pay Yates Beaggi's fees in respect of his discharge from bankruptcy is inherently implausible. Mr Arnott points out that, by the time Mr Xenos obtained any authorisation for such payments on 8 May 2014 (on the version of events given in his affidavit), FAL HB had already paid $26,000 to Yates Beaggi; on Mr Xenos' account, he told Mr Refaat on 8 May 2014 that he would need to engage Yates Beaggi to assist him, but he had already engaged Yates Beaggi by no later than 12 March 2014; and, on Mr Xenos' account, he told Mr Amirbeaggi at that time to direct future invoices to FAL HB, where Yates Beaggi had already directed emails to FAL HB on several occasions. Mr Arnott also submits, and I also accept, that any authorisation by FAL Arabia to pay Yates Beaggi out of FAL HB's funds is inconsistent with Mr Xenos' conduct in directing Yates Beaggi to prepare invoices in a manner that generally did not disclose the work done related to his bankruptcy, to which I will refer below, and that there would have been no need for Mr Xenos or Yates Beaggi to take that course if Mr Xenos had authority for FAL HB to make those payments for that purpose.
Mr Arnott also submits that Mr Xenos' version of events is inconsistent with the evidence that he sought to "downplay" the significance of his bankruptcy for the FAL Group. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that since Mr Xenos had presented his bankruptcy to FAL Arabia as a matter of little significance, it is highly unlikely that FAL Arabia would then have authorised Mr Xenos to spend an uncapped amount of FAL HB's funds on bringing it to an end. Mr Arnott also points out that, even on Mr Xenos' version of events, he did not have authority to use FAL HB's funds to pay the legal costs of his trustee in bankruptcy or his creditors.
By email between Mr Xenos and Mr Amirbeaggi on 16 May 2014 (Ex P6, 980), Mr Xenos stated: "Are you able to split the invoices in 2 for $15K each. Dated May and June.
Lets [sic] make it out as company consultation, legal advice, re franchise, trademarks etc." 
Mr Xenos also there observed that, after those invoices were sent, he could make payment, implicitly from FAL HB. That email indicates, first, that Mr
Xenos was requesting a false or misleading description of the work done by
Yates Beaggi, which I am satisfied in fact related to his bankruptcy, which was then reflected in invoices issued, dated 1 May 2014 and 1 June 2014, and, second, that he would be involved in making the payment of those invoices, contrary to his affidavit evidence. Mr Xenos acknowledged in cross- examination, as he had to, that his instruction to Mr Amirbeaggi to issue two invoices in the amount of $15,000 dated May and June and to put on them that they were for company consultation, legal advice, franchise and trademarks was given, notwithstanding that the invoices related to work that had nothing to do with those matters (T257-258).
Transaction 4 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim appears to follow from that email and was made on 21 May 2014 in the amount of $15,000 under invoice 8082 dated 1 May 2014 for matter number 14038. That invoice was addressed to FAL HB and headed "General Advices" for work described as "Various attendances upon Company consultation, legal, franchise and trademark advice". The fact that the vast bulk of work done over this period by Yates Beaggi related to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy, although some intellectual property work was done by Mr Yates for FAL under a separate file number, is apparent from an email dated 27 May 2014 from Mr Amirbeaggi to Mr Xenos setting out the nature of the work done (Ex P6, 1036). Transaction 5 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim was made on 2 June 2014 in the amount of $15,000 and was made under invoice 8082v2 dated 1 June 2014 for matter number 14038 addressed to FAL HB and headed "General Advices" for work described in the same way.
By a further email dated 19 June 2014 to Mr Amirbeaggi's secretary, Mr Xenos referred to a further amount of $15,000 that had been paid, plainly in respect of his bankruptcy, and requested that it be invoiced as "legal fees, contract reviews and property rights" (Ex P6, 1071). Transaction 6 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim is a payment made on 2 July 2014 in the amount of $15,000 and was made under invoice 8083 dated 1 July 2014 (Ex P6, 1171) for matter number 14038 addressed to FAL HB and, on one version, is headed "General Advices" and on another version is headed "Monthly retainer for commercial services provided" for work described as "Various attendances upon Company consultation, legal, franchise and trademark advice". Transaction 7 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim is a payment made on 8 July 2014 in the amount of $10,000.
By emails between Mr Xenos and Mr Amirbeaggi on 5 August 2014 (Ex P6, 1186), Mr Xenos stated "Can you please break this [referring to an invoice for $30,000 plus GST] up into 2 invoices for $15K each reflecting the $30K and I will have them paid, and just mark as monthly legal advice" for an invoice which related to work on his bankruptcy matter. Mr Amirbeaggi responded asking if he can send through two invoices for $17,500 each (Ex P6, 3375). It is plain, from that email, that the work done largely related to the preparation of an application under [s 153B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s153b.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) in respect of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy. Invoices in the amounts of $17,500 each were then issued dated 15 July 2014 and 1 August 2014 (Ex P6, 3377, 3379).
Transactions 8 and 9 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.40) are the corresponding payments were made on 8 and 12 August 2014 in the amounts of $17,500 each under an unnumbered invoice for matter 14038 which was headed "Commercial Advice" for professional fees for "Review consider advice upon and settle transactional documentation" (Ex P6, 1184). There is no evidence that such work was done, and that invoice was also issued on the file number relating to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy. By contrast, Yates Beaggi also issued other invoices in relation to trademarks and intellectual property advice, signed by another solicitor director and under a different matter number, to FAL HB, for example on 14 August 2014 (Ex P6, 1214). Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains these transactions by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. This explanation does not address the misdescription of the work done and I have otherwise addressed that evidence above.
Transaction 10 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.37) is a payment made on 13 October 2014 in the amount of $48,279.55 under an amended invoice number 8230 for matter number 14038 headed "Professional advice with respect to commercial undertakings of FAL Group" for FAL HB. The original version of that invoice indicated that it related to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy including a Federal Court filing fee. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains this transaction by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. I have addressed that evidence above.
Transaction 11 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.42) is a payment made on 13 October 2014 in the amount of $10,000. That payment was made, not for the purposes of legal costs incurred by Yates Beaggi, but for the costs of Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy obtaining advice relating to setting aside a judgment, presumably in respect of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy (Ex P6, 1388). That amount was paid by FAL HB (Ex P6, 1390). Transaction 12 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim is a payment was made on 14 November 2014 in the amount of $1,100.
By email dated 28 November 2014, Mr Xenos requested Yates Beaggi to issue "another invoice just marked as legal and consultation fee", which was then issued in respect of work that plainly relates to Mr Xenos' bankruptcy, including counsel's fees of counsel retained to appear in the Federal Court in respect of that bankruptcy (Ex P6, 3370). Transaction 13 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.39) is a payment made on 16 December 2014 in the amount of $22,939 under invoice number 8300 for matter 14038 headed "Legal and consultation fee". Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains this transaction by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. I have addressed that evidence above.
Transaction 14 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.50) is a payment made on 3 March 2015 in the amount of $21,329 under invoice number 8367 for matter 14038 and was also headed "Legal and consultation fee". Transaction 15 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.48) is a payment made on 31 March 2015 in the amount of $5,280 under invoice number 8423 for matter 14038 which was also headed "Legal and consultation fee". Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence is that these transactions were payments for "legal fees on behalf of F[AL] HB" and he again indicates that he is unable to provide further particulars without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which he again made no attempt to obtain on subpoena or discovery.
Further amounts were paid by FAL HB to Yates Beaggi in April 2015, to be applied to the trustee's costs of preparing a report to creditors for a meeting under [s 73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s73.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) (Ex P6, 1748). That payment was made from an FAL HB account over which Mr Xenos had control. By email from Mr Xenos to Mr Amirbeaggi on 23 April 2015, he confirmed that he had made a payment to Yates Beaggi with respect to the bankruptcy trustee's fees of calling a meeting of creditors and stated "For my records can I please have an invoice just stating legal fees" (Ex P6, 1751). I infer that that request was again directed to concealing the nature of the expenditure, by ensuring that it did not refer to the trustee's costs relating to Mr Xenos' discharge from bankruptcy. Mr Xenos himself attended to that payment, contrary to his affidavit evidence, since he advised Ms Do and Ms Lim of FAL HB on 23 April 2015 that: "I had to transfer a payment of $5,500 to Yates [B]eaggi for some legal fees. 
The invoice will be here later today as his assistant has been off. This is
FYI". (Ex P6, 1753) 
The NAB internet banking record also contained a description of the payment referring only to "legal fees".
Transactions 16 and 17 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transactions G.41 and G.47) are payments made on 20 and 23 April 2015 in the amounts of $11,000 and $5,500 and FAL HB and FAL Retail contend they are part payments for a proposed arrangement with creditors. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains these transactions by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. I have addressed that evidence above. Transaction 18 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.51) is a payment made on 5 May 2015 in the amount of $7,700 under invoice number 8480 for matter 14038 headed "Legal and consultation fee". Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence is that this transaction was a payment for "legal fees on behalf of F[AL] HB" and he again indicates that he is unable to provide further particulars without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which he again made no attempt to obtain on subpoena or discovery.
Transaction 19 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.45) is a payment made on 28 May 2015 in the amount of $8,455 under invoice number 8507 for matter 14038 headed "Legal and consultation fee". By email dated 31 May 2015, Mr Xenos advised a member of FAL HB's accounts staff that "I [Mr Xenos] have paid" that invoice, indicating his personal involvement in doing so (Ex P6, 1967). Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains this transaction by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. In cross-examination, Mr Xenos sought to explain the reference in the email dated 31 May that "I have paid" the invoice as indicating, not that he had paid the invoice but that it had been paid (T290). That explanation seems to me to be incredible in the literal sense and I do not accept it.
Transaction 20 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.49) is a payment made on 18 August 2015 in the amount of $15,622.20 under invoice number 8587 for matter 14038 also headed "Legal and consultation fee". Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence is that this transaction was a payment for "legal fees on behalf of F[AL] HB" and he again indicates that he is unable to provide further particulars without appropriate authorisation forms and supporting documents, which he again made no attempt to obtain on subpoena or discovery. Transaction 21 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.38) is a payment made on 14 September 2015 in the amount of $25,000 and FAL HB and FAL Retail submit the payment was made in respect of a proposal under [s 73](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/s73.html) of the [Bankruptcy Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ba1966142/) that Mr Xenos had put to his creditors, which required a payment of $25,000 on acceptance. That proposal falsely stated that the source of the funds was a loan from Mr Ashton. Mr Xenos' affidavit evidence explains this transaction by reference to his account of the authorisation for payments by FAL HB in respect of legal fees referable to his bankruptcy. I have addressed that evidence above.
Transaction 22 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.52) is a payment made on 4 November 2015 in the amount of $26,886.20 under invoice number 8649 for matter 14038 headed "Legal and consultation fee". Transaction 23 in Schedule C to the Further Amended Statement of Claim is a payment made on 16 December 2015 in the amount of $29,259, likely under invoice number 9891 for matter 14038 headed "Legal and consultation fee", although for the slightly higher amount of $29,389.00, although an unnumbered invoice dated 29 December 2015 was also issued for $29,359.00.
Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination that the majority of Yates Beaggi's fees in relation to acting for him, on his bankruptcy, were paid out of FAL HB's accounts although he did not accept that all such fees were paid from that account (T231). Mr Xenos also accepted that the monies paid out of FAL HB's bank account extended to an amount of about $5,500 required by his trustee in bankruptcy for its costs (T232). He claimed not to recall the fact that $25,000 to fund the payment to his creditors by which he exited bankruptcy was made out of FAL HB's bank account (T232). I do not accept Mr Xenos' evidence in that respect, since it seems to me likely that a payment of that size, in connection with the annulment of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy, would not be a matter that Mr Xenos would have forgotten within the relatively short period since he was discharged from bankruptcy.
Mr Refaat's affidavit evidence is that he first came to learn about Yates Beaggi about January 2016, when he became aware that firm had been receiving money from FAL HB. That evidence requires qualification so far as he had received the earlier letter from that firm, describing itself as Mr Xenos' solicitors. His affidavit evidence was also that he had not authorised payments to Yates Beaggi and did not agree to Mr Xenos engaging that firm as legal representatives for FAL HB. Mr Refaat accepted in cross-examination that he knew that Yates Beaggi was acting for Mr Xenos in his personal capacity from about May 2014 (when he received a letter from that firm) but that he did not know that Yates Beaggi had dealings with FAL HB or was paid by FAL HB until after Mr Xenos' resignation (T91). Mr Refaat denied in cross-examination that he had authorised Mr Xenos to engage Yates Beaggi for FAL HB or FAL Retail (T91-92) and also denied that authorisation was given to Mr Xenos to use FAL HB's or FAL Retail's funds to pay his legal bills relating to his bankruptcy. I prefer Mr Refaat's evidence to Mr Xenos' evidence as to that matter.
I now turn to the parties' submissions as to these transactions generally. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that these transactions involved a conscious and concerted effort by Mr Xenos, with at least some assistance by Yates Beaggi (through Mr Amirbeaggi), to disguise the underlying work that was being performed through the generation of invoices that did not accurately describe that work. Mr Arnott submits, and I also accept, that this was done so that the invoices could be processed through the FAL HB accounts department and Mr Xenos could obtain payment of FAL HB's bills in respect of his bankruptcy, with less risk of any challenge by FAL HB's accounts staff. Mr Arnott submits and I also accept that this conduct is inconsistent with Mr Xenos' claim that FAL HB had consented to these payments or, more precisely, had consented to his engaging his solicitor at FAL HB's expense to procure his discharge from bankruptcy, without limitation as to the nature or amount of the costs incurred.
Mr Arnott also submits, and I accept, that a reasonable director or officer in the position of Mr Xenos would have realised that he should not have been procuring, undertaking or permitting these transactions, and Mr Xenos' conduct in concealing the nature of the work being performed shows that he had an actual appreciation at the time that the conduct he was engaging in was improper and unauthorised. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that the payments made by FAL HB to Yates Beaggi in respect of the advice concerning his bankruptcy were made in breach of Mr Xenos' duties to FAL HB and all benefitted Mr Xenos personally, by facilitating (and, I add, avoiding the need for him to pay for) legal services about his bankruptcy, paying the costs of his bankruptcy trustee and the payments to his creditors pursuant to the arrangement by which he exited bankruptcy. Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that Mr Xenos either authorised, procured or failed to prevent these payments from occurring and, by doing so, he breached his duties to FAL HB.
Mr O'Connor submits that, from May 2014, FAL Arabia was aware of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy and no further steps were taken to terminate Mr Xenos' employment or to follow up as to the status of his bankruptcy. Mr O'Connor submits that the conversations between Mr Xenos and Mr Refaat, or representatives of FAL Arabia, in May 2014 amounted to approval for further expenditure of legal fees by the major shareholder of FAL. As I have noted above, I do not accept Mr Xenos' account of the earlier conversation to which he referred in cross-examination or the conversations in May 2014. In any event, even if those conversations had occurred, they did not amount to ratification of the payments to Yates Beaggi. Even if, contrary to my view, Mr Xenos' evidence had provided a truthful account of the relevant conversations, he plainly did not disclose all relevant matters relating to his bankruptcy and the proposed expenditures to FAL Arabia or FAL HB so as to obtain ratification of previous payments to Yates Beaggi or authorisation for future payments to Yates Beaggi. The matters not disclosed included, among other things, the fact and amounts of previous payments, the fact that previous and future payments were the subject of invoices which falsely described the nature of the work done, the likely amount of future expenditures for which authorisation was sought, and the fact that such future expenditures would include not only legal fees but amounts payable by way of costs of the trustee in bankruptcy and amounts payable to personal creditors of Mr Xenos. Even if these conversations had occurred in the form for which Mr Xenos contends, they would not assist him in respect of those payments.
Even if, contrary to my findings, FAL's approval of expenditure of legal fees in respect of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy would also have implied approval of those fees by its Chairman, who was personally a shareholder of FAL HB, I am not satisfied that such approval is established, still less that it extended to numerous payments to Yates Beaggi that had not been specifically disclosed to FAL Arabia or its Chairman, and which were recorded in FAL HB's financial records under incomplete or misleading descriptions, or to payment of the costs of Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy or amounts payable to his creditors to procure the termination of his bankruptcy. In cross-examination, Mr Xenos also relied on the fact that the budget reflected the payment of legal fees, as amounting to further authority to pay Yates Beaggi's fees, but acknowledged that the cashflow information only had a line item referring to "legals" and no reference either to payment to Yates Beaggi or for what the payment was made (T264). A disclosure of legal fees, at that level of generality, is not capable of supporting an authorisation of, or ratification of, particular payments of legal fees to Yates Beaggi for the purposes of Mr Xenos' bankruptcy.
In my view, these transactions would not have been implemented or permitted by a director or chief executive officer who exercised the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if he or she was a director or officer of a corporation in FAL HB's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within FAL HB as, Mr Xenos. Mr Xenos also did not exercise his powers or discharge his duties in respect of these transactions in FAL HB's best interests or for a proper purpose, and Mr Xenos' involvement with the transactions as director or officer of FAL HB involved the improper use of his position to gain an advantage at least for Fence All and to cause detriment to FAL HB. FAL HB is entitled to succeed in its claims against Mr Xenos under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and at general law in respect of these transactions.
Mr O'Connor submits, in the alternative, that any liability of Mr Xenos in respect of payments to Yates Beaggi would be limited to payments prior to May 2014, in the amount of approximately $26,000, and amounts payable to Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy or his creditors, as distinct from legal fees, in the amount of approximately $40,500. While Mr Xenos is liable for those amounts, I have also held that he is liable for the legal fees paid to Yates Beaggi in the intervening period.
As I noted above, FAL HB and FAL Retail subsequently settled their claim against Yates Beaggi and its principals, by deed dated 8 February 2017 (Confidential Exhibit D4) on terms of a payment of $[amount redacted] made by Yates Beaggi. Mr Xenos seeks to set off the recoveries made by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Yates Beaggi against the damages that may be ordered against him in the proceedings. Mr O'Connor submits that any damages payable by Mr Xenos in respect of payments to Yates Beaggi should be reduced by the amount payable by Yates Beaggi and its principals in the settlement with FAL HB and FAL Retail and that to award damages against Mr Xenos in respect of those transactions would give rise to double recovery by FAL HB and FAL Retail.
Mr Arnott draws attention to the decision in RACV Insurance Pty Ltd versus Unisys Australia Ltd <case> where Hansen J referred to the statement of the relevant principles in Banque Keyser Ullman SA versus Skandia (UK) Insurance Co Ltd (No 2) [[1988] 2 All ER 880] and summarised the principle as having the effect that: "When a plaintiff sues two defendants and settles with one but continues to judgment against the other, in the calculation of damages payable by the latter the plaintiff is entitled to treat the settlement sum as allocated first to any claim separate and additional to any claim that was common to the defendants and the costs of that separate claim; and, secondly, any excess of the settlement sum necessarily referable to the common or overlapping claim is to be credited in favour of the second defendant."
In Morris versus Riverwild Management Pty Ltd <case>; <case>, Nettle and Redlich JJA referred to Banque Keyser above and to RACV Insurance Pty Ltd versus Unisys Australia Ltd above and observed that: "[W]here several defendants are severally liable for parts of a plaintiff's claim, the general principle is that one such defendant is not entitled to credit in respect of payments made by other defendants unless and until the total of the payments made by the other defendants exceeds the difference between the plaintiff's claim and that part of the claim for which the defendant seeking credit is liable."
Mr Arnott points out, and I accept, that the claim brought by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Yates Beaggi was for a substantially larger amount than either the resulting settlement or the claim ultimately brought to trial against Mr Xenos. The additional claims brought against Yates Beaggi included, inter alia, claims arising from an alleged failure of that firm, in circumstances that it was providing legal services to FAL HB, including in retainers relating to other matters, to disclose to FAL HB and FAL Retail that Mr Xenos was an undischarged bankrupt who was disqualified from managing corporations by reason of [s 206B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206b.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). FAL HB and FAL Retail had also pleaded that the letter sent by Yates Beaggi on 8 May 2014, to which I have referred above, failed to disclose relevant information in breach of Yates Beaggi's duty to FAL HB and FAL Retail. FAL HB and FAL Retail pleaded that, had Yates Beaggi complied with its duties, then Mr Xenos would have been removed as a director or chief executive officer of FAL HB and FAL Retail at that point, and FAL HB and FAL Retail would not have been exposed to the losses that followed. The size of the claim against Yates Beaggi is indicated by the fact that one aspect of it, relating to transactions which Mr Xenos was alleged to have undertaken without appropriate authorisation, was for at least $12 million.
It seems to me that the wider claims made by FAL HB and FAL Retail against Yates Beaggi were substantial and were seriously arguable, and that the recovery made by FAL HB and FAL Retail from Yates Beaggi by way of settlement should properly be attributed to those claims and to costs before any credit is allowed from that recovery against damages awarded against Mr Xenos. There is no suggestion that, after allowing for those claims and for costs, any amount would be available to reduce the damages awarded against Mr Xenos. There should be no reduction of the amount of the judgment in favour of FAL HB and FAL Retail against Mr Xenos by reason of that settlement.

Payments of traffic and other fines
Third, FAL HB and FAL Retail seek to recover the amounts of payments to the New South Wales Office of State Revenue with respect to traffic and other fines totalling $59,461 as set out in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim and the parties treated these matters as in issue. I have referred above to the somewhat indirect way in which these matters were raised in the pleading, which parallels the claim in respect of the payments to Yates Beaggi. As I noted above, the claims in paragraphs 45-46 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim are particularised by reference to payments, inter alia, to the payment of these penalties, and paragraphs 65, 67 and 69 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim in turn particularise the loss or damage claimed by FAL HB and FAL Retail in respect of Mr Xenos' alleged breach of the express and implied terms of his employment and his breach of statutory duties as including the amounts set out in Schedule D of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, being the payments in respect of penalties to the office of State Revenue. As I noted above in respect of the claims relating to payments to Yates Beaggi, the Court should determine those matters where the parties have conducted the case on the basis that they are in issue.
The payments in issue relate to penalty notices paid by FAL HB and FAL Retail with respect to traffic offences. Many clearly relate to speeding offences which were detected in relation to Mr Xenos' car, although I do not need to find whether Mr Xenos was driving that car at the time. Mr Xenos explains these payments in his affidavit evidence by the bare statement that the substantial payments involved were "in respect of fines for vehicles and toll notices of F[AL] HB". Mr Xenos' evidence in cross-examination was that on some occasions he was the driver of the vehicle when traffic offences were issued; on some occasions he did nominate himself as driver, but the nominations were rejected by the Office of State Revenue because they were too late; and that he had not nominated himself as the driver on all occasions (T309). Mr Arnott submits, and I accept, that the losses caused by these notices have been aggravated by reason that Mr Xenos in most cases did not nominate himself or another person as the driver, resulting in a higher penalty and a further penalty for the failure to nominate.
By way of example, transactions 1 and 3 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transactions G.26-G.30) include a payment on 13 October 2014 of a penalty of $1,270, referable to penalty notice for a speeding infringement by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 31 August 2014 (exceeding limit by over 10 km per hour on M5 Motorway between Marsh Street and Bexley Road, Arncliffe) (Ex P6, 3314) and a payment on 4 November 2014 of $1,270 also relating to a penalty notice for a speeding infringement by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 8 October 2014 (exceeding limit by over 10 km per hour on Eastern Distributor between Oxford Street and William Street, Darlinghurst) (Ex P6, 3309). Transaction 6 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.19) is a payment on 24 December 2014 of $2,180 for a penalty notice for a speeding infringement by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 25 November 2014 (exceeding limit by over 20 km per hour on M5 Motorway between Marsh Street and Bexley Road, Arncliffe) (Ex P6, 3261). Transaction 11 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.35) is a payment on 16 February 2015 of $545 for a penalty notice for a speeding infringement by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 14 January 2015 (exceeding limit by over 10 km per hour on Botany Road Rosebery between Harcourt Parade and Gardeners Road) (Ex P6, 3330). Transaction 15 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.8) is a payment on 20 April 2015 of $4,175 for a penalty notice for a speeding infringement by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 9 March 2015 (exceeding limit by over 30 km per hour, again on the M5 Motorway between Marsh Street and Bexley Road, Arncliffe) (Ex P6, 3203). That amount was paid from FAL HB (Ex P6, 3204). A further penalty notice was issued for a failure to nominate the driver within the requisite timeframe in the amount of $3,610 and was also paid by FAL HB (Ex P6, 3206-3207).
Transaction 19 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.27) is a payment of $1,270 on 22 June 2015 of a penalty notice for a speeding infringement again by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 18 April 2015 (exceeding limit by over 10 km per hour on Forest Road, Penshurst between Penshurst Street and St Georges Road) (Ex P6, 3300). Transaction 22 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.25) is a payment on 17 August 2015 of $1,300 for a penalty notice for a speeding infringement by the driver of Mr Xenos' car on 20 July 2015 (exceeding limit by over 10 km per hour on the Eastern Distributor between Oxford Street and William Street, Darlinghurst) (Ex P6, 3290). Several other impugned transactions are payments to the Office of State Revenue for other unidentified penalty notices.
Transactions 4, 7-10, 13-14, 17-18, 21, 25 and 27-29 in Schedule D to the Further Amended Statement of Claim (Fontanot transaction G.23, G.20, G.22-G.23, G.18, G.17, G.16, G.14-G.15, G.13, G.12, G.10-G.11, G.9) are payments on 26 November and 24 December 2014, 2 February, 16 March, 31 March, 3 and 4 June 2015, 12 August 2015, 17 September 2015, 2 October 2015 and 2 November 2015 of penalties for failure to nominate a driver for the relevant penalty notices.
Mr Arnott submits that none of these penalties was properly payable by FAL HB and FAL Retail and that they should all have been paid by Mr Xenos directly or, alternatively, by the driver of the vehicle. Mr Arnott submits that there was no corporate benefit to FAL HB and FAL Retail from paying the fines; and that payment was to their detriment because it concealed the identity of the relevant driver from the Office of State Revenue which led to the imposition of substantial additional penalties. Mr Arnott submits that Mr Xenos either authorised, procured or failed to prevent these payments from occurring and, by doing so, he breached his duties to FAL HB and FAL Retail. It is not necessary to determine whether the payment of one or two such penalties may have been consistent with a director's or officer's duties, where payments of penalties on this scale were, in my view, a plain contravention of such duties, whether or not Mr Xenos personally had committed the relevant traffic offences.
In my view, these transactions would not have been implemented or permitted by a director or chief executive officer who exercised the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if he or she was a director or officer of a corporation in FAL HB's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within FAL HB as, Mr Xenos. Mr Xenos also did not exercise his powers or discharge his duties in respect of these transactions in FAL HB's and FAL Retail's best interests or for a proper purpose, and Mr Xenos' involvement with the transactions as director or officer of FAL HB involved the improper use of his position to gain an advantage at least for Fence All and to cause detriment to FAL HB and FAL Retail. FAL HB and FAL Retail are entitled to succeed in its claims against Mr Xenos under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and at general law in respect of these transactions. There is no evidence of adequate or specific disclosure of these transactions to the shareholders in FAL HB or FAL Retail and, specifically, to FAL Arabia or its Chairman to establish any basis for a defence of ratification.

Application of funding for Saudi Arabian and Malaysian factories
FAL HB and FAL Retail also seek to recover losses alleged to have resulted from an alleged misapplication of the funding provided for equipment for factories in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, totalling EUR898,254.78. This claim is founded on an alleged breach of [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) by Mr Xenos and it is pleaded in an abbreviated fashion as follows: . In or about July 2014, Mr Xenos, on behalf of the FAL Group and/or the
FAL Entities, arranged for [FAL Arabia] and [FAL Malaysian entity] to enter into three agreements with [FB Propak] for the supply and assembly of machines and goods in Malaysia.  . Pursuant to the Propak Agreements, FAL HB or FAL Retail were required to provide [FB Propak] with letters of credit to secure the supply of machinery and goods.  . By reason of Mr Xenos' conduct, FAL HB and FAL Retail failed to provide [FB Propak] with letters of credit to secure the supply of machinery and goods or otherwise appropriately utilise funds provided to FAL Retail by
FAL Arabia for the purposes of the Propak Agreements.  . Further, by reason of Mr Xenos' conduct, [FAL Arabia] and [FAL
Malaysian entity] remained indebted to [FB Propak] for outstanding sums pursuant to the Propak Agreements.
The conduct of Mr Xenos to which FAL HB and FAL Retail refer in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim is not particularised to those paragraphs, which were particularised by a list of documents without identification of any matters of fact that were to be drawn from them, and my attention was not drawn to any other particulars that were provided in respect of those paragraphs. The relevance of paragraph 41 is also somewhat unclear, since neither FAL Arabia nor FAL Foods and Beverages Malaysia is party to these proceedings; there is no suggestion that FAL HB or FAL Retail were their agents in any formal sense; and any loss that they, as distinct from FAL HB or FAL Retail, suffered cannot found a claim for damages by FAL HB or FAL Retail in these proceedings.
Paragraphs 64 and 66 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim in turn plead a breach of contract and a breach of fiduciary duty by Mr Xenos in respect of the matters pleaded in, inter alia, paragraphs 38-41 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, although Mr Arnott did not press this claim on that basis in submissions. Paragraph 68 potentially extended the claim for breach of Mr Xenos' statutory duties under [ss 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html)-[182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) in respect of these matters, pleading that "some or all" of the matters pleaded in a range of paragraphs of the Further Amended Statement of Claim breached those duties. Mr Arnott limited this claim in submissions to a breach of [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the corresponding general law duty.
Mr Arnott opened the case in respect of the claim as to FB Propak in oral submissions as follows: "Mr Xenos was required to obtain a letter of credit for the amount [of the third instalment payable to FB Propak] the idea being the money would come into the account into Australia, be used as security to obtain the letter of credit from an Australian bank, which would then be used to pay the vendor under the contract. Mr Xenos told his superiors that he had obtained the letter of credit. In fact, he did not, and what thereafter happened was that the money that was sent here for the purposes of securing that payment was disbursed, partly to Propak, but largely to other things, such that there is a deficit left in the amount in that account that has to be made up. A further payment was made by FAL Arabia for the fourth instalment into the same account, and those funds, again, were disbursed by Mr Xenos, partly to [FB]
Propak, and partly elsewhere, and this left a deficiency, after Mr Xenos' resignation of the amount of ... 898,254.78. 
We say this was a breach of Mr Xenos' duty of care this way. The contracting parties under the Propak agreements were FAL Arabia and [FB]
Propak, and FAL Arabia procured FAL Retail, or FAL HB, to effectively act as its payment agent and facilitate the payments, and money was given to those entities for the specific purpose of making those payments. Those entities then disbursed the money, and the person who actually did that was Mr Xenos.
This has left a deficiency that has had to be made up in some other way and that is a breach of Mr Xenos' duties to those companies, being FAL HB and FAL
Retail, to properly perform the role of payment agent that they were procured to pay." (T27-T28).
This submission makes clear that the only claim made against Mr Xenos in this respect is under [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the corresponding duty at general law and not for breach of the proper purposes duty under [s 181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or in respect of any allegation that he conferred an improper benefit upon himself or caused detriment to FAL HB or FAL Retail under [s 182](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s182.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or for a breach of trust, procuring a breach of trust, or a breach of fiduciary duty owed by Mr Xenos to FAL HB or FAL Retail.
Mr O'Connor responded, in opening, to the claim in respect of the funds advanced for the letters of credit to be provided to FB Propak by submitting that: "... what may become apparent from the evidence is that the funds were - well, to the extent that they were paid - were transferred to a FAL entity and they have been used by FAL for the benefit of FAL and not as opposed to transactions or any evidence that those transactions were transferred or moved elsewhere for the benefit of Mr Xenos." (T35)
The matters on which the Plaintiffs rely for this claim are set out largely in Mr Refaat's evidence and in documentation. Mr Refaat gave evidence of the development of a proposal that FAL Arabia develop a new factory in Malaysia which would produce juice, ice cream and coffee, and of funding provided by FAL Arabia to FAL HB in payments of USD 150,000 in July 2014 and USD 650,000 in August 2014 to fund construction works in Malaysia. Mr Refaat referred to steps undertaken by Mr Xenos to identify premises in Malaysia at which the factory could be built and to dealings with FB Propak for the supply of equipment and assembly of machines at the Malaysian and Saudi Arabian factories. In May 2015, FAL Arabia entered a series of agreements with FB Propak for the supply of equipment for the factories in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia (Ex P6, [182], [183] and [184]). Mr Refaat also referred to the steps that were to be taken to fund a third instalment to be paid to FB Propak, by way of commercial letters of credit, which was to involve the payment of EUR 3,961,094.31 into an account held by FAL Retail with NAB and the issue of a letter of credit by NAB in favour of FB Propak's Australian bank. Mr Refaat also refers to further dealings with Mr Xenos and FB Propak in respect of the provision of those letters of credit.
On 20 May 2015 FB Propak sought immediate payment of invoices relating to the equipment, referring to difficulties with payment that had continued over several months, although I am conscious that the agreements noted above had just been executed. Mr Refaat then sent an email to Mr Xenos seeking an explanation how a claim for immediate payment had come about where the contract provided for the third payment by letter of credit (Ex P6, 1956). By email dated 27 May 2015, Mr Xenos advised Mr Refaat of a possible solution to the difficulties with obtaining letters of credit, by which NAB could open a Euro account, funds could be deposited into that account and NAB would then issue commercial letters of credit (Ex P6, 1962).
Mr Refaat then sought authority for a transfer of funds by FAL Arabia to FAL Retail on the basis set out in an email dated 28 May 2015 from Mr Refaat to the Chairman of FAL Arabia, which noted that FB Propak's bank had not accepted letters of credit proposed to be issued by FAL Arabia's bank in Saudi Arabia; that FB Propak was seeking payment for equipment prior to delivery, which would bring the total payment to 95% of the amount due to FP Propak; that FAL Arabia needed to ensure that FB Propak complied with the terms of the contracts, and did not recommend payment in advance; and that: "We then recommend to open the [letters of credit] in Australia through our
Bank with FAL[HB]. Tim [Xenos] confirmed that [FB] Propak's Bank [Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ("ANZ")] will accept the same [letters of credits] if issued in Australia. The cost of issuance of the [letters of credit] is within the [letters of credit] fees range in [Saudi Arabia]." 
That request was approved by FAL Arabia's Chairman on that date and that approval was communicated by Mr Refaat to Mr Xenos on 28 May 2015 (Ex P6, ).
FAL Arabia subsequently transferred the amount of EUR 3,961,094.31 to FAL Retail, in an account with NAB, on 9 June 2015 (Ex P6, 1973). In his third affidavit dated 27 February 2017, Mr Xenos refers, inter alia, to a telephone conversation with a representative of FB Propak in mid-2015 and a further conversation with representatives of FAL Arabia following that conversation. Further correspondence followed between Mr Xenos and FAL Saudi Arabia as to the form of the letters of credit and, by email dated 14 July 2015, FAL Arabia advised Mr Xenos of its approval for the issue of seven letters of credit (Ex P6, 2032). By email dated 29 July 2015 (Ex P6, 2043), Mr Xenos followed up with FAL Arabia as to when the deposit payment for part of the equipment would be made and advised that: "The equipment is now on the water, and the L[etters of] C[redit] have been issued, so equipment is almost ready." 
In cross-examination, Mr Xenos sought to explain that email as relating to the issue of draft rather than final letters of credit. I do not accept that explanation.
Mr Xenos accepted in cross-examination that some payments made out of the account in which monies were received from FAL Arabia to fund the letters of credit were made to FB Propak and other payments were made for other purposes on his authority, including transfers to FAL HB's operating account and payments to external third parties (T342). Mr Xenos did not accept that the payments were not authorised on the basis that the only purpose for which the money in the account was to be used was for paying FB Propak or that he had failed to comply with the direction given by FAL Arabia to obtain a letter of credit with respect to the third instalment (T342).
Mr Refaat refers in his affidavit evidence to concerns which he raised with FAL Arabia's Chairman in September 2015 about Mr Xenos and funding deviations from FAL HB's budgets. Nonetheless, a fourth instalment in respect of the FB Propak arrangements in the amount of EUR 345,427.75 was transferred by FAL Arabia to FAL HB in December 2015 (Ex P6, 1992, 2539). Mr Refaat also refers in his affidavit evidence to the circumstances in which he later travelled to Malaysia to inspect the Malaysian factory and to matters which arose from that visit. In February 2016, it emerged that amounts forwarded by FAL Arabia had not been applied to acquire letters of credit in favour of FB Propak. FB Propak then advised FAL Arabia that Mr Xenos had claimed he could not organise a letter of credit between NAB and ANZ and that an amount of EUR 552,827.02 had been paid, on the basis that the balance would be paid down each week which had not occurred (Ex P6, 2739). A statement of account issued by FB Propak as at 1 February 2016 (Ex P6, 2760) recorded the amount of EUR 156,749.80 as outstanding in respect of the Saudi Arabian project, amounts of the third and fourth instalments of EUR 339,808.18 and EUR 149,947.25 as outstanding in respect of the Malaysian juice, ice cream and coffee roasting project and instalments three and four in the amounts of EUR 213,018.85 and EUR 38,730.70 as outstanding in respect of the Malaysian coffee capsule project. On that basis, a total amount of EUR 898,254.78 was not applied by Mr Xenos to the letters of credit or to payment to FB Propak. FAL Retail submits that its loss arises because it received money from FAL Arabia for the purpose of procuring letters of credit to pay the amounts payable under the agreements with FB Propak which was not applied for that purpose.
Mr Refaat was cross-examined as to the application of funds provided to FAL HB for equipment to be purchased for the factories in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. His evidence was that, when Mr Xenos resigned in January 2016, the supply of equipment for the factories was not completed and that steps were then taken by FAL Arabia to complete the factories and obtain the equipment that had not been supplied (T85). Mr Refaat's evidence in cross-examination was that the amount of EUR 898,254.78 that had been sent to FAL Retail, and which FB Propak advised Mr Refaat had not been paid to it, after Mr Xenos' resignation (EX P6, 2758) was subsequently paid by FAL Arabia to FB Propak (T86).
Mr Arnott submits that Mr Xenos' failure to make the payments to FB Propak in accordance with the instructions given to him was a breach [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the corresponding general law duty, which was aggravated by his statement that he had procured a letter of credit when he had not, and that Mr Xenos is liable to compensate FAL Retail for the deficit of EUR 898,254.78.
In response to this claim, Mr O'Connor submits that there is no or insufficient evidence that funds provided to FAL Retail for the purpose of payment to FB Propak were used, in part or whole, to Mr Xenos' benefit, or other than for the benefit of FAL HB or FAL Retail; that Mr Xenos' evidence was that various funds provided were deposited into accounts of FAL HB and FAL Retail; and that there would be double-counting in allowing relief on this basis, if the funds that were provided to FAL Retail have been used to fund the impugned transactions involving Mr Xenos. Mr Xenos also relies on Mr Refaat's evidence that the Malaysian factory is expected to be operational by June 2017; that the equipment to be acquired from FB Propak was ultimately supplied and will be used in the factory; and the statement of account was ultimately paid by further funds provided by FAL Arabia. Mr Xenos contends that FAL Group has had the benefit of such equipment and that the loss or damage claimed was not suffered. To some extent, that submission focuses on the position of FAL Arabia since it, or the entities that own the relevant factory, will have the benefit of the relevant equipment, albeit in circumstances that FAL Arabia may have paid for it twice, once by amounts advanced to FAL Retail and a second time by the further amounts paid to FB Propak to secure the provision of the equipment. Neither FAL Arabia nor the FAL Group entity which owns the factory is party to these proceedings, or claims any loss in them, and the only relevant question is whether any loss suffered by FAL Retail, or alternatively FAL HB, has been established.
The evidence does not seem to me to establish the allegation in paragraph 38 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim, that Mr Xenos, at least as distinct from FAL Arabia and its management, arranged the entry into the Propak Agreements. The allegation in paragraph 39 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim is that FAL HB or FAL Retail were required either to provide FB Propak with the letters of credit or "otherwise appropriately utilise" the funds provided for the purposes of the Propak Agreements. The pleaded breach of that obligation would therefore require not only that the letters of credit were not provided to FB Propak but also that the funds were not appropriately used for the purposes of those agreements.
To the extent that the allegation raised by paragraph 40 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim) involves a failure by Mr Xenos to obtain the letters of credit, there is little evidence as to why FAL Retail failed to obtain letters of credit from NAB, as Mr Xenos had suggested that it could do, secured by the funds provided by FAL Arabia, and as to whether that was a failure on Mr Xenos' part or arose from difficulties with NAB, FB Propak or FB Propak's bank that were not within Mr Xenos' control. FAL HB and FAL Retail bear the evidentiary onus as to this matter and do not, for example, lead any substantive evidence as to what NAB's or FB Propak's banks' requirements were or that they could have been satisfied by steps reasonably taken by FAL Retail or Mr Xenos. It does not seem to me that an unexplained failure to obtain the letters of credit speaks for itself so as to establish a breach of the statutory or general law duty of care and diligence on Mr Xenos' part, where other explanations of that failure consistent with the exercise of care and diligence by Mr Xenos are open.
To the extent that the pleaded claim (in paragraph 40 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim) is a failure to "otherwise appropriately use the funds", FAL HB and FAL Retail did not identify with any precision how monies paid to FAL Retail were applied and to which third parties payments were made from the funds or for what purpose. I will assume, without deciding, that any payment other than to FB Propak would arguably not be an appropriate use of those funds for the purposes of those agreements, even if it advanced the wider purposes of the development of the Saudi Arabian and Malaysian projects or FAL HB's or FAL Retail's wider business purposes. Even on that assumption, it does not follow that an application of such funds for another proper business purposes of FAL HB or FAL Retail was a breach of Mr Xenos' duties of care and diligence under [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or at general law. The fact that a payment or payments were not made for the purpose that FAL Arabia intended may not establish such a breach, if they were made in the interests of FAL HB or FAL Retail. Whether that is the case would depend on the nature of the particular payments, which were not identified by FAL HB's and FAL Retail's submissions.
It seems to me that the claimed breach of Mr Xenos' duty under [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and the corresponding general law duty has also not been established in respect of these matters. Against the contingency that an appellate court may take a different view as to that question, I turn now to the question of quantification of damages. I recognise that the Court must do the best it can to make a reliable assessment of damages, even where damages are difficult to assess, including where the plaintiff has failed to lead the best evidence of damages: Commonwealth of Australia versus Amann Aviation Pty Ltd <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 64], it seems to me that such a claim is not available where no allegation of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty is put in respect of the dealings with FB Propak.
Even if a breach of [s 180](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or the corresponding general law duty was established, it seems to me that FAL HB and FAL Retail would also need to establish a sufficient evidentiary basis for the Court to form a rational view as to the amount of loss suffered by FAL HB or FAL Retail by the application of funds for another legitimate business purpose and, if the funds were not applied for a legitimate purpose, would need to address the potential duplication in the damages claimed that would arise if that inappropriate utilisation was the payment out of those funds in the impugned transactions for which FAL HB and FAL Retail will recover damages under their other claims. FAL HB and FAL Retail did not adequately address those matters.
In these circumstances, it seems to me that FAL HB and FAL Retail have not established the pleaded breaches in respect of this claim and have also not established an evidentiary basis for the Court to quantify any loss they have suffered and this claim fails.

Orders, costs and referral to regulatory bodies
The parties should bring in agreed short minutes of order, including as to costs, within 14 days and, in the absence of agreement between them, their respective draft short minutes of order and short submissions as to the differences between them.
The matters to which I have referred above include matters that may be of concern to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, so far as Mr Xenos and interests associated with him appear to have received substantial funds while he was apparently bankrupt; it appears that tax returns were not or may not have been lodged by Mr Xenos disclosing the receipt of those amounts; and it appears that false information was provided to Mr Xenos' trustee in bankruptcy and his creditors as to the source of funds made available in respect of his discharge from bankruptcy. Subject to hearing from Mr Xenos, I propose to direct the Registrar to make a copy of this judgment available to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia.
 
Amendments May 2017 - Paragraphs 2, 165 - amounts redacted pending further application.
