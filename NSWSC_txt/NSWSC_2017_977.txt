JUDGMENT
On 5 June 2017 I made interim orders on an application made by the State under the [Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/croa2006246/) in relation to the Defendant: State of New South Wales versus Briar  <case> The summons in the matter was filed on 19 May 2017 and the evidence disclosed that the Defendant had been sentenced on 19 February 2015 to a term of imprisonment which concluded on 20 September 2017.
On that basis, the application made by the State was properly made within the time limitation imposed under [s 6(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/croa2006246/s6.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/croa2006246/). Since the making of the orders, the State has ascertained that the Defendant was sentenced for other matters in the Parkes Local Court on 20 January 2017 to a sentence of imprisonment that expires on 30 November 2017. The result is that the summons filed on 19 May 2017 was filed outside of the last six months period of the offender's current custody or supervision, as [s 6(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/croa2006246/s6.html) requires.
The fault in this matter not being ascertained does not appear to have been with the Crown Solicitor who commenced the proceedings on behalf of the State on the information she was given, but with some department or body which instructs the Crown Solicitor in relation to these applications. It would have to be observed that the failure for the Crown Solicitor properly to be instructed in this matter is to be regretted. The costs to the State of now having to restart the proceedings, as it were, and, if it is thought appropriate to pay the costs thrown away by the Defendant of the need to recommence the proceedings, are costs which should not have needed to be incurred.
Better systems need to be put in place to ensure that at the time of filing a summons in these types of matters the Crown Solicitor has up to date information concerning the sentence a defendant is serving. A further reason is the fact that this Court is obliged to make late adjustments to its listings whenever these matters are filed, often unnecessarily late, to ensure that the final hearing of them occurs at a sufficient time before the expiry of any sentence being served to ensure that, if continuing detention or supervision orders are made, as seamless a transition as is possible occurs.
In the circumstances, the Plaintiff is given leave to discontinue the present proceedings and is given leave to file a fresh summons today commencing proceedings, where the same orders are sought on both an interim and a final basis. It is not proposed that any of the directions which I gave on 5 June 2017 should be altered and nor is it suggested that there is any substantive change to any of the matters which I referred to in my judgment.
Accordingly, leave is given to the Plaintiff to discontinue the existing proceedings.
Leave is given to the Plaintiff to file in Court the summons dated today, together with a notice of motion.
The notice of motion is to be returned instanter.
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 3 to 10 of the short minutes of order.
The parties have liberty to apply to relist on one day's notice.
The Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant's costs thrown away by reason of the discontinuance of the earlier proceedings to which I have referred.
The hearing date of 15 September 2017 is confirmed.
