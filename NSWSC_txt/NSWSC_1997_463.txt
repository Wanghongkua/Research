Deputy Commissioner of Taxation versus Carragher Matter No 14510/95 [1997]
NSWSC 463 (8 October 1997) 
Last Updated: 17 December 1998 `DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION versus ANNE FRANCES CARRAGHER` `14510/95` `8 October 1997` `Callaway AJ` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division` `JUDGMENT: ` `HIS HONOUR: At the outset when this matter was called` on for hearing Mr McGovern for the defendant indicated to me that in relation to the defence based upon the validity of a certain notice and apparently a letter annexed was served therewith, he was aware of the fact that the other director of the company involved, which is known as Aladdin Laundry Pty Ltd,
Mr Gruber, had in fact been the defendant in similar if not identical proceedings heard by Mr Acting Justice Graham on 5 August 1997 and on which Mr
Acting Justice Graham has reserved his decision apparently having indicated that it would be delivered at the end of this month.

Mr O'Brien for the plaintiff is ready to proceed and wishes to do so, understandably, and no doubt it is in the interests of the defendant to have the matter disposed of but it seems to me that in the interests of judicial comity particularly if the decision may affect other cases and particularly if
Mr Acting Justice Graham's decision might be the subject of an appeal, that it would not be in the interests of justice to proceed with the case today.

I am, of course, very reluctant not to proceed with the case but it does seem to me there would be a considerable waste of everybody's time particularly judicial time which is said to be at a premium at the moment and consequently it seems to me there is no alternative but for the matter to be adjourned awaiting the decision in the case of the present plaintiff and Mr Gruber.

Accordingly, it is my view that the matter should not proceed today or, indeed, until that decision referred to above is handed down.

I stand the matter out of today's list for mention again before me after the decision of Mr Acting Justice Graham in the case of Gruber and the Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation and can I leave it to the parties or either of them to inform my Associate when that has happened and thereafter forthwith I will list it for mention either formally or informally for the purpose of obtaining or giving a date for hearing.
