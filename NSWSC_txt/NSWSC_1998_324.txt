The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This judgment concerns the admissibility of similar fact evidence and the coincidence rule dealt with in [s 98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). 
The litigation concerns whether certain representations were made by agents for the lessor of a shopping centre near Gosford to the plaintiff who was intending to take a lease of a shop in the centre for an amusement arcade.

The basal representations alleged are that there would be a cinema complex erected just outside the northern door of the plaintiff's premises and that the major eating area would be just to the south of those premises. It is common ground that there was reference to a cinema complex and that it was proposed by the lessor at that time that the cinema complex be so located.
There was also some mention of the eating area. The representations are said to have been made by Mr Levin, the then Project Leasing Manager of the centre.
The defendant says that what was said was no more than that such was the then current proposal.

The plaintiff filed two affidavits, one by Stephen Paul Monk and the other by
Frederick Wickham.

The affidavit of Mr Monk shows that Ms McLaughlan, another officer of the lessor, said certain words to him (he being the proprietor of a men's hairdressing business in the shopping centre) that a cinema complex would be built within two years, opposite the northern entrance to the boardwalk.

Mr Wickham, who is in a shop down the other end of the shopping centre, gives evidence, among other things, that he had various conversations with Mr Levin about the eating area in the plaintiff's region of the shopping centre and that Mr Levin had said that in about 18 months there will be a multi cinema complex opening up directly opposite the northern entrance to the boardwalk.

The plaintiff says that this material is admissible and to deal with that submission, it is necessary to look at [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s98.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). That Act makes it clear that, generally speaking, this sort of evidence is inadmissible. It is only admissible if there has been notice, or if the Court thinks that the evidence may have significant probative value.

Notice was given in the sense that affidavits were filed last December and the material was set out in the appropriate form. When a person files an affidavit, almost by definition, that person gives notice of his intention to adduce the evidence. However, I have still got to consider that the evidence may show that it has a probative value, or in one case, a significant probative value, to prove the point that the plaintiff wants to prove in the proceedings. In the instant case, the main thrust is that there was a false and misleading representation in trade and commerce.

There is no dispute that some words were said about the cinema complex and the eating area. The real dispute is what were the words that were said and in what context? It seems to me that the fact, if it be the fact, that similar words may have been said by one or more officers of the defendant, to other tenants, is of no probative, or alternatively, no significant probative value in determining the matters I have to consider.

When I considered this matter the other day, Mr Insall, for the defendant, referred me to Aroutsidis versus Illawarra Nominees Pty Limited  <case>; <case>; [(1995) 140 ALR 701.] 
Today Mr Evans, for the plaintiff, has referred me to p 509 of Aroutsidis' case. I do not however, with respect, think the situation dealt with at that page is anything like the situation with which I am dealing. Accordingly, I continue to decline to receive the evidence.

One matter that a trial judge in this sort of case has got to be very careful about, is to make sure that cases do not degenerate into a series of side issues. The present case involves, I think, only about $500,000. That is, of course, a significant sum to most of us. But when one considers the cost of a case which has been set down for ten days, it is probably less than the amount of the costs. The Court's duty is to keep the evidence, as far as possible confined, so that whilst each party can call the evidence it considers appropriate to its case, the Court has to be very careful to make sure that only relevant evidence is admitted and that the issues are confined as much as possible, and it is part of this policy that lies behind <case>.
