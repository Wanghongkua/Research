IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION  
Rothman J  September 2005  /2004  
CEO OF CUSTOMS versus OZZY TYRE & TUBE PTY LTD AND LORENE KHAMIS 
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: Ms Lorene Khamis was the sole director of, and owned 50% of the shares in, Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd (hereinafter "Ozzy"). Ozzy, under the control and at the direction of Ms Khamis, imported 18 shipments of tyres between December 1998 and April 2000. Ozzy brought in tyres on which was payable $328,123.07 duty and sought, through false documents and otherwise, to evade $255,805.34 of that duty.  In the case of each shipment Ozzy produced to Customs through Ozzy's customs broker, paperwork, including an invoice, understating the amount payable by
Ozzy to its overseas supplier of tyres and seeking to have duty calculated on the basis of that understated and falsely invoiced cost.  In some cases, another invoice for the true price was issued but not disclosed to Customs. In all cases the true higher value of the shipment was paid by Ozzy to the overseas supplier. In one case the difference was falsely represented as commission.  On 6 January 2004, Ozzy and Ms Khamis were each charged with offences under the [Customs Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (C'th) and, after initially indicating that the charges would be defended, on 17 May each pleaded guilty to the offences on the basis of an agreement concerning the payment of duty avoided and concerning the requirement to pay any penalty imposed.  The issue for determination is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on each of Ozzy and Ms Khamis and in determining that issue there are a number of matters with which the Court must deal. Within the overall nature of the offence and the necessity to have regard to the principles of sentencing including deterrence, retribution and denunciation, there is the important question of whether the objective seriousness of the offence depends, for purposes relevant to my sentencing discretion, on the amount sought to be evaded. Further, given the nature of the different offences there is a real question raised as to whether, and if so to what degree, there is overlapping criminal conduct. Within the issues to be taken into account when considering the subjective circumstances of the offender is whether, in the case of Ms
Khamis, the Count is entitled, and if so to what extent, to have regard to good character, if found, in an offence of this kind. Lastly, the Court is faced with an agreement between the parties concerning, in part, the enforcement of any pecuniary penalty I impose.  
Objective Seriousness of the Offences  In dealing with the objective seriousness of the offences with which Ozzy and Ms Khamis are charged, it is necessary to determine whether the amount of duty sought to be evaded affects the objective seriousness. Before doing so it is necessary to describe the facts of each offence, the structure of the relevant parts of the statute and determine the necessity for deterrence, retribution and denunciation.  
Facts of Each Offence  Ozzy is a corporation that carries on the business of importing car tyres, wheels and parts. It operates a warehouse at Hoxton Park and a retail outlet at Bexley.  Ms Khamis is, as already stated, the sole director of Ozzy and has been since 3 December 1991. Prior to that time, her brother and mother were directors. Ms Khamis also owned 50% of the share capital of Ozzy and at all relevant times managed its business and was responsible for the relevant dealings with customs agents relating to the importations which were the subject of the charges.  Between 18 December 1998 and 10 April 2000, Ozzy imported 18 shipments of tyres, wheels and car parts from two suppliers; Sunshine Industries Limited based in Japan and Heston Trading Pty Ltd based in Singapore.  In respect of each of the 18 shipments, Ms Khamis on behalf of Ozzy produced an invoice to Customs, through Ozzy's customs broker, for the purpose of having the shipments entered for home consumption. The amount of this invoice was represented to Customs as being invoice price and transaction value for the purposes of calculating the amount of duty payable upon the importation of the goods.  In each case, however, the invoice disclosed to the customs broker and
Customs significantly understated the amount paid by the first defendant to the supplier, either for the goods or for the goods and commission. The first defendant in fact paid the suppliers of the relevant shipment consideration that exceeded the amount disclosed. That additional amount was not disclosed to Customs.  In some cases (shipments 1, 2, 3, 7 and 18) the supplier produced an additional invoice that included the additional consideration. In one case (shipment 1) the additional invoice described the additional consideration as a "handling and communication" fee or commission. This additional "commission" invoice was not produced to Customs. In other cases, the additional invoice simply disclosed the total larger consideration. The additional "commission" was a price related cost.  Because in each case the additional consideration was part of the price of the goods, or was a price related cost, it ought to have been disclosed to
Customs. Because the additional consideration was not disclosed to Customs,
Customs calculated the transaction value and hence customs value of the shipments only on the basis of the price disclosed in the invoice that was produced to Customs. As a result, significant duty was evaded in respect of each of the shipments.  By consenting to convictions being entered in respect of each of the shipments, the defendants acknowledge that the additional payments were not a buying commission and therefore should have been disclosed to Customs as part of the price or price related cost for each of the shipments.  
Shipment One  On or before 18 December 1998, Ozzy ordered the first shipment of goods from Sunshine Industries and paid Sunshine Industries $55,160.67. A commercial invoice in the amount of $14,156.28 was produced to a customs broker to arrange the entry of the first shipment of the goods into home consumption.  Customs duty in the sum of $2,123.44 was calculated on the false customs value and was paid by Ozzy.  As a result of the understatement of the customs value on the entry, Ozzy evaded payment of no less than $6,150.66 in duty.

Scheme of the Act  The offences with which Ozzy and Ms Khamis have been charged require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, although, by specific provision [(s.247)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) the prosecutions are conducted in accordance with the civil procedures of the
Court. (See CEO Customs versus Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd <case>; [(2004) 216 CLR 161)]  A combination of the operation of [s.155](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s155.html), s.[159](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s159.html) and s.[161](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) makes clear that the value of the imported goods for the purposes associated with imposing duty is their customs value which is the transaction value of imported goods. (see sub-sections 159(1) and (2) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)) The transaction value is the amount equal to the sum of their adjusted price in the import sales transactions [(s.161](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)) where price is defined as all payments that have been made directly or indirectly by the purchaser to the vendor or to persons related to the vendor [(s.161](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s161.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)) and includes buying commission [(s.155](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s155.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)). Thus the device of seeking to transfer some amount from the purchase price to a buying commission is a device which has no effect on the amount of duty that is payable.  In analysing the offences with which each of the offenders is charged, it is necessary to understand that "smuggling" means "any importation ... of goods with intent to defraud the revenue." Each of the defendants have been charged with eighteen counts of smuggling contrary to [s.233(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and eighteen counts of making false statements contrary to [s.234(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/).  [Section (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) makes it an offence to "smuggle any goods" which, from the above, necessarily involves an intention to defraud the revenue. [Section (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) of the Act makes it an offence to "evade payment of any duty which is payable" and [s.234(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) makes it an offence to make a statement intentionally to an officer either reckless as to the fact that the statement is false or knowing that the information is misleading in a material particular. As can be seen from the summary of the offences the contravention of [s.233(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) and s.[234](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html)(1)(a) necessarily involves significantly overlapping criminal conduct and it is difficult to envisage a situation where someone evaded duty that was payable without committing the offence of smuggling. On the other hand the making of a false statement under [s.234(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) is not necessarily involved in the offence of smuggling but has overlapping features with the offence of evading payment of duty. It seems that both the offence under [s.233(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233.html) and s.[234](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html)(1)(d) are partly the means by which, in the current circumstances, the offence under [s.234(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) is committed. Therefore there is a significant amount of overlapping criminality in the different offences. There seems to be little or no overlapping as between the different sets of offences relating to each of the eighteen different shipments. Each requires a new and different intention, a new and different act of smuggling and a new and different act of dishonesty.  The penalties made applicable to the offences with which each of the defendants is charged are set out in [s.233AB](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233ab.html) and s.[234](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). The offence of smuggling is set out in [s.233AB(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s233ab.html) of the Act and, in the circumstances known in these proceedings, is a penalty not exceeding five times the amount of duty that would have otherwise been payable on the smuggled goods.  In relation to the offence of evading duty, [s.234(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) provides for a penalty not exceeding five times the amount of the duty on the goods which would have been evaded if the evasion of duty had been successful and not less than two times that amount.  The offence of making a false statement carries a penalty under [s.234(2)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s234.html) of a penalty not exceeding 100 penalty units or, under the terms of sub- section 234(3) a penalty not exceeding 50 penalty units, or $5,500.00, together with twice the amount of duty payable on the goods.  The temptation in relation to an offence of this kind is to determine the seriousness of the offence largely based on the amount of money involved in the deception. However the Parliament has established a regime which covers a wide range of activity and has, quite deliberately, fixed the penalties (both minimum and maximum) by reference to the amount of money involved in the criminal conduct. As a consequence, the legislature has cleverly built in a factor relating to seriousness by making the penalties directly proportionate to the amounts involved in the criminal conduct. To take account, once more, of the amount involved in the criminal conduct would be to double count that factor in the fixing of the ultimate penalty.  As earlier stated, the offences in question cover a range of activity. At one extreme, the smuggling and evasion offences cover the tourist who seeks to bring into Australia liquor, tobacco and/or gifts beyond that which is allowable under the regulations. The circumstances of the offences would include persons who evade duty without any commercial interest or intent.
Further, the offences include the importation of goods and associated acts in relevant circumstances where the goods are imported for business interests, but not for the purpose of profiting from the transaction. For example, a business would be guilty of the offences in circumstances where duty was evaded on goods brought in to equip better its facilities or staff. On the other hand, the offences in question, do not cover the importation of goods that are banned. Drug offences are dealt with quite separately and involve quite different penalties. In those circumstances, a situation such as the present, where a company and/or person are involved in the operation of a business which earns profit from the resale of goods imported into Australia, necessitates the view that the offences in question, once committed, are the exercise of a commercial decision to profit out of the deception of Customs and the taxpayer. The circumstances of the commission of such an offence have, in themselves, no redeeming qualities. Moreover, as has been stated for almost as long as the customs legislation has been in force (see R versus Lyon <case>; [(1906) 3 CLR 770)], the imposition of heavy penalties for offences of this kind is necessary given the nature of the offence and the conduct in question. To allow an importer of goods to be required to pay only that which has been evaded in duty imposes no disincentive on the repetition of the offence and, more importantly, provides a commercial incentive on seeking to evade the duty. I will, later in this judgment, deal with the nature of the agreement reached which gave rise to the consent to the orders that the sections had been contravened.  It is essential, in dealing with a commercial enterprise that has made profits to which it was not entitled by the evasion of duty and the commission of these offences to impose condign punishment which properly reflects the denunciation of the conduct, the retribution that society needs to impose and properly establishes a deterrent for any other like minded entity or person from committing similar offences.  The circumstances of the commission of these offences were such that the corporate and personal defendants involved themselves in the utilisation of two sets of accounts, one of them false, the deliberate understatement of the price paid for goods, the planned and pre-meditated determination that it was in their commercial interests to commit an offence and perpetrated these offences over a significant period of time.  The practical restrictions on the capacity of law enforcement agencies to apprehend every offender for every offence necessarily requires the legislature and the courts to ensure that deceitful conduct in a commercial enterprise, once determined, is appropriately punished. The courts must ensure that there is a deterrent to the commission of such offences by persons acting in a commercial enterprise and not allow the deception to occasion only that which would be required to be paid if the offenders behaved as the law requires. In R versus Lyon, supra, O'Connor J said:  "... it is one of the underlying principles of the Act that the Government should rely upon the importer to honestly state the truth according to his knowledge in reference to a matter in which he knows everything and the
Customs authorities know nothing. In the case of the duties payable ad valorem if the Customs authorities took steps in each case to satisfy themselves of the value of the goods for duty before allowing them to land, trade would be seriously hampered. Almost of necessity they must take the importer's statement of value prima facie as true. The policy of the Act, therefore, is that the Customs authorities trust to the statement of the person importing the goods."  I repeat the oft quoted passage from Kitto J L. Vogel and Son Pty Ltd v
Anderson, Minister for State for Customs and Exports for the Commonwealth of
Australia (1967) 120 CLR 157 at 164:  "The duty evaded has now been paid, and I understand that when the evasions were discovered, the defendant's gave the Customs every assistance in their investigations. But when all the considerations relied upon by the defendants have been given due attention, the case still cannot be regarded as other than a serious one. Not only are the defendants guilty of a sustained course of conscious wrong-doing, but the offences are in a field in which punishments for deliberate offences must be severe. The Customs laws represent the judgment of Parliament upon an important aspect of the economic organisation of the community and the object of the penal provisions is to make that judgment as effective as possible. It is important to remember that Customs officers have of practical necessity to rely extensively upon the information supplied to them by importers, for the flow of commerce could not be maintained if every importation had to be fully investigated. Moreover, detection of frauds is not always easy. No doubt ordinary conceptions of honesty and of civic responsibility suffice to ensure a great deal of fair dealing with the Customs but for some people little seems to matter but fear of the consequences of discovery. The [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) makes those consequences potentially drastic. It is for the courts to make them, in suitable cases, drastic in fact, for otherwise traders who are not saved by qualms of conscience from willingness to defraud their fellow citizens may weigh the profits they hope for against the penalties they have cause to fear and find the gamble worthwhile."  On appeal to the Full Court, the High Court said (120 CLR at 168):  "As already appears, these penalties were in each case the equivalent of four times the duty evaded whilst the minimum penalty was imposed in respect of each of the remaining charges. ... There is, in our view, no room for the suggestion that in fixing the penalties on these charges his Honour erred on any matters of principle; the argument merely is that penalties were excessive in the circumstances. But his Honour's reasons make it plain why penalties of this magnitude were imposed and amply demonstrate the need for such penalties."  In the circumstance of the commission of these offences and taking no account for this purpose of the amounts involved, I would assess the criminality of the conduct as above mid range of penalties. I, of course, will and do take account of the overlapping criminal conduct associated with the three different kinds of offences relating to each of the eighteen shipments.  
Subjective Circumstances  There is little or nothing that can be said that would differentiate the company, Ozzy, from Ms Khamis in objective features. As already stated, both defendants pleaded guilty, or, more accurately, consented to findings of contravention when the matter was listed for hearing on the substantive matters. This was the first time that the defendants had pleaded guilty and each had, before that, maintained the right to defend the proceedings. The defendants are not and cannot be the subject of any penalty for maintaining a right, sacrosanct in the law, of putting the Customs to proof. Indeed, they are entitled to the benefits of their guilty plea, although not at the highest level, given that the plea was entered at a later time than could have been the case. Notwithstanding that the plea was entered on the day on which the matter was set down for hearing, there were obviously negotiations between
Customs and the defendants in relation to the plea which gave rise to the agreement, in writing, and the agreed statement of facts. In the circumstances
I propose to allow a 15% discount in sentencing for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Amongst other factors involved in that discount is that the proceedings and the documentation provided to the Court, while showing a relatively strong case for the Customs, may have been difficult to prove in relation to every single incident and each valuation. Further, the complexity of the documentation and the transactions which they evidence would have made the substantive hearing of the matter a lengthy and complicated proceeding which would have occasioned considerable cost to both parties a significant part of which would have been irrecoverable.  Ms Khamis swore an affidavit which was put before me and the first twelve paragraphs of which were read. Ms Khamis was not cross examined on the affidavit.  Her personal circumstances are that the business, Ozzy Tyre & Tube Pty
Ltd, was originally started by her father and was run out of a service station. He had a partner and, quite separately, there are suggestions that some of the difficulties faced by Ms Khamis were associated with wrong-doing, either moral or legal, associated with the resolution of issues of property ownership which arose on the death of her father.  Her father immigrated from Lebanon to Australia in approximately 1970 and worked as a factory hand, a taxi driver and ultimately bought the service station which formed the basis for the Ozzy business. He had, originally, a partner, who left the business in about 1990 and then ran the business together with another person. In 1991, Ms Khamis' father died whilst in
Lebanon from a bomb explosion in a car in which he was travelling. Up until that time, Ms Khamis had nothing to do with the running of the Ozzy business, but from the time of the tragic death of her father, was required to start work there. The business was run by his then partner and Ms Khamis did the clerical work including answering phones, filing invoices, depositing money and running errands.  For reasons associated with the needs of the family, as the eldest child,
Ms Khamis was required to forsake any independent career in order to run the business and support the family. It was in these circumstances that Ms Khamis became involved in the business and suffered the pressure placed upon her as a young woman by the need to ensure the security and living expenses of her entire family. In 1991 Ms Khamis was 18 years of age and necessarily felt that pressure and reacted to it in ways that a more mature and experienced person may not have.  It is rare, if not exceptional, for good character to be taken into account in "white collar crimes". Generally it is the very good character of the offender that has enabled the offender to perpetrate the crime. However, in circumstances such as the present where, in extremely tragic circumstances, a young girl has been required to undertake the pressures of running a business and supporting her mother and siblings, the character of the offender can not be ignored and she is entitled to understanding of the circumstances that gave rise to the pressure to make a profit and no doubt contributed to her succumbing to involvement in criminal activity. Ms Khamis effectively took over the business from 1995, at the age of 22.  Further, the plea of guilty itself shows a degree of remorse and contrition for the conduct that has been committed. It is implicit in the foregoing that Ms Khamis has no criminal record which is a matter I also take into account in fixing the sentence.  
The Agreement between the Parties  The parties reached agreement which was tendered to the Court, the essence of which was that the duty that had otherwise been avoided has been paid to
Customs. It also provides for the declarations and orders of contravention and for the Court to impose a penalty. It recites, for which there is evidence before the Court, that the corporate and personal defendant are impecunious, or were, once the unpaid duty had been paid. The CEO of Customs, under that agreement, has agreed to accept the amount of the unpaid duty as full settlement and in full and final satisfaction of the duty, cost and penalties fixed by the Court. The CEO has undertaken not to enforce the balance of the judgment sum. The agreement further allows, if the CEO considers "on reasonable facts at any time" that the information as to impecuniosity contained in the affidavit of Ms Khamis "is materially incorrect at the date of its making", the CEO to be at liberty to terminate the agreement and take such proceedings to recover the balance of any judgment sum. The nature of this agreement causes me some concern. I do not by that suggest any impropriety or inappropriate conduct on the part of either the CEO of Customs or any Customs officer or the defendants or their legal representatives. The concern, rather is more fundamental as to the role of the Court in circumstances of the making of such an agreement. The further concern is the purpose and effect of the legislative scheme to which reference has already been made.  I have been referred to a number of cases that deal with similar agreements. (see CEO Customs versus Red Dale Holdings Pty Ltd <case> at <case> - [10];
CEO Customs versus Corniche Motors Pty Ltd <case> at <case> - [6])  I am grateful to the parties for providing the agreement which was essential for the sake of transparency and ensuring that the Court is apprised of the situation before it. Not to provide the agreement to the Court would have been quite inappropriate and improper. Nevertheless there are differences between the principle (see Red Dale and Corniche Motors above) of settling a customs prosecution on a commercial basis and the problems associated with the agreement now before the Court. There is no doubt that a customs prosecution may be settled on a commercial basis "without breaching the policy of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) or the administration of the criminal law or in any way detracting from the discretion of the court with regard to sentencing a person upon conviction in proceedings under the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)." This agreement, however, asks the Court to impose penalties in circumstances where those penalties, it is agreed, will not be enforced, except where the agreement precluding their enforcement has been obtained, essentially, by fraud.  I make it clear that the above is not a criticism of the agreement as reached, nor is it intended to be a criticism of the need of Customs to take into account impecuniosity in determining its future conduct. Ultimately every order for a penalty can be enforced or not enforced as the party capable of enforcing it determines. The agreement allows the Court to disregard questions of impecuniosity in determining the penalty. However, the agreement has the effect that there is no penalty, as a matter of practice, imposed upon either the corporate or the personal defendant. In this day and age when corporate entities are capable of being conducted in a way which ensures their impecuniosity and personal defendants are capable of obtaining benefits to which they are not legally entitled, there are significant policy issues associated with an agreement of this kind. I am not here suggesting that the circumstances of this case in any way mirror such a situation. But it is possible, at least hypothetically, for a commercial entity to embark upon the kind of conduct described in these offences and to do so in a way which would ensure the corporate entity would be impecunious and unable to pay any subsequent penalty imposed by the Court. Similarly, it is not beyond the realms of imagination, to extrapolate from current circumstances, for a family member entrusted to run that business to be wholly impecunious yet the entirety of the family may have benefited from the criminal conduct. I repeat, there is nothing in the factual material before this Court in these cases, which would suggest such a situation here. These comments are intended to be far more general. The difficulty with which Customs is faced is that by their very nature, a penalty which is confined to a pecuniary penalty will, in the case of impecuniosity, be problematic. It may be that the legislature needs to consider seriously the capacity, in the case of impecuniosity or inappropriateness of pecuniary penalty, for other penalties to apply. I do not here suggest that full time imprisonment would be appropriate, but some form of community service either with or without supervision and/or restrictions on movement, or other kind of penalty, should be included in the range of penalties available so that persons who perpetrate criminal offences of this kind can be the subject of a practical punishment which, in turn, would have the added benefit of repaying society with the assets of intelligence and hard work which, for example, the personal defendant in this matter, clearly has.  Having considered the above, I do not feel that there is anything in the agreement which would preclude the Court from imposing a penalty it would otherwise consider appropriate and, in the circumstances, proceed so to do.
Indeed I welcome the attitude of the parties and their legal representatives which enabled a commercial resolution but lament the lack of alternate options which would allow the Court to impose condign punishment.  In fixing the penalty I have taken into account all of the matters discussed above. In relation to the principle of totality of sentencing, as explained by the High Court in Mill <case>; <case>; [(1998) 194 CLR 610], I intend to fix penalties in the less severely punishable offences and then adjust the more severe penalty downward to take account of the total criminal conduct and the overlapping elements of that conduct.  As a matter of ease of calculation I shall utilise the facility provided by [s.4K(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s4k.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (C'th) impose one penalty for each of the three contraventions of the Act for each defendant. In doing so each penalty will take account of the eighteen shipments.  In the schedule of available penalties subsequently provided to the Court by Customs, the penalties in relation to the making of a false statement and smuggling are calculated on the total duty payable. Given the definition of "smuggling" to which reference has already been made and the context of s.233 and s.233AB(1)(a) it seems that the calculation should be based upon "the duty evaded" and/or the excess value (i.e. the true value less the declared value) of the goods as this duty or these goods are the only part of the importation for which the duty is sought to be evaded and/or for which there is an intention to defraud the revenue. Further, my construction of s.233AB(1) requires a minimum penalty for the offence of smuggling of twice the amount of duty that would have been payable and was not.  I shall include in the orders penalties of the defendants of the following order and calculated in the following manner:  
First Defendant: Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd 
False Statement (18 offences)  (Total duty payable: $328,123.07)  $3,000 + $400,000  less 15%: $342,400 
Smuggling (18 offences)  (Total duty on smuggled goods: $255,805.34)  times duty: $1,023,221.30  less 15%: $869,738.10 
Evasion (18 offences) - (Total duty evaded: $255,805.34)  times duty: $1,023,221.30  less 15%: $869,738.10  less allowance for overlapping criminal activity from (i) and (ii) (say 25%) 
Total fine for evasion: $566,738.10  
I then make a further allowance, of a small kind, to take account of the subjective factors associated with the corporate defendant including the lack of prior convictions and set the penalties at: 
False Statements: $325,000 
Smuggling: $850,000 
Evasion: $550,000  
Second Defendant: Ms Lorene Khamis 
The calculations for the second defendant are the same as the first, but I allow for the subjective factors to a far greater degree because such factors include not only the lack of prior conviction but the otherwise good character of Ms Khamis and the circumstances of her personal life which, in part, led to the behaviour. I shall impose the following penalties: 
False Statements (18 offences): $250,000 
Smuggling (18 offences): $750,000 
Evasion (18 offences): $512,000  The total effective fines imposed are:  on Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd: $1,725,000  on Ms Lorene Khamis: $1,512,000
