EX TEMPORE Judgment 
I have been asked to disqualify myself as a result of a comment made in the course of delivering an ex tempore judgment on an interlocutory basis with respect to the admission or non-admission in evidence of two expert reports.  
In refusing the application to allow that evidence to be adduced, there were a number of bases on which I based my decision. One basis was that there had been an arrangement struck between the first plaintiff and the ATO to pay a debt at $100 a week while this dispute was still in train.  
I have been told that in so doing I made reference to an affidavit that has not yet been read.  
I do not regard that as indicating to a reasonable person an apprehension of bias on my part sufficient to cause me to stand down. The reference was only one of a number of bases upon which I made my ruling and it was in relation to an interlocutory matter.  
I am told that the statement will be hotly contested. No doubt I will hear, in due course, the basis of that contest and will be in a position to rule, ultimately, on the issues with which I will be presented.  
I decline the application to stand down.  * * *
