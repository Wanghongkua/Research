ORDER
Appeal dismissed with costs
JUDGE1
KIRBY ACJ This appeal from the Criminal Division of the
Supreme Court (Levine
J) comes pursuant to leave earlier granted. It concerns the meaning of provisions of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/) (Cth) (the Act).
In issue in the appeal is whether a party, which has previously failed to secure relief pursuant to [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act from restraining orders made in respect of its property (which is thereby forfeited to the Commonwealth), may later secure leave to apply for an order providing relief in respect of the forfeited property, pursuant to [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the Act. Levine J held that it might.
The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth (DPP) contests that construction of the Act.
 
Refusal of orders under [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act
On 13 February 1992 Mr Bruce McCauley was arrested and charged with being in possession of not less than a commercial quantity of heroin which was reasonably suspected of being imported to Australia. This was a "serious offence" for the purposes of the Act. See the Act, [s.44(7A).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s44.html) The DPP took proceedings to obtain restraining orders in respect of specified property of
Mr McCauley and of a number of companies in which he was alleged to be concerned and which, it was suggested, he controlled. Logan Park Investments
Pty Ltd and Santa Prisca
Imports Pty Ltd (the respondents) were amongst those companies.
On 28 April 1994, Mr McCauley pleaded guilty before Court DCJ of the substantive offence. He was convicted and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with a 9 year minimum term. He is presently serving that sentence.
By [s.30(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html) of the Act, if a person in the position of Mr McCauley is convicted and a restraining order has been made in respect of property, whether his own or of some other person, and the restraining order is in force at the end of six months after such conviction, the property in question is forfeited to the Commonwealth.
Provision is made by [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act for relief against such forfeiture.
The respondents, together with certain other persons not concerned in the present proceedings, duly made application. That application was heard in the
Criminal Division of the Supreme Court by Loveday AJ. On 21
October 1994, his
Honour made final orders excluding certain property other than that of the respondents from the restraining orders made under the Act. He otherwise dismissed the application of the other parties, including the respondents.
From the orders made by Loveday AJ the respondents appealed to this Court. On October 1994, the Court delivered its judgment. See Logan Park Investments
Pty Ltd and Ors versus Director of Public Prosecutions, Court of Appeal unreported, 27 October 1994; (1994) NSWJB 121. The Court varied some parts of the orders of Loveday AJ in matters not presently material. However, the Court was not persuaded to disturb his Honour's refusal to grant an application for variation of the restraining orders pursuant to [s.48(3)(fa)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act. It was pointed out that Loveday AJ, following Gray versus Official Trustee in Bankruptcy and Ors [(1991) 29 FCR 166], had rejected the contention that the respondents' interests in their property was not "subject to the effective control of the defendant (Mr McCauley)." Various other challenges to Loveday AJ's general conclusions were dismissed insofar as the respondents were concerned.
They failed to obtain the variation of the restraining orders in their favour which they had sought pursuant to [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act. On the following day, 28 October , the respondents' interests in the property the subject of the restraining order were forfeited to the Commonwealth by the operation of [s.30(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html) of the Act. By [s.30(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html) of the Act, the property so forfeited was vested "absolutely in the Commonwealth".
The purpose of the scheme of legislative forfeiture established by the Act and its counterparts in other jurisdictions has been explained in earlier cases. See e.g. Caplin and Drysdale versus United States <case>; [491 US 617]; Director of Public Prosecutions for Commonwealth versus Saxon [(1990) 28 NSWLR 263 (CA)], 519.
On 22 December 1994, the respondents, by summons, sought an order in the
Criminal Division of the Supreme Court pursuant to [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the Act. By [s.31(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the Act leave is required by an applicant seeking relief under [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) where that applicant had previously been given notice of proceedings on the application for the relevant restraining orders or the making of the relevant restraining orders. It was not disputed that the respondents had received such notice. Indeed such notice was the foundation of their earlier unsuccessful application for relief under [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act. Accordingly, their application for leave came on for hearing before Levine J.
It was recorded that the property, the subject of the application for leave, was the same property as had been the subject of the earlier unsuccessful application under [s.48.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) It was accepted, both at first instance and in this Court that the respondents were not themselves in any way involved in the commission of the relevant offence of Mr McCauley. Nor was their property "tainted property" as that expression is defined in [s.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s4.html) of the Act.
By that definition, "tainted property" means property used in, or in connection with, the commission of the offence or the proceeds of the offence.
As described in the earlier judgment of this Court, the property of the respondents comprised a fund of investment moneys allegedly owned by Logan
Park and the equity, or "potential equity", of Santa Prisca in certain properties in
Alexandria, Sydney valued at approximately $4 million, subject to mortgage. The purpose of the summons before Levine J was to enable those two companies to secure leave as the first step on the way to seeking relief against the forfeiture of the property to the
Commonwealth, following the events earlier described.
The DPP asserts that the respondents, having earlier failed in their [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) application, cannot return to make an application for relief under [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the
Act. He says that, upon the correct construction of the Act, a second application is not permissible. Levine J dismissed the
DPP's contention. He provided leave. He stood over to a later hearing date the determination of the merits of the respondents' application.
Before that hearing could take place, the DPP secured leave to appeal which now brings its challenge to this Court.
During argument in this Court a question arose as to whether any issue estoppel might arise from the earlier determination of the application under [s.48.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) This was not a point argued at first instance. In terms of principle, if separate and different statutory rights are afforded by [ss.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) and [48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html), the determination of one would not give rise to an estoppel in respect of the other. In a sense, as was conceded for the DPP, the resolution of the primary question in the appeal determined whether the claim under the two sections was identical giving rise to an effective res judicata or issue estoppel.
 
The relevant legislation
The appeal thus raises a short question of statutory construction concerning the inter-relationship of [ss.41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s41.html) and [38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s38.html) of the Act. Relevantly, [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html), pursuant to which the respondents' earlier unsuccessful application was made, provides: "48(1) Where a court makes a restraining order, the court may, ... at any later time, make any ancillary orders that the court considers appropriate and, without limiting the generality of this, the court may make any one or more of the following orders: an order varying the property to which the restraining order relates; 
An order under subsection (1) may be made on application by: the DPP; the owner;...

Where: a person (in this subsection called the "defendant") has been convicted of ...
an offence; a court, in reliance on the conviction, ... makes a restraining order against property; and a person having an interest in the property applies to the court for a variation of the order to exclude the person's interest from the order; the court shall grant the application if.
 where the applicant is not the defendant and the restraining order was made by virtue of [subsection 44(7A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s44.html) - the court is satisfied that: the applicant was not, in any way, involved in the commission of the offence; the property is not tainted property in relation to the offence; and the applicant's interest in the property is not subject to the effective control of the defendant; or in any case - the court is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so having regard to all the circumstances, including: any financial hardship or other consequence of the interest remaining subject to the order, the seriousness of the offence; and the likelihood that the interest will be: subject to a forfeiture order; subject to [section 30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html);or required to satisfy a pecuniary penalty order."
The cross reference to [s.44(7A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s44.html) in para. (48)(3)(fa) renders applicable the relevant restraining order which was made in this case: "44(7A) Where the application seeks a restraining order against specified property of a person other than the defendant and the offence concerned is a serious offence, the court shall not make a restraining order against the property, unless: the application is supported by an affidavit of a police office stating that: the office believes that the property is tainted property in relation to the offence; or the officer believes that the property is subject to the effective control of the defendant; and the court is satisfied, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for holdings that belief."
Throughout these proceedings, confirmed by Loveday AJ and upheld by this
Court, it has been the
DPP's contention that the property owned by the respondents, which they seek to have excluded from the restraining order and subsequent forfeiture, is "subject to the effective control" of the defendant,
Mr McCauley.
I now set out the relevant provisions of [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the Act. The section follows immediately the provisions of [s.30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html) pursuant to which, as stated above, the property of the respondents was forfeited to the Commonwealth at the end of the six month period commencing on the day of the conviction of the defendant, Mr McCauley. [Section 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) is designed, after such forfeiture, and notwithstanding the absolute vesting of property in the Commonwealth, to provide a vehicle for relief in certain cases: "31(1) Where property is forfeited to the Commonwealth under [section 30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html), a person who claims an interest in the property may, subject to subsections (2) and (4), apply to the court that made the relevant restraining order for an order under subsection (6) or (7).

The application shall, subject to subsection (3), be made before the end of the period of six months commencing on the day on which the property is forfeited to the Commonwealth.

The court may grant a person leave to apply after the end of the period referred to in subsection (2) if the court is satisfied that the delay in making application is not due to neglect on the part of the applicant.

An application for an order under subsection (6) or (7) in relation to an interest in property shall not be made by a person who was given notice of: proceedings on the application for the relevant restraining order; or the making of the relevant restraining order; except with the leave of the court.

The court may grant a person leave to make an application if the court is satisfied that the person's failure to seek to have the property excluded from the relevant restraining order was not due to any neglect on the part of the applicant.
 
Where a person applies for an order under this subsection in respect of an interest in property, the court may: if satisfied that: the applicant was not, in any way, involved in the commission of the relevant serious offence; the applicant's interest in the property is not subject to the effective control of the defendant; and if the applicant acquired the interest at the time of or after the commission of the offence - the applicant acquired the interest: for sufficient consideration; and without knowing, and in circumstances such as not to arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the property was tainted property; or if satisfied that: the property was not used in, or in connection with, any unlawful activity and was not derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from any unlawful activity; and the applicant's interest in the property was lawfully acquired; make an order: declaring the nature, extent and value of the applicant's interest in the property; and either: if the interest is still vested in the Commonwealth - directing the Commonwealth to transfer the interest to the applicant; or declaring that there is payable by the Commonwealth to the applicant an amount equal to the value declared under paragraph .

Where a person applies for an order under this subsection in respect of an interest in property, the court may, if satisfied that: it would not be contrary to the public interest to be transferred to the person; and there is no other reason why the interest should not be transferred to the person; by order: declare the nature, extent and value (as at the time when the order is made) of the interest; and declare that [section 30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s30.html) shall cease to operate in relation to the interest if payment is made in accordance with [section ."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s33.html) 
The DPP's arguments
In submitting that Levine J had erred in granting leave to the respondents to apply under [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html), notwithstanding the earlier forfeiture of the property to the Commonwealth, the DPP's argument went thus: 
The Court had no inherent or other power to provide leave. Its only power could be found in the Act, specifically in [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) and relevantly in [s.31(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html); [2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s2.html). In order to grant leave, the terms of [s.31(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the Act required that there must have been a "failure to seek to have the property excluded from the relevant restraining order".
If there is no such "failure" there is no basis under [s.31(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) for providing leave. Leave of the Court was mandatory in the present case because of the terms of [s.31(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the Act read in the light of the agreed fact that the respondents had been given notice as there stated;  . This construction is conformable with the sensible operation of the Act which envisages that, if a person with an interest in property has notice of proceedings on the application for the restraining order or of the making of such an order [(s.31(4))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html), such person should be obliged to make application for exemption under [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html), as indeed the respondents did. The only exception envisaged was where that person could show a "failure" to seek to have the property excluded. In the present case, this was inapplicable because, far from "failing" to seek exclusion, the respondents had actually made their application but failed to succeed in it. They should not have another opportunity, in effect, to exclude their property (and recover it from forfeiture) by a second application, this time under [s.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html); [4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s4.html). That this was the intention of the drafter is clear enough. The
Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Bill which became the
Act, contains the following commentary on [s.31:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) "Sub-Clauses (4) and (5) preclude a court from making an order in favour of a person who had notice of the application for, or the making of the restraining order unless it is satisfied that the applicant was not negligent in failing to seek to have the property excluded from the restraining order. This is to ensure that, where possible, the restraining order itself is challenged and interests in property asserted before forfeiture." (emphasis added);
Whilst it is conceded that the respective provisions of [ss.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) and [48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act are not exactly harmonious, the DPP submitted that there was no essential difference between the grounds for relief under [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) and those under [s.31.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) Thus, it was put, [s.48(3)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) requires the court to grant the application for exclusion where it is satisfied that the public interest so requires.
Where the considerations listed in [s.31(6)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) were made out, as was said to be applicable here, it would necessarily follow that the proper application of [s.48(3)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act would satisfy the "public interest" test. Thus, it would be incorrect to say that when Loveday AJ made his orders under [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) he did not give consideration to all of the criteria stated under [s.31(6)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) which the respondents now seek to invoke. This is because the breadth of the language of [s.48(3)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act addressed his Honour's attention to precisely the same considerations as do the more precise provisions of [s 31(6)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html); and [6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s6.html). No reason could be shown why a third party should be given a lesser right than the "defendant". Every reason existed why the third party should have larger rights, or at least equal rights, to the "defendant". The result of the construction urged by the DPP would be that a third party would be afforded the same rights, or at least similar rights, as a "defendant" in terms of [s.48.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) That being so, the third party could, and should, have made application at the pre-fofeiture stage, i.e. the [s.48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) stage. In the events which had occurred in this case, there had been no "failure" to seek to have the property excluded so as to enliven the jurisdiction of the court under [s.31(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) Accordingly, the precondition for the grant of leave, necessary in the circumstances of this case, had not been made out. The grant of leave was therefore misconceived. It should be revoked by order of this Court. So went the arguments for the DPP. General considerations: approach to the Act
I acknowledge the arguability of the construction urged by the DPP. As in any task of statutory construction, the duty of the Court is to give effect to the will of Parliament as expressed in the language by which that will is stated. Before addressing the specific terms of [ss.31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) and [48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the Act, let me state a number of considerations of a general character which inform my approach to the task in hand: 
The
Act establishes a scheme for depriving persons of property rights which they otherwise enjoy by law. This is as much true of a company as it is of an individual. The right to own and to control property is an important civic right in a society such as ours. Indeed, it is an attribute of economic liberty. The ownership of property is recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article provides: "17.1 Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others. 2. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property." 
Although these provisions are not, as such, part of Australian municipal law, they reflect fundamental principles of the law of civilized countries, including principles upheld by the common law in Australia. To the extent that they state applicable principles of international law, they are available to assist in the construction of ambiguous Federal legislation. It will be presumed that such legislation is written against the background of an acceptance of such fundamental principles.
See eg Minister for Immigration and
Ethnic Affairs versus Teoh <case>; [(1995) 69 ALJR 423 (HC)], 252. Therefore, it can be accepted that the Act, insofar as it manifests ambiguity or obscurity, would have been intended to respect basic property rights. See Director of Public Prosecutions v Saxon [(1992) 28 NSWLR 263 (CA)], 266. To deprive property owners (and I would say property owners contingently divested of their rights) of such rights, clear legislation is required. Although in the present case, it is true that the respondents' property had been forfeited to, and vested in, the
Commonwealth, a proper view of the scheme of the Act, including s.31, is that the forfeiture is not complete until all rights of the property owner (including any rights enjoyed under s.31) are exhausted; 
Provisions for the forfeiture of property have conventionally been construed strictly. The Act contains an elaborate scheme, the predecessor of which was first introduced into Australian Federal law by the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) . That Act contains a number of provisions for the forfeiture of goods. A strict approach to the construction of forfeiture provisions was endorsed by the majority of the High Court in Murphy versus Farmer [(1988) 165 CLR 19]; [72 ALR 691 .] In the High Court, at 27 f Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ explained: ".. (T)here were competing arguments which are based on the substantive content of (the section). They point in opposite directions. On the one hand, it is arguable that the purpose of forfeiture provisions ... is 'to ensure the strict and complete observance of the Customs laws'.. and that that purpose would be best served by the automatic forfeiture ... (o)n the other hand, it seems to us to be more strongly arguable that clear words should be required before there is attributed to the
Parliament an intention to take the draconian step of imposing automatic forfeiture as a penalty for "any" wrong ... regardless of whether the wrong information was provided as the result of an innocent mistake or excusable ignorance. The effect of the penalty of automatic forfeiture ... can be devastating and quite disproportionate in that it applies regardless of the value of the goods of the importance or effect of the wrong statement which was made ... (i)t is ... in our view, proper to approach the construction of the actual words of the Act on the basis that it is to be presumed that clear words would have been used if it were intended to impose automatic forfeiture ..." 
This approach is equally applicable to the deprivation of the property of a company associated with the "defendant" (and let it be assumed under its control) but neither used in the commission of the offence nor the proceeds of the actual offence. Section of the Act must be given its meaning bearing in mind the whole range of cases to which the section will apply. It must take into account the variety of innocent interests which may be affected by forfeiture of company property which is not itself "tainted" within the meaning of s.4 of the Act; . Whilst it is legitimate to have regard to the Explanatory Memorandum and the purpose of the drafter, and whilst I would accept that the legislation here is ambiguous, permitting that course, the ultimate duty of a court is one of fidelity to the language which Parliament has actually used. See Ex parte
Beane; Re Bolton <case>; [(1987) 162 CLR 514], 518. Ministerial speeches and Explanatory
Memoranda cannot substitute for the language of Parliament which is expressed in its statutes.
The experience of the courts shows how, on many occasions, legislation misfires. Whilst courts should strive to avoid that result (and use Explanatory Memorandum in aid of that laudable objective) they may not use such Memoranda to put words into an Act of Parliament which the legislators have not themselves added. See Dallikavak versus Minister for Immigration and Ethic
Affairs [(1985) 61 ALR 471 (FFC)], 283; Bermingham versus Corrective Services
Commission of New South Wales [(1988) 15 NSWLR 292 (CA)], 299. No hard and fast rule can be laid down. Each statutory quandary must be resolved by reference to the language and apparent purpose of the legislation under scrutiny. But here the respondents contended that the DPP was seeking to add to s.31 of the
Act an additional sub-section in the following terms: "s31(5A) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) the court shall not entertain an application for an order under sub-section (6) or if the person making the application has previously applied unsuccessfully for orders under sub-section 48(3)." 
The more substantial and radical the surgery required of the legislation, the less inclined will a court be to perform it. A point will be reached where the court will refuse to pass from interpretation to what it feels is, effectively, curial legislation. Cf Craies on Statute Law, 7th ed, 109; 
It is not unusual for statutes to provide, including in relief against forfeiture, various successive modes of applying to obtain relief There is nothing inherently unusual in affording an avenue for relief prior to forfeiture and another after forfeiture has occurred, Relief against forfeiture legislation is typically regarded as beneficial and protective of the rights of individuals. It will not be construed narrowly. See eg Minster for Lands and
Forests and Anor versus McPherson and Anor [(1990) 22 NSWLR 687 (CA)],
In the context of an Act which has provided drastic consequences for certain property owners, it is not immediately apparent that the provision of multiple avenues for relief, at staged intervals according to later and better information, might not be the purpose of Parliament.
I approach the construction of the Act, and the inter-relationship of ss.31 and 48, with the foregoing general considerations in mind. Overlap and differences in ss. 31 and 48
When the particularity of the suggested overlap of, and differences between, ss.31 and 48 are examined, the following considerations were drawn to notice by the respondents:  .
Neither s.31(5) of the Act, nor any other provision in s.31, expressly disentitles a person who has failed in an application under s.48(3) from later seeking relief under s.31. Accordingly, the Court is driven back to inference.
The foregoing general principles provide guidance for the approach which would be taken in that regard, protective of the interests and basic property rights of the respondents; 
Nothing in the relevant statutory provisions gives rise to a necessary implication that failure to obtain a remedy under s.48(3) excludes the entitlement to make an application under s.31 The entitlements provided by the respective provisions are available at different points of time (pre and post forfeiture). They also depend upon the application of somewhat different criteria.
Thus, the criteria mentioned in s.31(6)(b) are not exactly those mentioned in s.48(3)(fa). Had it been intended that an application under s.48 of the Act would exhaust the right to apply under s.31, it would have been expected that the drafter would have ensured an exact equivalence between the provisions of the two sections. Very properly, counsel for the DPP acknowledged that the existence of similar, but not identical, provisions in the two sections presented something of an obstacle to the suggestion that the exhaustion of the one (s.48) would necessarily make the other (s.31) inapplicable;  . It is not inevitable that proof of the matters specified in s.31(6)(b) of the Act would necessarily, and in every case, attract an entitlement to relief under s.48(3)(g). Whilst it might be conceded that it would ordinarily be so, the fact remains that the legislature has provided for relief in different terms. By convention (although not always by practicality) that differentiation is taken to be deliberate. Thus, within s.48(3), whilst it is true that the subsection begins with the mandatory "shall" ("the court shall grant the application"), within the terms of paragraph there is ample room for the court to exercise its judgment, according to the merits of the particular case. This is provided by the use of the verb "satisfy" and by the evaluative phrase "in the public interest" as well as the use of the opinionative expression "having regard to all the circumstances". These words invoke judgment and discretion on the part of the court They are not as precise as the terms of s.31(6). That subsection is expressed in the language of general discretion ("the court may ..."). True, the discretion must be exercised in a principled way and by reference to the criteria mentioned. But those criteria are not exactly the same as the criteria stated in s.48; 
One arguable instance where a claim for relief might fail under s.48 but be entitled to succeed under s.31 is the case where the person affected, although possessed of "tainted property", could establish that sufficient consideration for the property was given, without grounds for suspecting that it was "tainted" when acquired. In such a case, whilst the applicant for relief might have failed under s.48, it might succeed under s.31. It is, at least, a possibility. To protect that possibility leave has been given to allow the facts to be proved and the application to be determined on its merits.
 
Conclusions
Although the proper conclusion is not entirely clear in this case, the ambiguity and obscurity arises from the terms of the Act. The DPP was, and is, in the unique position to influence the terms of the Act. Whilst the object of the drafter is clear enough from the Explanatory
Memorandum, unfortunately this object did not carry over into the language of the Act. Similar but not identical provisions are found in ss.31 and 48. Given the drastic consequences of the application of the Act and the deprivation of property rights which it effects, it is proper to construe the Act in a way favourably to the provision of successive rights of relief against forfeiture. After a, successive rights are certainly provided generally by the terms of ss.31 and 48. It would have been simple for Parliament to have excluded successive applications. It failed to do so. Affording leave does not, of course, determine the merits of the respondents' claim for relief. It simply permits the respondents to advance their arguments and to have them dealt with, on this occasion, by reference to the criteria in s.31 where earlier they were decided by reference to the slightly different criteria in s.48.
 .
No error has been shown in the decision of Levine J to grant leave to the respondents.
I record, in parting with the case, that no constitutional argument was raised by the respondents concerning the validity of the provisions of the Act purporting to forfeit their separate property, without compensation, to the
Commonwealth. Cf Georgiadis versus Australian and Overseas Telecommunications
Corporation <case>; [(1994) 68 ALJR 272 (HC)] applying the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), [s51(xxxi).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s51.html) 
Order
I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
JUDGE2
HANDLEY JA The reasons for judgment of Kirby ACJ which I have had the benefit of reading in draft form, set out the facts, the history of the proceedings, and the relevant statutory provisions. This enables me to go at once to the principal question. The appeal concerns the relationship between [s 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s31.html) and [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/) (Cwlth). In particular it is concerned with the relationship between [s 48(3)(fa)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) and [s 31(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html), (5), and (6). A restraining order was made against property of Logan Park Investments Pty Ltd (the company). Subsequently the company applied under [s 48(3)(fa)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) for a variation of that order which, if made, would have prevented the forfeiture of its property to the Commonwealth.
The
Court was bound to grant that application on being satisfied that the company was not in any way involved in the commission of the offences with which Mr McCauley had been charged, that the property was not tainted property in relation to those offences and that the company's property was not subject to the effective control of Mr McCauley. This application was refused by
Loveday AJ and an appeal to this Court failed.
The company later applied for orders under [s 31(6).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) The application was made within six months after the forfeiture of the company's property to the
Commonwealth and hence within time under [s 31(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) However since the company had been given notice of the making of the restraining order, this application could not proceed without the leave of the Court pursuant to [s 31(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) provides that the court "may" grant leave if "satisfied" that the applicant's failure to seek to have the property excluded from the relevant restraining order was not due to any neglect on its part. The company could not bring itself within this provision because it had applied although unsuccessfully to have its property excluded from the order. The Director argued that as a result the company was not entitled to leave under subs (4).
However subs (5) is an enabling provision which defines one circumstance in which the Court can grant leave. It does not purport to be exhaustive and is not in substance a prohibition against the Court granting leave in all other cases.
The Court therefore has a general discretion to grant leave in a proper case, even though the requirements of subs (5) are not satisfied.
The Director nevertheless argued that leave should have been refused either as a matter of power or as a matter of discretion. If the grounds on which an application might be made under [s 48](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) before forfeiture were precisely mirrored by the grounds on which such an application might be made under [s 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) after forfeiture, there would have been considerable force in these submissions. However the grounds are different. [Section 31(6)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) provides that the court may relieve in whole or in part against the forfeiture:- "(b) if satisfied that: the property was not used in, or in connection with, any unlawful activity and was not derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from any unlawful activity; and the applicant's interest in the property was lawfully acquired;" 
There is no such ground in [s 48(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) available to a third party although a somewhat similar ground appears in [s 48(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s48.html) in relation to property owned by the defendant who, in this case, was Mr McCauley the accused.
Given that the grounds for relief available to third parties under [s 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) after forfeiture, are wider than those available before forfeiture the intention of Parliament must have been that the remedies should be cumulative.
Senior counsel for the Director could not suggest any other reason why the discretionary grounds for relief, subject to the requirement of leave, after forfeiture should be wider than those available, as of right, before forfeiture.
In my opinion the principles of construction which must guide the Court, the differences in the grounds for relief at the two stages, and the absence of any express bar in [s 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) to a second application combine to require the dismissal of this appeal. I agree with the orders proposed by the President.
JUDGE3
POWELL JA I am disposed to think that the intention of the legislature, when enacting [s.31(4)(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/s31.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca1987160/) ("the Act"), was to limit the cases in which leave might be granted to those in which the relevant applicant had not earlier sought to have the subject property excluded from the restraining order, and that its failure to do so did not involve negligence on its part. This notwithstanding, the approach adopted by the majority (Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) in Murphy v. Farmer ((1) [(1988) 165
CLR 19], 382-3) in the passage ((3) CLR at 27-28; ALR at 6-7) to which
Kirby P has referred in his Judgment, would seem to dictate that the ambiguity, or obscurity, which is inherent in the relevant provisions of the
Act must be resolved in favour of the Respondents.
I agree that the Appeal should be dismissed with costs.
