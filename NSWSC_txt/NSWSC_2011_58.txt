Judgment 
In each of these unrelated proceedings, application was made for an order under the Companies (New South Wales) Code directing reinstatement of the registration of a company incorporated under that Code or earlier New South Wales companies legislation and later deregistered under the Code. The date of deregistration was 5 May 1989 in the first case, 13 December 1990 in the second and 18 August 1988 in the third.  
The order sought was made in each case. I indicated that I would publish some brief reasons, as I now do.  
The question of the correct approach, since the enactment of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), to cases of this kind concerning companies created and later struck off under pre-January 1991 State legislation has been considered at first instance on a number of occasions. Unfortunately, no clear consensus has been achieved.  
The relevant cases are Shaw versus Goodsmith Industries Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2002) 41 ACSR 556]  
I am bound to say, however, that I have a distinct discomfort about continuing resort to the Companies (New South Wales) Code , given that its applicability and availability rest solely on the insubstantial foundation of [s 85](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/s85.html) of the [Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/) . The Companies (New South Wales) Code is otherwise not in force following repeal of the [Companies (Application of Laws) Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cola1981282/) by the [Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/slpa2008434/) which was itself repealed by the [Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/slpa2009434/) .  
As regards a company deregistered under New South Wales companies legislation before 1 January 1991, a combination of:  transitional provisions that came into effect upon the creation of the
Corporations Law of New South Wales on 1 January 1991 by the [Corporations (New South Wales) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cswa1990344/) ; insertion into the Corporations Law of New South Wales by the [Company
Law Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/clra1998210/) (Cth) of not only reinstatement provisions corresponding with those in the present s
AH but also the particular transitional provision that became <case>; non-inclusion of that <case> in the Corporations Act 2001(Cth); and the wide-ranging but sometimes very generally and imprecisely expressed transitional provisions now in force through Division 6 of [Part .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p10.1) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) does not seem to provide a basis for a conclusion that reinstatement of registration may be dealt with by the court and by ASIC under [s
AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the present [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) .
It is in my opinion desirable that Parliament enact legislation dealing in a clear and concise way with reinstatement of the registration of a company either deregistered or dissolved before 1 January 1991 under State or Territory legislation then in force.  
Such cases arise fairly frequently. Identification of the correct basis on which to order and effect reinstatement is not something that is remote from practical affairs.  
One of the applications to which these reasons relate concerned a company deregistered before 1 January 1991 apparently without the knowledge of its directors and shareholders which, after it had ceased to exist, purported to become the registered proprietor of land and to mortgage that land to a financial institution as security for moneys purportedly borrowed. The second application concerned the regrettably common case of a person with an asbestos induced illness who wished to see a former employer brought back into existence so that proceedings in which damages for bodily injury were sought might be properly and fully constituted. The company the subject of the third case was deregistered at its own request in circumstances where its ownership of a parcel of land was simply overlooked.  
If law reform is undertaken in this area, it will usefully extend to other uncertainties arising from the Commonwealth legislation with respect to the recreation of deregistered companies: see White versus Baycorp Advantage Business Information Services Ltd  <case>; [(2006) 200 FLR 125], CGU Workers Compensation Ltd versus Rockwall Interiors Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2006) 201 FLR 296], GIO
