Wednesday 23 September 2009  /06 Evelyn Tobin &anor versus Morris Ezekiel & anor; Estate of
Lily Ezekiel 
JUDGMENT (ex tempore)  HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks leave to read an affidavit of Timothy
Dennis Kelly sworn 17 September 2009, the significant feature of which is that it annexes a note made by Mr Kelly of a conversation with one Rachel Brook on February 2007, which conversation had as its subject matter the circumstances in which Ms Brook provided the name of the solicitor Geoff
Woolley, who drew the disputed 1997 wills. It appears that Mr Kelly spoke to
Ms Brook on 28 February 2007, made a note of the evidence which she could give, and was informed by her that she did not wish to sign any statement or affidavit.
 It does not appear that when the time came for service of the plaintiffs' affidavit evidence, any outline of the evidence which it was anticipated that
Ms Brook would give was served or provided nor was any indication given that it was proposed to call her to give oral evidence, she having declined to provide an affidavit.
 On 3 September 2009, the plaintiffs issued a subpoena to give evidence to Ms
Brook. It did not prove possible to serve that subpoena, but ultimately it appears that Ms Brook, having undergone major surgery, is, for that reason, not readily available to give evidence.
 Having ascertained that, on 17 September 2009 TD Kelly & Co sent to
McLachlan Chilton a letter, purporting to be a notice under [Evidence
Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html), of intention to adduce evidence of Ms Brook's previous representation in reliance on [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s64.html)
That letter enclosed Mr Kelly's affidavit and in turn a copy of the handwritten note of the conversation with Ms Brook, and for present purposes I am content to assume that if in form it did not fully comply with the requirements of [Evidence Regulation ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/er2005171/), reg , any departure from that form would not occasion prejudice.
 However, [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s68.html), plainly contemplates that a [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) notice would be served at least 21 days prior to the occasion upon which the evidence is to be used. Even if the section does not expressly say so, UCPR, r 31.5, provides:  
Unless the court orders otherwise, notice for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) must be given: in any case where the court by notice to the parties fixes a date for determining the date for hearing [that is to say, a callover], not later than days before the [callover], ...
 in any other case, not later than 21 days before the date on which the court determines the date for hearing.
 
The date for this hearing was determined many months ago.  It seems to me that there is simply no sufficient cause shown for leaving until 17 September 2009 service of a [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) notice. If the evidence could be admitted without prejudice, I would always be inclined to do so. But the argument that to do so in this case would deny the defendants an opportunity to investigate what is attributed to Ms Brook - which opportunity was fundamental to the admission of firsthand hearsay under [s 64(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s64.html) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) in the first place - is a formidable one.
 I am satisfied that there would be serious potential prejudice in extending time for service of a [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) notice or dispensing with the requirement for such a notice in this particular case. I therefore refuse leave to rely on the affidavit of Timothy Dennis
Kelly sworn 17 September 2009.
