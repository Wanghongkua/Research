REGINA versus F /95 
Friday 4 October 1996 
COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
Grove J, McInerney J, Hulme J 
CATCHWORDS: CRIMINAL LAW - AN UNBORN INFANT IS A PERSON FOR CAUSING WHOSE DEATH A DRIVER MAY BE CONVICTED OF CULPABLE DRIVING PROVIDED THAT INFANT IS BORN ALIVE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIES AS A RESULT OF ANTE-NATAL INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE RELEVANT IMPACT 
JUDGMENT 
GROVE J: A question of law which has arisen at a trial is submitted by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to <case>(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act: "Is a child in utero who is injured through impact with a motor vehicle or through impact with any object of a motor vehicle in or on which that child in utero was being conveyed, is subsequently born, lives independently and then dies as a result of the injuries sustained, a person for the purposes of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/)?" 
The Director has filed a statement of circumstances as required by <case>(b).
On 30 March 1991 F was driving a motor vehicle in the Horsley Drive Carramar.
His ability to drive was impaired by his having previously partaken of the drug cannabis. His de facto wife K was riding as a passenger. She was then approximately eight months (34 weeks) pregnant. As a result of dangerous driving by F his vehicle crossed to the incorrect side of the road and collided with another. K suffered head and abdominal injuries. She was admitted to hospital and on that day underwent emergency caesarean section as a result giving birth to a female infant, D. The newborn child was noted to have bilateral swellings over her parietal bones. Investigation confirmed severe trauma to the skull and underlying brain. D died on 31 March 1991 as a result of injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident. She was, of course, at the time of impact unborn and within her mother's womb.

An indictment charging three counts of culpable driving contrary to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) was presented against F. The first count related to grievous bodily harm being occasioned to K. To this he pleaded guilty and he was in due course sentenced.
That count is not relevant to the present question. The second and third counts were charged in the alternative namely: "2. On 30 March 1991 at Carramar in the State of New South Wales, did drive a motor vehicle, namely, motor car registered No EBK 750, on a public street in a manner dangerous to the public when through impact with the said motor vehicle, the death of D was occasioned.
And the Director of Public Prosecutions further charges in the alternative that F on 30 March 1991 at Carramar in the State of New South Wales, did drive a motor vehicle, namely, motor car registered No EBK 750, on a public street in a manner dangerous to the public when through impact with the said motor vehicle in which one D was being conveyed, with an object, namely motor car registered No PTB 695 the death of the said D was occasioned." 
F elected trial without jury and on 1 December 1995 his Honour Judge Luland QC found a verdict of not guilty on both counts. The relevant provisions of [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) were in these terms: "[S52A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html)
Where the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, any person is occasioned through - the impact with any object of a motor vehicle in or on which that person was being conveyed (whether as a passenger or otherwise); ...................................................................
 impact with a motor vehicle; and the motor vehicle was at the time of the impact, or at the time of overturning or leaving the highway, or at the time the thing fell from it, being driven by another person -- under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug; or at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public; the person who was so driving the motor vehicle shall be guilty of the misdemeanour of culpable driving." 
His Honour found that the second count could not be sustained because [s
A(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) "did not apply" to this case in any event but, pertinent to the third count charged under [s
A(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) and the present question, held that D as a child in utero at the time of impact was not a "person" within the meaning of that word where it appears in the provision. It appears twice, in the reference to death or grievous bodily harm being occasioned to a person and in the expression in [s
A(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) "that person was being conveyed (whether as a passenger or otherwise)." 
What is therefore involved in this reference is a relatively short point of interpretation. "Person" is undefined in the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) save to extend its meaning to societies, companies and corporations.

As observed by the learned trial judge the common law has long recognized that where an unborn child receives injuries, is born alive but dies of those antenatal injuries, the perpetrator may suffer criminal liability for homicide: R versus Senior [1832 1 Moody CC 346]; R versus West <case>; [1848 2 Cox CC 500.] In New South Wales the definition of murder in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s18.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) refers to "intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on some person" and there is no reason to hold that the common law principle as to liability would not continue to apply. Legislation of provisions such as those penalizing procuration of miscarriage (Crimes Act [s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s83.html) do not purport to nor operate so as to abrogate it. An offender may be convicted of the murder or manslaughter of a "person" being an unborn infant at the time of the felonious act causing death and it can be noted that one arraigned for those crimes may by express provision [(s
A(5))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) be convicted of an offence under [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s52a.html) 
The prosecution referred to McCluskey versus Her Majesty's Advocate [1989 RTR ] in support of the application of the principle mentioned. Section 1 of the Road [Traffic
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta77/) (Imp.) provided: "A person who causes the death of another person by driving a motor vehicle on the road recklessly shall be guilty of an offence." 
The Court (a three judge bench of the High Court of Justiciary of Scotland) investigated the common law in England and in Scotland and observed that culpable homicide would lie for causing the death of a person born alive by injuries inflicted before birth: R versus Kwok Chak Ming (No 1) [1963 HKLR ]; Glanville
Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd Ed) @ 289; Russell on Crime (12th Ed) @ 401. It was therefore concluded impossible to find that the words "the death of another person" in a United Kingdom statute must relate only to the death of a person in life at the time of the act (of reckless driving). The appreciation of the common law was later confirmed by the Court of Appeal : Attorney-General's Reference (No 3 of 1994) [1996 2 All ER .] 
A similar approach to the meaning of "a person" in the context of culpable homicide under the Western Australian Criminal Code was adopted in R v
Martin, unreported, Supreme Court of Western Australia (Owen J) 8 Dec 1995.

His Honour Judge Luland distinguished McCluskey because he considered that s
A(1)(a) had a feature of temporal relationship between the death occasioned by the impact and the person being conveyed in the vehicle. He concluded that a "living person" (by which I take him to have meant a person having been born) must be being conveyed at the time of impact in order to found liability. The distinction sought to be drawn exists or does not exist in accordance with whether "person" includes the living but unborn. Thus the central question remains whether D had the status of a person being conveyed at the time of impact. The argument for the respondent necessarily contended that only K (to the exclusion of D) was being conveyed. D was not, in my view, a nonentity at that time. Subject to the condition of being born alive, she was capable of being the victim of homicide and, at common law, a claimant for damages for injuries sustained whilst in utero: Lynch versus Lynch [1992 25 NSWLR .] I am conscious of some observations that it may be anomalous that liability depends upon fulfilment of that condition but it would be more anomalous - and contrary to the thrust of authority - to classify D as a non-person.

Written submissions in support of argument referred to a variety of cases in foreign jurisdictions where the status of an unborn infant had been discussed in the judgments. As I have said, the present question involves construction of an expression in statutory context but it can be stated that those cases are consistent with an affirmative answer to it with the possible exception of
R versus Tait [1989 3 All ER 682.] That case dealt with <case> of the Offences Against the
Person Act 1861 (Imp.) which creates an offence of threatening another to kill that other or a third person. Mustill LJ giving the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, Criminal Division to the effect that a threat to kill a child in utero by bringing about miscarriage was not an offence against that provision expressed criticism of the well established law of culpability for causing the death of a child born alive by pre-natal injury describing it as "the old and stranger rule of English law": @ 686 g-h. I am unpersuaded that reference to this judgment provokes a negative answer to the question posed for this Court.

Section 52A was replaced in 1994 (Act No 78) and it was said to be observable that the temporal relationship had been excluded. The new structure of the section imposed liability for occasioning death or grievous bodily harm through impact but the formula of a person being conveyed in or on a vehicle (whether as a passenger or otherwise) is repeated in the definition of reference to that impact: <case> (a) & (b) (as amended). No support for the construction of the statutory language adopted in the District Court is to be derived from analysis of the replacement provision.

I would answer the question in the affirmative. As provided by <case>(f) of the Criminal Appeal Act the respondent's costs should be paid by the
Crown.
 
McINERNEY J: I agree with Grove J that the question be answered in the affirmative, for the reasons he has given.

HULME J: I agree with the order proposed by, and the Reasons of, Mr Justice Grove.
