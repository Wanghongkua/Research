EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission seeks restraining orders under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) ("CARA"). It brings its application by summons filed in court this morning supported by a statement of facts and circumstances signed by the solicitor Mr Goh and an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark with a number of associated annexures.
The affidavit of Mr Spark sets out his belief that the defendant engaged in serious crime related activity and sets out the grounds for that belief. In particular Mr Spark relies upon a statement of facts prepared by the New South Wales Police Force. That statement of facts sets out the details of this investigation into a drug manufacturing operation and indicates that the defendant was heard on a listening device to be present in, and discussing the processes of, what might be called, a meth lab on a rural property.
Based on the material in the facts sheet I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion attested to by Mr Spark and in those circumstances [s 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) is in mandatory terms and I must make the restraining order.
Accordingly I make the orders which are contained in the short minutes of order. I will date and sign those and have them sealed and order that those orders should take effect forthwith.

Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor being noted) and 
Considering that, having had regard to the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 25 May 2015, there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion stated therein, 
The Court orders:
Pursuant to [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of "interest in property" as defined in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s7.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/)) of Sean
Anthony Smith, including the interest in property in the property specified in the Schedule hereto.
Liberty is granted to the Plaintiff and Sean Anthony Smith to apply on three (3) days' notice.
The costs of obtaining these orders shall be costs in the cause.
Pursuant to Rule 36.4(1 )(a) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) these orders are to take effect as of the date hereof.
