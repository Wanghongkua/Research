Grieve versus Registrar General of New South Wales [1997] NSWSC 105 (3 April )
 `GRIEVE versus REGISTRAR GENERAL OF NEW SOUTH WALES` ``3744/96 
THURSDAY, 3 APRIL 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Folio identifier 19/18/758779 is registered in the names of Bruce Ronald Ferguson and Patricia Ferguson and Robert Bruce Patrick Ferguson as joint tenants in one-half share and Connie Tanner in one-half share as tenants in common. The land is at Norah Head in the Shire of Wyong.

The plaintiff is the manager who was appointed by the Guardianship Board in respect of the estate of Patricia Ferguson. Bruce Ronald Ferguson died on 13
July 1994. The person shown in the Certificate of Title is Connie Tanner whose full name is Constance Mary Tanner, who is still alive and has given evidence in these proceedings.

Robert Bruce Patrick Ferguson was born on 1 November 1957, the only child of
Bruce Ronald Ferguson and Patricia Ferguson. Mr Ferguson junior attended the
University of Sydney and was awarded a degree of Bachelor of Arts with second class honours in 1980. At the beginning of the 1984 academic year he enrolled at the University of Tasmania. It would seem that he withdrew from his study at that university during the first academic term and a doctor whom he consulted in March 1984 said that she thought that Mr Ferguson junior was suffering great anxiety. It would seem that some time in 1983 he had become a missing person in Southport, Tasmania but had returned to his normal activities after that episode.

On 22 April 1984 Mr Ferguson junior was reported missing to the Tasmanian police. He told people that he would be going for a bush walk in the Moonlight
Ridge Track area of Tasmania. He was never seen again. The Tasmanian police conducted a thorough search for Mr Ferguson junior over a period of some ten days. The Inspector in charge described the search as a massive search by experienced police and civilian bush walkers in rough country in bad weather.
In fact the Inspector said the conditions were so rough that two of the search party were temporarily lost during the search. No trace of Mr Ferguson junior was ever found. The police concluded that either he had never gone bush walking at all or alternatively he had become lost and might never be found.
He was never heard of since.

The newspapers of the time were interested in Mr Ferguson junior's disappearance and some of the clippings from the newspapers are in evidence before me. Included amongst these is an article about Mrs Patricia Ferguson to the effect that she never gave up hope that her son was still alive.

This may explain why eight years after Mr Ferguson junior had disappeared the subject property was registered in the name of Mr Ferguson junior, his two parents and his aunt, even though as a matter of legal presumption after seven years when Mr Ferguson had not been heard of by anybody the law would presume that he was by that stage dead.

The conveyance of the property into the name of a dead person is a nullity so that the Certificate of Title should have issued in the names of Mr and Mrs
Ferguson senior and Mrs Tanner, but the fact that this didn't occur is no fault of the Registrar General's, the defendant in these proceedings, but rather something that was done by the family because of Mrs Ferguson's feelings about her lost son.

The plaintiff now wishes to have the title rectified so that Mrs Ferguson whose estate he manages and Mrs Tanner will hold as tenants in common. He wishes to do this on the basis that Mr Ferguson senior is deceased and Mr
Ferguson junior is either deceased or alternatively should not have been on the title in the first place.

The law is as stated by the High Court in Axon versus Axon <case>; [(1937) 59 CLR 395] that once seven years has passed and a person has not been seen by the persons who were to be expected to be contacted by the propositus the court can presume that the propositus is dead although not that he or she died at any particular time. It does not matter that the propositus was a person who had deliberately cut himself or herself off from friends or was a fugitive from justice (see Ross versus NRMA Life Limited, Young J, 14 April , unreported).

In the instant case whether Mr Ferguson junior went bush walking and become irretrievably lost and must surely have died or whether he never went bush walking at all and disappeared for reasons of his own, by April 1991 the law would presume him to be dead. It follows that in 1992 he should not have been registered as a proprietor.

However, it is also the situation that if Mr Ferguson junior was validly on the title he is now, as at the date of the making of this order, presumed to have been dead. Accordingly, by the principles of survivorship the plaintiff is entitled to the order for which he asks.

Section 101(1) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) as amended provides: "Where a person becomes entitled to an estate or interested in land: upon the death of a person registered with the person as joint proprietor of that estate or interest; or.... the Registrar-General may, upon application in the approved form by the person so entitled and proof to the Registrar-
General's satisfaction of the death or other event....register that person as proprietor of the estate or interest." 
The plaintiff applied to the Registrar General to exercise his powers under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s101.html)
After consideration, the Registrar General replied to the effect that whilst he did not dispute that the evidence was strong that there should be a presumption of death it was not his role to usurp the Supreme Court and without actual evidence of death such as a death certificate or a Coroner's report he was not able to apply [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s101.html) 
As far as I am aware there has never been a decision as to what proof of death to the Registrar General's satisfaction means under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s101.html)
I can well see why the Registrar General took the view that was taken in the letter to the plaintiff's solicitor of 11 March 1997. However, it does seem to me that if the Registrar General is clearly satisfied that a person must be presumed dead under the principle in Axon versus Axon (supra) then it is open to the Registrar General to apply [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s101.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s101.html) is not only limited to the case where there is a death certificate issued or a
Coroner's report. It may be that the Registrar General, mindful of the assurance fund, may not wish so to act but it is competent for the Registrar
General to act if he or she so thinks it is proper to do so.

In the instant case the evidence shows that this Court should declare that
Robert Bruce Patrick Ferguson is dead and it should also declare that the
Registrar General would be entitled to register as proprietors of the land comprised in folio identifier 19/18/758779 Patricia Ferguson and Connie Mary
Tanner in equal shares as tenants in common.

I make no order as to costs. The Registrar General has submitted and the public has doubtless benefited by having a decision made as to the scope of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s101.html) of the Act which the Registrar General administers.
