JUDGMENT 
MAHONEY AP: This appeal has been said to raise for decision two questions of considerable difficulty: whether an employer can recover amounts paid under an order which, by operation of a subsequent variation of the order, are in excess of what the subsequent order directs; and whether in any event a Local Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine a dispute in relation to that matter.

Each of these questions, and the implications of the answers given to them, are of practical importance in the administration of the Workers
Compensation legislation and the orders which the Compensation Court can and should make.

The facts are simple. On 1 October 1982 the Compensation Court made an order for compensation in favour of the worker, Mr Thompson, for the payment of $54 per week from 6 October 1981.

In August 1985 the worker commenced proceedings against the appellant in the
Compensation Court seeking an increase in that award for weekly compensation; the appellant, the employer, sought a review of the order, by way of diminution or termination.

On 1 July 1987 the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) came relevantly into force.

On 6 October 1987 the Compensation Court made, by consent, an order varying the first order. The order was in the following terms: "Having duly considered the matters submitted, THE COURT, by and with the consent of the parties hereto:
HEREBY ORDERS AND AWARDS: 
That the weekly compensation payable under the award dated 11 October 1982 in matter No 11687 of 1981 be varied to: $80 from 11 October 1982 to 30 June 1983.
 $NIL from 1 July 1983 to 24 May 1985.
 $179 from 25 May 1985 to 28 July 1985.
 $57 from 29 July 1985 to 30 June 1986.
 $46 from 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1987.
 $NIL from 1 July 1987.

That the respondent pay the applicant's costs (including a fee for counsel for advice on evidence) forthwith after they have been agreed or taxed.

That the respondent have credit for amounts of compensation paid to date.
GRANTS liberty to the parties to apply." 
It is agreed that, if the second order had been in force from the time of the operation of the first order, 6 October 1981, the amounts actually paid by the employer in accordance with the terms of the first order exceeded the amounts which, under the second order, it would have been obliged to pay by $4,397.60.
That amount was made up by (as they have been loosely described) over-payments to 30 June 1987 (the commencement of the 1987 Act) of $3,642.60; and over- payments from the commencement of the 1987 Act to the date of the hearing below of $756. (In view of the issues which have been posed, it is not necessary to pursue the precise details of these amounts or the calculations of them).

Subsequently, the employer brought proceedings in a Local Court to recover from the worker the amount of the over-payments, $4,397.60. The magistrate before whom the proceeding came held that he had no jurisdiction to deal with the claim in the Local Court. Having heard arguments in relation to his jurisdiction, he "acceded to the submissions of the defendant on the question of jurisdiction" and held: "I have no jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's action. Having decided against the plaintiff on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction, it is not necessary for me to make a determination on any other issues." 
The matter was taken on appeal by stated case under the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s101.html)
Bryson J held that the Local Court had no jurisdiction to determine the claim, determined that the magistrate's determination in that regard was correct and dismissed the proceeding with costs. The matter has now been brought to this
Court on appeal from the decision of Bryson J.

In an exhaustive examination of the submissions of the parties, it would be necessary to consider the following questions: (1) What was the effect of the second order of the Compensation Court?; (2) Did the second order create in the employer a right to recover by action the amount of the suggested over- payments; (3) Was the second order valid; and (4) Did the Local Court have jurisdiction to determine such matters.

THE EFFECT OF THE SECOND ORDER OF THE COMPENSATION COURT: 
The first order of the Compensation Court (11 October 1982) was valid and effective to impose on the employer the obligation to pay the amounts there referred to, namely, $54 per week from 6 October 1981. Under the general law, the right of the worker to compensation would presumably have merged in the order and the source of the obligations of the employer would then be that order. Therefore the right (if it was such) to recover any amount as over-paid arises not from the first order but from what subsequently occurred and the effect of it.

The second order (6 October 1987) was made by consent. Nothing has been urged to turn upon this. However, it has not been contested but that it operated according to its terms to vary the first order and to substitute for the obligations created by the first order the obligations set forth in the second order. The order not merely created rights according to its terms but "varied" the rights previously existing to substitute for them the rights set forth in par 1(a) of the second order. The variation, presumably made in accordance with <case> of the 1987 Act, is accepted to have been valid. If it had not contained par 1(c) it would have been clear that, by the force of the second order, the rights of the parties would have become merely those set forth in par 1(a) of the second order.

It is proper to record that the evidence does not disclose - at least it does not establish - the grounds on which the second order was made or the section of the Act under which it was made. In particular, it does not appear whether the facts were such as to give rise to the operation of <case> of the 1987 Act.
But, however that be, the second order is accepted to be valid.

If the order had not contained par 1(c) the employer would not, in my opinion, have claimed a right or entitlement to what has been described as the over- payments in accordance with the law of restitution or the like. The payments which were made were not paid voluntarily: cf Miller versus CSR Timber Products
Pty Ltd [(1993) 29 NSWLR 611.] They were paid pursuant to the obligations created by the valid first order. In my opinion, the substitution by the second order of different obligations does not mean that payments made in satisfaction of obligations under the first order, while it remained valid, were made in circumstances which, whatever be the effects of the law of restitution, would entitle the employer to recover the over-payment.

Accordingly, if there is to be a right to recover over-payment, it must derive from the operation of par 1(c).

That paragraph does not purport to create in the employer a right to payment of any amount by the worker. It purports to create, and to create only, a more limited right, namely, the right for the employer to debit against the obligations created by par 1(a) "amounts of compensation paid to date".
Accordingly, the employer had, by virtue of the paragraph, no general right to recover the amount over-paid and accordingly no right to sue for it in any court.

This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the substantial dispute between the employer and the worker: the employer was given no right to sue for the over-payments in any court.

However, that does not deal in terms with the question posed for decision in the stated case. As the stated case indicates, the employer contended that the magistrate's decision "was erroneous in point of law upon the grounds ... " that he "erred in law in holding that I have no jurisdiction to hear and determine the plaintiff's action for recovery of over-payments or worker's compensation as that is a matter falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Compensation Court." The stated case posed as the matter "to be determined by the Court" "whether my determination was erroneous in point of law". It is to that question that I now come.

As I have said, such rights as the employer may have in relation to the over- payments derive and derive only from par 1(c) of the second order, made on 6
October 1987. It has not I think been argued that, although the over-payments were made pursuant to the terms of an order, the first order, which were then valid and binding upon the employer, the effect of the making of the second order was, as it were, to create a situation in which the over-payments were made without obligation or without consideration or otherwise in circumstances giving rise to a right of recovery under the (evolving) law of restitution.
The circumstances surrounding a claim of that kind were not investigated and, if it were sought to make a case of that kind, it would be necessary to examine more closely all of those circumstances, including the circumstances leading up to the making, by consent, of the second order. That possible basis of claim therefore may be put aside.

If the basis of the employer's claim to the over-payments is contained and contained only in the second order, the rights in question were created by an order made under the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). (That
Act, as I have said, came into force on 1 July 1987).

Section 107 of the 1987 provides: "107. Subject to this Act and the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) the
Compensation Court has exclusive jurisdiction to examine here and determine all matters arising under this Act (except Part 5)." [Part 5 relates to common law remedies for injuries and, in my opinion, is not here relevant].

The claim to the over-payments, arising under an order made under the 1987
Act, is, in my opinion, a matter "arising under this Act" within <case>. I have had the benefit of the analysis of provisions of this kind by Bryson J and of the observations made in this Court in cases such as Czysnok versus Jaques
Limited (Court of Appeal, 17 September 1993, unreported); Carricks Limited v
Pizzaro [(1995) 38 NSWLR 274]; NSW
State Brickworks versus Abi-Arraj [(1995) 38 NSWLR 94]; and
Miller versus CSR Timber Products Pty Limited. Counsel in argument referred also to Clutha Limited versus Danswan (Court of Appeal, 5 April 1993, unreported).

In my opinion, in those cases there is nothing which, as a matter of decision, is inconsistent with the conclusions which I have reached and the reasoning upon which those conclusions have been based. The position may be different where the claim to recovery and the employer's rights relate to amounts paid voluntarily and not as the result of an order of the Compensation Court. In such a case, the right of recovery of over-payments may derive from matters other than an order of the Compensation Court: they may derive, eg, from the fact that, as the circumstances eventuate, the payments have been made not pursuant to any order but upon what ultimately appears to be a mistaken view of the law or the facts. Priestley JA referred to matters of this kind in
Carricks Limited versus Pizzaro in the course of his judgment. This, in my opinion, is a different case. A claim to over-payments deriving and deriving only from the terms of an order made under the 1987 Act, or the claim to the existence of such a right, must in my opinion be a matter "arising under" the Act. The terms of <case> are wide and intended to have a wide operation: the legislature has conferred exclusive jurisdiction upon the Compensation
Court not merely in relation to the determination of matters arising under the Act but also in relation to the examination and the hearing of such matters. To examine the terms of the second order to determine whether it is a matter arising under the 1987 Act, is a matter which in my opinion <case> commits exclusively to the Compensation Court.

I am conscious of what has been said in other cases of portions of the reasoning of Bryson J in his judgment in the present case. But I am satisfied that, in the end, those observations, if correct, do not warrant a conclusion different from that to which I have arrived.

Before parting with this appeal, it is proper to refer to one other matter. It may in due course be necessary for this Court to determine whether the
Compensation Court has power to make an order in the form of the second order and, in particular, whether it has power to make an order varying a previous order and, in doing so, to make an order having the literal effect that an employer "have credit for amounts of compensation paid to date". This is a matter to which reference was made in Miller versus CSR Timber Products Pty
Limited. In that case, in dealing with "the overpaid situation": at 616 et seq; I referred to problems of this kind. Sheller JA: at 620 et seq; made particular reference to similar problems and, I think, expressed doubts as to the extent of the powers of the Court in this regard. See also the observations of Cripps JA: at 625-6 and the following pages. In considering a question of that kind, it may, I believe, be necessary to distinguish between the different kinds of cases which may arise. (I put aside any order which in terms requires repayment by the worker of compensation payments already made to him). There may be a situation in which a worker has, as here, received payments pursuant to an order of the Compensation Court, where subsequently that order is varied, to provide that a different set of obligations is deemed to have existed during the earlier times when payments were made, and where provision is made for credit to be given for the payments already made against the new obligations.

A different situation may arise where obligations being varied in such a way, there has been an over-payment and the order purports to entitle the employer to set off the over-payments against its obligation to pay compensation in respect of periods after the making of the (second) varying order.

It would, in my respectful opinion, be extraordinary, and quite unjust, if, the second order having set up a new charter of obligations in respect of the period covered by the first order, payments already made could not be set off against the obligations arising under the second order and accordingly the employer was liable to make compensation payments twice in respect of the same period of incapacity. There would then be "dual payments" upon any view of the meaning of the 1987 Act, and the injustice of this would be apparent.

Where, as the result of the second order, a situation of over-payment has arisen, and it is sought to set off that (past) over-payment against the employer's obligation to pay compensation in the future, different questions arise. The Court will then have to consider, as I suggested it to be, the "policy question": at 616; relating to the position of a worker receiving ongoing compensation.

In the present case, it is not necessary to deal with these matters. The second order provided that, in effect, there should be no future liability for compensation: the order was reduced ultimately to "nil".

However, it is sufficient for present purposes to conclude that, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading the judgments prepared by Mahoney AP and Powell JA and accordingly I need not again recite all the facts. The matter came before Bryson J on a stated case. The facts stated were, in summary, that on 11 October 1982 the Workers Compensation Commission made an award in favour of the respondent, Robert James Thompson, whereunder the appellant, Melesco Manufacturing Pty Limited, was ordered to pay him weekly compensation from 6 October 1981 to continue until the same was "ended, diminished, increased, or redeemed in accordance with the provisions of" the Workers Compensation Act 1926 (the 1926 Act). 
On 6 October 1987 the Compensation Court by consent varied that award from 11
October 1982 and ordered "that [Melesco] have credits for the amounts of compensation paid to date". As the result of the variation of the original award, Melesco had overpaid a sum of $4,397.60 to Mr Thompson in the period between 11 October 1982 and 6 October 1987. Despite requests, he refused or neglected to repay this amount or any part of it. In 1990 Melesco sued Mr
Thompson in the Local Court for money had and received by him for the use of
Melesco. On 27 September 1991 the Local Court found against Melesco on the basis that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the action. By the stated case the Magistrate referred this question of jurisdiction to the
Supreme Court stating "the matter to be determined by the Court is whether my determination was erroneous in point of law". On 12 June 1992 Bryson J determined that the Magistrate's determination was correct and dismissed the appeal.

On various occasions this Court has held that the Compensation Court had no power to order a worker to refund moneys overpaid or wrongfully paid by the employer as compensation except in the particular circumstances referred to in [s58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the Act) as in force at the relevant time: New South Wales Brickworks versus Abi-
Arraj [(1995) 38 NSWLR 94]; Carricks Limited versus Pizzaro [(1995) 38 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281995%29%2038%20NSWLR%20274 "View LawCiteRecord" ) Even this limited power was not available to the Commission or the Court under the 1926 Act. As in force at the time relevant s58 did not apply to this claim.

In Carricks Limited versus Pizzaro this Court held that where an award made in was varied on 29 October 1989 with the effect that it terminated from 30
November 1988, a claim by the employer to recover payments made between 17
October 1988 and 19 October 1989 was not a matter "arising under" the Act within the meaning of s107 of the 1987 Act, which invested the Compensation
Court with exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters so arising. At 278 Priestley JA, with whose reasons I agreed, said: "I do not think [the respondent worker's] arguments prevail against the propositions: that s58 is the only section giving the Compensation Court power to make repayment orders of various kinds; that s58 was limited, at times relevant to this case, to the two particular types of situation earlier mentioned; that accordingly the Compensation Court did not have a restitution jurisdiction except as to the specific subject matter of s58 (1); that the
Local Court would have such jurisdiction unless there was something in the Act taking it away; and finally, that there was nothing express or clearly implied in the Act to support the view that the Local or other courts were being deprived of such jurisdiction except to the extent that s58 and s107 operated in regard to the matters dealt with in s58 (1).

As earlier indicated, it does not follow from what I have said that the employer will necessarily succeed in its claim in the Local Court. I express no opinion on that. It may be that the employer has a prima facie right to recover: see David Securities Pty Limited versus Commonwealth Bank of Australia <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 353] at 378.
David Securities however also recognises possible defences to the claim. The facts before this Court are insufficient for any conclusion to be drawn about the result of the Local Court proceedings. What in my opinion is clear is that the Local Court has jurisdiction to hear and decide the case." 
At 280 Cole JA said: "There is no express provision depriving an employer who has overpaid a worker the right to sue on usual principles of common money counts or constructive trust for recovery of the overpaid sum. The right to recover moneys overpaid, being a common law or equitable right (David Securities Pty Limited v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia at 376), may only be removed by clear statutory enactment: Melbourne Corporation versus Barry <case>; [(1922) 31 CLR 174] at 206; Coco versus The Queen <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 427] at 436.
 .......

In my opinion a claim for moneys overpaid in purported compliance of an award is not a matter `arising under this Act': compare Melesco Manufacturing Pty
Limited versus Thompson (Bryson J, 12 June 1992), unreported) at 18-21. It is a claim for moneys recoverable at common law, and in accordance with equitable principles. It follows, in my view, that the Local Court was not deprived of jurisdiction. The circumstance that s58 has defined two circumstances in which the Compensation Court may address an overpayment, and additional circumstances since 1994 in which it may adjust weekly payments of compensation to take account of overpayments [(s58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)) does not, either explicitly or implicitly, deprive a party who has overpaid moneys in other circumstances of the right to recover such sums in a court of competent jurisdiction. This view accords with the provisional view expressed by Cripps JA in Miller versus CSR Timber Products Pty Limited [(1993) 29 NSWLR ]
at 630-631. In my view, it is also consistent with the legislative intent expressed in [s58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) that, in certain circumstances, courts of general jurisdiction other than the Compensation Court, have jurisdiction to entertain claims for repayment of overpayment of compensation. In my opinion, [s58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) is to be regarded as facultative of jurisdiction of the Compensation Court to rectify overpayment made in the circumstances there referred to, namely, where earnings in truth negate an entitlement to compensation yet payment has been made. It is not to be regarded as restrictive of the general jurisdiction of other courts." 
With respect to those who think otherwise, I am unable to distinguish those cases from the present case. Different considerations will apply to those cases covered by [s55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html) which was inserted in the 1987 Act by the WorkCover Legislation
Amendment Act 1995.

In Miller versus CSR Timber Products Pty Limited at 619, I suggested that the employer would have a claim for restitution against the worker under the general law. In that case, in substance, the overpayments were for periods before any award was made, so that the employer's claim may have required it to demonstrate that voluntary payments were made under a mistake. In the present case the claim would be founded on a logical extension of Lord Field's aphorism in Cox versus Hakes [[1890] 15 AppCas 506] at 547 that "Restitutio in integrum is the right of every successful appellant"; see The
Commonwealth versus McCormack <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR 273] at 276. In Production Spray Painting and Panelbeating Pty
Limited versus Newnham [No 2] [(1991) 27 NSWLR 659] at 661,
Handley JA referred to Commissioner for Railways New South Wales versus Cavanough <case>; [(1935) 53 CLR 220] at 225, where Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ quoted with approval the following passage from 21st ed (1892) of Archbold's
Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (at 226-7): "........ upon the reversal of a judgment against any person convicted of any offence, the judgment, execution and all former proceedings become thereby absolutely null and void [and] he ....... will be entitled to be restored to all things which he may have lost by such erroneous judgment and proceedings, and shall stand in every respect as if he had never been charged with the offence in respect of which judgment was pronounced against him." 
This case was concerned with the effect of the quashing of a conviction for larceny. Handley JA observed: "However the principle is of general application and applies to civil appeals; see McCormack at 276-277 and D M Gordon QC `Effect of Reversal of Judgment on Acts Done Between Pronouncement and Reversal' [(1958) 74 LQR 517] at 521-4." 
Mahoney and Priestley JJA agreed with Handley JA. The nature of such claims is fully and helpfully discussed in Mason and Carter, Restitution Law in
Australia, ch 7, 225-231. See also Burke versus Gillett <case>; [(1996) 1 VR 196] at 201.

We are not concerned with the question whether in this case the common law proceedings in the Local Court should succeed. That is for the Local Court to decide. However, I entirely agree with what Cole JA said in Carricks Limited v Pizzaro at 280. The claim which Melesco brought in the Local Court was for moneys recoverable at common law and was not a matter arising under the 1987
Act.

In my opinion the appeal from Bryson J should be upheld. I agree with the orders proposed by Powell JA.
 
POWELL JA: The present appeal, in my view, serves to highlight the unsatisfactory nature of an appeal, such as this was, by way of case stated, particularly so when the proceedings at first instance, in respect of which the case has been stated, appear to have been conducted in an informal, or irregular, way.

The proceedings at first instance, which were proceedings in the General
Division of the Local Court at the Downing Centre presided over by Godfrey
LCM, were proceedings in which the Appellant - no doubt on behalf of its workers compensation insurer - sought to recover from the Respondent moneys which it claimed to be due to it, in effect, as moneys had and received by the
Respondent to its (the Appellant's) use, the total amount of the money in question being $4,397.60. In the absence of some statutory provision to the contrary, such a claim is one which the Local Court in its General Division might lawfully hear and determine pursuant to the provisions of [s.12(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/s12.html) of the [Local Courts (Civil Claims) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/) ("the [Claims
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/)") which is as follows: - "12(1) Subject to this Part, a court sitting in its General Division has jurisdiction to hear and determine actions for the recovery of any debt, demand or damage (whether liquidated or unliquidated) in which the amount claimed is not more than $40,000.00, whether on a balance of account or after and admitted set off or otherwise." 
Although [s.19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/s19.html) of the [Claims Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/) enumerates certain classes of subject matter in respect of which the Local Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain and determine claims, the claim which the Appellant sought to raise in the proceedings at first instance did not fall within those enumerated classes of subject matter.

The claim which the Appellant sought to raise at first instance arose ultimately from what appears to have been a compensable injury sustained by the Respondent while in the employ of the Appellant at some time prior to
September 1981, an Application for Determination made to the Workers
Compensation Commission ("the Commission") by the Respondent for compensation in respect of that injury; an Award made by the Commission in October 1982 and a later Award made by the Compensation Court in October 1987 in that
Application; and payments made by the Appellant - or its workers compensation insurer - to the Respondent between October 1982 and October 1987 by way of weekly compensation.

At the time when the first of those Awards was made, the Respondent's rights as to compensation, and the powers of the Commission in relation to applications for compensation were governed by the provisions of the Workers
Compensation Act 1926 ("the 1926 Act") which, so far as is relevant to the questions now under consideration, provided (inter alia) as follows: - "36(1) Subject to section 37 of this Act" (which section provided for an appeal on questions of law or in relation to the admission or rejection of evidence) "the Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act, and the action or decision of the Commission shall be final.
 
Nothing in sub-section one of this section shall prevent the Commission from reconsidering any matter which has been dealt with by it, or from rescinding, altering or amending any decision or order previously made, all of which the Commission shall have authority to do. ...........
 (1) Any weekly payments may be reviewed by the Commission at the request of either the employer or the worker, and on such review may be ended, diminished, or increased, subject to the maximum provided by this Act, and the amount of payment shall, in default of agreement, be settled by the Commission.
 .........." 
The 1926 Act contained no provision authorising the Commission, when acting pursuant to the provisions of s.36(2) or s.60(1), to order a worker to refund to his, or her, employer, directly or indirectly, the difference to the date of an Award between the amounts of payments made to the worker and the compensation to which the worker was held to have been entitled.

The Application for Determination, which appears to have been filed in about
September 1981, was dealt with by Thompson J, who, on 11 October 1982, made an
Award (Appeal Book p.8) which, so far as is relevant, was as follows: - "1. That the respondent pay the applicant, on the basis of partial incapacity weekly compensation at the rate of $54 from 6 October 1981, such weekly payment to continue until the same be ended, diminished, increased or redeemed in accordance with the provisions of the Act." 
Thereafter, so it seems, and until 6 October 1987, the Appellant - or its workers compensation insurer - paid to the Respondent compensation in accordance with the Award made by Thompson J. 
When the Compensation Court was created in 1984, the provisions of (inter alia) s.36 of the 1926 Act were repealed, being replaced, in part, by the provisions of [s.17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s17.html) of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) ("the [Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/)"), which, relevantly, provided as follows: - "17. ...
 
Subject to [Part IV"](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/index.html#p4) (which provides for appeals) "a decision or proceeding of the court shall not be vitiated by reason of any informality or want of form; or be liable to be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question by any court.
 
Nothing in sub-section (3) shall prevent the court from reconsidering any matter which has been dealt with by it, or from rescinding, altering or amending any decision previously made or given, all of which the court shall, subject to sub-section (5) have authority to do." and by the new S53G which was inserted into [Part VII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/index.html#p7) of the 1926 Act by the [Workers Compensation (Amendment) Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/wca1984335/) ("the [1984 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/wca1984335/)"), the provisions of which new section, so far as relevant, were as follows: - "53G(1) Subject to [Part IV](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/wca1984335/index.html#p4) of the [Compensation Court Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/)" (which Part deals with appeals) "the Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to examine into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act." 
At the same time, the [1984
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/wca1984335/) also amended the provisions of s.60(1) of the 1926 Act by substituting the word "Court" for the word "Commission" wherever occurring.

In about August 1985 there was filed on behalf of the Respondent in the
Compensation Court an Application for Determination seeking an increase in the amount of weekly compensation provided for in the then existing Award, which
Application appears subsequently to have led to there being filed on behalf of the Appellant an Application for Determination seeking the termination of, or a diminution in the amount of, the weekly compensation provided for in the then existing Award. For some reason which is not revealed by the material before the Court, those Applications were not dealt with until 6 October 1987, when O'Meally CCJ made the second of the Awards to which I have earlier referred.

Before that had occurred, however, the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) ("the [1987 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)") had come into operation on 30 June 1987. So far as is relevant to the matters arising on this appeal, the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) provided as follows: - "55(1) Any weekly payment of compensation may, because of a change of circumstances, be reviewed by a commissioner at the request of the employer or the worker or of the Board. 
On any such review - the weekly payment may be ended, reduced or increased (but subject to the provisions of this Division relating to the amount of the weekly payment); ..........
 
A commissioner may review a weekly payment of compensation even though it is made under an award of the Compensation Court (whether before or after the commencement of this section).
 ..........
 (1) If, because of a worker's return to employment or a change in employment that affects the worker's earnings - the worker is not entitled under this Act to any weekly payments of compensation that have been paid to the worker; or the amount of any weekly payments for compensation that have been paid to the worker exceed the amount to which the worker is entitled under this Act, a commissioner may order the worker to refund to the person who made the payments any amount to which the worker is not entitled in respect of payments during any period not exceeding 2 years from the date of payment.
 
Any such refund may, in accordance with the terms of the commissioner's order, be deducted from future weekly payments of compensation to the worker or be recovered as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.
 ..........
 (1) The commissioners have (subject to this Act and the [Compensation Court Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/)) exclusive jurisdiction to examine, here and determine all matters arising under this Act.
 .........." 
It will be observed that, notwithstanding the provision in s.58 for the making of an order for a refund of excess payments, s.55 contained no similar provision.

When the Applications for Determination which had been filed by the Respondent and the Appellant respectively came before O'Meally CCJ on 6 October 1987, his
Honour - apparently by consent - made an Award (Appeal Book p.7) which, so far as is relevant, was as follows: - "(a) That the weekly compensation payable under the Award dated 11 October 1982 in matter No. 11687 of 1981 be varied to - $80 from 11th October 1982 to 30th June 1983.
 $NIL from 1st July 1983 to 24th May 1985.
 $179 from 25th May 1985 to 28th July 1985.
 $57 from 29th July 1985 to 30th June 1986.
 $46 from 1st July 1986 to 30th June 1987.
 $NIL from 1st July 1987.
 ..........
 
That the respondent have credit for amounts of compensation paid to date." 
The material which is before the Court does not disclose the basis, or bases, upon which the variations made by O'Meally CCJ to the original Award were made, or calculated. 
It is said that, as the result of the variation of the original Award, the
Appellant has overpaid the Respondent $3,641.60 in respect of the period between 11 October 1982 and 30 June 1987, and $756.00 in respect of the period between 1 July 1987 and 6 October 1987, the total overpayment being $4,397.60.

Although, in my view - and there was no submission to the contrary - they do not bear directly on the questions to be determined on this appeal, the following amendments to the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) which have been made since 6 October 1987 might be noted.

The Workers Compensation (Compensation Court) Amendment Act 1989 made the following amendments to the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/): in each of [ss.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s56.html) and [58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) the words "the Compensation Court" were substituted for the words "a commissioner" and "the commissioner" wherever occurring; in [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) the words "Compensation Court's" were substituted for the word "commissioner's" wherever occurring; s.107 was omitted and there was substituted the following: "107. Subject to this Act and the [Compensation Court Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/), the Compensation Court has exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters arising under this Act (except Part 5)." (Part 5 of the Act deals with Common Law Remedies.) 
The Workers Compensation Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1994 further amended [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/): by inserting in [s.58(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) after "2 years" the words and symbols "(or such shorter or longer period as the Court considers to be appropriate)"; and by inserting after [s.58(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) a new sub-section reading - 
Without limiting this section, the Compensation Court may make such orders as it thinks fit for the adjustment of weekly payments of compensation to a worker to take account of any overpayments made to the worker (whether or not in the circumstances referred to in sub-s.(1)) in respect of any previous period." 
The Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment Act 1995 further amended [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/): by inserting in [s.58(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) after the words "under this Act" the words and symbols "(including under the former Act)"; by inserting after s.58(4) a new sub-section reading: "(5) In this section: a reference to the worker's return to employment includes a reference to the worker's commencing employment, and a reference to employment includes a reference to employment in the worker's own business." 
The WorkCover Legislation Amendment Act 1995 amended [s.55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html) of the [1987 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) by inserting after [s.55(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html) a new sub-section reading: "2A. If on any such review a weekly payment of compensation is ended or reduced with effect from a day that is earlier than the date of the Compensation Courts order on the review, the Compensation Court may order the worker to refund the amount of any payments made to the worker to which the worker is not entitled as a result of the order on the review." 
As will later appear, some, at least, of the these varying amendments appear to have been brought about by decisions of this Court, in particular, the decisions on Czysnok v. Jaques Limited [1] and Miller v. CSR Timber Products Pty. Limited 2 and, perhaps, New South Wales State Brickworks v. Abi-Arraj 3.

The material which is before the Court on this appeal reveals little of what occurred in the Local Court leading up to the determination by Godfrey LCM which gave rise to these proceedings. Although it seems clear enough that, at some time, which is not revealed by the material which is before the Court, those proceedings were commenced by the filing of a Statement of Claim - later amended - in which the Appellant sought to recover from the Respondent the amounts to which I have earlier referred, the material which is before the court does not reveal whether or not any Notice of Grounds of Defence (Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Rules 1988 ("the Claims Rules") were filed on behalf of the Respondent - what, if any, grounds of defence might have been taken in any such Notice of Grounds of Defence; nor the manner in which nor the basis upon which the matter came to be heard by Godfrey LCM. It would, however, appear that, although neither the [Claims
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/) nor the
Claims Rules provides for any such procedure, it was agreed between the parties that there should be tried as a preliminary issue - for which purpose the allegations in the Appellant's Amended Statement of Claim were to be accepted as true - the question whether the Local Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Appellant's claim.

It would further seem that the submissions advanced on behalf of the Appellant in relation to that issue proceeded along the following lines (Appeal Book pp.
-5): the Compensation Court had no jurisdiction to order the repayment or adjustment by way of set off of overpayments of weekly compensation under the Act; the Compensation Court had only limited jurisdiction to order the repayment or adjustment of overpayments of weekly compensation under the 1987
Act,which power was derived from s.58 of that Act, and that s.58 of that Act did not so operate as to exclude common law remedies where overpayments were not recoverable pursuant to the provisions of s.58; .
[s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) was not retrospective in its operation so as to apply to payments of weekly compensation made prior to 1 July 1987 pursuant to the provisions of the 1926
Act; even if [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) operated so as to preclude jurisdiction in relation to payments made after 30 June , the Local Court nonetheless retained jurisdiction to deal with the claim insofar as it related to overpayments made prior to that date.

It would further seem that the submissions advanced in relation to that issue on behalf of the Respondent proceeded along the following lines (Appeal Book p.5): by virtue of the provisions of ss. 36 (later s.53G) and 60 of the 1926 Act and of [ss.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html) and of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) the
Compensation Court had jurisdiction to deal with questions concerning overpayments of weekly compensation whensoever made; .
[s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) was retrospective in its operation so as to apply to payments of weekly compensation made prior to 1 July 1987; .
[s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) was the only means by which recovery of overpayments could be effected and operated to the exclusion of all other remedies; in those circumstances the Local Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the question of recovery of overpayments whensoever made by the
Appellant to the Respondent.

In the event, Godfrey LCM, in what I can only describe as a rather cryptic judgment, held that the Local Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Appellant's claim and ordered that the proceedings be dismissed with costs.

Thereafter, at the request of the Appellant, Godfrey LCM stated a case for the opinion of the Court.

The hearing of the case stated took place before Bryson J, then sitting in the
Common Law Division of the Court, in June 1992. In the Judgment which he was to deliver on 12 June 1992, Bryson J expressed the view that the determination made by Godfrey LCM was correct and that, accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Although I find the process of reasoning by which his
Honour reached that conclusion a little difficult to follow, it seems to be that the Appellant's claim to recover the overpayment was one which could be considered by the Compensation Court pursuant to the provisions of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) and that, accordingly, the provisions of s.107 of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) rendered the Compensation Court's jurisdiction to deal with that claim exclusive of the jurisdiction of any other court.

The Appellant thereafter appealed to this court.

When the appeal came on for hearing, Mr. P.M. Hall Q.C. appeared with Mr. J.T.
Gleeson for the Appellant, while Mr. D. Letcher Q.C. appeared with Mr. A.
Howen for the Respondent.

Although, in both the Notice of Appeal which was filed on its behalf and in the Written Submissions which were prepared by its counsel, the Appellant had sought to submit that the Local Court had jurisdiction to entertain the claim in respect of both the overpayments made prior to, and the overpayments made after, 30 June 1987, on the hearing, Mr. Hall informed the Court that, for reasons which he briefly outlined (Transcript p.2), the Appellant did not seek an argument as to the jurisdiction of the Local Court to deal with the overpayments made after 30 June 1987.

The submissions advanced on behalf of the Appellant in relation to the jurisdiction of the Local Court to entertain the Appellant's claim to recover the amounts overpaid in respect of the period prior to 30 June 1987 proceeded along the following lines: the 1926 Act did not evince a legislative intention to deprive an employer of a right to seek recovery of overpayments in a court which otherwise had jurisdiction to entertain such a claim: the 1926 Act did not contain any provision which authorised the
Compensation Court to order the refund of overpayments; neither s.60 of the 1926 Act nor [s.17(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s17.html) of the [Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) provided the Compensation Court with any such power, nor was that deficiency remedied by the provisions of s.36(1) of the 1926 Act, the provisions of which section are in substance the same as those contained in s.107 of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) which latter section has been held not to confer on the Compensation Court jurisdiction to order the repayment of overpayments except in the cases provided for by [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (New
South Wales State Brickworks v. Abi-Arraj 4; Carricks Limited v. Pizzaro ); there being no provision in the 1926 Act which specifically, or generally, conferred on the Compensation Court jurisdiction to order workers to make refunds to employers, the 1926 Act could not be taken as evincing a legislative intention to remove the right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to seek recovery of overpayments (Carricks Limited v. Pizzaro ); the provisions of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), as they were at the date of the hearing before Godfrey LCM, were not such as to deprive courts of competent jurisdiction of jurisdiction to entertain and determine a claim for recovery of overpayment made prior to the commencement of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/): [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), as it stood prior to the amendment made by the Workers Compensation Legislation
Amendment Act 1995, did not have retrospective operation and, thus, did not authorise the Compensation Court to order refunds by a worker to an employer where the amounts in question were ordered to be paid under the 1926 Act and were paid before the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) came into operation (Czysnok v. Jaques Limited 7); nor did s.107 of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) confer on the Compensation Court jurisdiction to order a refund of overpayments (New
South Wales State Brickworks v. Abi-Arraj 8); since neither [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) nor s.107 of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) conferred on the Compensation Court jurisdiction to order a refund of payments made prior to 1 July 1987, and since there was no other provision which did so, it followed that the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) did not operate to deprive a court of competent jurisdiction of jurisdiction to hear and determine claims for the recovery of overpayments made prior to the commencement of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (Carricks Limited v. Pizzaro 9).

Although I found the submissions of the Respondent rather difficult to follow, they appeared to be as follows: since the claim which the Appellant sought to advance at first instance depended upon, and arose out of, the exercise by O'Meally CCJ of the powers under [s.55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html), of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), that claim was a matter "arising under" the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/); this being so, the Compensation Court had, and has, to the exclusion of any other court, jurisdiction to entertain the Appellant's claim; the decision of this Court in New South Wales State Brickworks v. Abi-
Arraj 10 and Carricks Limited v. Pizzaro 11 are to be distinguished upon the bases that, whereas, in the instant case, the award made by O'Meally CCJ varied the award made by Thompson J, both as to the amount of weekly compensation payable, and as to the periods during which weekly compensation was payable, the bases upon which those variations were made not being revealed by the material before the Court: in New South Wales Brickworks v. Abi-Arraj 12 the variation of the original award had been made upon the basis that, in a relevant respect, the original award had been made upon a false factual premise; and in Carricks Limited v. Pizzaro 13 the relevant award, although terminating an entitlement to receive weekly compensation as from a date earlier than that to which payments had been made, did not otherwise vary the original award.

It seems to me that the issues which are raised for determination upon this appeal are: what is the true nature of the claim which the Appellant in the proceedings at first instance sought to have heard and determined; was that claim one which, as the law then stood, the Compensation Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine; was the jurisdiction of the Local Court otherwise to hear and determine the claim made by the Appellant at first instance excluded by the provisions of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) as they then stood.

Although - since the facts of the case are not fully disclosed by the material which is before the Court - it is not possible to predict, with any confidence, the likely outcome of the claim made by the Appellant, it seems clear enough that the claim which the Appellant sought to raise at first instance was one based upon "the law of restitution" or the concept of "unjust enrichment", the basis of that claim being that the payments which, prior to June 1987, had been made by, or on behalf of, the Appellant to the
Respondent had been made, not under the 1926 Act, but in the belief, later, by the use of the powers under one or other or both of the provisions of s.60 of the 1927 Act or [s.17(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s17.html) of the [Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/), or one or other or both of [s.55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) or [s.17(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s17.html) of the [Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/), shown to have been mistaken, that they were made pursuant to the Award made by
Thompson J (and, thus, under the 1926 Act) see, for example, David
Securities Pty. Limited v. Commonwealth Bank of Australia 14.

The Compensation Court being a statutory court, it had no jurisdiction to order a refund to an employer of amounts overpaid in the absence of a provision in the relevant statutes, and, then, only in the circumstances provided for in the relevant statutes (Miller v. CSR Timber Products Pty.
Limited 15; New South Wales State Brickworks v. Abi-Arraj 16). The provisions of [s.55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s55.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) as they were in 1991 not authorising the Compensation Court to make any order for refunds and amounts overpaid, and the provisions of [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), as they were in 1991, authorising an order for a refund of amounts overpaid only in the two cases there provided for, and the provisions of [s.58](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s58.html) of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) as they were in 1991, in any event, not being retrospective (Czynok v. Jaques
Limited 17) the Compensation Court then had no jurisdiction to order the
Respondent to refund to the Appellant the amounts which, by reason of the making by O'Meally CCJ of the second Award, were revealed as having been overpaid.

The right, in an appropriate case, in reliance upon "the law of restitution" or the concept of "unjust enrichment" to seek to recover moneys paid under a mistake as to law being right under the general law, that right may only be removed by clear statutory enactment (see, for example, Coco v. The Queen ). Given that, in the absence of an express power authorising the
Compensation Court to order a refund of payments overpaid, the Appellant's claim arose under "the law of restitution" or the concept of "unjust enrichment", that claim, in 1991, was not "a matter arising under (the 1987)
Act" and s.107 of the [1987
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) did not operate to prevent the Local Court from entertaining and determining that claim.

It does not, however, follow that the Appellant would necessarily succeed in its claim in the Local Court. Although it would appear, on such little material as is before this Court, that the Appellant has a prima facie right to recover the amounts overpaid, it is to be remembered that, in David
Securities Pty. Limited v. Commonwealth Bank of Australia 19, the High Court recognised possible defences to such a claim and, as the facts in this case are not fully known to this Court, it would be unwise to offer any opinion as to the possible outcome in the Local Court - that will be a matter for the
Local Court to determine in the light of any defence which may have been, or which may be, raised to the claim, and after considering the whole of the evidence which may be tendered on the hearing.

For these reasons I would propose the following Orders:
Order that the appeal be upheld.
Order that the orders made by Bryson J be set aside and that, in lieu thereof, the question in the case stated be answered "yes" and the case be remitted to the Local Court for it to hear and determine the Appellant's claim in accordance with law.
Order that the Respondent pay the costs of the Appellant of the appeal, of the hearing before Bryson J and of the hearing before Godfrey LCM.
Order that the Respondent, if qualified, have a Certificate under the [Suitors Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/).
