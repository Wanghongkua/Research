Spitzer and Anor versus Figtree Drive-In Discounts Pty Ltd and Ors Matter No /96 [1997] NSWSC 573 (21 November 1997) ` 
Leslie Spitzer & Anor versus Figtree Drive-In Discounts` `Pty Ltd & Ors` ` 4582/96` `21 November 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` `  /96 LESLIE SPITZER & ANOR V FIGTREE DRIVE-IN` ` DISCOUNTS PTY LTD & ORS` `  `
 `JUDGMENT` 
HIS HONOUR: This is a motion for separate trial. 
The parties are involved as shareholders in the first defendant company, the plaintiffs holding a quarter interest and the second and third defendants a three-quarter interest. The plaintiffs sue under s260 of the Corporations Law for a compulsory sale of their shares on the basis that there has been oppression. The defendants deny oppression.

The land on which the business is held is owned by the parties and is separate from the business. There is no lease or, as far as I can see, fiduciary relationship.

In the cross claim, the defendants seek to have an order under [s66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). Such an order is made almost as of course except in very special cases. The usual valid defences are that: partition is preferable to sale, or that there is something against the conscience of the person seeking relief, which makes it inequitable to make an order.

In the instant case (a) is not present, and I do not think (b) is either, but
I have not really directed my mind fully to determine that question.

Ordinarily, if there is some other forensic or commercial reason why an order under [s66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) might not be expedient, it seems to me that the practice has been either (a) to grant a short adjournment of the application so that relief can be obtained in another place, such as the Family Court (Williams versus Williams [[1979] 1
NSWLR 376], 383); or (b) to make the order, vest the property in the trustees, make the appropriate orders under [s66H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66h.html) and s[66I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66i.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) and leave it to the good commercial sense of the trustees for sale as to when they sell, with the expectation that should there be a serious dispute between the beneficiaries that judicial advice would be sought.

In the present case, the two issues of the oppression in the company and the right to sell the land owned by the individuals appear to be discrete.
Although the court does not ordinarily make an order under Part 31 of the
Supreme Court Rules for separate trials unless there is some good reason for it, in my view, where one has completely discrete issues and prima facie there is little defence to one issue, then it is best to separate that issue and dispose of it first.

Accordingly, I will make an order for separate trial of the cross claim under [s66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) and will fix the trial to take place before me at 10 am on Friday 28 November 1997, and
I will reserve the costs of this motion.
