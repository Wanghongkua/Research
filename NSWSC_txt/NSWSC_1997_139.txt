Eighth Srj Pty Ltd V Merity [1997] NSWSC 139 (17 April 1997) `EIGHTH SRJ PTY LTD V MERITY` `3667/94` `Tuesday 25 March 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: These proceedings arise out of a failed conveyancing transaction at Woollahra. The property at 4 Fletcher Street Woollahra was, at all material times prior to May 1994, property of which the plaintiff was the registered proprietor. The plaintiff is a company with no assets which it owns beneficially, being the trustee of a trading trust known as the "Philadelphia
Trust". Its controller is Andrew James Abercrombie, a non-practising solicitor. The defendant, John Merity, is also a solicitor. ` ` On about 5 May 1994, Mr Merity entered into a contract for the sale of land in the 1992 edition of the standard form to purchase 4 Fletcher Street from the plaintiff for $675,000. He paid a 10% deposit, that is $67,500. The contract contained a series of special conditions of which it is only necessary to set out special conditions 23 and 27 which were as follows:-` `"Whole of Agreement` `23. The Vendor shall not be bound or obliged in any way` ` by any representation, warranty, condition, promise` ` or other statement made by the Vendor or any other` ` person or corporation acting or purporting to act on` ` behalf of the Vendor unless the same is set out in` ` writing in full in this Agreement.` `Condition of Property` `27. The Purchaser acknowledges that he is purchasing` ` the property in its present condition and state of` ` repair and enters into this Agreement consequent` ` upon his own inspection of the property and subject` ` to any infestation and dilapidation and that the` ` Vendor has not nor has any one on the Vendor's` ` behalf made any representation with respect to the` ` condition of the property and the Purchaser shall ` ` make no objection or requisition or claim for` ` compensation in respect of the same. "` ` The property had at all material times been let by the plaintiff to tenants, the managing agent being Oxbridge Real Estate. Oxbridge Real Estate had unsuccessfully endeavoured to sell the property on behalf of the plaintiff.
The fifth cross defendant, Mrs Resch, was friendly with Mr Abercrombie and she suggested to Mr Abercrombie that her employer, the third cross defendant,
Nickelby Pty Ltd which trades as WJ Bridges Real Estate, might be able to sell the property on his behalf. Mr Abercrombie indicated that he was not prepared to pay any advertising expenses, but that if WJ Bridges Real Estate was the cause of a sale, he would pay certain commission and he made a key available to Mrs Resch. The fourth cross defendant, William Bridges, is the controlling officer of the third cross defendant and is also, it would appear, employed by it.` ` On 30 April 1994, Mrs Resch inserted an advertisement for the property in
The Sydney Morning Herald notifying anyone who was interested that 4 Fletcher
Street would be open for inspection between 11.30 am and 12.30 pm that day.
The advertisement also stated "AMAZING VALUE for under $700,000. Max. living style with min. maintenance ... JUST MOVE IN AND ENJOY". ` ` The same day Mr John Merity and his wife Christina inspected the property and spoke to Mrs Resch about it. Mr Merity told Mrs Resch that he and his wife were "looking for ... a property in good repair ... which is low maintenance" and Mrs Resch said, "This property will satisfy those requirements. All it needs is a good coat of paint." Mrs Merity then said "We want something ...
that, most importantly, hardly needs anything doing to it." Mrs Resch replied "You don't have to do a thing."` ` Although there was some confusion about the dates and number of occasions when the Meritys returned to the property before the contract was entered into, it would seem relatively plain on the balance of the evidence (though nothing really turns on this), that they returned within seven days with a Mr
Embury, an interior designer. At this time Mrs Resch said "You will enjoy it here. You will have nothing to spend" and again in answer to a question from
Mr Merity that "It ... should require minimal maintenance" Mrs Resch said "Yes
I agree. All you have to do is move into it. It is ideal for your requirements."` ` Mr Merity was friendly with Mr Bridges and it would seem the two of them jogged on Bondi Beach together. During the week in question Mr Merity telephoned Mr Bridges and made it clear that he was looking for "a smaller hassle-free place" and mentioned that he had been talking to Mrs Resch about 4
Fletcher Street. He said Mr Bridges replied "This will suit you perfectly."` ` Mr Merity did not request any pest report before contract. However, after contracts were exchanged, he asked Mrs Resch to obtain a pest certificate. Mrs
Resch approached Mr Joyce, who was a person who, from time to time, supplied pest reports for estate agents in the Woollahra area. Unbeknown to Mrs Resch,
Mr Joyce had in fact been retained by Mr Abercrombie to control termites on the property over a period of some years. ` ` On 8 June 1994 or thereabouts, Mr Joyce delivered his report to WJ Bridges
Real Estate. A glance at the report told Mrs Resch that it was not a good report. She held the report and, it would appear, negotiated with Mr Joyce to see if she could obtain a clean report. It would seem that her hope was that
Mr Abercrombie would agree to pay $1,500 which would enable Mr Joyce to do the work he had suggested which would have enabled him to issue a fresh and clean certificate. Mr Abercrombie, however, was not prepared to do this. Mr Joyce was outraged at the suggestion that he should issue a clean report and insisted that he get permission to speak to the purchaser. ` ` Mr and Mrs Merity did not receive Mr Joyce's report until 6 July. Mrs Resch was very severely criticised in cross examination for withholding the report, especially seeing it was a report which was ordered by and paid for by the purchaser. Mrs Merity spoke to Mr Joyce and she became very concerned about the problem disclosed in the report and also concerned about the fact that chemicals had been used to treat termite infestation in the past. Mrs
Merity was a person who had a horror of chemical sprays, and in particular, was concerned that her daughter, who suffered from asthma, should not be exposed to chemicals. ` ` Mr Merity, who had been acting for himself at this stage, then retained solicitors, Messrs Colquhoun Murphy of Canberra. ` `On 15 July 1994, that firm wrote to Gells, the vendor's solicitors, a letter, the material part of which is as follows:-` ` "We are instructed that:-` ` 1. In negotiations between your client's agent Ms` ` Marcia Resch of WJ Bridges Real Estate Pty Ltd for` ` the sale and purchase of ... 4 Fletcher Street,` ` Woollahra ("the property") Ms Resch represented to` ` our client and our client's wife on several` ` occasions that the property was sound and in good` ` repair and free from pest infestation.` ` ...` ` 5. On 8th June 1994 a pest certificate accompanied` ` by a covering letter from Mr Joyce was delivered to` ` the agent.` ` 6. Ms Resch withheld the report from our client` ` until 6th July 1994.` ` 7. Mr Joyce has informed our client that your ` ` client and the agent attempted to induce Mr Joyce` ` to give the purchaser a "clean report" ...` ` 8. On 7th July Kevin Joyce Pest Services Pty Ltd` ` provided the purchasers with a report detailing` ` the history of extensive termite infestation on` ` the property which he had been treating for 4 ` ` years without success.` ` Based on these instructions we have advised our client that your client by its agent fraudulently represented to our client that the property was free of pest infestation by which he was induced to enter into the contract. He is therefore entitled to rescind the contract and further to sue the agent for damages.` ` We hereby give you notice that our client rescinds the contract entered into between your client 8 SRJ Pty Ltd and our client John Lindsay Merity on 5 May .` ` Please authorise the agent to return the deposit."` ` ` ` Gells replied on 18 July indicating that they were seeking instructions and suggesting that it might be better to choose a procedure for applying for a declaration as to the validity of the contract before too much damage was done so that the parties did not get themselves into a situation where legal costs exceeded the damages. This brought a response on 21 July that "Our client has elected to rescind the contract. It is a matter for your client to choose what action it takes."` ` On 26 July 1994 Gells wrote, "We were hoping your client would reconsider his position and hope he will do so again.` ` "Your letters amount to a declaration by your client of repudiation of his obligations under the contract ...` ` "In the hope that your client will reconsider his position we reply in detail to each of your allegations"` ` They then did so and then indicated that unless there was a reaffirmation of the contract by 2 August 1994 there would be a notice of termination sent on the basis of repudiation. On 15 August 1994 the vendor terminated the contract pursuant to its threat. ` ` The plaintiff commenced these proceedings on 6 September 1994. Its statement of claim sought a declaration that its termination was valid and an order that the deposit, which had been paid into court by the agent, should be paid out to it. Its claim also contained the words "alternatively damages".` ` When the case opened, Mr Alexis for the plaintiff, said that the case the plaintiff made was for damages for loss of bargain. I pointed out that even though paragraph 16 of the amended statement of claim pleaded that the plaintiff had suffered a loss of benefits, there was no prayer for damages apart from the words "alternatively damages". Mr Alexis said he did not wish to amend and the case proceeded.` ` Mr Merity's amended defence denied repudiation. He also filed a cross claim (the first cross claim) against (a) the plaintiff and Mr Abercrombie; and (b) the third, fourth and fifth cross defendants. As against the plaintiff and Mr
Abercrombie, Mr Merity sought a declaration that he was entitled to terminate, alternatively a declaration that he had rescinded the contract, alternatively an order that the court rescind the contract, alternatively an order that the court declare the contract void under <case> of the Trade Practices Act, return of the deposit under <case>(2A) of the Conveyancing Act and damages under the
Trade Practices Act for false and misleading conduct. As against the other cross defendants, damages were sought under the Trade Practices Act for false and misleading conduct.` ` The second, third and fourth cross claims endeavoured to lay off any blame or responsibility for misbehaviour under the Trade Practices Act to one or other of the parties.` ` It seems to me that the questions for determination are:` `1. Were the defendant's letters of 15 and 21 July 1994 a repudiation of the contract or a proper rescission or termination?` `2. If there was a repudiation, is the plaintiff entitled to damages, and if so, what is the quantum of such damages?` `3. Is the defendant entitled to relief under <case>(2A) of the Conveyancing
Act?` `4. Has there been any operative false or misleading conduct by the estate agents or the vendor under the Trade Practices Act or Fair Trading Act and if so, by whom?` `5. Should any, and if so, what relief be granted to atone for any of such false or misleading conduct?` `6. How should the burden of such relief be borne?` ` Having dealt with those matters I will then deal with 7, the orders that should be made in the proceedings.` ` I will deal with these issues in turn.` `` `1. As a general rule, a person may only rescind a contract if there is a recognized vitiating factor present and restitutio ad integrum can be given.
Furthermore, a party may unilaterally terminate a contract only if he or she is entitled to do so under a provision of the contract or if there is a breach of condition or a fundamental breach.` ` The letter of 15 July relied on a fraudulent misrepresentation. No such fraudulent misrepresentation was pleaded or relied on at the hearing before me. Mr Merity relied on an alleged innocent misrepresentation as to the termite infestation, or a defect in the property which entitled him to rescind. So far as termination is concerned, (as opposed to rescission), there was some reliance on the vendor's failure to comply with clause 12 of the contract. Further these defects were relied on to constitute a case under the
Trade Practices Act which is dealt with under question 4 below.` ` I will deal first with rescission as opposed to termination or relief under the Trade Practices Act.` ` A very fine, but real, distinction exists between defects in title which entitle a person to rescind and defects in quality which do not. What is a defect in title is difficult to define, but usually encompasses the situation where the vendor is unable to convey the full estate which it promised to convey to the purchaser. A defect in quality merely means that the purchaser obtains the appropriate title to the land but that there are some facts relating to the quality of the property sold which affects its value. As good an example as any is `Long versus Worona Pty Ltd ` (1973) 1 BPR 9109 where a house was sold when it was in the process of being reconstructed and the builder who carried out the work had not done so in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. Notwithstanding this, Helsham, J held that there was a mere defect in quality and the purchaser was not entitled to rescind. I will return to this case in due course. Recently, the NSW Court of
Appeal has affirmed the very real difference between defects in title and defects in quality and has made it clear that town planning defects fall into the second category; see `Carpenter versus McGrath ` ``(1996) NSW ConvR 55-788.
` ` `Williams on Vendor and Purchaser` ``4th ed vol 2 p 766 says of defects in quality, "Not only is there no legal obligation upon a vendor of land to disclose to the purchaser any defects known to him in the quality of the thing sold, but further the vendor is not bound to disabuse the purchaser of any erroneous belief, which the purchaser has formed, and which the vendor knows that the other has formed, as to the quality of the purchase property. A vendor may well sell a house, which has got dry rot in all the woodwork and is badly drained, to a purchaser, who knows nothing of these defects, but believes to the knowledge of the vendor that the house is in good repair and well drained, yet the purchaser will not be entitled to claim the rescission of the contract; provided always that the vendor made no representation as to the quality of the thing sold, and did not actively conceal the defect." Even if the defect in quality means that the house is positively noxious such as the situation where it was infected with small pox there will be no right to rescind though the court may decline specific performance. `Williams ` ``in fact cites no direct authority for his proposition though the cases he refers to in analogous situations may provide a basis for it. However, his statement has been accepted as being the law by most conveyancers including `Farrand` ``in the 18th edition of `Emmet on Title `at p 120. In my view it does represent the law. The only qualification that may have to be put on it is that if what is sold is a dwelling house and it is impossible to live in the house because of some public health law, then one may get to the stage of there being a defect in title; cf the obiter of Bacon, VC in `Chester v
Powell` `` [(1885) 52 LT 722], 723. ` ` Is the defect in the instant case, a defect in title or merely a defect in quality? I have not been able to find any relevant cases dealing with pest infestation nor have counsel referred me to any such cases. Termites were the subject of the Western Australian Full Court's decision in `Van Den Esschert v Chappell ` [[1960] WAR 114], but that was a case of fraudulent misrepresentation before contract that the property was termite free. There are also a couple of cases dealing with dry rot (`Adams versus Richardson & Starling Ltd ` [[1969] 1 WLR 1645] and `Gordon versus Selico Co Ltd ` [[1986] 1 EGLR 71)], but neither of these bear on the present case. ` ` The most recent case allied to the current topic that I have been able to find is `Kadissi versus Jankovic ` <case>; [[1987] VR 255.] In that case, when the purchasers inspected a building, they saw some minor cracks in the walls that needed filling and repainting but nothing to suggest there were any structural difficulties in the building. In fact, over the last four to twelve years there had been considerable bad cracking because of shrinkage and drainage works and various levies had been made on body corporate members. The vendor did nothing to alert the purchasers as to this problem. Crockett, J held that in the absence of fraudulent concealment or of actual misrepresentation or express agreement, there was no reason why the purchasers should be able to rescind the contract. He postponed the question as to whether the deposit should be returned. ` ` In the instant case it is clear that there had been a termite problem in the property. Mr Joyce had been treating the property for four years, yet there were still, what Mr Joyce concluded, hidden termite nests in some obscure place from which termites were eating the studs and joists. In January 1994,
Mr Joyce had put some powder in strategic places and was of the view that the probabilities were that the termites would take the powder back to their nest and would be eradicated. Mr Joyce reported to the plaintiff in January 1994 that he had provided a "Termite service. Removed panels to lounge, dining and kitchen areas and treated active termites. Replaced timber and replastered on /1/94. THERE IS DEFINITELY A HIDDEN NEST IN THE STUD WALLS. I HAVE ORGANISED
A HALF YEARLY CHECK AND SHOULD WE FIND AN EARLY PROBLEM, THE WALLS WILL HAVE
TO BE OPENED AND INSPECTED." Mr Abercrombie swore that whilst he realized there had been termite problems from time to time, he was certain that Mr
Joyce had indicated to him in January 1994 that the problem would be fixed permanently by the treatment that Mr Joyce had given. Mr Joyce did say to Mrs
Merity in July 1996 that he suggested to Mr Abercrombie that if the powdering was effective the termites would carry it back to their nest which would have solved the problem permanently but he then discussed what would happen if this did not occur. Mr Abercrombie agrees that something like this was said by Mr
Joyce to him, but his interpretation of Mr Joyce's statement was that the treatment would be permanent. I find it very hard to accept this evidence, and on reflection I do not accept it. Mr Abercrombie came across as a very experienced man in law and in property and it is very difficult to see how such a person could have interpreted Mr Joyce's memorandum or the conversation in the way he says he did interpret them. This, however, does not take the case very much further forward as one has the situation of a vendor at least believing that the treatment of January 1994 may well fix the problem with termites.` ` I should add that there was an objection to a question put to Mr Abercrombie in re-examination as to why he did not mention Mr Joyce's January findings to
Mrs Resch. I thought at the time that the answer would probably be irrelevant, but, as I was not sure, I had the answer recorded and reserved on its admissibility. As matters have turned out, my view of the answer's irrelevancy is confirmed and I thus reject the last question and answer on p 138 of the transcript. ` ` Mr Joyce's further inspection was that there was still a problem but that it could be fixed for $1,500. Mr Abercrombie was unwilling to pay the $1,500, saying it was the purchaser's problem: Mr Merity was unwilling to pay the money and also to have chemicals used, so that for the sake of $1,500 five counsel spent three days in the Supreme Court arguing about the consequences.
There were other expert pest exterminators who gave evidence. The gravamen of their evidence was that there had been termite activity in the past which had affected some of the timbers, but there was little current activity as at .` ` It is not necessary for the present purpose to go into this evidence too thoroughly because one has the situation where, if there is any defect, it is clearly a mere defect in quality under the definitions examined earlier. The evidence is that whilst there was some termite affectation of the property, the problem could be cured for abut $1,500. ` ` Mr Sullivan QC, who appeared with Ms Hogan-Doran for Mr Merity, alternatively relied on an innocent misrepresentation. This innocent misrepresentation would, he submitted, lead a court of equity to decline specific performance and order rescission. ` ` Mr Sullivan QC relied on the leading case of `Redgrave versus Hurd ` [(1881) Ch D 1.] The ratio decidendi of that case was that where a statement was made by a person which that person now knows to be false, equity will not permit him or her to keep that contract as no person ought to seek to take advantage of his or her own false statement (pp 12 and 13). ` ` The problem with that formulation is that it is very difficult here to find a false representation even made innocently. I accept the evidence of Mrs
Resch that she had no cause to suspect that anything that she said about the property was in any way false or that she had any knowledge at all that there was any termite problem with the property. Mr Abercrombie at least thought that there was a good chance that the past termite problem was no longer a problem because of the powdering which Mr Joyce had put into effect in January
He never actually said anything to the purchaser or to the agents about the problem. I find it difficult to find any representation that the property was free of termites. ` ` The purchaser relies on five alleged representations, the first allegedly made in the newspaper advertisement of 30 April 1994, the second, third and fourth made by Mrs Resch at the initial inspection and when Mr Embury inspected respectively, and the fifth by Mr Bridges. ` ` The case is made easier for me factually because there is no denial that the advertisement was published or that the words which Mr and Mrs Merity say were uttered by Mrs Resch and Mr Bridges were so uttered. However it is a completely different matter to say that they had the meaning that there was a representation that there were no termites.` ` It was common background that WJ Bridges Real Estate knew that Mr Merity and his wife formerly owned a larger home and had some very nice possessions, but that because some children had moved out of the home, they had disposed of it, were currently renting, and wanted a smaller home which required little day to day work to keep it looking spick and span. Accordingly, the attraction of "min maintenance" to quote the newspaper advertisement was, to my mind, aimed at giving purchasers the impression that there was little to do to keep the house spick and span week by week rather than going towards any structural problems. However, this is not the whole of the answer to the defendant's claim because the advertisement in its last line goes on to make the assertion that the purchaser might just "move in and enjoy" and one of Mrs Resch's statements was that "You will have nothing to spend". Again I find it hard to hold that this was a representation that there was no termite infestation even though, of course, if one has a termite problem one will have something to spend on the house.` ` One must also take into account the provisions of special conditions 23 and of the contract which I have set out earlier. Helsham, J in `Long v
Worona Pty Ltd ` (supra), made it quite clear that such clauses must be given effect because there is no other way in which vendors can protect themselves. It is different in the case of a latent defect in title: `Nottingham Patent Brick and Tile Co versus Butler ` `` [(1886) 16 QBD ], , but the type of special conditions used here are sufficient to protect against defects in quality. As `Williams `op cit says at 759-764, the purchaser must make his or her own enquiry before exchanging contracts, a point which Mr Alexis, for the plaintiff, harped on time and time again during his address. ` ` One adds to all this the fact that the purchaser was a solicitor. He had in fact trained his paralegal Ms Kaye Grogan in the dangers of exchanging contracts without a pest report, he was aware of the problem generally and he read and understood special conditions 23 and 27. In addition he was separately advised by an independent solicitor who gave a certificate under s
W of the Conveyancing Act. When one adds all these things together, I cannot see any operative innocent misrepresentation.` ` I should deal with one further argument put by Mr Sullivan QC. When faced with the statement in `Armstrong versus Strain ` [[1952] 1 KB 232], 246, by
Devlin, J that "You cannot add an innocent state of mind to an innocent state of mind and get as a result a dishonest state of mind", he put that if the principal knows an agent is making a representation in ignorance and stands back without interference, the principal makes a misrepresentation. The only statement that could be found to support that proposition was one made, without any authority being cited, by `Lang ` in the 5th ed of `Estate
Agency Law and Practice in New South Wales `[3019]. However, whilst that statement could be correct in some circumstances, it must be remembered that the circumstances in the instant case are rather unusual. When Mr Abercrombie gave evidence it was to the effect that had he known (which he didn't until the evidence came out in court) that Mrs Resch had made the statements that she had made, he would have been happy with that situation. To my mind this is insufficient, that a person would have approved of something had he known about it. Thus, where a son-in-law uses his father-in-law's boat without permission, it is insufficient for the son-in-law to prove at his trial for theft that the father-in-law would have given permission had he been asked: `Morden versus Porter ` [(1860) 29 LJMC 213.] ` ` `Franich versus Swannell ` [(1993) 10 WAR 459], a worse case on the facts, illustrates the difficulty of marrying an "innocent" estate agent and a knowing vendor to produce a misrepresentation. In that case a vendor who knew of a subsidence problem produced a sanitized engineer's report to the agent so that the latter could, in good faith, sell to the purchaser without the embarrassment of knowledge. Ipp, J said at 481-2, holding that there was no misrepresentation, "At common law, a principal may vicariously be liable for torts committed by an agent. In seeking to cloak Mr Swannell with the character of the conduct of the estate agents employed by him, Mr and Mrs
Franich are, however, not seeking to fix him with vicarious liability for the agents' torts. Rather, they are seeking to attribute to him that element connected with the agents' conduct so as to complete a cause of action against him, based on his own conduct, under ... <case> of the Trade Practices Act. In my view, there is no basis at common law for such attribution."` ` Thus, despite Mr Sullivan QC's lucid arguments, I cannot see how there was any misrepresentation, innocent or otherwise, to the effect that there was no termite infestation in the property. ` ` I now turn to the question of whether the purchaser could terminate as opposed to rescind. ` ` For this purpose one must look to see whether there is any contractual provision, condition or fundamental breach on which the purchaser can rely.
There is nothing in the first category. There is no condition that the building will be termite free. Furthermore, cases such as `Long versus Worona Pty
Ltd ` and `Kadissi versus Jankovic ` suggest there is no fundamental breach in this type of case. Accordingly, this part of the question should be answered in the negative.` ` Mr Sullivan QC, however, pointed to an alleged breach of clause 12 of the standard terms of contract. This provides that:` ` "The vendor authorises the purchaser, subject to` ` the rights of any tenant -` ` 12.1 to have the property inspected to obtain` ` any certificate or report reasonably` ` required; ...` ` 12.3 to make 1 pre-completion inspection of` ` the property."` ` The evidence was that Ms Kaye Grogan rang Mrs Gell, the solicitor for the vendor and complained that Mrs Merity had been denied the right to inspect the property by the agent. Mrs Gell replied that Mrs Merity had been up there many times already. Ms Grogan said, "Mrs Merity is entitled to inspect the property prior to settlement". Mrs Gell replied, "Yes she can but the vendor has someone in the house this week and when a date for settlement is made then the house can be inspected ... It's a bit of a trade-off, isn't it Kaye?" ` ` It is to be noted that clause 12 of the standard form of contract is not a promise by the vendor to allow the purchaser inspection, nor in Hohfeldian terms does it confer a right on the purchaser, it merely confers a privilege.
There are no decisions on the clause, but I would agree with the editor of `Butterworth's Conveyancing Service ` vol 1 para [10270] that there does not seem to be any legal obligation on the vendor to be co-operative in and about the inspection, and I also agree with the editor's conclusion that "pre- completion" in 12.3 means "immediately before completion"; accordingly, there was no condition that the vendor would co-operate in arranging the inspection.
What Ms Grogan sought was not a pre-completion inspection and what Mrs Gell said did not amount to a breach of any obligation on the vendor. There is accordingly nothing in this particular point and no right in the purchaser to terminate.` ` I will just touch on the contention that the contract was void or should be declared void under <case> of the Trade Practices Act because of false and misleading conduct. As I said in `Prioris Pty Ltd versus Inscorp Holdings Ltd ` `` [(1995) 124 FLR 409], 420, the better view of <case>(a) of the Trade
Practices Act is that it does not operate to permit the court to make void that which was otherwise valid; see `Trade Practices Commission versus Milreis
Pty Ltd ` [(1977) 29 FLR 144], 160-1, ; `Webb Distributors (Australia) Pty Ltd versus Victoria ` <case>; [(1993) 179 CLR 15], 37 and `Harland "The Statutory Prohibition of Misleading or Deceptive Conduct in Australia and its Impact on the Law of Contract" ` [(1995) 111 LQR 100], 123-4. I adhere to this view. The contract, accordingly, not being void under the general law cannot be vitiated under the Trade Practices
Act. ` ` Accordingly, the first question must be found in favour of the plaintiff vendor.` `` `2. I now turn to the question of damages. ` ` Mr Sullivan QC's first submission was that clause 9 of the standard form of contract involves a vendor in an election and that once the vendor has elected to forfeit the deposit, it is impossible for the vendor to change its mind and to elect damages.` ` With respect, it is almost impossible to construe clause 9 in this way. The clause reads, so far as is relevant, as follows:-` ` "9. Purchaser's Default` ` If the purchaser does not comply with this` ` contract ... in an essential respect, the vendor` ` can terminate by serving a notice and then -` ` 9.1 keep or recover the deposit ... ;` ` 9.2 hold any other money paid by the purchaser` ` under this contract as security ... ` ` 9.2.1 for 12 months, or` ` 9.2.2 if the vendor commences proceedings` ` under this clause within 12 months,` ` until those proceedings are concluded;` ` and` ` 9.3 sue the purchaser -` ` 9.3.1 to recover damages for breach of` ` contract; or` ` 9.3.2 .... to recover the deficiency on` ` resale ... "` ` It would seem to me that as a pure matter of reading the clause, the word "and" after 9.2.2 shows that 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 confer cumulative rights and not alternative rights. Indeed, it has been said in analogous cases that there is no room for the doctrine of election within this sort of clause; see for instance `Taylor versus Raglan Developments Pty Ltd ` `` [[1981] 2 NSWLR ], and `Tang versus Chong ` ``(1988) 4 BPR 9507, 9510. Accordingly, I reject this submission.` ` The next problem is the one that I adverted to earlier in these reasons, and that is, the vendor claimed return of the deposit and alternatively damages.
It did not amend its statement of claim, but the way it presented its case was to claim loss of bargain damages. ` ` I need to examine the claims made by the vendor for damages. Unfortunately, the way the case was presented means that I am not able to determine all the necessary questions of fact that arise under this heading, but it has been agreed that I should determine the questions of principle, and then, at a later date either myself, or alternatively, a Master, will deal with the question of dollars and cents.` ` Document MI 88 is the plaintiff's schedule of damages under which the plaintiff claims $120,423.26 made up as follows (I have corrected the arithmetic):-` ` 1.

That evidence shows that, inter alia, the following amounts were claimed:-` ` (1) (a) $671.25 for cleaning and maintaining the` ` swimming pool;` ` (b) (i) $470.40 for new plants; and` ` (ii) $183.00 for gardening labour;` ` (c) $285.00 for painting to restore the appearance` ` of the property after plaster had been` ` removed to gain access to pest infestation;` ` (d) plumbing work to clear blocked toilet lines` ` $390.00;` ` (e) pest eradication $1,750.00;` ` (f) removalist for redelivery of furniture` ` back into the property when the vendor` ` moved back into possession $543.75;` ` (g) repairs to make the property more attractive` ` for sale $75.00;` ` (h) electrical work on the pool to enhance its` ` appeal for sale $179.00.` ` I will consider (1)(a) to (h) broadly under the heading of physical work and if need be, look at each category separately. ` ` The other heads of damage may be summarized as follows:` ` (2) Insurance during the period between the loss of the sale to the defendant and the resale to Mr and Mrs Toll, the contract for sale to the
Tolls being exchanged on 6 April 1995 and completed on 18 May 1995.` ` (3) Land tax between the termination and 18 May 1995.` ` (4) Interest that the plaintiff would have received had it had the moneys from the sale to the defendant and invested them in accordance with its normal investment procedure. In other words, interest foregone.` ` (5) Interest paid on a mortgage on the property that` `would otherwise have been discharged.` ` (6) The deficiency between the net price that would have been received from the defendant and the net price in fact received from the Tolls. The evidence here is that the contract price with the Tolls was $650,000, that is, $25,000 less than the contract price with Mr Merity, and that the net receipt from the
Tolls after payment of commission was $635,120.42.` ` (7) Interest under the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).` ` I will first deal with general principles and then examine each of these headings in turn.` ` Although the pleadings do not make it completely clear, the words "alternatively damages" to my mind pick up either damages under the general law or "damages for breach of contract" referred to in clause 9.3.1. Although in fact the contract with the Tolls was made within 12 months, the pleadings and the way the case was run by Mr Alexis, do not suggest the vendor was claiming a liquidated sum on a deficiency in accordance with clause 9.3.2. As
Fitzgerald, J said in `Tiplady versus Gold Coast Carlton Pty Ltd ` <case>; [(1984) 3 FCR 426], 465, the distinction is an essential one. Furthermore it is clear that once a vendor has made a choice as to which of the remedies to pursue then that is an election against the other: `Tiplady's case ` ``and `Jampco Pty Ltd versus Cameron (No 2) ` fully reported in [(1985) NSW ConvR -275], an abbreviated report also appearing as [(1985) 3 NSWLR .] `
 ` The difference between the two methods is that where there is a deficiency on a resale, one has liquidated damages and one takes the difference between the contract price and the resale price and makes certain adjustments which are authorised by the authorities. On the other hand, where there are damages at common law or under the contract (probably this means the same thing), one takes the difference between the contract price and the value of the land as at the date of the breach and adds on consequential damages, and if necessary, interest, giving credit for the deposit. If one looks at the `Tiplady case `, both before Fitzgerald, J and on appeal to the Full Court <case>; [(1984) 8 FCR 438], one can glean that there seems to be very little difference between what, under the general law, will be consequential damages and what, under the contract, will be the "costs and expenses of resale". In the `Tiplady case ` Fitzgerald, J considered he was dealing with general damages, the Full Court thought that they were dealing with a case of deficiency on a resale, yet the only adjustment that the Full Court made to the damages as assessed by Fitzgerald, J from the detailed reasons which his
Honour gave was to take the actual contract price on a resale rather than the value of the land as at the date of breach. Although Mr Alexis submitted to the contrary, in a case where he is really seeking contractual damages at common law, the damages must be assessed as at the date of the breach, ie,
August 1994 when the breach was accepted as putting an end to the contract.` `` ` (1) The authorities as to what are consequential damages are not always consistent. Up until 1985 they are analysed in `Professor Butt's ` book on the `Sale of Land` at pp 519 and following and later cases are referred to in the Second Cumulative Supplement. There is a little support for the plaintiff's first head of damages. This type of item was allowed in `Rossco
Developments Pty Ltd versus O'Halloran ` [(1980) 29 ACTR 1] at 6, but
Blackburn, CJ made it quite clear that there were special facts. "The property was a new house, an asset owned by the plaintiff for the purpose of sale at a profit" so that "the cost for the period indicated, of keeping it in first- class condition, attractive to buyers ... was an expense incidental to the resale". Blackburn, CJ's reference to `Williams on Vendor and Purchaser ` th ed vol 2 at p 1016, seems to me to show that he was not intending to say that as a general rule such damages are payable. `Williams ` makes it quite clear that "If the contract had been completed, he (the vendor) would have had to bear his own expenses; and to allow him to recover his expenses, in addition to compensation for his loss, would be to place him in a better position by reason of the breach of contract than he would have occupied if the agreement had been carried out." ` ` The headnote in `Bruce versus Waziri ` [(1982) 46 P & CR 81], tends to support the plaintiff's proposition because Jeffs, DJ allowed the vendor's insurance cover and maintenance costs pending resale. One reads the judgment as reported in vain to see where the learned Deputy Judge dealt with the matter and it is only when one goes to `Professor Farrand 's ` note in [(1984) 48 The Conveyancer and Property Lawyer 84], that one can see the passage of the judgment which was omitted from the report. When one does read that passage one must agree with
Professor Farrand's comment at 85, "Could any conveyancer's curiosity be cured by this unexplained and perhaps inexplicable passage? Not merely maintenance but heating and rates, maybe also lighting and even a butler, were allowed.
Better left unreported after all." I do not consider that I should follow `Bruce versus Waziri . `` ` Mr Alexis was not able to refer to any other authority that assisted him.` ` In my view this head of damages is not one which could be laid at the defaulting purchaser's feet.` `` ` (2) As to insurance, it is strange that no reported case seems to have dealt with the precise point. However, there seems to me to be no difference in principle with the claim for maintenance. I thus disallow the claim.` `` ` (3) Land Tax. In `Tiplady, ` rates and land tax were allowed only until the termination of the original contract. In dealing with deficiency on resale, I allowed land tax up until the time of the new contract in `Jampco
Pty Ltd versus Cameron (No 2) ` NSW ConvR at 56,583. However, in a case based on common law damages it would seem to me that the land tax is payable because of the land which the vendor owns as at 31 December in the relevant year. This is the total of the vendor's land holdings, and the evidence is, in the instant case, that the vendor held more than one piece of land. It seems to me that this is not part of the damages for the purchaser's breach.` `` ` (4) Interest foregone. The claim here is that had the vendor had the purchase money it would have invested it at a high rate of interest in the investment market with which it was very familiar. However, to allow this would be to fall foul of the principle referred to in `Williams ` that to allow a vendor to keep the land, have compensation for loss of its bargain and also to give it compensation for what it might have made out of the purchase price is over-compensating the vendor.` ` ` ` (5) The vendor had mortgaged the property. The purchaser knew that the vendor had mortgaged the property both by his searches and from conversations.
However, the mere fact that the purchaser knows the vendor has mortgaged the property is insufficient to remove the case from the general principle that the damages payable by the purchaser do not include interest payable on the vendor's mortgages: `Bridges versus MacPhail ` (1977) 3 BPR 9317 and `Jampco v Cameron ` supra. There is not sufficient material to depart from this general rule. ` ` ` ` (6) I have already dealt with the heading of deficiency on a resale.
Accordingly, the vendor is only entitled to forfeit the deposit and is not entitled to any damages overplus.` ` ` ` (7) As to interest under the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/), the deposit money has been in court since about the time that the proceedings were instituted. Accordingly, the vendor will be entitled to payment out of court together with interest. The court's practice is to pay the money into the common fund of the Public Trustee which earns commercial rates of interest. It does not seem to me in the circumstances that there is any call for any further interest.` ` In any event, <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) does not appear to be applicable by its very terms to situations where the vendor is entitled merely to forfeit a deposit which has been paid into court.` ` ` `3. Section 55(2A) of the Conveyancing Act. I now turn to the question as to whether there should be relief given to Mr Merity against forfeiture of the deposit pursuant to [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).` ` As `Professor Butt ` points out in his book at p 515, there are two views as to the proper construction of [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html), that it is limited to situations where there is such disqualifying conduct on the part of the vendor as ought to provide a foundation for the exercise of the court's discretion; or (b) a wider view which means that the court is to adopt a broad approach of fairness; see eg `Kadissi versus Jankovic ` (supra) at 258-9. In New South Wales the wider view has been adopted and the classic statement is that of Street, CJ in Eq in `Lucas & Tait (Investments) Pty
Ltd versus Victoria Securities Ltd ` [[1973] 2 NSWLR 268] at -273: "The jurisdiction under [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) does not give to a court an overall discretionary supervision of monetary adjustments between parties to a contract under which a deposit was paid but which has been terminated. A vendor who forfeits a deposit in strict enforcement of his legal rights is not to be deprived of it under [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) unless it is unjust and inequitable to permit him to retain it." ` ` The Judges of this Division have constantly refused to set out any "standard test" as to when a deposit might be refunded under [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) though the general flavour of the decisions has been that, prima facie, a vendor who is at law entitled to forfeit the deposit should be able to do so because the commercial purpose of the deposit is to act as an earnest on the part of the purchaser that the contract will be performed. It is only if there is some significant special factor usually a factor sounding against the vendor's conscience that a court of equity will give relief under [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) of the statute; see eg `Pratt versus Hawkins ` [(1991) 32 NSWLR 319.] ` ` I stand by what I said in `Clurstock Pty Ltd versus Timanu Pty Ltd ` [(1988)
NSW ConvR 55-419] at 57,831, that the flavour that emerges from most of the decisions on [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) is that "where the purchaser has been caught up in a situation through little fault of his own or perhaps because of the fault of his solicitor and has endeavoured to do the decent thing, the Court will very often exercise its discretion in his favour, notwithstanding that this will have the effect of depriving the vendor of the right to forfeit the deposit and notwithstanding that the making of such an order will lessen the importance of a deposit as an earnest that the contract will be fulfilled." ` ` It is clear that the pivotal consideration is the justice of the situation, see the observations of Kirby, P in `Wight versus Foran ` [(1987) 11 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281987%29%2011%20NSWLR%20470 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 482. Kirby, P repeated those thoughts in the appeal in `Timanu Pty Ltd v
Clurstock ` [(1988) 15 NSWLR 338], 343.
(Although the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in the `Timanu case `, my words on the present point were not affected). ` ` In `SA Mearns versus Parris Holdings Pty Ltd `(1994) 6 BPR 13,677 at 13,685,
Santow, J referred to the necessity of special or exceptional circumstances to warrant the making of an order. Although those words may have flowed through from one of my previous judgments, I must confess that having reread the authorities that may be putting the test a little high. The courts have refused to lay down the standard: it is a matter of looking at each particular case to see whether it is fair and conscionable to give relief or not. ` ` Another part of my reasons in the `Timanu case `are germane to the present problem. I said at 57,831, "If a situation emerges that there is a bona fide dispute as to the meaning of the Regulation, it is usually always possible for the parties to approach the Court for a declaration, which case can be heard very quickly, or the purchaser can show by its conduct that it is ready, willing and able to carry out the contract, if at all possible. In such a situation it may well be that if it is shown by the proper evidence that the benefit to the vendor through forfeiting the deposit is out of all proportion to the penalty that should be paid by the purchaser for an invalid rescission that the Court would give relief. However, it is for the purchaser to make out its claim under the section and if all that is disclosed is that when a complication comes up, the purchaser, instead of negotiating, rescinds straight away without discussion and in the context where the vendor is endeavouring to sort out the problem and, indeed, in a short period of time the problem goes away, it does not seem to me that the purchaser has made out a case under the section. The purchaser has not in those circumstances demonstrated that it would be unjust for the common law to apply." ` ` In the present case, despite Mrs Gell's invitation, Mr Merity and his solicitors did not deal with the problem that had arisen in this way, but rather elected to terminate there and then. It is difficult for a person who has taken such a position to use [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) to advantage if he or she is later found to be wrong. ` ` Although the court does not lay down any "standard test", it is clear that the discretion to be exercised is that of a collegiate court and not at the whim of an individual judge. It is thus useful to see how other judges have approached similar problems. The authorities digested in `Professor Butt's ` book and in para [31040] of `Butterworths Annotated Conveyancing and [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) ` indicate that the following matters influence the court as to whether it will exercise its jurisdiction under the section in favour of a purchaser:- ` `(a) Has the vendor received any windfall benefit? (such as the case where the vendor has in fact resold at a higher price).` `(b) However, even if there is no windfall to the vendor, the court may still give relief.` `(c) Is non-completion a fault of the purchaser personally or a matter over which it had little control?` `(d) Was the purchaser's use of the property thwarted by some factor outside the purchaser's control?` `(e) Was there any mis-statement (even short of a misrepresentation that would permit rescission) in the vendor's camp which affected the purchaser's decision?` ` In the instant case, only factors (d) and (e) could` `possibly be relevant. Category (d) is discussed by `Professor Butt ` at pp 511 and 512 of his book. It is noteworthy that there only appears to be one example where the factor has been thought to be sufficiently strong for the court to make an order for the recovery of the deposit, and that was `Tsekos v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd ` [[1982] 2 NSWLR 347], which, with respect, appears to be out of the mainstream of authority and appears to be a case where Rath, J considered that, in that particular case, the vendor's knowledge of an intended resumption was a matter which in conscience should have been shared with the purchaser, and if it had been, would have stopped the whole problem arising.` ` Certainly, in `Long versus Worona Pty Ltd ` (supra), Helsham, J did not consider it sufficiently strong a case for exercise of his discretion under the sub-section, that the house was incomplete with defective building work in the light of the circumstances that the purchaser knew that the house was partly completed and was warned about having it completed before he exchanged contracts. ` ` There are other cases such as `Little versus Piccin ` [(1983) 52 LGRA ], , where the degree of affectation was much more serious than in the instant case yet no relief was granted.` ` So far as (e) is concerned, one really gets into the same factual area as will be dealt with under heading 4. For the reasons which I there give, I do not consider that there is sufficient mis-statement to make it unconscionable for the usual result to follow that if a purchaser repudiates a contract, its deposit is forfeited.` ` Although there is a broad discretion to give relief under [s (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), that discretion must be exercised in accordance with the practice of a collegiate court. It does not seem to me that the factors in this present case justify me exercising my discretion in favour of the purchaser.` `4. The Trade Practices Act claims.` ` Section 52(1) of the Trade Practices Act provides:-` ` "A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce,` ` engage in conduct that is misleading or ` ` deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive."` `This is mirrored in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) which reads:-` ` "A person shall not, in trade or commerce, ` ` engage in conduct ... ".` ` Various points arose in the argument on this part of the case which can conveniently be dealt with under the following headings:-` `(a) Were the activities complained of in trade or commerce?` `(b) Were the statements mere puffs or were they more serious statements?` `(c) Was there any reliance on the relevant statements by the defendant?` `(d) Is there any contribution between the plaintiff and the third, fourth and fifth cross defendants? and` `(e) Miscellaneous issues.` `` `(a) What is comprehended by the phrase "in trade or commerce" was considered by the High Court in `Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd versus Nelson ` <case>; [(1990) 169 CLR 594.] At 603, four Justices said, "[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s52.html) was not intended to extend to all conduct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporation might engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, its overall trading or commercial business." Earlier they said, "The words 'in trade or commerce' refer to 'the central conception' of trade or commerce and not to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business." Toohey, J at 614 says, "The question is not whether the conduct engaged in was in connexion with trade or commerce or in relation to trade or commerce. It must have been in trade or commerce."` ` Furthermore, it seems to me that with the possible complication caused by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s84.html) on deemed liability of agents, it must be the actor's or representor's trade or commerce that is involved. This distinction does not appear from the cases under the Act, presumably because the problem has not arisen, but it has come up in other areas of the law such as landlord and tenant. There, if head landlord A owns a dwelling house and leases it to mesne lessee B who uses it as a residential in which sub-tenants C, D and E reside, as between B and A the premises are used for commercial purposes: `Wiseman versus Neilands ` [(1958) 75 WN 247], even though if one were testing other relationships one might come to a different conclusion.` ` There is no doubt at all that the estate agents were involved in commerce.
Their whole business was to facilitate commercial transactions. The question as to whether the vendor and Mr Abercrombie were in trade and commerce raises a quite different question. Ordinarily, if an individual is selling his or her residence being a capital asset, that sale is not in trade or commerce. ` ` In `O'Brien versus Smolonogov ` [(1983) 53 ALR 107], the Full
Federal Court adopted a passage from `Young versus Joyce ` [351 A (2d) ], 860 , "We do not believe that the isolated sale of real estate by its owner, in this case, constitutes the conduct of trade or commerce". The court said that the mere fact that people have used facilities such as newspaper advertisements and the telephone did not convert a non-commercial transaction into a commercial one. ` ` I should first note that <case> of the Trade Practices Act cannot affect the position. In this I follow what Hill, J said in `Argy versus Blunts & Lane
Cove Real Estate Pty Ltd ` <case>; [(1990) 26 FCR 112], 130. The authorities show that whether a sale of land is in trade or commerce is, in the ultimate, a question of fact.` ` In `Franich versus Swannell ` (supra) a sale of a private home by a vendor, even though agents were employed to find a purchaser, was held not to be a sale in trade or commerce. The cases show, however, that only slightly more commercial flavour will put the case into that category: `Argy versus Blunts & Lane Cove Real Estate Pty Ltd `(supra). Indeed, there is some rather doubtful authority for the proposition that if a property is put in the name of a corporate vehicle which has power to use it as a trading asset, that is some material from which one can find that the sale is in trade or commerce; see `Satna Holdings Pty Ltd versus Jokade Pty Ltd ` [(1984) 7 ATPR -529.]` ` It is certainly relevant to consider whether the transaction was motivated by business reasons; see `Bevanere Pty Ltd versus Lubidineuse ` <case>; [(1985) 7 FCR 325], 329, where the Full Federal Court said, "The sale of the clinic should not be viewed in isolation from the totality of the appellant's commercial activities. The sale was part of those activities. The proceeds of sale were available to be used by the appellant in other commercial activities, if it so chose. The agreement for sale entailed continuing obligations ... not to engage in competitive commercial conduct. In retaining an agent to find a buyer for the business the appellant adopted a procedure commonly used in trade or commerce for finding a buyer for a business which is available for purchase. The mere fact that it was the sale of a capital asset did not deprive it of its character as a transaction in trade or commerce." ` ` As to the facts, the evidence clearly showed that the plaintiff was the trustee of a trading trust for Philadelphia Trust. There was some evidence that the trust had a series of properties and was involved in turning those properties over for profit. However, the property in question was initially purchased for a beneficiary under the trust, Mr Abercrombie, to live in whilst in Sydney rather than for resale. There was evidence that the property was the first one to be sold.` ` Although not all the indicia referred to by the Full Federal Court are present in the instant case, most of them are. It would seem that the profits of the sale were to be used for the benefit of the trading trust and the only matter which would incline one to say that the transaction was not in trade or commerce was the fact that it was the first sale of a capital asset which had originally been purchased for a purpose other than resale. Looking at all the facts, however, it seems to me that the transaction can be properly said on the part of the vendor to be one in trade or commerce. However, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Abercrombie himself was acting in trade or commerce. He never sold anything. He was merely a director of the vendor.
Section 84 does not operate to make Mr Abercrombie liable for the reasons I have already considered. ` ` Accordingly, in my view the plaintiff and the third, fourth and fifth cross defendants were acting in trade or commerce.` `` `(b) Puffery. ` ` Under the general law, there is a real distinction between a representation and a mere puff. Under the Trade Practices Act, the law also understands that "in the ordinary course of commercial dealings, a certain degree of 'puffing' or exaggeration is to be expected. Indeed puffery is part of the ordinary stuff of commerce." (`General Newspapers Pty Ltd versus Telstra Corporation ` <case>; [(1993) 45 FCR 164], 178).
However, as `Professor Harland `says in his article, from which I have already quoted, at p 112, "The commentators generally believe that the defence that a seller's claim is only puffing, not to be taken seriously and not attracting liability, is less likely to succeed under the statutory prohibition than at common law. This is no doubt generally true, especially in cases of advertising and other promotional activity, and, given the public policy goals underlying the statute, any other result would be surprising."
The learned professor then goes on to say that recent cases may be reversing that trend and continues, "The question of just where to draw the line in this context will clearly remain one of debate".` ` When looking at the conduct of the alleged infringer of <case>, one must look at the whole of the conduct not the particular matter on which the plaintiff has focused attention in isolation: `Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd ` <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 191], 199 and `Pappas versus Soulac Pty Ltd ` <case>; [(1983) 50 ALR 231.] In that lastmentioned case at 234, Fisher, J said, in the context of an agent making statements about the commercial viability of a shopping centre which the agent was selling, "... Many of the statements ...
were also essentially the type of introductory comments, in the nature of puffery, made at the start of negotiations, for the purpose of attracting the interest of a possible purchaser. As such they became irrelevant or of little, if any, significance when detailed information is subsequently given a fortiori, to a potential purchaser with commercial experience. To the extent that they are essentially puffery, it is proper to be reluctant to elevate them to the status of potentially misleading conduct."` ` With these thoughts in mind, one must examine the various matters pleaded as false or misleading conduct under the statute. ` ` The first matter is the newspaper advertisement. It seems to me very difficult to allege that a newspaper advertisement which is designed primarily to tell people that a house is open for inspection should be construed as giving information other than preliminary information upon which a person should rely in order to enter into a contract. If one expects puffery anywhere it would be in such a newspaper advertisement. Although Lee, J in `Paper
Sales (Australia) WA Pty Ltd versus PSA Pty Ltd ` [(1991) ATPR 41-142] at 53,051, left open the possibility that "an ordinary member of the class of persons to whom the conduct is directed may fail to discern that representations about the advertised product are to be disregarded", I think ordinarily an advertisement which merely directs someone to enquire about the product is not expected in trade or commerce to be relied upon as a quasi representation.` ` In the instant case, an advertisement in the general terms of exhibit VX 93 including the words "Max living style with min maintenance" and "Just move in and enjoy" to my mind do not get into the area of statements which were intended to be more than introductory puffery.` ` The second representation is alleged to have been made by Mrs Resch on the first introduction of the property where the defendant said he was looking for a property in good repair with low maintenance. Mrs Resch's comment that the property would satisfy the requirements and that all it needed was a good coat of paint and the purchasers would not have to do anything was made at the initial introduction to the property in circumstances where the property was open for inspection and various members of the public were making introductory enquiries. Again, with the purchase of a property worth $675,000 I would not have thought that anyone would consider that statements made by the showing agent were to be considered to be representations which could be relied upon without further enquiry.` ` The third statement is made by Mr Bridges on the telephone. Again I cannot see how such an enquiry made informally that the purchaser was looking for a "hassle free place" and a reply that the place would suit him perfectly could be said to be a representation that there was no termite infestation.` ` This brings me to the fourth complaint, and that is that, probably on the
Thursday after the initial introduction, Marcia Resch said, "You will enjoy it here. You will have nothing to spend". It is put that such amounts to a statement in trade or commerce that there were no latent defects which would cause the purchaser to have to expend money. One must always remember that the statements are to be looked at in their context and are to be analysed as to what both the speaker and the hearer would have understood them to cover; cf `Krakowski versus Eurolynx Properties Ltd `(1995) 183 CLR 563, 576. The whole tenor of the conversations with the agents was to do with minimal upkeep of the property and it being a house which could be lived in with a minimum amount of day to day care because of its particular layout. I do not consider that either party was directing his or her mind to the question as to the whether there was some hidden defect or some termite infestation or some structural defect. ` ` Paragraph 24 of the amended first cross claim says that the representation "You will have nothing to spend" meant "that the property would not in the immediate future require work to put it in good order and condition". My attention was, of course, directed to <case> of the Trade Practices Act concerning representations with respect to future matter. However, I do not have to spend time in this area because I cannot find in all the circumstances that the words uttered by Mrs Resch (which she does not deny uttering) could amount to the representation in para 24.` ` The fifth representation is that the property required minimal maintenance and that all the purchaser had to do was to move into it. The same consequence is pleaded in para 30 and for similar reasons I do not consider it follows.` ` Accordingly, in my view there has been no false or misleading conduct in the statements that were made.` `(c) In view of the conclusion I have reached under (b), it is unnecessary to consider reliance. It was common ground between counsel that a statement could be actionable under <case> even if it were not the sole cause of the relevant decision so long as it was the significant cause in the making of that decision: `Gould versus Vaggelas ` [(1985) 157 CLR 215], 236; `Henjo Investments Pty Ltd versus Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (No 1) ` <case>; [(1988) 39 FCR 546], 558. Moreover, contributory negligence is no defence: `Argy versus Blunts & Lane Cove Real Estate Pty Ltd ` <case>; [(1990) 26 FCR 112], 138. Furthermore, it does not matter that the person to whom the mis-statement was made could have checked its falsity and did not do so (`Henjo versus Collins ` supra).` ` There were, of course, the special conditions put in the contract. However, here again this is just one of the matters to take into account when looking at the various matters of fact; see the `Paper Sales case `referred to earlier.` ` One of the most significant matters is that Mr Merity was not cross examined to any significant extent on him not relying on the statements. ` ` In all the circumstances had it been necessary to do so, I should have found reliance.` `(d) In the light of my findings, it follows that there is no liability on any party to Mr Merity under the Trade Practices Act. Accordingly, no question of contribution arises. The claim for contribution allegedly arising under the
Trade Practices Act would have had to be dismissed because of cases such as `Re La Rosa ` [(1991) 31 FCR 83.] However, any claim under the general rules of equity for contribution was stood over pending determination of the present proceedings. It will now be unnecessary to deal with any aspect of those claims.` `(e) Accordingly, there should be a verdict for the plaintiff, third, fourth and fifth cross claimants on the first cross claim and all other cross claims should be dismissed.` `` `5 and 6. These matters do not arise.` `` `7. The consequences of what I have said are that there must be a declaration that the plaintiff has properly terminated the relevant contract and that it was entitled to and did forfeit the deposit. The moneys in court plus interest must be paid out to the plaintiff. All other claims and cross claims are dismissed. Counsel for the plaintiff must bring in short minutes of order to reflect this decision. Unless a week before the nominated date counsel arrange an alternative date with my Associate the nominated date to bring in the short minutes is Thursday 17 April 1997 at 9.30 am. When the short minutes are brought in the question of costs can be debated. The plaintiff has succeeded but not to the full extent of its claim for damages. The defendant has wholly failed. The estate agents, if I can call them that, have succeeded on the cross claim yet it may be able to be argued that some of their conduct led to the cross claim and this may be significant on the question of costs. With these brief but elliptical comments I will await submissions.` `` 
EIGHTH SRJ PTY LTD versus JOHN LINDSAY MERITY & ANOR /94 (NO 2) 
THURSDAY 10 APRIL 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: On 25 March 1997 I gave reasons for judgment in these proceedings and stood the matter over to a convenient day for short minutes to be brought in to reflect those reasons. In the course of the reasons I expressed certain provisional thoughts. One of those thoughts was that no interest would be payable on the deposit which had been forfeited by the purchaser. Today Mr Alexis for the plaintiff sought to review that matter and argued that his client was entitled to interest under section 94 of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). Ms Hogan-Doran for the defendant submitted that that matter had already been concluded by my judgment. However, the judgment did not intend to deal in any conclusive way with any matter which had not been argued; it merely contained some provisional thoughts. I do not consider that anyone is prevented from raising matters now which were not the subject of argument upon which I adjudicated in my judgment on 25 March.

There are various orders which all the parties agree flow from the reasons that I have given and these are numbered 1 to 7 in the short minutes of order which were handed up this morning.

Five further matters need to be considered and appropriate orders made. These are:
Is the plaintiff entitled to interest on the deposit and, if so, at what rate?
Is the plaintiff entitled to an order for all its costs against the defendant or only part of its costs?
Should any order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff be on an indemnity basis?
What should happen as between the defendant and others as to the costs of the cross-claims?
What should happen as between the third and fourth cross-defendants on the one hand and the fifth cross-defendant on the other hand as to the costs claims between them? 
I will deal with each of these issues in turn.
The form of contract which was the 1992 edition of the standard form provided in clause 9 that the vendor was able to terminate and then "9.1. Keep or recover the deposit". The contract does not specifically say, as earlier editions have said, that the deposit was forfeited upon the happening of the relevant event. That would seem to flow as a matter of course, even though the contract does not mention the word "forfeit", see Howe versus Smith [(1884) 27
Ch D 89.] 
Accordingly, upon the termination by the vendor the vendor became entitled to be paid the deposit. The deposit under the contract was supposed to be held by the vendor's solicitor as depositholder who had an obligation to invest it.
However, it would seem that despite what the contract said the deposit was held by the third cross-defendant, W J Bridges Real Estate. The demand was made on that company and as things have turned out it should have paid the deposit over to the vendor. However, as Professor Butt points out in his book
The Sale of Land, the commercial reality of the situation is that where there is a dispute the resolution of which depends on the determination of facts of law, the only safe course is for the stake holder to pay the moneys into court and to interplead.

This the real estate agent did, though, as Mr Alexis points out, about three months were lost in between the time of demand and the time of payment into court.

When the moneys were paid into court they were paid out in accordance with the usual practice to the Public Trustee to be invested in his common fund. I am told from the bar table that this meant that to the $67,500 deposit was to be added interest at three to six per cent and that the only amount that the vendor will receive by way of interest is three to six per cent less the
Public Trustee's administrative charges. However, if the Court rates of interest are applicable, as per schedule J to the Rules, the plaintiff would be entitled to somewhere between ten and twelve per cent.

I think the lesson to be learned for the future is that in conveyancing transactions where there is a dispute as to the deposit, it is far better for everyone to agree to put the deposit out at some commercial rate of interest rather than to pay it into court. I cannot really blame any of the solicitors for not foreseeing the problem in this case seeing that I did not realise myself that the money would be getting such a low rate of interest. As I say, the lesson is there for the future.

The questions that arise are, accordingly: can the Court award interest under section 94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) and if it can, should it? 
Section 94(1) commences with the words "In any proceedings for the recovery of money (including any debt or damages or the value of any goods) the Court may order that there shall be included, in the sum for which judgment is given, interest at such rate as it thinks fit ..." 
The first matter to consider is whether the present claim constitutes "proceedings for the recovery of any money" within the meaning of the section.
If one looks at the final version of the Statement of Claim one can see that the plaintiff claims a declaration that the defendant repudiated the contract, that it had been terminated and that the deposit was forfeited to the plaintiff. It also sought an order that the money paid into Court by the third cross-defendant on 8 December 1994 be paid to the plaintiff. I do not consider that that was a claim for the recovery of money even though the commercial effect of judgment in the proceedings would be that money would flow to the plaintiff. In Westblade versus Adams (1984) 3 BPR 9319 at 9324, McLelland J held that section 94 was not applicable where one had a situation where a stakeholder was holding the deposit even though the plaintiffs were entitled to the appropriate declarations that they were entitled to the deposit. Mr
Alexis thought that was inconsistent with two other decisions of this Court: the decision of Rath J in Tsekos versus Finance Corporation of Australia
Ltd <case>; [(1927) 28 SR 20.]
However, as Santow J pointed out, the legislative source of power to award interest in the case before him was to be found in [section (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). It was not a case where [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s94.html) was implemented. The case before Rath J does not indicate what power his Honour was applying. It seems to me that the two sets of authorities can be reconciled. There is power to award interest when a deposit is recovered under [section (2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) and there is no power where a stakeholder has the deposit and an application is made for declaration that the deposit has been forfeited. If there was power to award interest, there would be a problem to determine against whom the interest would be awarded. It would seem to be unfair that the stakeholder should have to pay interest unless one applied those old cases that allowed stakeholders to invest the stake money and keep the interest. However, that line of authority has long been abrogated.

Again, it might be unfair that the purchaser should have to pay the interest because the purchaser is not receiving the use of the money. Really, the whole thing must be solved by putting the deposit out at interest as the contract originally contemplated and making sure, when there is a dispute as to who is entitled to the interest, that the deposit remains at proper interest while the dispute is determined.

I do not consider there is any power to award interest under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s94.html) in this case.

Even if I was of the view there was power, I would not be of the view that interest should be awarded. Although it is true that interest is awarded because the plaintiff has been left out of his or her money, it is also a consideration that the defendant has made use of the money in the meantime.
That is why, as I understand it, at least up until recently, the Court rate was fixed at one per cent above the commercial rate. A person would then pay its debts rather than use the money commercially. Where the person to pay has not been able to use the money because it is in court or alternatively it is the stakeholder, then I think strong arguments have to be put by the plaintiff as to why it would be just to award interest.

I do not consider that in the case where there is a forfeited deposit, without more, one may assume that it would be just to award interest. Accordingly, I answer the first question by ruling that the plaintiff is not entitled to the interest on the forfeited deposit other than the interest which that deposit has earned whilst being held by the Public Trustee. Accordingly, no special order is needed to deal with that matter.
The next matter is whether the plaintiff is entitled to all its costs or only part. The debate is whether, because the plaintiff inflated its claim and sought damages over and above the claim of forfeiture of the deposit, which additional claim it lost, it should not get the whole of its costs. The general rule is, that even if the plaintiff fails on some issues, the plaintiff should get its costs of proceedings if successful (Waters versus P C
Henderson New South Wales Court of Appeal, 6 July 1994, unreported). There are exceptions to that general rule, such as situations where issues are clearly severable, but the general rule applies even if there are some issues on which a plaintiff, which has been successful overall in the litigation, fails. Of course, in the long run, the matter is in the Court's discretion, but that is a judicial discretion exercised in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Court. Despite what Ms Hogan-Doran has said about the issues in this case in her written submissions, in my view the plaintiff is entitled to all its costs against the defendant.
Are those costs to be paid on the indemnity basis? As to this, Mr Alexis points to the correspondence which began in July 1994 when the litigation was either commenced or contemplated. A letter of 2 June 1995, which was put in evidence this morning as part of exhibit PX1001 on the matter of costs, showed that on that day the plaintiff offered to settle the case on the basis it would take the deposit and its costs to date and not claim for its actual loss or interest. Furthermore, the defendant was to bear the costs of any litigation with the agents and there was to be "no commission".

This was responded to by the defendant on 16 June 1995 to the effect that he would settle for $25,000 inclusive of costs. The forfeited deposit was $67,500. Mr Alexis says that the offer that was made was fairly close to how the litigation turned out and that there having been such an offer the Court would, in accordance with principle, make an order for indemnity costs. He put that cases such as Maitland Hospital versus Fisher (No 2) [(1992) 27 NSWLR ]
show that it is the firm policy of the Rules that litigation be discouraged by imposing on a person who does not accept a reasonable compromise the penalty of paying the costs of the other party on the indemnity basis after that time.

Ms Hogan-Doran says the letter was not a true offer of compromise. The plaintiff was not giving anything away, the deposit had already been paid into court and there was no question of interest. Thus, all the offer amounted to was for the plaintiff to get the maximum it could get and thus contained no element of compromise at all. Furthermore, the mere handing over of a
Calderbank letter and its rejection is not, without more, grounds to make an order for costs on an indemnity basis (John S Hayes & Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd [(1994) 52 FCR 201], 206).

I do not consider that this is a matter with which I can deal merely by exchange of formulae. The Court must consider the matters raised by both sides and work out what is a just order to be made.

Although I believe there was some compromise involved in what the plaintiff's solicitors were saying in their letter of 2 June 1995, it was not much of a compromise. There were a whole series of rather complex issues between the parties and I do not consider that the offer made in that way in that letter was one which really could be said to have been an early bona fide compromise of expensive litigation. The offer was slightly more than the plaintiff did receive. I do not consider that there is a sufficient case shown by the plaintiff to warrant the costs order being made other than on the ordinary basis. It may be that in actual fact these days very little turns on it but Mr
Alexis was instructed that something did turn on it and I have adjudicated according to law.

Accordingly, I do not consider that there should be any indemnity costs.
The cross-claims between the defendant and the estate agents - if I can refer to the third, fourth and fifth cross-defendants by that title - involve claims by the defendant that the estate agents were in breach of the Trade
Practices Act. I found in favour of the estate agents. Ordinarily a person who is successful in litigation is entitled to his or her costs. The only reason why such an order would not be made is if there was some conduct of the estate agents which would warrant some other result.

It is clear from my judgment that the actions of the estate agents were not what in an ideal world one would expect. However, the world we live in is not the ideal world and one can well understand estate agents working at the coal face endeavouring to settle conveyancing transactions to the satisfaction of both vendor and purchaser even if some of their conduct was not "according to
Hoyle". The real question is not whether the estate agents have been guilty of moral misconduct, but, whether there is something about their conduct which "improperly induces the losing party to think that he had a good cause of action or defence or which has occasioned unnecessary litigation or expense in the institution or conduct of the proceedings." I quote from McHugh JA in
Hedley versus National Commercial Banking Group of Australia, 31 October 1986, unreported. Applying that test, there is nothing I can say for the estate agents' conduct which would have induced the defendant in the way his Honour indicated. Accordingly, the defendant must pay the costs of the cross- defendant estate agents.
This makes the question of costs as between Mrs Resch, the fifth cross- defendant who was employed by the third cross-defendant, more or less academic. There was a fourth cross-claim put on at the first day of the hearing seeking indemnity by Mrs Resch. The costs of that did not increase the whole costs of the action at all and I believe it should be ignored.

Mr Bowers for the third and fourth cross-defendants has put that Mrs Resch's conduct, especially in withholding the pest report, was a frolic of her own and not part of her duties. I think that although had Mr Bridges known about this he would have forbidden it, what she was doing was well within her job as a real estate salesman for the third-cross defendant. Had there been any real contest Mrs Resch might have been entitled to indemnity. However, that really does not arise. There should be no costs paid or payable between the third and fourth cross-defendants on the one hand and the fifth cross defendant on the other hand.

Accordingly, I make orders 1 to 7 in the short minutes of order. I also order as follows: 
Order that the defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff and the first and second cross-defendants of the proceedings.

Order the defendant pay the costs of the third, fourth and fifth cross- defendants.

Order as between the third and fourth cross-defendants on the one hand and the fifth cross-defendant on the other hand that there be no order as to costs.

There is to be no order as to the costs of the fourth cross-claim.

The exhibits may be retained for twenty-eight days on the usual basis.
