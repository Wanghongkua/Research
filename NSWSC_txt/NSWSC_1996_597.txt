APPEAL - appellants submitted trial judge in error in accepting figure of $750 as "average weekly earnings" on the basis:(1) the primary rule under [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) should have been used as the case did not fall within the exceptions in par of the section and (2) even if the $750 was correct, he had overlooked [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) of the Act which required the amount to be reduced by 20% to convert the amount to the "current weekly wage rate" - appellants also submitted judge's discretion miscarried on orders relating to partial incapacity.

Held: 1) trial judge bound to apply [s 43(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html); however it was not clear whether he was using the primary rule under par (a) or the part following, the secondary rule, to be used in cases within the exception. In deciding whether the section is applicable, the primary rule required "average weekly earnings" as defined in [s 42(8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html), "to be computed in such manner as is best calculated to give the rate per week at which the worker was being remunerated". "Best calculated" involves an element of judgmental evaluation in the process of computation and the trial judge's assessment was within the range. It was not impracticable "to compute the rate of remuneration" referred to in [s 43(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) ) Amount of $750 not justifiable in light of the facts or under the statutory provision. The respondent's "average weekly earnings" during the period of less than the twelve months when he was employed by the appellants should be taken as $625 a week and the current weekly wage rate under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s36.html) $500, because of [s (1)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) ) On partial incapacity, facts of the case indicate a much lower figure should be arrived at; trial judge had not given sufficient weight to the fact that the worker had been retired for nearly two years. The provision in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) that the weekly amount awarded for partial incapacity must "bear such relation to the amount of that difference" and the difference between pre- and post-injury earnings "as may appear in proper in the circumstances of the case" has regularly been seen as imposing upon the court a discretionary power.

JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: This appeal is from a judgment delivered by Manser J of the Compensation Court on 15 July 1994 in favour of Mr Claydon, (there the applicant, here the respondent) who had claimed workers compensation from Mr and Mrs Pratt, (the appellants). Before Manser J the appellants contested the existence of the employment relation between them and the respondent. Manser J decided this issue in favour of the respondent and the appellants do not seek to raise that matter again in the appeal. The questions raised in the appeal relate to the amount of some of the awards made and to the application of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s40.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the Act).

The respondent is a carpenter and joiner who retired from running his own business in April 1991. From April 1991, he received an invalid pension which permitted him to earn $70.00 per week over the pension. His evidence at the hearing was that although he had given up the business in April 1991, he did the odd job of furniture restoration for family and friends, but he "didn't charge them, [he] only charged them for materials". He did not hold himself out as a carpenter or tradesman between the period April 1991 and January .

In January 1993, the respondent came to an arrangement with Mrs Pratt, his sister-in-law, to carry out some carpentry work in relation to her kitchen.
According to the respondent, Mrs Pratt had "got a quote to do the job off a builder and she thought it was too much and she asked [the respondent] if [he] would like to do it for her" and he had agreed to do it, for the price of $1500.00, with his brother-in-law, Mr Ron Moss, assisting him. The respondent and Mr Moss estimated that the job would take about 10 days to complete, and they agreed to split the money between them.

The respondent started work on Friday 22 January 1993, Mr Moss the next day.
They continued working each day, through the weekend, until Wednesday 27
January 1993, when the job was almost completed. On that morning, the respondent was "ripping the VJ lining" using a circular bench saw, when he "just felt a sting and [he] saw [his] index finger fall on the floor" and the three middle fingers of his left hand were "still on but they were hanging everywhere".

The respondent's left index finger was re-attached by microsurgery, as were the other two middle fingers. However, he was left with only a stub of the left thumb and the left hand little finger was surgically amputated. The three middle fingers of the respondent's left hand "are in a state of permanent clawing. They are without mobility". The trial judge was of the opinion that "for all practical purposes the left hand is useless". The expert medical assessment of the loss of the use of the hand was 60%. Manser J, however, thought that it would have been "considerably more".

In respect of weekly compensation Manser J made orders (see p 10 of his reasons) which in the formal "Orders and Awards" issued by the Compensation
Court were expressed as follows: "1. That the respondent pay the applicant weekly compensation at the rate of -
 $750 for twenty-six weeks from 27th January 1993 on the basis of total incapacity.
 $311.10 thereafter to 30th September 1993 on the basis of partial incapacity.
 $312.60 from 1st October 1993 to 31st March 1994 on the basis of partial incapacity.
 $314 as adjusted from 1st April 1994 on the basis of partial incapacity, such weekly payment to continue in accordance with the provisions of the
Act." 
Manser J also awarded the respondent lump sum amounts in respect of claims under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and of the Act.

There were also consequential orders for interest, expenses and costs.

The appeal concerns only the amounts of weekly compensation set out in Order 1 above.

Order 1.(1) was made pursuant to [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s33.html) and [36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s36.html)(1).
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s33.html) provided that "If total ... incapacity ... results from an injury, the compensation ... shall include a weekly payment during the incapacity".
[Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s36.html) provided that the weekly payment of compensation for total incapacity during the first twenty-six weeks of incapacity was to be "the amount of the worker's current weekly wage rate". How that was to be arrived at was set out in a number of subsequent provisions.

Manser J's explanation of how he arrived at the amount of Order 1.(1) was brief. He said: "The ... question is, how is one to deal with the worker's claim for weekly compensation. His wages schedule suggests that the current weekly wage rate for a person employed in the activity in which Mr Claydon was then engaged, would have been receiving the sum of $750.00 per week.
 
It is important to remember, I think, that there is a great deal of fiction in the assessment of the worker's probable weekly earnings in this particular jurisprudence. It assumes a state of affairs which does not exist, that is to say that the worker would probably have been earning $750.00 per week, when it is clear from the evidence that no such situation would have existed. This was a man who had retired and who had done a one-off job in an activity with which he was extremely familiar. However, this artificiality has long been recognised and accepted by courts of high authority." 
Manser J went on to decide how much the respondent would be able to earn in his injured condition, and related questions. Then, somewhat later in his reasons he returned to the question of weekly compensation for total incapacity, saying: "I find therefore that at all material times since the worker has been partially incapacitated, his ability to earn in some suitable employment is the sum of $100.00. The mathematical difference, of course, is $650.00.
 
However, there would seem to be a period of about 6 months in which the worker could truly be said to have been totally incapacitated for work, and I find that to be so.
 
The consequence of this exercise is that in respect of the period of 26 weeks from 27 January 1993, the worker was totally incapacitated for work. His probable weekly earnings were, as I say, $750.00, and that is the rate at which he should be paid for that period." 
In order to get to "the amount of the worker's current weekly wage rate" which would, pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s36.html), be an injured worker's weekly compensation payment for any period of total incapacity during the first twenty-six weeks of such incapacity, a number of subsequent provisions have to be considered, as already mentioned.

The first is [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s36.html) which said that "current weekly wage rate ... means [that rate] determined ... in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html)".
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html), so far as presently relevant (see 42(1)(d)), provided that the current weekly wage rate was "a reference to the prescribed proportion of the worker's average weekly earnings in respect of work being performed by the worker immediately before becoming incapacitated". [Section (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) defined the "prescribed proportion" as 80% and "average weekly earnings" as meaning "the average weekly earnings ... determined in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html), during the period of 12 months before the injury or, if the worker has been employed with the employer concerned for less than 12 months, during that lesser period".

At the relevant time [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) provided: "43.(1) For the purposes of the provisions of this Act relating to 'earnings' and 'average weekly earnings' of a worker, the following rules shall be observed: 
Average weekly earnings shall be computed in such manner as is best calculated to give the rate at which the worker was being remunerated, except that if, because of the shortness of the time during which the worker has been in the employment of the employer or the terms of the employment, it is impracticable at the date of the injury to compute the rate of remuneration, regard may be had to the average weekly amount which, during the 12 months previous to the injury, was being earned: by a person in the same grade, employed at the same work, by the same employer; or if there is no person so employed, by a person in the same grade in the same class of employment, and in the same district." 
It seems reasonably clear that one factor (and it must have been the principal one) in Manser J's reaching the $750 figure was the wages schedule tendered by the respondent, (Exhibit F), for he said that it suggested that someone employed in the activity in which the respondent was then engaged would be receiving $750 per week. However, it is not at all clear whether, when applying [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html), as I think he was bound to do, he used the opening part of par (a) (the primary rule) or the part following the words "except that". This latter part provided a secondary rule to be used in cases within the exception.

The appellants made a number of different submissions in support of the contention that the trial judge erred in accepting the figure of $750.00 per week as the respondent's "average weekly earnings". 
First, at the very least, the appellants said, the trial judge, even if he were right in taking $750 as his starting point, had overlooked the need, because of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html), to reduce that figure by 20% in order to convert what the judge took to be the actual average weekly earnings to the current weekly wage rate being the prescribed proportion of those average weekly earnings. The judge's figure therefore had to be reduced, on any view, to $600.

Counsel for the respondent did not contest that this initial adjustment, at least, would have to be made.

Next, submissions were made for the appellants to the effect that the primary rule in [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) should have been used, and that the case did not fall within the exceptions defined in par (a). The primary submission in this respect involved the idea that it was not impracticable at the date of the respondent's injury to compute the rate of his remuneration. It was submitted that since the quote to do the work for $1,500 had been given on the basis that that was the price for what was estimated to be two weeks work and since the amount was to be shared equally with Mr Moss, the amount of $1,500 had to be divided by four, bringing the figure down to $375, which then had to be reduced by 20%, leaving a result of $300. It was said there was nothing impracticable about this computation.

On this same footing, two other possibilities were put. One was, in recognition of the fact that the work was actually completed in six days, that the respondent should be treated as being on a daily rate of one sixth of $750, that is $625 per five day week, and that that should be the figure subject to the 20% reduction. The other submission was that the amount earned by the respondent for the work, whichever figure was taken, should be divided by 52 to see what the respondent had averaged during the year ending with the six day work period.

A first step in considering these submissions is to decide whether the exception to [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) was applicable. It would have been if it had been impracticable at the date of the injury to compute "the rate of remuneration". The reference to "rate of remuneration" seems to be a reference back to the earlier words "the rate per week at which the worker was being remunerated". "Rate" simply as a word by itself, does not appear to be defined in the Act. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s36.html) uses the defined phrase "current weekly wage rate", and in some cases that will be a rate fixed by an award, or in the case of an employee of the Crown and some other employers, pursuant to a determination: [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) and (b). The "rate per week" and the "rate of remuneration" referred to in [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) do not appear to be referable to rates of the kind mentioned in [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) and (b) which can be ascertained by reference to an award for a determination.
Paragraph (a) of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) refers to the computing of the rates mentioned in the paragraph. Some kind of calculation seems to be envisaged, as distinct from reference to a schedule of some kind. "Average weekly earnings" in par (a) means the average weekly earnings of the worker during the period of twelve months before the injury or, if the worker has been employed with the employer for less than twelve months, during that lesser period: [s (8).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html)
Although the definition in [s (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) of "average weekly earnings" is restricted to operating "In this section", the use of the defined phrase in [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html), which is a subsection whose opening words appear to make it applicable for the purposes of Division 2 generally, seems to me to make the definition applicable to the phrase when used in [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) 
The primary rule in [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) requires "average weekly earnings" as defined in [s (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) to "be computed in such manner as is best calculated to give the rate per week at which the worker was being remunerated", presumably at the time of the incapacitating injury. The words "best calculated" seem to me to import an element of judgmental evaluation into the computation process.

In the present case, the broad facts are plain: for six days work the respondent earned $750, that is $125 a day. Assuming that "average weekly earnings" contemplates a five day week, the bare figures give the result that at the date of injury the respondent was earning at the rate of $625 a week.

I do not see any better way of computing the respondent's "average weekly earnings". Although the method used is a simple one, and leaves out of account matters that are taken into account in the fixing of the rates which appear in the awards and determinations mentioned in [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) and (b), the result does not seem to me to be unrealistic. By this I mean that the result seems to me to be within the range of what the respondent in the year of his retirement before the injury would have earned at any time when he chose to work for remuneration, and in my opinion, represents actuality for the short time of his employment during the twelve months terminated by his injury.

Since I think it is possible to arrive at the foregoing result, which seems to me to be a sensible one, I do not think that it is impracticable "to compute the rate of remuneration" referred to in the exception to [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s43.html) 
On this approach, if any of the appellants' submissions were to succeed it would be the one last described. The submission which would treat the respondent's $750 as being payment for two weeks work does not accord with the facts, and the other, which would take the relevant figure as the total for the year, and use it to calculate a minuscule weekly average through the year, is not justified by the statutory prescription.

At this stage it is necessary to consider the principal argument of the respondent seeking to support Judge Manser's figure. (The figure sought to be supported was the $600, representing Judge Manser's $750 less the "prescribed proportion" defined by [s (8).)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s42.html) 
This argument revolved around the wages schedule tendered by the respondent (Exhibit F), which has already been mentioned.

This document was entitled "Applicant's Schedule of Earnings". Under a heading "DATE" it said "27.1.93 - and continuing"; under a heading "PROBABLE EARNINGS AWARD $P.W." it said "$750.00". and under a heading "ACTUAL EARNINGS" it said "Nil". The appellant filed a corresponding document entitled "Respondent's Wages Schedule" which disputed this estimate. However, the appellants' schedule was not tendered as evidence at the hearing. For the respondent it was submitted that the trial judge was either bound or entitled to accept this document as showing the respondent's current weekly wage rate.

This submission was first put on the basis that the appellant's failure to tender their schedule meant, because of [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s6.html) of
Part 9 of the Compensation Court Rules that the $750 figure was deemed to be admitted .

As <case> made it clear that it was dealing with pre-injury average weekly earnings, it does not seem to me that, even if Pt 9 r 6 did operate here, any resultant deemed admission could be of any absolute assistance. As I understood counsel for the respondent, he eventually acknowledged this and confined his submission about the document to the contention that it was evidence of the probable earnings having been $750 per week. I am not sure that this is right, in the circumstances, but even if it were, the evidentiary value would not be conclusive, and I would prefer to rely on the actual facts, as they appeared in evidence.

On this footing I think the appellants should succeed on the basis earlier indicated, that is, that the respondent's "average weekly earnings" during the period less than twelve months when he was employed by the appellants should be taken as $625 a week (on the $125 a day, five day week basis); and that this means the current weekly wage rate for purposes of <case> was $500 (because of <case>(d)).

Accordingly, I would uphold the appeal against Order 1.(1), set it aside, and in its place make an award for $500 for twenty-six weeks from 27 January 1993 on the basis of total incapacity.

This conclusion means also that, at the least, Order 1.(2), (3) and (4) must be reconsidered. This is because <case> which governed weekly payments during partial incapacity required the court, as one step towards reaching the eventual figure, to decide upon an amount not exceeding the difference between, putting the matter in very general terms, pre-injury earnings and post-injury earnings; and the calculation of pre-injury earnings, by <case> had as one component, the need to refer to "the worker's current weekly wage rate for the pre-injury employment". This is the same figure as the one already dealt with in connection with Order 1.(1), that is, the $750 figure used by Manser J, which as I have already said, should in my opinion have been $500.

In arriving at Orders 1.(2), (3) and (4) Manser J first took $750 as the probable pre-injury weekly amount, then considered the remaining capacity of the respondent, post-injury, and concluded it was $100 per week, and then considered the remaining requirement of <case> which was to decide upon an amount not exceeding the $650 difference which would "bear such relation to the amount of that difference as may appear proper in the circumstances of the case". He expressed his conclusion on this matter as follows: "I adjust the mathematical difference between the worker's probable weekly earnings but for injury and the amount which I have determined he would be able to earn in some suitable employment by $150 per week." 
He thus arrived at a figure of $500 a week. This was greater than the maximum amount payable under the Act and accounted for the form of his orders as first expressed, that is, "to ... pay ... compensation on the basis of his partial incapacity ... at the rate applicable to an adult worker with a dependant spouse". The form of the Order 1.(2), (3) and (4), as set out at p 3 above, is the translation of this form of order into the specifics of the rates from time to time applicable to an adult worker with a dependant spouse.

The appellants made a submission in regard to Order 1.(2), (3) and (4) which, if correct, would involve the court in a much wider reconsideration of the order made by the judge below than would be involved in simply asking whether a proper result could be achieved by using the $500 figure in place of the $750 figure in the appropriate place in the calculation, and adjusting the other figures used by Manser J.

The submission pointed to the need for the trial judge first to have calculated the difference between pre- and post-injury earnings (this is a very loose way of describing what is precisely defined in pars (a) and (b) of s 40(1)) and then having arrived at that difference, which does not supply the answer to the question what shall be the amount payable for partial incapacity but simply the upper limit of that amount, to consider what amount less than that "may appear proper in the circumstances of the case".

For the appellants it was submitted that this last operation required the judge to look at all the circumstances of the case and exercise a judicial discretion in arriving at the appropriate figure. It was submitted that the circumstances of the case overwhelmingly pointed to a much lower figure than that arrived at by Manser J. His main point was the feature of the case that
Manser J had summed up in a sentence: "This was a man who had retired and who had done a one off job in an activity with which he was extremely familiar." 
The argument was that the result of Manser J's decision was that the respondent became entitled to the same compensation until the age of sixty-six as if he had been a full time worker when injured, when the fact was that with the exception of the six days work which terminated in his injury he had for all practical purposes been a retired non worker for nearly two years preceding the injury.

This seems to me to be a very powerful consideration and one to which Manser J did not, so far as I can tell, give sufficient weight. Since the partial incapacity awards must be set aside in any case, for the reason earlier mentioned, the question thus arises, should this court attempt to go through the process required by <case> and itself reach conclusions about the amount of compensation for partial incapacity, or should the question be remitted to the Compensation Court.

The direction at the conclusion of <case> that the weekly amount awarded for partial incapacity must "bear such relation to the amount of that difference" - that is, the difference between pre- and post-injury earnings - "as may appear proper in the circumstances of the case" has regularly been recognised as imposing upon the court a discretionary power which must be exercised in arriving at the amount of the weekly award: see, amongst many examples, Lovett Building Co Pty Limited versus Burns [(1993) 9 NSWCCR 58] at 66.
This discretion is constantly exercised by judges of the Compensation Court, which is regarded as a specialist tribunal in all the matters for which that court is the appropriate first instance court.

When the question was raised with counsel for the appellants whether, if the court were to set aside the partial incapacity order, a new trial would be necessary, the answer was that prima facie that would probably be so, subject to the submission that here the case was so plain that the result of the respondent's pre-injury position of retirement was that he should not have compensation at all, and this court should go ahead and say so. Although, as I have indicated, Manser J's reduction of the <case> difference in my opinion gave insufficient weight to the powerful circumstances favouring a greater reduction, I am not persuaded that the circumstances require a reduction so great as to make any award nugatory, and I do not accept that part of the appellants' submission.

Counsel for the respondent argued against any interference with the partial incapacity order, but said that if the court was against him on that, then the matter should go back for a re-hearing according to law.

In the circumstances it seems to me more appropriate for the Compensation
Court to decide whether, and if so what, order should be made in favour of the respondent for the partial incapacity.

I therefore propose the following orders should be made: 
Appeal upheld.

Order 1 set aside; instead order .(a) the Appellants/Respondents pay to the Respondent/Applicant weekly compensation in the sum of $500 for twenty-six weeks from 27 January 1993 on the basis of total incapacity.
 that the balance of the Respondent/Applicant's application for weekly compensation be remitted to the Compensation Court for determination in accordance with this decision.

That the parties file written submissions within seven days of the making of these orders on the question what orders should be made for the costs of this appeal. Those written submissions should be delivered to my associate.

In case it may be material at some stage of these proceedings, I record that at one point prior to the hearing of the appeal, the parties had agreed on a compromise of the proceedings, subject to the obtaining of an order under [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/). As it turned out, the parties were unable to obtain such an order, and when the appeal came on for hearing, after some discussion of the situation that had arisen, the view was arrived at between counsel and the court that the only function of this court in the circumstances in regard to the appeal was to hear it and decide it in the ordinary way. The proposed compromise and any problems the parties had had under [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) were of no relevance to the appeal, were not mentioned again and have played no part in the hearing or decision of the appeal.
