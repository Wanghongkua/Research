PROCEDURE - civil - [Criminal Assets Recovery Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) - restraining order  
JUDGMENT
By summons filed in the Registry of the Supreme Court of NSW on 4 May 2016 the NSW Crime Commission, the plaintiff, seeks orders pursuant to <case> of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1900 ("the Act") against the defendant, Tien Cuong Nghiem. The orders sought are for a restraining order in respect of any interests in property of the defendant, including property set out in Schedule One, but excluding the property outlined in Schedule Two of the Summons.
Section 10A of the Act provides for applications of this nature to be heard ex parte, and this application proceeded on that basis.
In support of the application for a restraining order, the plaintiff relies upon the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark, filed 4 May 2016. Mr Spark is employed by the plaintiff as a Director of Financial Investigations and his affidavit sets out that he is an authorised officer as defined in <case> of the Act. He is a person authorised in writing by the plaintiff generally to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of <case> and Part 4 of the Act.
As a result of his employment with the plaintiff, Mr Spark has had access to records held by the New South Wales Police Force on its Computerised Operational Policing System, and records held by Land and Property Information New South Wales, being a unit of the Department of Finance, Services and Innovation. He has also seen, on a number of occasions, records held by the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services and is familiar with the nature and appearance of such information.
Mr Spark suspects that the defendant has engaged in the following serious crime related activities as defined in <case> of the Act, being acts which are offences falling within the definition of "serious criminal offence", pursuant to <case>(b) and 6(2)(d) of the Act: * (1) Cultivate by enhanced indoor means prohibited plants (cannabis), contrary to <case>(1A) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 ("DMTA"); and * (2) Knowingly take part in the cultivation of prohibited plants (cannabis) which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited plant, contrary to <case>(a) of the DMTA.
* (3) Recklessly deal with the proceeds of crime (in excess of $200,000), contrary to [s 193B(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) being an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involving money laundering.
Mr Sparks relies upon a police Fact Sheet which outlines the suspected serious criminal activity outlined above. The defendant was charged with the offences specified in the Fact Sheet on 23 March 2016.
The Fact Sheet outlines that in February 2016 the State Crime Command Drug Squad established a strike force to investigate the cultivation of cannabis. During the course of the investigation, a number of premises were identified as of interest to the police. The premises included addresses in Baulkham Hills, West Pennant Hills and two addresses in Greenacre. Police conducted physical surveillance of the premises and observed the defendant attending the addresses in Baulkham Hills and West Pennant Hills
Search warrants were executed on both of the premises which the defendant was seen attending in March 2016. Both premises were secured and an elaborate indoor hydroponic cannabis cultivation was found to be active in several rooms at each location. It was later detected that the mains electricity supply for both premises had been illegally bypassed to support the cultivation systems. At one address, 89 cannabis plants were found, and at the other 85 cannabis plants were located.
The police have evidence to establish that the defendant is responsible for the care and supervision of the cannabis cultivations. The estimated street value of the plants seized is $525,000.
The defendant was arrested on 23 March 2016 after he arrived at one of the Greenacre addresses, and charged with the offences outlined above. Following his arrest, police executed two further search warrants on the Greenacre residences and sums of $200,000 AUD and $860,000 AUD were discovered. The police allege that the sums of money are proceeds from the cultivation of cannabis. The police have located documents in the name of the defendant linking him to the Baulkham Hills address.
Having considered the material tendered by the NSW Crime Commission, including the affidavit of Mr Spark, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion held by Mr Spark. In accordance with [s 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10a.html), I make the restraining order sought, and the further orders requested by the plaintiff.
