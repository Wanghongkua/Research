Robert Walter YANDELL t/as YANDELL SOLICITORS v Ira GOLDENBERG 
On 24 September 1992, the plaintiff (John Roberts) lent Mrs Goldenberg (the respondent) $108,000 for 3 years secured by a mortgage over a home unit. The loan was guaranteed by the respondent's son and daughter-in-law. The appellant solicitors (Yandells) acted for the respondent in the transaction. The money was used, inter alia, to discharge a first mortgage to the Advance Bank and a second mortgage to Westpac.

On 24 August 1994, the respondent defaulted on the monthly payment and the default continued. The plaintiff sued the respondent who defended the proceedings and filed a cross-claim against the solicitors.

The trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed against the respondent and the respondent was entitled to damages against the solicitors for the prejudice she suffered as a consequence of entering into the transaction. He also noted that there was a `sparseness of evidence' concerning the respondent's understanding of the mortgage she had entered into with Westpac in 1990.

In further argument on the quantification of the respondent's loss, her rights under the [Contracts Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) (the
Act) were raised for the first time. The appellant argued that this submission was outside the pleadings and raised an entirely new case.

The judge held that the transaction involved both benefit and detriment to the respondent which must be set-off. He accepted the argument of the respondent that, in the event that Westpac had attempted to enforce the mortgage against her, she would have been entitled to relief under the Act. He assessed that, on the available evidence, there was a 50% probability that she would have obtained relief under the Act. The finding had the effect of adding $25,000 to her damages award.

On appeal it was submitted that the trial judge erred:
In failing to find that the discharge of the Westpac mortgage was a benefit to the respondent and not a detriment;
In finding that the value of the benefit conferred ought to be discounted having regard to the probability that the respondent would have received relief under the Act;
In holding that the degree of such a probability was 50%.

Held:
The judge's finding concerning the probability of the respondent obtaining relief under the Act was surprising given his earlier finding concerning the sparsity of evidence.
Prima facie, credit should have been given for any benefit obtained by receipt of the later mortgage monies.
The respondent failed to raise a claim against Westpac at the trial and accordingly no evidence had been called. The only relevant evidence was sparse and had been tendered on a different issue. In the circumstances, it would not be fair to the solicitors to use that material.
The judge should have held that the whole of the amount paid to discharge the Westpac mortgage was a benefit to the respondent which should have been set off in her claim against the solicitors.

Robert Walter YANDELL t/as YANDELL SOLICITORS versus 
Ira GOLDENBERG 
JUDGMENT 
BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
STEIN JA: On 24 September 1992 the plaintiff (John Roberts) lent Mrs Goldenberg $108,000 for 3 years secured by a mortgage over her home unit at Bellevue Hill. The loan was guaranteed by Mrs Goldenberg's son and daughter-in-law. The appellant solicitors, Yandells, acted for the Goldenbergs in the transaction. The loan provided for the payment of monthly interest instalments. Default was made in such payments on 24 August 1994 and it continued. The plaintiff sued Mrs Goldenberg who defended the proceedings but also cross-claimed against Yandells for damages for negligence in acting for her. 
When the transaction was settled, $8,791.57 was applied to discharge Mrs
Goldenberg's first mortgage to the Advance Bank and $76,552.27 applied to discharge Mrs Goldenberg's second mortgage to Westpac.

McLelland CJ in Eq found that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed against
Mrs Goldenberg. In his judgment of 3 February 1997 his Honour noted that: 
Some evidence was given by Mrs Goldenberg to the effect that she was either unaware of, or did not adequately understand, the mortgage transaction with
Westpac in 1990, and evidence in response was adduced from Ms Howard who was a bank officer with Westpac who dealt with that transaction, although Ms
Howard's recollection of the matter was not good. I do not consider it necessary for the purpose of the present hearing to make any finding on this matter, and, in view of the sparseness of the evidence and the pendency of the proceedings against Igor and Eleonora, undesirable to attempt to do so in the absence of any such necessity.

His Honour turned to Mrs Goldenberg's cross-claim against the solicitors and found in her favour. The judge however indicated to the parties that he wished to be addressed on the issue of the quantification of Mrs Goldenberg's loss.
This occurred on 11 February 1997. In addressing on Mrs Goldenberg's loss, counsel for Mrs Goldenberg indicated that her loss included the opportunity to resist liability under the Westpac mortgage. Counsel specifically referred to her rights under the [Contracts Review Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) . On behalf of the solicitors, Mr Dempsey submitted that credit should be given for the discharge of Mrs Goldenberg's liabilities to the Advance Bank and Westpac.
He said: 
My learned friend raised a further argument today that in fact the solicitor is responsible for the Westpac mortgage, because it was either invalid or the first defendant lost the opportunity of demonstrating that it was and, in my submission, if the defendant had wished to demonstrate that the Westpac mortgage was invalid, these were the proceedings in which that relief could conveniently and should properly have been sought. There was no procedural other reason why that dispute, if it was to be agitated, could not have been brought in these proceedings, subject to the joinder of Westpac.

Mr Dempsey continued that Mrs Goldenberg had not lost the opportunity of seeking to set aside the Westpac mortgage either by virtue of the solicitor's conduct or otherwise, subject to questions of limitation of action. Counsel noted that the argument raised an entirely new case against the solicitors, completely outside the proceedings and the pleadings, alleging that the solicitors failed to advise Mrs Goldenberg of her rights against Westpac under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/).

McLelland CJ gave his second judgment on 27 February 1997. He concluded that in Mrs Goldenberg's case against the solicitors, she was entitled to damages for the prejudice and disadvantage she had suffered as a consequence of entering into the transaction of 24 September 1992. He noted that the transaction involved both benefit and detriment to Mrs Goldenberg. These must be set-off. The possible benefits included the monies paid to the Advance Bank to discharge the first mortgage and the discharge of the Westpac mortgage. The
Advance Bank mortgage discharge was clearly of benefit to Mrs Goldenberg. The solicitors submitted that the Westpac discharge was also of benefit to Mrs
Goldenberg. Mrs Goldenberg contended that, in the event of an attempt by
Westpac to enforce the mortgage against her, she would have been entitled to relief under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/).

His Honour found that her chances of resisting enforcement of the Westpac mortgage in relation to the $19,151.58 and interest paid to discharge a debt to the ANZ Bank was negligible. He continued: 
There is some evidence, to which I referred in passing in my judgment of 3
February 1997, from Mrs Goldenberg and Ms Howard as to the circumstances of the execution by Mrs Goldenberg of the Westpac mortgage. Having regard particularly to my finding as to Mrs Goldenberg's ability to understand
English and to Ms Howard's account of the circumstances of the execution by
Mrs Goldenberg of the Westpac mortgage, the probability of Mrs Goldenberg obtaining relief under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) in respect of the Westpac mortgage, had proceedings been taken to enforce that mortgage in or about September 1992, cannot be regarded as negligible so far as the excess over $26,400.00 was concerned. That excess was approximately $50,000.00. If the Westpac mortgage had not been discharged on 24 September the evidence suggests that Westpac would have sought to enforce the mortgage within a short time thereafter. If this had occurred, and on the limited information available, I would assess the degree of probability of Mrs
Goldenberg then obtaining relief under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) from payment of the abovementioned $50,000.00 as approximately 50%. It is true that
Mrs Goldenberg might in theory have sought relief against Westpac under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) in any event even after the discharge of the Westpac mortgage on 24 September 1992 (see Contract Review Act s.14), but in the circumstances it was not unreasonable for her not to do so, at least until she obtained independent advice about the matter, which I infer did not occur until after solicitors were retained to appear for her following commencement of the present proceedings on 20 December 1994. By that time any claim under the [Contracts
Review Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) in respect of the Westpac mortgage was statute barred (Contracts Review Act s.16).

These findings are somewhat surprising given that his Honour indicated in the first judgment that he would not make a finding on the issue noting the `sparseness of the evidence'.

Out of the $108,000 Mrs Goldenberg borrowed from Mr Roberts, the Westpac mortgage was discharged. It seems to me that, prima facie, credit should be given for any benefit obtained by receipt of the later mortgage monies. This conclusion is consistent with remarks made in Collier versus Morlend Finance
Corporation (Vic) Pty Ltd [[1989] ASC 55-716] at 58,430 and 58,433 and Demetrios versus Gikas Dry Cleaning Industries Pty Ltd [(1991) 22
NSWLR 561] at 575 and 576 although in different contexts from the present.

In the proceedings no claim by Mrs Goldenberg against Westpac under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/) was ever raised. Such a claim would have been likely to have involved the calling of evidence. It is not surprising that the court did not investigate the issue since it was never part of the pleadings and was never raised in the proceedings. It first surfaced after the initial judgment on liability was delivered and in submissions on damages. As it was, all that his Honour had before him was what he had described as the `sparse evidence' tendered on a different issue at the trial.

In my opinion, to utilise that material was unfair to the solicitors because it was really a new claim that they did not advise Mrs Goldenberg of her rights against Westpac under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/). It was not merely a matter going to damages or, if it did, the parties ought to have been invited to call evidence if they desired. Indeed, if Mrs Goldenberg wished to raise the issue, the pleadings should have been amended and evidence called. The question of the joinder of Westpac may also have arisen. I think that his Honour erred in considering the issue on damages and in concluding that Mrs Goldenberg had a 50% chance of setting aside the Westpac mortgage.
The finding had the effect of adding $25,000 to her damages against the solicitors. In my opinion, his Honour should have found (absent permitting a new case to be run by Mrs Goldenberg) that the whole of the excess amount of approximately $50,000 paid to discharge the Westpac mortgage, after $26,400 principal and interest had been directed to discharging the ANZ mortgage, was a benefit to Mrs Goldenberg. It should have been set-off in her claim against the solicitors. The issue of whether Mrs Goldenberg had suffered a detriment by losing the chance of successfully resisting, under the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/), a hypothetical claim by Westpac to enforce the mortgage was never investigated by the Court.

The effect of this conclusion is that his Honour erred in deducting $25,000 from the amount of the solicitors' liability to Mrs Goldenberg. He should have deducted the whole of the $50,000. This means that the liability of the solicitors to Mrs Goldenberg set out in paragraph 3 of the orders of the court should be reduced to $22,460.26, together with interest thereon as provided by paragraph 3(b).

The parties should file Short Minutes of Order within 7 days giving effect to the judgment of the court reducing the damages awarded to Mrs Goldenberg as against the appellant, Yandells, and to make any consequential amendments necessary to the orders of McLelland CJ in Eq. The respondent should pay the appellants' costs of the appeal but have a certificate under the Suitors'
Fund Act if otherwise entitled.
