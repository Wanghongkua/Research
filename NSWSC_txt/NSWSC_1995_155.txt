JUDGE1
GLEESON CJ The issue in this appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the District
Court to hear and determine a claim in negligence for damages for personal injuries, in circumstances where the defendant's conduct, and the resulting physical injury to the plaintiff, occurred outside New South Wales, but some of the consequential damage was suffered by the plaintiff in this State.
The issue turns upon the meaning and effect of [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/).
The appeal comes to this court, by leave, from a decision of Moore DCJ, who had before him a motion seeking the dismissal of the action brought by the respondent plaintiff. Two grounds were relied upon by the appellant defendant.
The first, which is no longer material, was that the action should be dismissed for want of prosecution. The second, which forms the basis of this appeal, was that the District Court had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The motion was unsuccessful.
The facts may be stated quite briefly. The respondent has, at all material times, been a resident of New South Wales. Some years ago, she went to Falls
Creek in
Victoria for a skiing holiday. While there, she injured herself. The accident occurred as she was alighting from a chair lift. She claims that the accident was caused by negligent acts or omissions of the appellant, who was the ski lift operator, its servants and agents. She sues for damages for negligence. The action was commenced in 1991, but, as was noted, the complaint of want of prosecution does not arise in this appeal.
On the day following the accident, the respondent returned to New South
Wales by the first available air transport and was taken to a hospital in
Sydney for treatment. Subsequently she underwent a number of surgical procedures in hospitals in the Sydney area. The cost of these procedures forms part of her claim for damages. The respondent also claims loss of income resulting from the accident. It was in New South Wales that she suffered most of the after-effects of the accident.

The District Court is a court of limited, statutory, jurisdiction. The common law classifies courts as superior or inferior. That classification has important consequences for a number of matters, including the subject of jurisdiction. For the purposes of that classification, the District Court is an inferior court.
The civil jurisdiction of the District Court is presently defined by Div 2 of [Pt III](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/index.html#p3) of the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/). The relevant statutory provisions are contained in [ss44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s44.html) and [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the Act.
[Section 44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s44.html) provides, so far as is material, as follows: "44 (1) Subject to this Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the following actions: any personal action at law in which the amount claimed does not exceed $250,000, whether on a balance of account or after an admitted set-off or otherwise; any action to recover goods that have been detained, or to recover the assessed value of such goods, in which the value of the goods together with the amount of any consequential damages claimed for the detention of the goods does not exceed $250,000; any action brought to recover an amount not exceeding $20,000, which is the whole or part of the unliquidated balance of a partnership account, or the amount or part of the amount of the distributive share under an intestacy or legacy under a will.".
[Section 46](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s46.html), which confers upon the court certain powers in relation to the granting of ancillary equitable relief, is not relevant.
[Section 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) is in the following terms: "47 (1) The Court shall have jurisdiction in accordance with this
Act to hear and dispose of an action, and a registrar may exercise the powers conferred on the registrar by any of the rules
Prescribed for the purposes of this subsection - notwithstanding that part of the cause of action arose outside New South Wales, provided a material part of the cause of action arose within New South Wales; notwithstanding that the whole cause of action arose outside
New South Wales, provided the defendant was resident within New
South Wales at the time of service of the document which commenced the action; or notwithstanding that the defendant is not within New South
Wales, provided the whole cause of action or a material part of the cause of action arose within New South Wales and provided the defendant was within a
State or a part of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of the Service and Execution of Process Act, , of the Commonwealth) at the time of service of the document which commenced the action.
Subsection (1)(c) applies whether the defendant has or has not ever been resident or carried on business in New South Wales.
In this section, "defendant" includes, where there are two or more defendants, any one of those defendants".
Section 47 was amended in 1975 and 1984, but neither amendment is presently material. The present form of the section, quoted above, is not precisely the form of the section at the time the respondent's action was commenced. The only difference, however, is that the section is now expressed in gender-neutral terms, and it is convenient to deal with the section in its present form.
It is common ground that the appellant defendant is incorporated in
Victoria, and has never had a place of business in New South Wales. It is agreed that the appellant is not within New South Wales within the meaning of s47(1)(c). The case was argued at first instance on the basis that the critical question is whether a material part of the respondent's cause of action arose within New South Wales. The respondent's argument was widened on appeal to include a submission based upon the provisions of the Service and
Execution of Process Act 1901 (Cth), but, for a reason given below, that legislation would not assist the respondent if her argument about s47 is rejected.
The language of s47, and, in particular, the references in it to material parts of a cause of action arising within New South Wales, or to the whole of a cause of action arising outside
New South Wales, must be understood in the light of the history of Australian and English legislation dealing with district, or county, courts, and the common law rules relating to the jurisdiction of inferior courts, which have had an important influence on the relevant legislation.
Since 1973, New South Wales has had one State-wide District Court. Before then it had a number of district courts, whose operations and jurisdiction were tied to local districts, as defined from time to time.
District courts were established in 1858 following the presentation of petitions from the inhabitants of country centres requesting the setting-up of district courts in their towns and districts (H T E Holt "A Court Rises", published by the Law Foundation of New South Wales, p10). The colony was divided into districts, and district courts were to be held at proclaimed places, although such places and districts were subject to alteration. The jurisdiction of the courts was limited to cases in which a defendant either resided in the locality, or had incurred liability therein, and it was also limited by the amount of money in dispute, and the nature of the cause of action.
The legislation governing the operations of the courts was altered from time to time, but an example of the legislative scheme as to jurisdiction can be found in s7 of the District Courts Act 1912, which provided: "7.(1) The several courts appointed to be held at towns and places within such districts, respectively, shall have jurisdiction(a) when the defendant, or one of two or more defendants, as the case may be, is resident or carries on business, or when the debt sued for was contracted, or the liability for damages arose within the districts for which such courts respectively are ordered to be held.
For the purposes of preventing disputes as to the jurisdiction of District Courts, and in order to facilitate the execution of process including the service of summonses, the courts holden in and for each of any two adjacent districts shall, for the purposes of this
Act, be deemed to have jurisdiction for the space of two miles on either side of the boundary between such districts, but the fact that an action is pending in one of such courts, or a judgment recovered therein, shall be a bar to an action in the other court between the same parties for the same cause".
The legislative scheme was plain. Territorial jurisdiction, which was fundamental to the idea of courts set up to serve defined localities, depended upon two factors: the locality in which the defendant resided or carried on business; and the locality where a debt sued for was contracted or the liability for damages arose. The rules for determining where a debt was contracted were technical and reasonably clear. Liability for damages would arise in the place where such liability first came into existence. There could be no doubt that, in the present case, the appellant's liability for damages came into existence in Victoria, where the respondent's cause of action was complete.
The limitation period commenced to run on the day she was injured, before she returned to New South Wales. (Hawkins versus Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539. That was when her cause of action first accrued. (See Brennan J at 561-2, Deane J at 587.)
Historically, there was a substantial difference between the territorial basis of the jurisdiction of a superior court, on the one hand, and that of an inferior court, on the other.
That difference is reflected to this day in the differences in the statutes governing the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the
District Court of New South Wales.
At common law, the basis of a superior courts jurisdiction was found in the capacity to serve process upon a defendant. Provided a defendant was served with process within the jurisdiction, it mattered not where the cause of action arose. The primary or proper jurisdiction of a superior court is over persons who are served with process within the jurisdiction (John Russell and Co Ltd versus Cayzer Irvine and Co Ltd [(1916) 2 AC 298] at 302). (There is, of course, a difference between being present within the jurisdiction on the occasion of service of process, and residing or carrying on business in the jurisdiction.) As a corollary, the reach of a superior court's jurisdiction was typically extended by statutory provisions, and rules, permitting service of process outside the jurisdiction. For example, Part 10 of the rules of the
Supreme Court permit the service of originating process outside the State in various defined circumstances. Part 10 r1A provides, inter alia, for service of originating process outside Australia where the proceedings, wholly or partly, are for the recovery of damages in respect of damage suffered in the
State caused by a tortious act or omission wherever occurring.
On the other hand, the jurisdiction of an inferior court was defined by the Act or instrument creating it, and was usually limited, territorially, to matters involving residents of a certain locality, or to causes of action arising within prescribed metes and bounds.
(cf Halsbury's Laws of England, th Ed, Vol 10 para 712; R versus Beecham <case>; [(1910) VLR 204).] For example, s60 of the
English County Courts Act 1846 provided that a summons might issue in a district in which the defendant dwelt or carried on business at the time, or in which the cause of action arose.
Later, the legislation was widened to allow process to issue in a district in which the cause of action arose in whole or in part (County Courts
Act 1888, s74).
One of the principal purposes of the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) , which repealed the District Courts Act 1912, was to abolish the multiplicity of district courts, and establish a single District
Court of New South Wales with
State-wide jurisdiction.
It appears that the language of [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) had its origin in [s36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/cca1958185/s36.html) of the [County Court Act 1958](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/cca1958185/) of Victoria. That section provided: "36. The court shall have power to hear and determine every action in respect of which jurisdiction is conferred upon it by this or any other Act, notwithstanding that part of the cause of action arose outside
Victoria, provided that a material part of the cause of action arose within Victoria, and shall have power to hear and determine every such action notwithstanding that the whole cause of action arose outside Victoria, provided that the defendant resided within Victoria at the time of the service of the summons upon such defendant".
In the provisions of [s36](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/cca1958185/s36.html) of the [County Court Act 1958](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/cca1958185/) (Victoria) and [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), there are to be found the familiar concepts.
If a defendant resides within the locality (now, the State) he or she may be sued by process issuing out of the court; regardless of where the cause of action arose. What has changed is that the whole State has become a
"district". Alternatively, the basis of jurisdiction is that the cause of action arose within the State, either in whole, or at least in material part.
The contrast is between a cause of action that arose wholly outside the
State, and a cause of action a material part of which arose within the State.
In an action framed in negligence the material Parts of the plaintiff's cause of action are the duty of care, the breach, and damage. The consequential damages which a plaintiff may suffer, and for which compensation may be recoverable could, of course, be suffered in a number of jurisdictions or localities. The present case provides an example.
Part of the respondents damages were suffered in New South Wales. (This would equally be the case if she were, not a New South Wales resident returning here for operative treatment, but, for example, a visitor from overseas who had been injured at
Falls Creek and had some medical treatment in Sydney.) However, her cause of action was complete in Victoria in the sense that it first accrued there.
The language of the statute, and the historical background, show that provisions such as [ss44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s44.html) and [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) are intended to mark out the ambit of the District Court's jurisdiction. To the extent to which the language of [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) operates, it extends the jurisdiction of the present
District Court beyond that of the previous district courts, but it also defines the limit of that jurisdiction.
The District Court has no jurisdiction other than that conferred upon it by statute, either expressly or by implication (Jago versus District Court of NSW <case>; [(1989) 168 CLR 23).] The evident purpose of [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) is to state the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the District Court; a matter which, historically, has been regarded as of central importance in legislation establishing inferior courts. In that respect [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) is a limiting provision of the kind referred to in Ex parte Iskra ((1963) [63 SR 538] at 543). For that reason, the effect of s13 of the Service and Execution of Process Act is that the Act does not extend the jurisdiction of the District Court beyond the limits set in [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/). [Section 13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s13.html) provides that the relevant Part of the Service and Execution of Process Act does not confer on a court jurisdiction to hear or determine a suit which it would not have jurisdiction to hear and determine if the writ of summons had been served, relevantly for the present case, in New South Wales. The terms of [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), and in particular [s47(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html), are such that, even if the writ of summons were served in New South Wales, the District Court would not have jurisdiction unless a material part of the cause of action arose within New South Wales.
For reasons relating to the history of legislation defining the jurisdiction of inferior courts, a number of early English authorities addressed the question whether the whole of a cause of action arose within a particular district or locality, or whether, conversely, a material part of the cause of action arose within or without the locality. Those authorities drew a distinction between the place where damage, as an essential element of a cause of action, was suffered, and the place where consequential damages were suffered. (eg, Thurston versus Vincent 1 Jones 448; <case>; [82 ER 235]
A colourful example is to be found in Stannian versus Davis 1 Salk 403, a case concerning a dispute as to the jurisdiction of an inferior court. Leach's report of the same case (1703-1704 Modern Reports, Vol 6 p223) gives the following account of part of the judgment: "It was also agreed clearly, that if that which is the gist of the action, and the complete cause of it, be laid within the jurisdiction, and the declaration shews further matter, which is only aggravation or consequential damage without which the action would have lain such matter need not be averred to be within the jurisdiction; as an action on the case for calling a woman a whore, whereby she lost a marriage, there not only the words, but also the loss of marriage, must be alleged to be within the jurisdiction, because the one without the other will not maintain the action; and there one may confess the words and traverse the damage. So in trespass by a master for the battery of his servant, whereby he lost his service; the loss of service, as well as the battery, must be laid within the jurisdiction. But in an action by a tradesman for calling him a cheat in his trade, whereby he lost his customers; there the loss of customers need not be alleged within the jurisdiction; because the words are actionable without it, and it is only aggravation in an action for arresting one in another man's name, without consent of the other ..."
The effect of the authorities was summarised in Peacock versus Bell <case>; [1 Saund ], as follows: "((A)s to such matters as are inserted only for aggravation of damages, and might be omitted, and yet the action remain, it is not necessary to lay them within the jurisdiction".
It was against that background that it was said by Bovill
CJ in Cooke v
Gille ((1873) [LR 8 CP 107], at 115) that in an inferior court it is necessary to prove that every material fact which constitutes the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the court.
In the context of negligence, the term "damage" includes both the physical injury itself and other foreseeable consequences suffered by the plaintiff Damages are awarded in a lump sum, in compensation for each item or aspect of the damage suffered by the plaintiff (Mahoney versus J Kruschich
Pty Ltd <case>; [(1985) 156 CLR 522] at 266). In the lastmentioned case McHugh JA distinguished between damage (in the sense in which that word is used in SCR Pt10, r (1)(e)) and injury. Injury means actionable wrong. Damage includes all the detriment, physical, financial and social which a plaintiff suffers as the result of the defendant's negligence. His Honour specifically contrasted damage with the element necessary to complete the cause of action.
The place where the whole or a material part of a cause of action "arose", (which is not significantly different from the place were a cause of action first accrues), is in contrast to the place or places where a plaintiff in negligence suffers consequential damage flowing from the injury inflicted by the defendant.
In the only reported case directly in point, (a case whose facts are indistinguishable from the present), Thomas versus Penna ((1985) [2 NSWLR 171)], Nash
DCJ treated this distinction as critical. In my view that decision was right, and should have been followed by Moore DCJ. The case does not fall within [s47(1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) The respondent's cause of action arose in Victoria; no material part of it arose in New South Wales.
I would add two things.
First, I agree with the comments of Nash DCJ in Thomas versus Penna to the effect that there should be legislative reconsideration of the scheme of [s47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/). The modem law as to the power to stay proceedings in the case of inappropriate forum-shopping (see, eg, [Service and Execution Of
Process Act 1992](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/) (Cth) [s20)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s20.html) should be sufficient to protect against the abuses that might otherwise occur if the District Court's extra-territorial jurisdiction were widened. The present is a case in which the District Court would have been an appropriate forum, and it is incongruous that the respondent could undoubtedly have commenced her action in the Supreme Court.
Second, an attempt was made on appeal, on behalf of the respondent, to contend, for the first time, that the wrong procedure had been followed at first instance to raise the jurisdictional issue. The way in which the point was raised below was related to certain exchanges between the lawyers for the parties early in the piece, and if this point had been argued below there would have been room for a discretionary decision to remedy any procedural problem. The respondent should not be permitted to raise the point for the first time on appeal.
The appeal should be allowed and the orders made by Moore DCJ set aside.
The Statement of Claim should be struck out on the ground that the cause of action is beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court. The respondent should pay the appellant's costs of the motion at first instance and of this appeal.
The respondent should have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act if otherwise so entitled.
JUDGE2
MAHONEY
JA I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice. As the appeal raises issues of general importance to the operation of the District
Court of
New South Wales, I shall add some short observations of my own.
What is here in issue is the jurisdiction of the District
Court to determine a proceeding in respect of a cause of action which arose outside New
South Wales where the initiating process was not served in New South Wales.
The defendant company has no relevant connection with New South Wales.
The District Court is constituted by the [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/): [s 8(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s8.html); and its jurisdiction is to be derived from the provisions of that Act. That
Act does not in terms provide for service of its initiating process outside
New South Wales. The (Commonwealth) Service and Execution of Process Act 1901 and (now) the [Service and Execution of Process Act 1992](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/) provide for the service in one State of the process of a Court of another State. Were it not for [s 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) of the [District Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), I would conclude that the summons in the present proceeding was or could have been validly served on the defendant in
Victoria and that such service would have enabled the District Court to determine the present proceeding. It is the anomalous provisions of [s 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s47.html) which prevent such a conclusion. In order to explain why I have reached this conclusion, it is necessary to refer to the general basis of jurisdiction of the Courts of this State and, in particular, of (as it is conventionally described) an inferior court such as the District Court.
I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of the Chief Justice, with which Rolfe AJA has expressed his agreement. I shall therefore state these matters in general terms and without the qualifications and exceptions which would necessarily be involved in a full statement of them.
The basis of the jurisdiction of the ordinary superior courts, such as the
Court of
King's Bench at Westminster and the Supreme Court of New South Wales, is the service of the initiating process within the territorial limits of the relevant realm. It would be wrong to assume that the jurisdiction of these superior courts was determined or developed upon a schematic basis. It was, I think, not developed by way of systematic analysis of concepts; it evolved by historical processes or, perhaps, accidents. However, in understanding the basis of jurisdiction of such courts, it is, I think, useful to distinguish between the kinds of disputes - the kinds of causes of action - which such courts could determine and the circumstances in which they could determine them.
The kinds of disputes, that is, the kinds of causes of action, which those courts could deal with develop from time to time. Oversimplified, the position was originally that such courts had the power to hear and determine the kinds of disputes in respect of which writs or other proceedings were from time to time authorised by the Sovereign. It is not necessary to pursue the growth and spread of the kinds of writs or processes which could be issued and the extension of the jurisdiction thereby to cover substantially the whole area of disputes as to common law rights. A reference to such matters is contained, passim, in Tidds
Practice (1824), 9th ed.
It is important to recognise that such courts could determine such disputes whether the cause of action in question arose inside or outside the realm. It is not necessary for present purposes to trace the growth of the principles of
Private International Law (Conflict of Laws) in this regard. As the common law developed, these courts came to have power to determine the relevant kinds of disputes, even if they arose outside the realm. It was, of course, necessary to determine for this purpose the effect of the law of the place where the cause of action arose and, for example, to distinguish between provisions of the foreign law which were substantive and those which were procedural. But, provided what occurred gave rise to rights and obligations recognised by the common law, that is, to a cause of action, those courts could, in principle, determine disputes in relation to them. In more recent times, it has come to be recognised that - again, I put the matter in general terms - such courts, though they have jurisdiction in respect of particular disputes, may decline to exercise it: see, eg, Oceanic Sun Line Special
Shipping Co Inc versus Fay <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 197] The courts could determine such disputes, even though one or both of the parties were resident or living outside the realm.
 .
But such courts could not determine such matters unless their initiating process was appropriately served. In principle, the courts exercised jurisdiction in respect of such matters if the defendant had been served with the initiating process within the territorial boundaries of the realm. If that process was not so served, the courts could not determine the plaintiff's claim against the defendant.
It has sometimes been suggested that service within the realm is not sufficient if the defendant's presence there is transitory, eg, on a ship at a port or an aircraft at an airport. It is not necessary to consider such matters in this appeal.
The courts' jurisdiction has been expanded by legislation or by court rules. In some cases, service may be substituted or dispensed with. In other cases, service may be authorised outside the realm. But these are exceptions to the underlying principle.
The District
Court is, in the relevant sense, an inferior court.
Therefore the extent of its jurisdiction is to be determined by the terms of the Act. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the Act to see what provision has been made as to these two matters: the nature of the causes of action in respect of which the court may act; and the service of the initiating process.
The [District Court Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) makes no specific provision as to the latter matter. However, it is, I think, proper to infer that, in respect of the relevant causes of action, the Court was seen by the legislature as being granted jurisdiction if and only if the initiating process were served within the realm: in this case, within the territorial limits of the State of New
South Wales. The District Court is now a single court: it covers the whole of the State of New South Wales. In this it differs from the several District
Courts established under the District Courts Act 1912. There is, in my opinion, no reason why in this regard it should be treated in a manner different from the superior courts. The reasons why, in relation to superior courts, the principle requiring service within the realm was adopted are, mutatis mutandis, applicable to a court of the present kind. I have considered the decisions of the High Court and of the Supreme
Court dealing with the jurisdiction of the District Courts under the 1912 Act. I shall not extend this judgment by analysing them.
It is sufficient to state that the principles there enunciated do not, in relation to the present court, lead to a conclusion different from that to which I have referred.
The Service and Execution of Process legislation has provided and now provides for service of initiating process outside the State of the Court in question. I am of the view that, if the principle to which I have referred in relation to service be applied to the District Court, service under the
Service and Execution of Process legislation would result in the District
Court having jurisdiction to the same extent as if the process had been served within the State. However, for the reasons to which I shall refer, it is not necessary to pursue this question to a final conclusion.
The difficulty confronting the plaintiff in this case is a difficulty as to the causes of action over which the District Court is to have the power of decision.
Section 9(1) of the Act provides that the court "shall have a civil jurisdiction, consisting of: (a) its jurisdiction conferred by
Part 3; and ...
". It is the jurisdiction conferred by Pt 3 of the Act which is here in question. That jurisdiction is dealt with, as far as is here relevant, in Pt 3
Div 2. The court is there given a common law jurisdiction: <case>; and an ancillary equitable jurisdiction: s 46. See also ss 50 and 51. Were there no other provisions, it would, I think, be inferred that, as with the superior courts, the
District Court has jurisdiction over all actions referred to in s (I shall put aside the other provisions), provided the steps as to service be taken which subject the defendant to the court's power of decision, ie, its jurisdiction. However, <case> prevents that inference being drawn. Section 47 provides: "47. (1) The Court shall have jurisdiction in accordance with this
Act to hear and dispose of an action, and a registrar may exercise the powers conferred on the registrar by any of the rules prescribed for the purposes of this subsection: notwithstanding that part of the cause of action arose outside
New South Wales, provided a material part of the cause of action arose within New South Wales; notwithstanding that the whole cause of action arose outside
New South Wales, provided the defendant was resident within New
South Wales at the time of service of the document which commenced the action; or notwithstanding that the defendant is not within New South
Wales, provided the whole cause of action or a material part of the cause of action arose within New South Wales and provided the defendant was within a State or a part of the Commonwealth (within the meaning of the Service and Execution of Process Act of the Commonwealth) at the time of service of the document which commenced the action.
Subsection (1)(c) applies whether the defendant has or has not ever been resident or carried on business in New South Wales.
In this section, "defendant" includes, where there are two or more defendants, any one of those defendants."
The construction of <case> is difficult.
At least two questions arise: whether the section was intended to qualify the general principle that (subject to legislation) service of initiating process may be effected only within the State; and whether and to what extent it limits or extends the causes of action which would otherwise be within the District Courts jurisdiction.
The determination of these questions is difficult for at least two reasons: it is not clear what is the effect inter se of (as I shall describe them) the "notwithstanding" and the "provided" provisions in pars (a), (b) and ; and it is not clear what are the assumptions upon which those paragraphs are intended to operate.
These two matters are, of course, inter-related.
The way in which <case> is intended to operate may be illustrated by a paraphrase of what, in my opinion, is the effect of par (a). Relevantly, the paragraph was intended to provide to the following effect: "The
Court shall have jurisdiction in accordance with this Act to hear and dispose of an action ... (a) notwithstanding that (that is, in cases where) part of the cause of action arose outside New South Wales provided (that is, if) a material part of the cause of action arose within New South Wales; ...". The "notwithstanding" and the "provided" provisions of pars (b) and (c) operate in the same way.
That, of course, does not clarify in full the effect of the operation of s 47: it does not make clear whether the section is intended to extend and/or to restrict what otherwise would be the operation of the Act. Again, the matter may be conveniently tested by reference to par (a). Paragraph (a) operates where part of the cause of action arose outside, and a material part arose within, New South Wales. The question arises: why should the legislature have thought it necessary to provide expressly that the court should have jurisdiction in such a case? As I have indicated, were there no provisions such as <case>, the inference would be that the District Court would have jurisdiction in respect of a common law cause of action within <case> whether the cause of action arose within or without the State. (I assume for this purpose that the initiating process is served upon the defendant in the State or otherwise so as to subject him to the Court's jurisdiction). But the paragraph assumes otherwise: <case>(a) is necessary only if it be assumed that the District Court would not have jurisdiction if the cause of action arose outside the State. Paragraph (b) is also enacted upon that assumption.
The two paragraphs assume that the Court would, <case> apart, have no jurisdiction unless the cause of action in question arose entirely within New
South Wales; it is otherwise difficult to see a substantial reason for the enactment of those two paragraphs. I shall not pursue the more complex provisions of par (c).
I am reluctant to construe the
Act upon the basis of such an inference.
Cases have arisen in which legislation has been drafted upon the basis of assumptions which, as the courts have subsequently found, should not be made and the courts have felt it possible to construe the legislation in a way which avoids the effect of the mistaken assumption. In the present case, the assumption which, in my opinion, has been made has two effects at least: it restricts the extent of the jurisdiction of the District Court to causes of action which essentially arise within New South Wales; and to the extent that that restriction is qualified, the qualification is one which is difficult to construe and difficult to apply. But I agree with what is the effect of the judgment of the Chief Justice in this regard.
Even if the assumption on which <case> is based be incorrect the provisions make it clear that it was the purpose of the section to limit the causes of action within the jurisdiction of the District Court to those which satisfied the requirements of the relevant paragraphs.
In stating the matter in this way, I am conscious of what has been said in the earlier cases in relation to the jurisdiction of the more limited courts set up under the District Courts Act 1912. Those courts, being limited narrowly and to the particular territorial areas set up by the 1912 Act, not unnaturally restricted the causes of action with which those courts dealt to causes of action having connection to the districts in question. I think that, where a court is set up as a single court with a state-wide ambit, the considerations which warranted the inference or warranted the enactment of special provisions limiting jurisdiction over causes of action in this way do not apply. I do not think that what has been said in those cases requires a different conclusion.
I have spelled out the steps in the reasoning which has led me to the conclusion which I share with the Chief Justice and
Rolfe AJA. I have done this because, in my respectful opinion, the position in respect of the jurisdiction of the District Court is in this regard unsatisfactory. There is no functional reason why the District Court should not, as do superior courts, have jurisdiction in respect of causes of action wherever arising, subject only to the defendant being appropriately served with the initiating process of the court. The Service and Execution of Process legislation is directed to removing the main jurisdictional restrictions existing in respect of State courts; the legislation is intended to this extent to provide an Australian rather than a State background for the operation of the various State courts.
The District Court is, as I have said, now a court of wide jurisdiction in respect of common law claims and no doubt that jurisdiction will be expanded rather than contracted. To restrict its jurisdiction in the way which <case> does is inappropriate in times of instant communication; no functional purpose is served by it. It is a matter which, in my opinion, warrants the attention of the legislature.
I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice.
