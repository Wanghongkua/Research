Catchwords: 
CRIMINAL LAW - confiscation of criminal proceeds - variation of orders  
JUDGMENT
On 9 September 2011 Garling J made orders under <case> of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 restraining the disposal or attempt to dispose of the property identified in that order. 
The Plaintiff now applies to vary the orders made by the inclusion of a number of other properties contained in the schedule to the earlier order. Those properties are in Western Australia. The need to do so appears in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 December 2013. In short, in order for the present Plaintiff to restrain the disposal of assets in Western Australia, it is necessary for a judgment from this Court to that effect to be registered in Western Australia.
I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the property identified by Mr Spark in his affidavit, and which forms the subject of the present application, ought also to appear in the schedule so that a restraining order can have effect in Western Australia. 
For that reason, the order made on 9 September 2011 is varied in terms of the order contained in the Notice of Motion dated 10 December 2013 and filed in Court today.
