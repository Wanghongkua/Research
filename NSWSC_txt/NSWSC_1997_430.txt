Peter John James versus Paul John Waite & Ors` ` 1855/95` `24 September 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /95 - PETER JOHN JAMES versus PAUL JOHN WAITE & ORS 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an unfortunate case as to which of two innocent sets of parties is to bear the cost of the fraud of a third party. The first defendant did not appear today. He knew about the proceedings because there has been correspondence with him and he telephoned my Associate yesterday as to whether he need turn up today at the hearing. The first defendant was in financial difficulties at the relevant period of time, which is May to September 1994. He had been carrying on business inter alia as a finance broker and moneys had been paid to him by the plaintiff which, to use a neutral term, he had lost. 
The second and third defendants, who are the parents of the first defendant, owned a property at Beresfield. The first defendant talked them into transferring that property to him and said he would give them $130,000 so that they could buy retirement accommodation at Lake Macquarie. For that purpose he took his parents to a solicitor in the Newcastle area, Mr Sneddon, where they signed a transfer of the Beresfield property (which is the property in issue in the present proceedings) and handed the transfer, together with the
Certificate of Title to the first defendant. The first defendant, who never paid any part of the promised $130,000, then took those documents down to
Sydney and produced them to Mr Genge, solicitor. Mr Genge had been acting for the first defendant for some period of time but the evidence is, in the instant case, he was acting for the plaintiff.

The plaintiff and the first defendant agreed that the first defendant would give a mortgage over the Beresfield property for $60,000. That sum was slightly more than the $59,000 which the plaintiff had paid the first defendant, the figure being rounded up, according to the plaintiff, to take account of interest. The mortgage accordingly noted the principal sum as $60,000, the term of mortgage two months and the interest 9.75 per cent.

The first defendant did not pay the stamp duty on the transfer and, accordingly, it could not be registered. Nor could the mortgage be registered until the first defendant became the registered proprietor. Mr Genge lodged a caveat which became U633887 on 20 September 1994 against the title to protect both the first defendant's interest as transferee and the plaintiff's interest as mortgagee.

In October 1994 the second and third defendants became aware of the fact that they may have been defrauded. They lodged caveat U700263 to protect their interests. The plaintiff says that Mr Genge advised him to pay the stamp duty on the transfer. He did so on 8 December 1994. The plaintiff says he does not know why Mr Genge advised him to do this but he did so. The probabilities were that this was the only way in which security could be registered but that matter may need decision on a later date. The transfer was registered as
U937988 and the mortgage as U968411 on 25 January 1995. The Registrar General indicated on 9 March 1995 that he feared that he should not have registered those documents because of caveat U700263. That sparked the present suit which was commenced on 6 April 1995.

Mr Julian Millar appeared for the second and third defendants and Mr Cameron appeared for the plaintiff. Mr Millar conducted his clients' case admirably, asking certain questions of the clerk to Mr Genge who, under supervision, carried out the transactions, and of the plaintiff himself. This was necessary because the second and third defendants had no personal knowledge of what happened. However, after such inquiries Mr Millar, very properly, acknowledged that the material was not enough to show that there was fraud or notice that could be attributed to the plaintiff. It follows from the indefeasibility provisions of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/) that the plaintiff must succeed against the second and third defendants so that mortgage U968411 should remain on the title.

There is a cross claim made by the second and third defendants against the first defendant. It is quite clear that they were defrauded, that they have never been paid the purchase money, and, indeed, they were told lies to make them part with the Certificate of Title and transfer. They have claimed, both under the general law and under the Contracts Review Act, that the transfer should be set aside, and that should happen.

It seems to me, bearing in mind [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s19.html) of the [Contracts Review Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/), that the appropriate order is that the first defendant execute a transfer of the fee simple in the subject property within fourteen days. The transfer will be subject to mortgage U968411. Under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s20.html) of the [Contracts Review
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/), no stamp duty will be payable on that instrument. It is appropriate also to make an order under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cra1980201/s20.html) of the Act that the stamp duty paid in respect of transfer U937988 be refunded to the plaintiff. If the first defendant does not so sign the instrument, then the plaintiff may apply for an order under section 100 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/).

As to costs, the order is that the defendants, other than the submitting defendants, pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings and that the first defendant pay the second and third defendants' costs, including any costs which they may have to pay the plaintiff.

Exhibits may be returned.
