JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
HAMILTON J  
THURSDAY, 20 NOVEMBER 2008  /08 ELLA EDEN PULHAM versus BETTY DELANEY & ANOR 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: This is the ex parte hearing of a summons for declarations concerning entitlement to a property at Tuncurry ("the property"). The plaintiff is the daughter of the late John Palmer, who died on 1 July 1982.
She was, on 19 January 1983, granted probate of his will made on 23 January .
 The property is the land in Certificate of Title Volume 9258 Folio 189. That certificate of title shows Ruth Roberts and Ella Eden Pulham as tenants in common in equal shares of the property. Prior to 24 September 1964 John Palmer was the sole registered proprietor of the property. By a transfer signed on that day and registered J851966 he transferred a one half share as tenant in common to Ruth Roberts. The evidence shows that Ruth Roberts was his de facto wife. The plaintiff received her one half share by transmission in 1984 to her as executrix of John Palmer's remaining one half share.
 A de facto spouse did not, in 1964, have the benefit of a presumption of advancement: Napier versus Public Trustee (WA) [(1980) 55 ALJR 1.] The consideration for the transfer was expressed to be one pound. Not having given value for the estate transferred to her, prima facie Ruth Roberts held her one half share of the property, when transferred to her on a resulting trust in favour of John Palmer, the transferor. Furthermore, there is no evidence to rebut the presumption of resulting trust to the effect that John Palmer intended a gift of that share to Ruth Roberts. What evidence there is is to the contrary of an intention of gift since Ruth Roberts, in 1966, after the transfer had been effected, said, "Only the furniture is mine, the house belongs to your father". As this statement was a declaration against interest by a party to the relevant transaction, it is admissible in evidence:
Charles Marshall Proprietary Limited versus Grimsley <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 353] at 365.
 Ruth Roberts, in fact, died in 1967. The evidence, therefore, shows that at the time of his death John Palmer was the beneficial owner of the whole of the
Tuncurry property.
 In those circumstances the plaintiff is entitled to the declarations that she seeks, including a declaration that, in the events which have occurred, the plaintiff is entitled to have registered in her name the whole of the land in the relevant certificate of title.
 The service of the amended summons has been effected on Betty Delaney and
Eric Roberts, who were children of Ruth Roberts. They have not appeared at the hearing and there is evidence that they have disclaimed any interest in the property. In those circumstances I shall make declarations as sought by the plaintiff.
