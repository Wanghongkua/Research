Despite the use of the term "shall", there is no mandatory duty on the
Council to submit the draft LEP to the Department pursuant to [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html)

JUDGMENT 
MAHONEY P: The Council of the City of the Blue Mountains ("the Council") has, over a period, considered whether it should take steps to permit part of the Katoomba Golf Course to be used for residential development. The Golf Course is, within the [Local Government Act 1993](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/), community land. The Council entered into an agreement with Noroton Holdings Pty Limited ("Noroton") relating to the development of part of the land and associated matters. In order to enable the development referred to in the agreement to be carried into effect, it was necessary that the land be reclassified as operational land within the [Local Government Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) [s 27.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s27.html) This could be done by the making of a Local Environment Plan ("LEP") within Division 4 of [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/index.html#p3) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) ("EPA"). The Council commenced the procedure by which the LEP could be made and, in due course, the Minister made it. The respondent, Friends of Katoomba Falls Creek Valley Incorporated brought proceedings in the Land and Environment Court to have the LEP declared invalid. On 31 January 1995, Justice Pearlman, Chief Judge of the Court made such a declaration. Noroton has appealed to this Court against that decision.

The Minister and the Council have filed submitting appearances. The appeal is, it is agreed, an appeal by way of rehearing.
THE BACKGROUND: 
The background of the proceeding before her Honour and before this Court has been summarised by the learned judge in the following way: "At a special meeting on 29 August 1989, the council resolved to 'proceed to the preparation of a Local Environmental Plan to allow a major accommodation development and associated tourist facilities on part of the Katoomba Golf
Course ...'.

At that time, the Katoomba Golf Course ('the site') was zoned 6(a) Recreation
Existing under the Blue Mountains Local Environmental Plan No 4, and was leased by the council to the Katoomba Golf Club for the purpose of a public golf club.

On 10 September 1991, the council entered into an agreement with Noroton and other parties which relevantly: recited the council's wish to encourage the development of and to promote tourism in the Blue Mountains, its consequent support of the proposal to redevelop the site by the construction of a hotel and up to 160 medium density dwellings, and the fact that council's support of the residential development was conditional upon the construction of the hotel; provided for the sale by the council to Noroton on the terms set out in the agreement of that part of the site upon which the hotel and residential development were to be constructed; and contained Noroton's agreement, upon the terms set out to carry out the proposed development, which included, amongst other things, the upgrading of the golf course and the refurbishment of the clubhouse on the site.

An environmental study was prepared in accordance with specifications set down by the Department of Planning. This study was presented to the council for consideration on 24 August 1993. A report by the council's acting director of strategic planning on this date contained the following recommendation: '1. That Council accept the Environmental Study and, pursuant to Section 64 of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/), submit the Environmental Study and draft local environmental plan, incorporating recommendations from the Study and operational land classification to the
Department of Planning for the issuing by the Director of Planning of a certificate under Section 65 of the Act to enable the Environmental Study and
Draft Local Environmental Plan to be publicly exhibited in accordance with
Section 66 of the Act.' 
The council did not adopt that recommendation on that date, but instead resolved relevantly as follows: '1. That the Environmental Study be received.
That the Draft Local Environmental Plan be brought to Council.' 
An extraordinary meeting was held on 7 September 1993 at which the council resolved, in part, as follows: '1. That Council proceed with exhibition of the Draft LEP and Environmental
Study as recommended to the meeting of 24 August 1993.' 
A draft local environmental plan was submitted by the council to the
Department of Planning on 1 October 1993, with a request that the draft be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel for an opinion as to whether the plan could legally be made. The Parliamentary Counsel responded on 3 November 1993, raising, amongst other things, an issue as to the status of the site under the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) ('the LG
Act'). Under the LG Act, the site was classified as community land and was accordingly subject to certain restrictions which would prevent the proposed development from being carried out. It would be necessary for the site to be declared to be operational land under the LG Act, but the draft local environmental plan as submitted did not change the status of the site from community land to operational land.

Thereafter, a further draft local environment plan ('the final draft LEP') was prepared, which, amongst other things, contained a clause reclassifying the site from community land to operational land. On 7 February 1994, the final draft LEP was submitted to the Department of Planning, and a certificate authorising its public exhibition was issued on 7 March 1994 by the Department pursuant to <case> of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) 'the
EP&A Act').

During March1994, notice of the public exhibition of the final draft LEP was given in several newspapers, including the Blue Mountains Gazette. The final draft LEP went on public exhibition from 9 March 1994 to 6 April 1994.

Section 29 of the LG Act requires a council to arrange a public hearing under s 68 of the EP&A Act where a draft local environmental plan contains a proposal to reclassify community land as operational land. Accordingly, a public hearing was duly held. The report of the hearing was delivered to the council on 14 June 1994. It contained the following recommendations: '7.1 It is RECOMMENDED that the Council not proceed with the reclassification of Katoomba Golf Course from Community Land to Operational Land under the [Local Government Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/); and not proceed with the Local Environmental Plan to permit the development of a hotel and residential flats on part of the present golf course.
 .2 It is further RECOMMENDED that, should the Council decide to proceed with the proposed reclassification and rezoning it should:
Make a Development Control Plan concurrent with the new Local
Environmental Plan to ensure the preservation of a treed skyline along Narrow
Neck Road;
Place conditions on any development consent which bind the proponents (for the term of the lease in regard to the golf course and in perpetuity in regard to the development site) to measures which ensure that the swamps and creek water quality and volume are maintained and protected;
Ensure that the cost of any traffic management or improvement measures consequent upon the development are borne by the developer, not the Council nor the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW.' 
On 14 July 1994, the council held an extraordinary meeting to deal with the proposed development. I shall return later to consider this meeting in more detail, but for present purposes it is sufficient if I note three matters in relation to it: 
The council's manager, city planning, presented a report. After reviewing the environmental study and the report of the public hearing, the council officer drew some conclusions and ultimately stated as follows: 'Considering arguments both for and against the proposal it is considered the use of the Golf Course for development of a tourist facility its associated infrastructure, sewerage treatment and irrigation regime is not appropriate for this particular site. However, it may be appropriate if a smaller scale project contained wholly within the currently developed bounds of the Golf
Course could be developed which would have the benefit of assisting the Golf
Course out of its current difficult financial circumstances.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
That Council not proceed with the reclassification of Katoomba Golf Course from Community Land to Operational Land under the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) at the present time.
That Council decline to support the making of a draft Local Environmental
Plan to enable Council to allow a development for the purposes of Residential
Flat Buildings and associated tourist facilities on land being part of the
Katoomba Golf Course as exhibited.' 
The meeting heard submissions from the public, including Mr Tracey Lake, the managing director of Noroton, and Mr Andrew Beatty, a partner of Allen
Allen and Hemsley, the firm of solicitors acting for Noroton. Afterwards, the council moved into confidential session and received advice from its solicitor, Mr CT Drury, a partner of Phillips Fox.

Ultimately, the council passed the following resolution: 'That Council not resolve to proceed with the draft LEP, but acknowledging the inherent conflict in Council's roles as consent authority and as a party to the development agreement, Council resolve to refer the draft LEP to the
Department of Planning for determination by the Minister, but Council express its agreement with the conclusions set out in the Report by the Manager, City
Planning, presented to the Extraordinary Meeting of Council on 14 July 1994.' 
The final draft LEP was referred to the Department of Planning. The report made under <case> of the EP&A Act, dated 14 November 1994, referred briefly to the public submissions received, the public hearing, the environmental study and the council planner's conclusions. The report recommended that the
Minister make the LEP.

The Minister made the LEP on 23 November 1994. It was published in the
Government Gazette on 9 December 1994.

Noroton subsequently lodged a development application in respect of the development, which received the council's consent on 1 November 1995 and became development consent No 104/95." 
Some of the facts found or narrated by the judge have been in contest before this Court. Insofar as it is relevant to refer to that contest, I shall do so in the course of dealing with the submissions that have been made.

Mr Hemmings QC, for the appellant Noroton, has relied essentially upon three submissions. He has submitted that to understand the trial judge's judgment and the submissions he makes, it is necessary to understand the reasons why the Council did what it did. The Council is, of course, an elected body: councillors are elected from time to time. The members of the Council were, he suggested, divided upon whether the proposed development should proceed.
Noroton was pressing the Council to proceed with the development, pressing its contractual rights under the agreement with the Council, and threatening to sue if the Council did not do what, in that company's contention, it was contractually or otherwise obliged to do. On the other hand, there were in the
Council area those who objected to the development. The respondent company was, no doubt, the vehicle for pressing their objections.

By about mid-1994, the disputes had come to a crucial stage. The Council had, in contemplation of the development proceeding, commenced the steps provided for in Division 4 for the making by the Minister of the appropriate LEP. All of the steps had been taken, and validly taken, up to the point prescribed by s 68(4) of the EPA. The draft LEP had been prepared and exhibited and the person appointed to deal with the steps prescribed by EPA had made a report.
In the report, the officer, Mr Harris, had recommended to the Council that the
LEP should not be made. It was not, of course, the function of the Council to make the LEP: it is made by the Minister. Mr Hemmings' suggestion was that the
Council - I paraphrase his submission - saw the opportunity to transfer the burden of the decision, and such blame as should be attached to it by the contending parties, from itself to the Minister. It accordingly passed the resolution of 14 July 1994. The effect of that resolution was, Mr Hemmings' argument suggested, to pass to the Minister the decision whether to make the
LEP; to adopt as the Council's opinion the opinion expressed by Mr Harris, viz, that on town planning principles the LEP should not be made; and by resolving "not to resolve to proceed with the draft LEP" to avoid the disapproval of those who opposed the making of the LEP.

Notwithstanding that resolution, the Minister made the LEP. It was submitted that the LEP was invalid for reasons associated with that resolution and the making of it, including the reasons adopted by the learned judge and other reasons.
THE ISSUES ARGUED ON THE APPEAL: 
The submissions pressed by Mr Hemmings QC were essentially as follows: that where the procedure for the making of an LEP has reached the stage referred to in <case> the Council does not have power to do otherwise than to forward the draft LEP and the material referred to in the subsection to the
Secretary and accordingly that the validity or invalidity of the Council's resolution of 14 July 1994 cannot be relevant to the validity of an LEP made by the Minister; that the validity of the resolution of 14 July 1994 was not relevant to the validity of the LEP made by the Minister because it was not necessary for the Council, in forwarding the draft LEP and material to the Secretary of the
Department, to pass a resolution; and that that resolution was valid.

The making of an LEP of the present kind may be initiated in at least two ways: by a resolution of the Council to commence the procedure: <case>; and by a direction by the Minister to the Council to carry out that procedure: <case>. In the present case, the former procedure was followed. The <case> procedure is initiated by a resolution of the Council. Accordingly, special cases apart, the Council may revoke that resolution and accordingly put an end to the procedure which would otherwise lead to the making of the LEP. The resolution may be revoked in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s372.html) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) and, possibly, as the result of the power conferred by the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s48.html) It is not in contest but that, up to the [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) stage, a council may, by appropriate resolution, put an end to the procedure and so produce the result that no LEP is made. But, Mr Hemmings QC submitted, once the procedure has reached the stage where, under [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) nothing more is required to be done by the Council than to forward the material to the Secretary as there provided, the Council may no longer resolve not to proceed further. There is, the submission suggested, then an obligation upon the Council to forward the material to the Secretary: the matter is, as it was put, then out of the hands of the Council.

It was accepted that there is no judicial consideration of these provisions and that there is nothing in the legislation or the cases which bears upon the matter, in support of Mr Hemmings' submissions or against them.

The thrust of his argument was, I think, that, by the section <case> stage, the Council had no further duties to perform; that the only step to be taken by it was couched in mandatory ("shall") language; and that the general scheme of the legislation envisaged that, the procedure having reached that stage, it should proceed to completion by a ministerial decision. It was suggested, in argument, that by the [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) stage, submissions would have been received by the public and that, there being a public interest involved, it did not lay with the Council to determine whether the matter should or should not proceed.

In my opinion, this submission should not be accepted. I appreciate the force of the term "shall" in [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html)
That term is, of course, ordinarily used where it is intended that a mandatory duty be imposed: see [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s9.html) But the effect of it and similar terms depends upon the intention of the legislature as disclosed by the legislation in its context: see Hatton v
Beaumont [(1977) 2 NSWLR 211]; [(1978) ALJR 589.] The term "shall" and similar terms are used in relation to the earlier stages of the procedure and, as it is conceded, such terms do not exclude a discretion in the Council to resolve that the procedure not go beyond the relevant stage. I see no reason why the term in [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) should be given a different effect. I am conscious that, at that stage, the
Council has done all that the legislation requires of it other than to send the matter to the Secretary. But that, I think, is not a reason sufficient to construe the term as mandatory in the sense here suggested. I think that the term is used to impose an obligation upon a council to forward the material to the Secretary subject to there being, for some appropriate reason, the occasion not to do so. I do not see the language of the subsection as excluding the power which otherwise the council would have to determine that the procedure go no further.

One further observation may be made in relation to this submission. What is here in question is the validity of the LEP made by the Minister. The validity of what the Council did is relevant only if and insofar as it can affect the validity of what the Minister did. Mr Hemmings' argument is, I think, to the effect: the Council had no power to determine that the draft LEP and the material should not be forwarded to the Secretary: it was under a mandatory duty to forward it; accordingly, the resolution of 14 July 1994 and the validity of it have no bearing upon the validity of what the Minister did; and accordingly the LEP was validly made.

I do not accept that at the [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) stage the Council could not validly determine not to proceed further with the statutory procedure. Upon this basis, the substratum of this submission fails.

This submission is associated with submission (a). It is to the effect that if it be necessary for the Council to forward the draft LEP and the material to the Secretary, that is to be done not by a resolution of the
Council but by an act of the appropriate officer of the Council, eg, its manager. The action required is, it was submitted, a ministerial action not appropriate for a council resolution. The argument suggested, I think, that accordingly the resolution of the Council, valid or invalid, did not bear upon the validity of what ultimately the Minister did.

I do not think that this submission should be accepted. I am inclined to the view that, when the matter has reached the [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html) stage and everything which the Council is required to do by the procedure has been done, it will normally be assumed that the Council's intention is that the matter be passed to the Secretary and ultimately to the Minister.
Ordinarily, if nothing else appears, the assumed intention of the Council may be carried into effect by the manager. But in this regard each case will depend upon its own circumstances. Where, for example, Council has reserved to itself the ultimate decision whether the matter is to proceed to the Secretary or not, an operative decision of the Council, by resolution, will ordinarily be required. In the present case, it is clear that Council had reserved to itself the decision as to what should be done. The fact, if it be such, that
Council need not have dealt with the matter is, I think, irrelevant if Council has, as here, determined to exercise the discretion retained by it in relation to the further progress of the matter. If, in the exercise of that discretion, something has been done which affects the power of the Minister to make the
LEP, then the fact that the Council need not have intervened will not prevent that error being given appropriate effect.

In saying this, I do not determine that the invalidity of the present resolution goes to the validity of what the Minister did. But, in any event, I do not think that this submission succeeds.

This submission deals with what essentially was the basis of the decision of the learned trial judge. Her Honour concluded: that, in deciding whether to pass the resolution, the Council had been affected by (as she described them) non-planning considerations; that that invalidated the exercise of the
Council's discretion and accordingly the resolution that it passed; and that accordingly the Minister's decision was invalid.

Her Honour's reasoning in this regard gives rise to several questions. It was submitted that her Honour erred in fact in holding that the Council was affected by non-planning considerations; it was submitted that, in any event, the decision of the Council was not based upon such considerations; and that, however that be, the non-planning considerations which affected the decision in this case were considerations to which the Council could legitimately have regard. And it is arguable that, whatever be the validity of the Council's resolution, that invalidity cannot affect the validity of what the Minister did.

The learned trial judge found as a fact that, in exercising the discretion evidenced by the resolution of 14 July 1994, the Council was affected by non- planning considerations. Mr Hemmings QC submitted that that finding of fact was wrong and that this Court, as on a rehearing, should form a different conclusion. In my opinion her Honour's finding was correct. It was a finding warranted by the evidence. I shall not pursue the detail of the evidence as Mr
Hemmings QC dealt with it. I am satisfied that, in what was put to the
Council, on behalf of Noroton and by its own solicitor Mr Drury and those whose opinions he referred to the Council, the Council was made aware of the fact as to which reference has been here made.

Mr Hemmings' arguments suggested, I think, that because of the special form of the resolution passed, the Council should be inferred not to have taken those matters into account but, on the contrary, to have avoided consideration of them. He referred, inter alia, to the advice which had been given to the
Council by its senior counsel at the time.

I do not think that that is a correct construction of what occurred. Noroton had, by letter and otherwise, made clear to the Council that it desired - required - the Council to forward the material to the Secretary in accordance with [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s68.html)
It threatened long and persistent litigation if that was not done. And, it may be inferred, it foreshadowed a claim in damages. Council's solicitor Mr Drury did not accept the correctness of the opinions expressed for Noroton but he made clear to the Council - at least it was clear to it - what were the issues in this regard.

It is necessary to consider more closely what were the non-planning considerations to which the judge referred. These, I think, related essentially to the agreement which the Council had made with Noroton. Various views had been put forward to the Council as to the Council's obligations in relation to that agreement. As I have indicated, those representing Noroton pressed that the Council was obliged, legally and perhaps otherwise, to forward the draft LEP and the material to the Minister. They had pressed that legal proceedings would be taken to enforce this and the possibility of the
Council being liable in damages if it failed to do so must, I believe, have been one of the things to be inferred from what was said. The Council had received advice from which it might have concluded that it was under no such contractual obligation. It had had advice that its obligation was to deal with the matter then before it having regard to town planning principles. It had also been advised, Mr Hemmings QC contended, that one way of dealing with the matter was, in effect, to make no decision in relation to the matter but effectively to pass the decision to the Minister. His contention was that this was the result of the resolution of 14 July 1994.

The learned judge inferred that the councillors took into account "the prospect of litigation being mounted by Noroton or by third party objectives" and that it was "influenced by its contractual relationship and perceived contractual obligations and the possibility of litigation".

As I have said, the learned judge concluded that these considerations went beyond, as it was conveniently described, the town planning principles to which conventionally Council should have regard and that by reason of this the
Council's resolution was invalid as having been influenced by considerations beyond those to which properly it could have regard.

In my opinion the Council had regard both to the possibility of contractual litigation by Noroton and those associated with it and to the possibility of litigation by those who objected to an LEP being made.

Upon this basis I come to consider whether the Council's resolution was invalidated. In this case, the considerations relevant to the Council's decision are not specified in the legislation. In such circumstances, the considerations which are relevant and irrelevant must be determined by inference. The approach to be adopted in such a case has, in my opinion, long been settled. In the seminal decision of Water Conservation and Irrigation
Commission versus Browning [(1947) 74 NSWLR 492] at 505,
Dixon J indicated, in effect, that no consideration is to be inferred to be irrelevant to the exercise of the instant power unless from the nature of the power and its context it appears to be so. His Honour: at 505; said: "But, though the discretion is neither arbitrary nor completely unlimited, it is certainly undefined. I have before remarked on the impossibility, when an administrative discretion is undefined, of a court's doing more than saying that this or that consideration is extraneous to the power (Swan Hill
Corporation versus Bradbury <case>; [(1937) 56 CLR 746] at 757, 758). But there must be some warrant in the provisions, the nature or the subject matter of the statute before so much can be said of a particular consideration that has been acted upon. What warrant have we in point of law for saying that the considerations governing the
Commission's refusal of consent to the transfer to Carbone can be material to no purpose falling within the scope and object of the Commission's discretion?" 
The Browning case has been followed by the High Court of Australia: see Re
Coldham; Ex parte Brideson <case>; [(1989) 166 CLR 338] at 347; and by this Court: see Warringah Shire Council v
Pittwater Provisional Council [(1992) 26 NSWLR 491] at 520.

It is, in my opinion, important first to identify the precise power which is in question. In this case, what the Council did, in passing the resolution in question, was not to determine what were the town planning restrictions to be applied to a particular area of land or otherwise to apply town planning principles. Insofar as its resolution was valid, what the Council was doing was deciding whether the draft LEP which had been prepared should be forwarded to the Secretary for ultimate consideration by the Minister. This decision involved, inter alia, the Council's decision as to whether the procedure towards the making of the LEP should proceed or whether, at that point in the process, it should stop.

I shall assume without finally deciding that, notwithstanding the change in
Local Government functions brought about by the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/), it remains the law that, in determining what town planning restrictions are to apply to a particular land area, in determining whether town planning or building consent should be given in respect of a particular land area, and in similar decisions, a Council may have regard only to town planning principles in the sense in which that term has been understood in the authorities: see
Ampol Petroleum Ltd versus Warringah Shire Council (1956) 1 LGRA 277; Shell
Company of Australia Ltd versus Leichhardt Municipal Council [(1957) 2 LGRA ];
Allen Commercial Constructions Pty Ltd versus North Sydney Municipal Council <case>; [(1970) 123 CLR 490]; Kentucky
Fried Chicken Pty Ltd versus Gantidis & Anor <case>; [(1977-78) 140 CLR 675.] But the present decision was, in my opinion, not of that character. In deciding whether or not the procedure towards the making of an LEP by the Minister should proceed beyond the [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) stage, a council is in my opinion not restricted to such town planning principles.

Particularly is this so where the power falls to be exercised in a context such as the present. The proposal that an LEP be made did not arise purely from a town planning proposal. It arose, and arose only, in the context of a proposal for the development for residential purposes of part of land, the
Katoomba Golf Course, which was community land for the management of which the
Council was responsible: see generally [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s27.html)
The Council had entered into the agreement for the proposed development of part of that land not, or not merely, because that development was the best use which, having regard to town planning principles, could be made of the land. The Council, I infer, had had regard to other more general matters affecting its municipal area and to the revenues, improvements, and otherwise which might be expected to come from the successful completion of the agreement and the development.

In this context, the decision whether the matter should be referred to the
Secretary and so to the Minister was in reality a decision affecting whether the proposed development should proceed at all. If the Council validly decided not to refer the matter to the Secretary and the Minister, the result would be - if what it did was valid - that the development would not proceed.

In such a context, I do not think that the only relevant considerations were town planning considerations. It would, in my respectful opinion, be unrealistic so to confine the matters to which the Council could have regard in deciding whether the matter was to proceed. In that context, I am of opinion that it was proper for the Council to take into account its obligations under the agreement, the possibility that what it did would involve breach, and the possibility that it would be involved in costly litigation. Such matters were, in my opinion, inherent parts of the problem which it had to decide in deciding whether to pass the matter to the Secretary and to the Minister as [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) contemplated.

Mr Hemmings QC, in his oral submissions, at one stage conceded, I think, that the Council would act beyond its powers if it took into account the possibility of litigation by objectors to the making of the LEP. Mr Tobias QC, for the objectors, referred to that "concession" in his submissions. In a context such as this the Court is not bound by a concession of this kind. What is relevant or irrelevant to an act in the law by a public authority must be determined, not by concession but by a proper application of the law. But, that being accepted, I am conscious of the experience of those representing the parties in the area of the law here in question. However, insofar as the concession was made and persisted in, it was I believe made upon the assumption that what was involved was a decision to which, in the ordinary course, the restriction to town planning considerations would apply. But, for the reasons to which I have referred, the present decision was in my opinion not of this kind. Accordingly, I remain of the view that the scope of considerations to which the Council could have regard went beyond such town planning considerations. The Council was, I believe, entitled to have regard to the fact that the proposal to which it had agreed was one which, at the time of making the decision, appeared likely to involve the Council, one way or the other, in unwelcome litigation. That, in my opinion, was a factor to which the Council could have regard.

For these reasons I am of opinion that the Council had the power to make the decision that it made in passing the resolution of 14 July 1994. Accordingly, the validity of the LEP made by the Minister is not affected by that resolution.

I have dealt with the matter by reference to the three submissions which have been pressed before this Court. Before parting with this matter it is proper to add a further observation. One of the matters relevant in determining the extent of the Council's powers in a context such as the present is the nature and extent of the power which the Minister exercises in determining whether or not to make an LEP. That matter has not been argued and I therefore do not express any final view in relation to it. But in my opinion it should not be taken from the decision of the Court in this case that the Minister, in deciding whether or not to make an LEP consequent upon procedures such as those here in question is limited to the conventional town planning considerations. It is at least arguable that, in making that decision, the
Minister may have regard to matters beyond such principles. Thus, it is arguable that land may be rezoned by an LEP made by the Minister where the making of it is contrary to the use to which the land should be put on town planning principles but is one which, eg, will produce other benefits to the community of a non town planning nature. It is arguable that an LEP may be made by a Minister to give effect to, eg, a promise made in an election campaign and for that purpose only. Whatever be the boundaries of the
Minister's discretion in this regard, if those powers go beyond giving effect merely to town planning principles, that is, I think, a matter relevant in determining the ambit of the Council's discretion in making the decision which it did on 14 July 1994. However, that is not a matter upon which it is necessary to base the present decision.

In my opinion the appeal should be upheld. It should be accepted that the LEP is valid. The respondent's proceeding should be dismissed with costs.
 
PRIESTLEY JA: In this appeal Noroton Holdings Pty Limited (Noroton) challenges the correctness of a decision by Pearlman J invalidating a Local Environmental Plan (an LEP) purportedly made under the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) (the EPA Act). The LEP, if valid, would, amongst other things, permit redevelopment of part of the Katoomba Golf Course, owned by the Katoomba Council (the Council). 
The challenged LEP was prepared pursuant to Pt 3 Division 4 of the EPA Act.
Sections 54 to 70 within Division 4 set out the steps to be taken in the making of an LEP, from the decision of a Council to prepare one (s 54) to the actual making of the LEP by the Minister (s 70) which gives the plan legal effect.

The Council decided, pursuant to <case>, on 29 August 1989 "subject to confirming legal and planning advice," to prepare an LEP "to allow major accommodation development and associated tourist facilities on part of the
Katoomba Golf Course".

In 1991 the Council took a step which gave it a commercial as well as a town planning interest in the proposed development. It contracted to sell to
Noroton that part of the Golf Course on which the hotel and residential developments were proposed.

The procedure which Pt 3 Division 4 required the Council to follow in implementing its decision to prepare a draft LEP was: next, to prepare an environmental study (s 57); then to prepare a draft LEP having regard to the environmental study (s 61); in preparing the environmental study and draft LEP to consult with various specified persons (s 62), then, when the draft LEP was prepared to submit a copy to the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Planning; next, if the Director General of the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning (the Director) certified (s 65) that the draft plan might be publicly exhibited (in accordance with <case>), the Council was to exhibit the draft LEP publicly in accordance with <case>; then, to consider the submissions made with the respect to the provisions of the draft LEP following its public exhibition (s 68).

I break into the sequence of required procedures here to note that the final draft of the LEP in question in the present case was exhibited publicly from 9
March 1994 to 6 April 1994. By this time [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s29.html) of the [Local Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) had come into operation. This required a Council to arrange a public hearing under <case> of the EPA Act in respect of a proposal in a draft LEP to reclassify community land as operational land. The draft LEP contained such a proposal and accordingly when the public exhibition of the LEP was advertised it contained a note that under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s29.html) of the [Local Government
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) the
Council intended to conduct a public hearing in accordance with <case> of the
EPA Act.

Section 68 sets out the remaining steps a Council needs to take in implementing its decision to prepare an LEP. Also, the decision of the present appeal depends in large part on the requirements and interpretation of parts of this section. I reproduce it at this point: " Section 68(1) Where: a person making a submission so requests, and the Council considers that the issues raised in a submission are of such significance that they should be the subject of a hearing before the
Council decides whether and, if so, what alterations should be made, the Council shall, in the prescribed manner, arrange a public hearing in respect of the submission.

A report of the public hearing shall be furnished to the Council and the
Council shall make public the report.

The Council shall consider the submission and the report furnished pursuant to subsection (2) and may make any alterations it considers are necessary to the draft local environmental plan arising from its consideration of submissions or matters raised at any public hearing.

An alteration made by a Council pursuant to subsection (3) need not relate to a submission.

The Council may (but need not) give public notice of and publicly exhibit, wholly or in part, a draft local environmental plan that has been altered pursuant to subsection (3). The provisions of this section and sections 66 and 67, with any necessary adaptations, apply to any such exhibition of a draft plan, but not so as to require a further certificate under section 65.

The Council shall, subject to and except as may be provided by the regulations, submit to the Secretary - details of all submissions; the report of any public hearing; the draft local environmental plan and the reasons for any alterations made to the plan pursuant to subsection (3); and a statement - to the effect that the provisions of sections 66 and 67 and this section relating to public involvement in the preparation of the draft plan have been complied with; specifying the environmental planning instruments and directions under section 117 that have been taken into consideration; giving details of any inconsistency between the draft plan and any instrument or direction referred to in subparagraph (ii) and the reasons justifying the inconsistency; and giving details of the reasons justifying the exclusion of provisions of the draft plan under subsection (5) or the exclusion from the application of the draft plan of any land under that subsection.
 
In submitting the draft local environmental plan, the Council may exclude certain provisions thereof or exclude from the application thereof part of the land to which the draft plan applied (in this section referred to as `the deferred matter') which, in its opinion, require or requires further consideration but which should not prejudice the consideration by the Director and the Minister of the draft plan as submitted.

The Council may subsequently take action under this section in respect of the deferred matter, without having to publicly re-exhibit that deferred matter, as if it were a draft local environmental plan.

More than one public hearing may be held in respect of any submissions, and one hearing may be held in respect of more than one submission.
 ...." 
The public hearing under <case> was held on 16 and 17 May 1994. The hearing was chaired by Stephen Harris, a senior lecturer in Town Planning at the
University of New South Wales. He wrote the report and recommendations, which were dated 14 June 1994. The principal recommendation was that the Council not proceed with the reclassification of the land from Community Land to
Operational Land and not proceed with the LEP. A further recommendation was that if the Council should decide to proceed with the proposed reclassification and rezoning it should do so on particular bases which were specified.

The Council made the report public in accordance with <case>. In a letter to the Council dated 6 July 1994 Noroton expressed the view that the opinions of
Mr Harris, set out in the report upon which the principal recommendation was based, were not only wrongly formed but were indefensible. The letter also said that it was the opinion of Noroton's legal advisers that "the Council has a clear statutory and contractual obligation to submit the Draft LEP to the Department of Planning". The letter later said that Noroton expected
Council would "meet its future obligations" and then went on to say that if the Council were to "attempt to not proceed with the draft LEP", Noroton would, "exhaust all reasonable avenues ... to seek remedies in the Equity and/or Land and Environment Courts, and/or Courts of Appeal, at whatever cost and for whatever length of time this may take".

At this stage the Council was well aware that it was in a position of some difficulty. It had contractual obligations to Noroton. (Just what these were, in the circumstances, was a matter of debate.) It had committed itself over a period of years to supporting the town planning proposals involved in
Noroton's project. It was the consent authority which would have to consider the development application Noroton would make if the Minister made the proposed LEP. It was aware that a significant body of objectors opposed
Noroton's proposed development. The report of the <case> public hearing firmly supported the objectors. It had reason to be concerned that if it resolved to proceed with the draft LEP there might be litigation against it brought by objectors under <case> of the Act and that if it resolved not to proceed with it then Noroton would bring proceedings against it.

The Council had received professional advice as to possible ways of resolving its dilemma, and again it is plain that it was in the hope of doing so that, on the night of 14 July 1994, it adopted the following resolution: "That Council not resolve to proceed with the draft LEP, but acknowledging the inherent conflict in Council's roles as consent authority and as a party to the development agreement, Council resolve to refer the draft LEP to the
Department of Planning for determination by the Minister, but Council express its agreement with the conclusions set out in the Report by the Manager, City
Planning, presented to the Extraordinary Meeting of Council on 14th July, ." 
The Report by the Manager, City Planning, referred to in the resolution ended as follows: "Conclusions
There are significant areas of native vegetation on the site, in particular hanging swamp and remnant eucalypt forest in the north east corner, together with the strip of vegetation along Narrow Neck Road and its intersection with Glencoe Street.
There is an undeniable community and public benefit for more development in its multiplier effect on job creation, direct cash input to Council and direct cash input to the Golf Course.
If the current guidelines as outlined in the environmental Study are used to restrict development then the significant amount of the vegetation along
Narrow Neck Road will be removed, the Golf Course redesigned and appropriate management methods installed for the control of stormwater and other runoffs from the course.
It is not considered appropriate to use on-site sewerage treatment plants in these circumstances and development should be restricted until reticulated sewerage is available.
The current Local Environmental Plan envisages a core zoning to allow for development to take place for residential flat buildings and tourist facilities and an outer buffer zone to allow greater flexibility in this location at the Development Control stage. It is considered that the remnant vegetation on site should not be used for the establishment of tourist facilities and should be preserved in its entirety. In this regard the LEP will need to be modified to distribute the development areas onto the land used now for the Golf Course.

Considering arguments both for and against the proposal it is considered the use of the Golf Course for development of a tourist facility its associated infrastructure, sewerage treatment and irrigation regime is not appropriate for this particular site. However, it may be appropriate if a smaller scale project contained wholly within the currently developed bounds of the golf
Course could be developed which would have the benefit of assisting the Golf
Course out of its current difficult financial circumstances.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. That Council not proceed with the reclassification of
Katoomba Golf Course from Community Land to Operational Land under the [Local
Government Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/) at the present time.
That Council decline to support the making of a draft Local
Environmental Plan to enable Council to allow a development for the purposes of Residential Flat Buildings and associated tourist facilities on land being part of the Katoomba Golf Course as exhibited." 
Whether the Council resolution, in referring to "the conclusions set out in the Report", was referring only to the matter under the subheading "Conclusions" to the exclusion of the matter under the subheading "Recommendations", may be debatable. The trial judge seems to have assumed that the whole of the end of the Report from the subheading "Conclusions" to the end was being referred to, and this seems to me to be the more obvious meaning.

I note here that at the stage when the Council adopted the resolution of 14
July 1994 it had reached the point in the procedures stretching from [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s54.html) to s 70 of [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/index.html#p3)
Division 4, where, following receipt of the report of the public hearing under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html), it had to consider that report [(s (3))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) and was then empowered to make any alterations it considered necessary whether arising from submissions, matters raised at any public hearing, or otherwise [(s (3A)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) [Section (3B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) makes it clear that the Council, at that point, had power to prepare an altered draft LEP. If it exercised that power then the procedures of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s66.html) and [67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s67.html) would again have to be followed. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) envisaged that after the Council complied with [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html), and the further steps, if any, arising from that consideration had been taken, that the Council would reach the stage set out in [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) 
I also note here that when the Council in its resolution of 14 July 1994 resolved to "refer the draft LEP to the Department of Planning for determination by the Minister" the word refer was deliberately chosen to make it clear that the Council was not complying with the words of [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) that it should submit the relevant documentation to the Secretary of the
Department. The Council was seeking to leave the decision whether the draft
LEP should be made entirely to the Minister; it wished to show to Noroton and the opponents of the proposal alike that so far as the Department and Minister were concerned it was recognising its conflict of interest, expressing its view as a town planning body that the proposal should not go forward, but expressly refraining from making a decision whether or not an LEP should be made in the form of the draft. To have submitted the relevant documentation to the Secretary in accordance with [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s68.html) could have been argued to be inconsistent with the stance it was trying to show.

In accordance with the Council's resolution the draft LEP and accompanying documentation were referred to the Department. The Director then reported to the Minister, purportedly pursuant to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lga1993182/s69.html)
The report, dated 14 November 1994 recommended that the Minister make the LEP under <case>(a) and (8) of the EPA Act. The Minister approved the recommendation and in accordance with it purported to make the LEP on 23
November 1994.

A development application lodged by Noroton in respect of its project was consented to by the Council on 1 November 1995.

Pearlman J's decision that the LEP and consequently the development consent were invalid was reached by the following steps: (1) the draft LEP was submitted to the Department pursuant to subs 68(4) by the Council's resolution, (2) this was an essential step in the procedure towards the
Minister's eventually making a valid LEP, (3) the resolution was influenced by the Council's wish to avoid litigation, (4) this was an impermissible consideration invalidating the resolution, and (5) the Minister could therefore not make the LEP, and (6) there was then no basis for granting the
Development Application.

In the appeal counsel for Noroton said that the questions to be argued were:
Did the Council pursuant to <case> have a statutory duty to submit the draft
LEP? 2. Was the Council required to resolve to send the plan to the Minister pursuant to <case>? 3. If the Council had a duty to pass a resolution on the matter, and if it took into account an irrelevant matter, was that matter of such significance that the decision was vitiated? It was submitted for Noroton that the questions should be answered 1. Yes; 2. No; 3. No.

As will later appear, I think there was a fourth question which arose in the course of argument which requires separate treatment, but at this stage I will confine myself to the three questions specified by the appellant.

I will deal with the third question first.

I have already said that the materials before the court make it plain that the
Council was concerned with the possibility of litigation against it no matter what decision it reached in considering whether to resolve to proceed with the draft LEP. The resolution which the Council adopted on 14 July 1994 itself shows that the Council recognised the situation of conflict in which it was placed in its differing roles as consent authority and as a party to the contract with Noroton. The resolution also shows that it was the Council's view that, as a consent authority, it did not want to proceed with the draft
LEP. The Council avoided making that decision because of its concern about threatened litigation.

It seems to me that as a consent authority the Council was obliged to act upon the view it had formed that the proposed development was undesirable from a town planning point of view. It does not seem to me to have been relevant for the Council in reaching its decision on a town planning matter to take into account possible repercussions to it in its commercial aspect. In my view the
Council did take such possible repercussions into account. That was one of the reasons why the Council attempted to sit on the fence, instead of deciding whether or not it would submit, in accordance with <case>, the documentation listed in that subsection.

I therefore agree with the trial judge's opinion that in arriving at the resolution which it adopted the Council took into account an impermissible consideration which invalidated the resolution.

I return now to the first question raised by Noroton, which was whether the
Council had a statutory duty to submit the draft LEP to the Department pursuant to <case>.

In my opinion <case> did not have the effect contended for.

Mahoney P has given reasons for reaching this conclusion, with which I respectfully agree and will not repeat. Also, some considerations I mention when I later deal with the fourth question seem to me to point strongly to the same conclusion.

An additional and related matter is that, even if the Council had a legal duty to submit the documentation referred to in <case>, it did not do so, nor do I think there were any means by which the Council could be compelled to do so.
The Council might be directed by the Minister to do so, pursuant to ss 55 and/or 117, but if it did not comply with the direction I do not know of any means by which the Minister could enforce compliance in any direct way. It would perhaps be open to the Minister, after giving due notice, to adopt the procedure that was used in the Balmain case[1] of appointing a manager to do what the Council was refusing or failing to do. The procedure did not work in the Balmain case because too little time was given to the Council to comply with the Minister's direction. It was not suggested in that case that the method would not have been successful had reasonable time been given before the removal action by the Minister.

Thus, assuming, against my own opinion, that what can properly be described as a legal duty lay upon the Council to submit the relevant documentation, non compliance with the duty could not, in my opinion, be equated with its having been carried out. If submission was an essential step in the process, which I will come to when dealing with the fourth question, then its not having taken place could not, in my opinion, be overcome by holding that the Council had a duty to make the submission.

The second question raised by Noroton involved the assertion that in any event the Council did not need to resolve to submit the <case> documents to the
Department; once everything preceding the <case> step had been done, that step was automatic and ministerial, and required no further action by the
Council, beyond letting its officers forward the necessary documents to the
Department.

Amongst other reasons, I think this argument fails for the same basic reasons as the first argument.

Although in one sense these conclusions dispose of the three questions
Noroton's counsel said were being raised, I have earlier indicated that I think more needs to be said. In the course of the submissions on questions 1 and 2, what seems to me to have been a separate, fourth, question was argued.
This was that the validity of the resolution of 14 July 1994 was not relevant to the validity of the LEP; the fact was that the <case> materials reached the Director and then the Minister; and on the basis of them the Minister went ahead to make the LEP; he had power to do this; there was no reason for impeaching his decision; and nothing therefore invalidated the plan he made.

This raises the question whether the Minister can make an LEP where <case> has not been complied with. It also calls into question the step in Pearlman
J's reasoning that a submission of the documentation to the Department pursuant to <case> was an essential step in the procedure towards the
Minister's eventually making a valid LEP.

In my view this step in the trial judge's reasoning was a sound one. The whole sequence of sections from <case> to <case> seems to me to go upon the basis that either a Council itself decides to prepare and carry through a draft LEP to the stage where the Minister makes it as a plan initiated and persisted with by the Council (if the various hurdles along the way are cleared) or, if the
Council does not want to prepare and carry through to the making stage a draft
LEP (or having initially decided to do so later changes its mind) but the
Minister does want a draft LEP carried through then the process can be set on foot by his direction under <case>. No question of the latter method having been adopted by the Minister (which would be subject to the difficulty of enforcement already discussed) arises in the present case. The only presently relevant sections are those commencing with the Council's decision under <case> to prepare the draft LEP and the subsequent sections, earlier mentioned in passing, which follow directly on from that decision of the Council. These sections all appear to me to go upon the footing of a continuing decision by a
Council that its draft LEP shall go ahead to the stage where the Council has done everything that it can do towards having it made by the Minister, and it seems to me that at least until the stage has been reached where the Council has made a submission in accordance with <case> it must be open to the
Council to bring the process to an end if it decides to do so.

It seems to me to be a particular demonstration of this view that <case> in requiring the Director to furnish a report to the Minister prior to the
Minister's considering whether the Minister will make a plan, requires that that report is to be about the draft LEP "submitted under <case>" (s (a)). Similarly, the Minister's power to make an LEP is to make one in accordance with the draft LEP "as submitted by the Council under s (4)" (s 70(1)(a)(i)). 
Thus the power for the plan to be made by the Minister depends upon compliance at an earlier stage by the Council with <case>. In my opinion there was no such compliance in the present case, and accordingly the Minister had no power to make the LEP.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs..
