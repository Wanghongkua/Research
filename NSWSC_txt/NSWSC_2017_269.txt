JUDGMENT 
Background
On 30 June, 1-3 July and 8 September 2015, I heard relatively complex proceedings relating to the Estate of the late Douglas John Singh. The complexity of those proceedings resulted partly from the fact that there were several overlapping proceedings. Those proceedings included proceedings 2013/141437 ("Probate Proceedings") in which, inter alia, Mr David Singh filed a "Second Cross-Claim amended 10 September 2014 Statement of Cross-Claim" which brought multiple claims for relief, including a claim for provision under the [Succession Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) . I also heard proceedings brought by Mr David Singh (2013/338156) ("Further Proceedings") in which he brought, inter alia, a similar claim for provision under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), as well as two other proceedings brought by other claimants who also brought claims under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). As I noted, in my judgment delivered on 2 October 2015 ([2015] NSWSC 1457) at [11], Mr Smart, who appeared as Counsel for Mr David Singh in the proceedings, narrowed his claims in both the Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings and in the Further Proceedings to four matters, the fourth of which was a claim for provision for Mr David Singh under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/).
I addressed Mr David Singh's claim for provision under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/), both in his Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings and in his separate claim in the Further Proceedings, in my judgment at [139] - [162], I observed, at the conclusion of that part of the judgment, that: "I am satisfied that [Mr David Singh's] evidence fell well short of what would be needed to provide an understanding of his financial circumstances, and I am not persuaded that his financial position is as he claims. I am also not persuaded, for these and the other reasons set out above, that [Mr David
Singh] has financial need beyond his entitlement to a share of the residue under the will, and it seems to me that the deceased made adequate provision for [Mr David Singh's] maintenance, education and advancement in life in all the circumstances. [Mr David Singh's] claim for provision under Chapter 3 of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) therefore fails."
Mr David Singh also did not succeed in respect of the other submissions put by his Counsel, so as to support any other order in his favour in the Further Proceedings. When I delivered judgment, I made orders dismissing Mr David Singh's Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings, including his claim for provision under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/). On 2 November 2015, I made further orders in a form agreed between the parties to give effect to my judgment which provided for costs in respect of, inter alia, the Further Proceedings brought by Mr David Singh.
Mr David Singh appealed from my judgment, filing a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 30 October 2015 and a Notice of Appeal on 18 January 2016. On 22 August 2016, Simpson JA ordered that the appeal be dismissed by reason of issues as to compliance with directions made in respect of the conduct of the appeal. By a further judgment delivered on 13 February 2017 ([2017] NSWCA 15) three judges of the Court of Appeal (Beazley P, Macfarlan JA and Emmett AJA) set aside Simpson JA's order. In the course of their judgment, the Court of Appeal observed (at [2]) that I had concluded that the claim by Mr Singh for provision pursuant to Chapter 3 of the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) should be dismissed "although no formal order to give effect to that conclusion appears to have been made". That proposition appears to be correct in respect of Mr David Singh's separate claim in the Further Proceedings, although Mr David Singh's corresponding Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings had been dismissed by my orders made when I delivered judgment on 2 October 2015. The Court of Appeal observed that an application needed to be made to me to make a formal order to give effect to my decision on Mr Singh's family provision application.

The Defendants' application for a further order in the Further Proceedings
By email dated 28 February 2017, the solicitors for the Defendants in the Further Proceedings wrote to my Associate requesting that such an order be made, in terms that might have seemed uncontroversial given the Court of Appeal's observation that such an application should be made, as follows: "In relation to the above proceedings, and the subsequent decision of Black
J of 2 October 2015, no formal order was made in relation to Mr David Singh's claim for provision under Chapter 3 of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) (being proceedings 2013/338156) (the Further Proceedings). 
As you are aware, Mr David Singh has lodged a Notice of Appeal against this decision, which includes aspects of his claim for provision from the Estate.
This matter is currently before the Court of Appeal. 
I am instructed to make an application for this Order to be formally made. 
Could you please advise whether a formal application should be made in this regard."
By email sent at my request on 1 March 2017, my Associate invited Mr David Singh to make written submissions as to whether such an order should be made, as follows: "His Honour has noted the observation made by the Court of Appeal ([2017]
NSWCA 15) as to the need for an application to [him] for a formal order. His
Honour proposes to dispense with the need for a formal application and does not require further submissions from the defendants in [the Further
Proceedings] beyond Ms Chapman's email. 
His Honour will allow Mr David Singh an opportunity to make written submissions, not exceeding 10 pages in one and a half spacing, by 4pm 15 March , as to whether an order dismissing [the Further Proceedings] should now be made, consequential on the findings in paragraphs 139-162 of his Honour's judgment and the corresponding order already made in the Probate Proceedings.
Any such submissions should be sent to me by email and served on the
Defendants' solicitors." 
Mr Singh's submissions
Mr David Singh responded by email sent on 12 March 2017. Mr Singh submitted, first, that he objected to the relevance of the second paragraph of Ms Chapman's email dated 28 February 2017 which referred, as I noted above, to his appeal against my earlier decision, and stated that matter was currently before the Court of Appeal. Mr Singh submitted that: "The application of the defendants is for an order to be formally made in the plaintiff's claim for provision under Chapter 3 of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) (being proceedings 2013/338156). The second paragraph of the electronic mail of K
Chapman dated 28 February 2017 is of no relevance to the application of the defendants." 
It seems to me that Ms Chapman's observation as to the appeal was relevant, both because the Court of Appeal had observed that an application needed to be made in respect of a formal order in the Probate Proceedings, and because the existence of the appeal requires that the position in respect of such an order be regularised.
Mr Singh advised that he also objected to the first sentence of the first paragraph of my Associate's email allowing an opportunity for submissions, which (as I noted above) had stated that: "His Honour has noted the observation made by the Court of Appeal ([2017]
NSWCA 15) as to the need for an application to him for a formal order."
Mr Singh submits that: "This raises several issues with apprehended bias, the introduction of material and the involvement of a decision maker, amongst others. 
A decision maker is not at liberty to read judgments of other matters on their own accord, unless the reading of the judgments is in the course of a decision being made and the reading of the judgments is necessary to consider and assess their suitability as authorities for the decision being made. 
A decision maker is not at liberty to read judgments involving the same parties, published or otherwise and embark on their own mission to conduct research. 
A decision maker is to remain impartial and unbiased in the exercise of their duties."
It seems to me that a judge at first instance can read published decisions of the Court of Appeal, including in respect of appeals from decisions of that judge. In this case, as I noted above, the Court of Appeal's decision points to the need to make a formal order in respect of the disposition of the Probate Proceedings. I accept, of course, that judges must remain impartial and unbiased. I do not accept that knowledge of the Court of Appeal's observation that an application needed to be made to me to make such an order can give rise to any relevant lack of impartiality or actual or apprehended bias in respect of the question whether to make an order to give effect to the determination of the relevant matters in my judgment.
Next, Mr Singh indicates that: "[Mr Singh] objects to the lack of opportunity for the defendants to make written submissions as given to [Mr Singh] in the second paragraph of the electronic mail of the Associate to Justice Black dated 1 March 2017. 
This raises issues with procedural fairness and the offering of the same opportunity to each of the parties to make written submissions and the right to be heard. 
The defendants must be given the same opportunity to make written submissions as given to [Mr Singh]. 
The defendants, having made the application for an order to be formally made and following ordinary legal procedures and conventions, must be properly given the first opportunity to make written submissions as given to [Mr
Singh]."
The approach I adopted in respect of submissions reflects no more than the fact that the Defendants sought to have an order made, on the apparent basis that it would give effect to the findings in my judgment, and no further submissions were necessary to explain that application or its basis. There is no disadvantage to Mr Singh in the fact that he was given an opportunity to make detailed written submissions in opposition to such an order, if he wished to do so, that was not afforded to the Defendants.
Mr Singh also objects to the words "and the corresponding order already made in the Probate Proceedings" in the second paragraph of the email from my Associate dated 1 March 2017 and submits that: "[Mr Singh's] claim for provision under Chapter 3 of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) (being proceedings 2013/338156) is separate, distinct and independent of the probate proceedings.  [Mr Singh's] claim for provision under Chapter 3 of the [Succession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) (being proceedings 2013/338156) and the probate proceedings are not analogous or equivalent in character, form, or function and are not comparable in any way. 
Hence, the question as to whether an order dismissing proceedings /338156 is not consequential or dependent on the corresponding order already made in the probate proceedings."
I accept that Mr Singh's claim for provision under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) in the Further Proceedings was brought in separate proceedings from his claim for provision under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) in the Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings, although those proceedings were heard together, the same evidence was relied on in both claims, Counsel who appeared for Mr Singh advanced the same submissions in respect of both claims and I dealt with those submissions in both matters together in my judgment. It seems to me that those claims in the two proceedings are not independent, in that the determination of the claim in one of the proceedings on the merits necessarily determined the other. To put that proposition another way, Mr Singh could not conceivably fail in the Cross-Claim under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) in the Probate Proceedings and succeed in the claim under the [Succession Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa2006138/) in the Further Proceedings or vice versa, particularly where he relied on the same evidence and his Counsel advanced the same submissions in respect of both claims. It seems to me that the result in this claim in the Further Proceedings is consequential upon the result in the corresponding claim in the Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings, and vice versa, because both claims were put on the same basis.
Finally, Mr Singh apologised for a suggested delay in making submissions and explained the reason for that delay. No criticism of Mr Singh was made by the Defendants or the Court in respect of any suggested delay as to these submissions and no such apology was necessary. Mr Singh made his submissions within the period which had been allowed for those submissions.

Determination
I am satisfied that a further order should be made dismissing the Further Proceedings number 2013/338156, since that is the necessary consequence of the findings I had made in the judgment and the orders I had already made in respect of Mr David Singh's corresponding Cross-Claim in the Probate Proceedings, number 2013/141437, and of the fact that Mr Singh did not succeed in any of the claims ultimately pressed by his Counsel at the hearing. Accordingly, I order that proceedings 2013/338156 be dismissed. Orders have already been made, with the agreement of the parties, as to the costs of those proceedings.
