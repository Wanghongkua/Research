SEVIC versus ROARTY 
The respondent filed a medical report in the Common Law Division in accordance with a direction by the Court. The report referred to documents not annexed to the report in relation to which the respondent claimed legal professional privilege.

The appellant's application for production of those documents was granted by the Prothonotary. On review, this decision was set aside by the Master. The appellant appealed against the Master's decision to the Court constituted by a
Judge.

The Judge held that: the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) applied; the medical report was clearly privileged under s119 (b); the report had not been voluntarily disclosed; and disclosure was made under compulsion of law, therefore, privilege had not been lost and there was no basis for the operation of s126.

The grounds of appeal were that the Judge erred in holding the disclosure was under compulsion of law and that there was no waiver of legal professional privilege to the material upon which the report was based. The appellant submitted that despite the application of the Act the common law will still require the disclosure of related documents on the basis of "ordinary notions of fairness" as stated in Attorney General for the Northern Territory v
Maurice  <case>; [(1995) 185 CLR 83.] 
Held: 
Dismissing the appeal
The medical report retained its legal professional privilege.

Per Sheller JA 
This appeal concerns the effect of the Act on the operation of common law principles with respect to implied waiver of legal professional privilege.
The principles of the Act apply derivatively to ancillary processes involving the pre-trial gathering of evidence: Akins versus Abigroup (unreported)
NSW Court of Appeal, 1 June 1998.
Under the Act, disclosure of documents in accordance with directions of the Court is under "compulsion of law": Akins versus Abigroup.
The common law reacts to s119 of the Act by treating the report as privileged even though it was disclosed as a result of a Court direction.
At common law, the effect of the direction to disclose the report was not to compel disclosure, but was to advance the moment at which the respondent had to decide what they were going to use and what they were going to withhold. Therefore, at common law, in this case, it is not significant whether service of the report was voluntary or involuntary; Comfort Hotels
Limited versus Wembley Stadium Limited [[1988] 1 WLR 872] at 877-8 followed.
The respondent sought to obtain an unfair advantage by concealing, by reliance on privilege, at least some of the facts on which the medical report was formed. On this basis, at common law the principle in Maurice and Ng would require disclosure.
Waiver of privilege over the material referred to in the report can occur if the report has not been adduced in evidence. Therefore, it is necessary to determine how the Act affects the principle in Ng. General Accident
Corporation versus Tanter [[1984] 1 WLR 100] not followed. Maurice at 483 and 498, Re Konigsberg [[1989] 3 All ER ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1989%5d%203%20All%20ER%20289 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 295, and Clough versus Tameside & Glossop Health Authority [[1998] 2 All
ER 971] at 976 followed.
Where there is inconsistency between the Act and the common law, the Act prevails. Therefore, the Act displaces the common law principles of disclosure waiver of the Maurice variety and implied consent waiver. Accordingly, the provisions of the Act apply: Adelaide Steamship Co Limited versus Spalvins <case>; [(1998) 152 ALR 418], Akins v
Abigroup Limited.
Under the provisions of the Act, legal professional privilege had not been waived by the respondent. Accordingly, the decision of the Judge was right and the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Powell JA
It is not necessary to refer to the provisions of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to resolve this appeal.
At common law, questions of waiver of legal professional privilege do not arise until the privileged communication or a document referring to privileged communications has been disclosed during the hearing: General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp Limited versus Tanter [[1984] 1 WLR 100.]
At common law, production of a document in accordance with a Court direction does not amount to a waiver of legal professional privilege:
British Coal Corporation versus Dennis Rye Limited (No 2) [[1988] 1 WLR ],
Goldman versus Hesper [[1988] 1 WLR 1238],
Giannarelli versus Wraith (No 2) <case>; [(1991) 171 CLR 592], Woollahra Municipal Council versus Westpac Banking Corporation [(1992) 33 NSWLR 529], Goldberg versus Ng (1994) 33 NSWLR 639.
In this case, the report was filed pursuant to a Court direction, it had not been adduced in evidence and it has not been used in such a way to make it unfair for the appellant at this stage of the proceedings to be denied access to it.

Per Fitzgerald AJA
It is not necessary to refer to the provisions of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to resolve this appeal.
The respondent's filing of the report had little, if any, effect on the parties' conduct of their action. There is no material inconsistency in the respondent's filing of the report and his maintaining legal professional privilege. Fairness does not require that the privilege be removed.
The fact that the High Court may be prepared to depart from the common law as stated in cases prior to the enactment of the relevant statute does not necessarily make it appropriate for an intermediate appellate court to develop the common law by analogy to that statute in a way that departs from the common law.

SEVIC versus ROARTY 
JUDGMENT 
SHELLER JA: 
INTRODUCTION 
This appeal concerns the extent to which the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) (the
Act) governs or affects the common law principles applicable when considering whether legal professional privilege has impliedly been waived.

DIFFERENTIAL CASE MANAGEMENT OF COMMON LAW PROCEEDINGS 
In 1994 the appellant, Elizabeth Sevic, began proceedings in the Common Law
Division against the respondent, Dr John Roarty, an orthopaedic surgeon, to recover damages for professional negligence in the performance by the respondent of a hip operation on the appellant on 24 October 1989. The proceedings were subject to Differential Case Management (DCM) pursuant to
Practice Note 81 and allocated to the Special Case Management Track. On 19
October 1995 a direction was given, inter alia, that the respondent file all experts' reports by 31 January 1996. In accordance with that direction, the respondent filed a report in the form of a letter dated 22 September 1994 from
Dr Robert Tinning. This letter began with the sentence "I have received your letter of 9 September last and the documents concerning this claim in a well indexed folder." 
On 4 April 1996 the appellant applied by notice of motion for an order: "That the Defendant produce all instructing letters and materials furnished to
Dr Robert Tinning for the purposes of his report dated 22 September 1994 and served on the Plaintiff on 16 February 1996." 
CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE 
The notice of motion followed an exchange of letters between the parties' solicitors during the course of which the respondent claimed privilege in relation to the correspondence and material provided to Dr Tinning.

The matter came before Prothonotary Whalan who, on 29 April 1996, made the order sought. The respondent applied to the Master for a review. On 19 August Master Malpass said he was satisfied there was a basis for disturbing the
Prothonotary's decision and set aside his order. The Master approached the matter by reference to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p23) rule 10 (1) (c) of the Supreme Court Rules, as then in force, which provided :
 "10 (1) Where - it appears to the Court from evidence or from the nature or circumstances of the case or from any document filed or served in the proceedings that there are grounds for a belief that any document relating to any matter in question in the proceedings is in possession, custody or power of a party, the Court may, unless the document is privileged from production, order the party - to produce the document for inspection by any other party at a time and place specified in the order....." 
The Master said that it was common ground that the material which the appellant sought to have produced was properly the subject of a claim for privilege; compare Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Limited versus Interchase Corporation
Limited (In Liquidation) (unreported) Queensland Court of Appeal, 19
December 1997. The principal question in issue was whether or not there had been an implied waiver of that privilege. There was no express waiver. The
Master said: "The authorities demonstrate that, where there is no intentional waiver, the question of whether a waiver should be implied depends on whether it would be unfair or misleading to allow a party to refer to or use material and yet assert that that material, or material associated with it, is privileged from production (see Attorney General for the Northern Territory versus Maurice <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 475] at -483, 487-488 and 492-493)." 
The Master quoted passages from the judgment of Mason and Brennan JJ and the judgment of Deane J to the effect that the holder of legal professional privilege should not be able to abuse it by using it to create an inaccurate perception of the protected communication.
 "In order to ensure that the opposing litigant is not misled by an inaccurate perception of the disclosed communication, fairness will usually require that waiver as to one part of a protected communication should result in waiver as to the rest of the communication on that subject matter." 161 CLR at 488.

The Master said: "Dr Tinning expressly refers to [the documents] in his report. The contents of the report would suggest that the documents were used for the purposes of its preparation. As I understand the submissions made on behalf of the [respondent], it did not seem that there was dispute as to whether or not the documents fell within the category of associated material.

The real dispute between the parties concerns the inquiry to be made as to whether it would be unfair or misleading to allow the [appellant] to maintain privilege having regard to the use or reference made to the material. The
Court must form a view on the evidence that it has before it. Each case can be expected to turn on its own particular facts." 
The Master was not satisfied on the material before him that waiver of the privilege should be imputed or implied.

The appellant appealed to the Court constituted by a Judge, on the ground that the Master had erred in finding that there had been no implied waiver of privilege. On 19 December 1997 McInerney J dismissed the appeal.

Before his Honour, the appellant sought to argue that ss122 and 126 of the Act were applicable to the resolution of the issue of privilege. McInerney J allowed the argument to proceed on this basis and dealt with the appeal as one governed by the provisions of the Act.
 [EVIDENCE ACT 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) [Part .10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.10) of the Act is headed "Privileges" and Division 1 "Client legal privilege".
[Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html), [118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html), [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html), [122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) and [126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) in that Division are relevant to this appeal. In [s117](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s117.html) "Confidential document" is defined to mean a document: "prepared in such circumstances that, when it was prepared the person who prepared it; or the person for whom it was prepared, was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the obligation arises under law." [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) (c) and [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) provide that evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) * "prepared by the client or a lawyer, for the dominant purpose of the lawyer, or one or more of the lawyers, providing legal advice to the client." [s118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) , or * "that was prepared, for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding (including the proceeding before the Court), or an anticipated or pending Australian or overseas proceedings, in which the client is or may be, or was or might have been a party." [s119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) 
McInerney J was of the view that the medical report prepared by Dr Tinning was clearly prepared as a confidential document for the dominant purpose of providing professional legal services to the respondent and the material was therefore privileged; [s119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) . This conclusion has not been challenged.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) is headed "Loss of client legal privilege: consent and related matters".
Subsections (2) and (4) are as follows: "(2) Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if a client or party has knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made: under compulsion of law .......

Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client or party to another person other than: a lawyer acting for the client or party, or if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding an office under, an Australian law - the Minister, or the Minister of the
Commonwealth, the State or Territory, administering the law, or the part of the law, under which the body is established or the office is held." 
McInerney J said there was no dispute that the substance of the advice had been disclosed and knowingly disclosed, it not being an accidental disclosure.
His Honour said: "The question is whether there has been a voluntary disclosure. The definition of `voluntary' in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary is `as arising or developing in the mind without external restraints; purely spontaneous; performed or done of one's own free will or choice; not constrained, prompted or suggested by another'." 
His Honour referred to the provisions of what had then become the relevant practice note in respect to the DCM process (Practice Note 88) and s76A of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). It had been pointed out that the document was served pursuant to a direction by the Court.
On that basis, his Honour said that the document had not been voluntarily disclosed. Furthermore, he held that the disclosure was made under compulsion of law. Accordingly, there was no loss of privilege in the circumstances of the service of the report.

Section 126 of the Act provides that: "If, because of the application of ss121, 122, 123, 124 or 125 this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a communication or the contents of a document, those sections do not prevent the adducing of evidence of another communication or document if it is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the communication or document." 
This section may be directed to the type of waiver by implication discussed in
Maurice. McInerney J said: "I am of the opinion that s122 of the Act does prevent the adducing of evidence of a communication or the contents of a document and, thus, there is no basis for an order pursuant to s126 of the Act." 
His Honour said he regarded the judgment of the Master on the question of common law privilege as unappealable. His Honour said: "I must confess that the material in the document should fully alert the appellant to the evidence that the doctor (if called) is likely to give. In any event, different considerations arise, if and when the doctor is called to give evidence." 
APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL 
On 2 March 1998 the appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The notice of appeal contained two grounds: "His Honour erred in finding that: when the Respondent, pursuant to a direction made under Differential Case
Management Practice Notice 81, served an expert report from Dr Tinning, he did not do so `voluntarily' within the meaning of that expression in section 122 [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), but rather was acting `under compulsion of the law' as per [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s22.html) (2) of that Act; and there was no waiver of legal professional privilege to the factual material on which the report was based." 
On 1 June 1998 this Court decided Akins versus Abigroup Limited. Mason P, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, gave the principal judgment. His
Honour observed: "The impact of the Acts [the New South Wales and Commonwealth Evidence Acts] upon pre-trial gathering of evidence has been a matter of controversy in the cases. It is common ground that each Act is in terms relevantly confined to the adducing of evidence, and that this expression does not in its ordinary and natural meaning extend to ancillary processes involving the pre-trial gathering of evidence." 
After referring to a number of decisions in which opposing views were expressed, the President adopted and followed the reasoning in Telstra
Corporation versus Australis Media Holdings & Ors (No 1) <case>; [(1998) 152 ALR 418] at 427 and held that the principles of the Act touching client legal privilege applied derivatively to ancillary processes involving the pre-trial gathering of evidence. This entailed a modification of the common law to accord with the Act in this area. His Honour observed that the
Adelaide Steamship case represented a recent, considered decision of the
Full Federal Court in relation to the reach of the indistinguishable provisions of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (C'th).

In Re Z [(1996) 134 FLR 40] at 66-9, a majority of the Full Court of the Family Court took the same approach. Mason P said that in those circumstances the duty of this Court was to follow the Full
Federal Court unless convinced that its interpretation was plainly wrong. A caveat was mentioned to which I will return.

In light of this decision, Mr McKeand, who appeared for the appellant, did no more than reserve to himself the argument that Akins was wrongly decided.
Moreover, counsel accepted that the conclusion in Akins, that disclosure in accordance with directions of the Court by delivery of copies of statements of evidence by proposed witnesses which attracted legal professional privilege was under "compulsion of law" within [s122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) (c) of the Act, required that the filing of Dr Tinning's report be so treated and accordingly that the first ground of appeal must fail.

McInerney J's decision proceeded on the unstated assumption, both in argument and in his Honour's reasons, that that part of the Act which dealt with client legal privilege applied to the ancillary process with which his Honour was concerned. For present purposes, we are bound to proceed on the same basis.
Moreover, it is not suggested that Dr Tinning's report was not a confidential document prepared for the dominant purpose of the respondent being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian proceeding; [s119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) of the Act. Accordingly, the common law reacts to [s119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) by treating the document as privileged even though it has been disclosed, at least knowingly, as a result of Court direction. So much is conceded by the appellant. Furthermore, since the contents of Dr Tinning's report need not be disclosed, [s126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) does not operate to require the respondent to disclose the documents referred to in it even if this was "reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the" report. This all accords with McInerney J's decision and is conceded.

However, the appellant submits that the common law will still require disclosure of the related documents on the basis of the common law principle which embraces "ordinary notions of fairness" and was stated in Maurice and explained by the majority of the High Court in Goldberg versus Ng <case>; [(1995) 185 CLR 83] particularly at 98 and 100-101.

At 98 the majority said: "It follows that the critical question in the present case is whether Mr
Goldberg's disclosure of the privileged documents to the Law Society gave rise to a situation where ordinary notions of fairness required that he be precluded from asserting that those documents were protected from production for inspection by the Ngs in the related equity proceedings between the Ngs and the Goldbergs. In order to answer that question, it is necessary to identify the circumstances of the disclosure in somewhat more detail." 
Amongst other things, Mr Goldberg when handing the documents to the Law
Society said that he wanted to retain his legal professional privilege in regard to them. He was told that he would. The papers had not been prepared for the Law Society but so that Mr Goldberg could get legal advice. A later statement he produced was provided on the same basis. The provision of the documents to the Law Society was voluntary. The Law Society's powers of compulsion were not invoked. At 100-101 the majority said: "There remains for consideration the question whether Mahoney JA and Clarke JA fell into error in concluding that Mr Goldberg's provision of the privileged documents to the Law Society created a situation in which considerations of fairness required an imputed waiver of Mr Goldberg's legal professional privilege in relation to those documents. There are, of course, considerations weighing against that conclusion of their Honours. Among them are general considerations relating to the importance of the part played by legal professional privilege in the administration of justice and particular considerations arising from the sensitivity of the privileged documents and the fact that, on the findings of Young J, the documents were provided to the
Law Society on the basis that legal professional privilege in relation to them would be retained. However, in the context of the inference that Mr Goldberg's delivery of the documents to the Law Society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of assisting him to rebut Mr Ng's complaint, it appears to us that those considerations are outweighed by other considerations which favour their Honours' conclusion. We turn to identify those other considerations." 
In identifying these other considerations the majority said, at 101-2: "As has also been seen, the provision of the documents to the Law Society by
Mr Goldberg was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of assisting him in having the complaint against him resolved adversely to Mr Ng. Presumably, they played some part in procuring that result. In that regard, it is relevant to note that is has not been suggested that Mr Goldberg provided any other written statement to the Law Society in answer to the complaint against him.

Ordinarily, a party involved in a number of related proceedings or procedures will be able, in one proceeding or procedure, to take advantage of documents or other material which have been utilised by the other party in another of the related proceedings or procedures. That would, presumably, have been the case here if Mr Goldberg had not elected to make use of the privileged documents for the purpose of rebutting Mr Ng's complaint to the Law Society since the Law Society's letter of 14 May 1990 ....... indicates that the `usual procedure' would have been to require Mr Goldberg to make a `written response'. As Clarke JA pointed out in the Court of Appeal, such a written response would not, if prepared for the purpose of being placed before the Law
Society, have been protected by legal professional privilege from production to the Ngs in the equity proceedings. In these circumstances, it would be unfair if the fact that Mr Goldberg saw fit to rely, in answer to Mr Ng's complaint to the Law Society, upon privileged communications to his solicitor in relation to the equity proceedings should have the effect that the Ngs were deprived of access to, and possible use of, the substance of that answer. That unfairness is heightened in the present case where, in the absence of access to the material before the Law Society, one can only speculate about why the
Complaints Committee concluded that Mr Ng's complaint that Mr Goldberg had failed to account for $100,000 allegedly paid on account of professional costs did `not involve a question of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct' [emphasis added]." 
A relevant consideration was that the provision of the documents by Mr
Goldberg was voluntary. In the present case the service of Dr Tinning's report was required by the direction of the Court if it was "to be relied upon on the liability issue." The respondent chose to put itself in a position where it could rely upon Dr Tinning's report and no doubt the report was served for that purpose and the associated purpose of assisting the respondent in his defence to the appellant's claim. In Comfort Hotels Limited versus Wembley Stadium
Limited [[1988] 1 WLR 872] at 877-8 Hoffmann J, as his Lordship then was, said: "A privilege operates by way of exception to the normal rules of discovery and evidence under which a party or witness can be compelled to disclose documents or information. It confers on a party or witness a right to refuse to disclose documents or information which fall within the scope of the privilege.

Ord.38, r.2A has the effect of empowering the court to make it a condition of a party's ability to lead oral evidence at the trial that he should have given prior notice of such evidence in the form of a written statement served on the other parties. It does not mean that he can be compelled to disclose any document or information. Anything which he does not wish to disclose he may still keep to himself. It is only if he wants to disclose the information by way of evidence at the trial that he may now be required as a precondition to disclose it in written form in advance. What the rule therefore does is to advance the moment at which a party must examine the information he has gathered for the purposes of the trial and decide what he is going to use and what he is going to withhold." 
This passage was approved both at first instance and by Dillon LJ in the Court of Appeal in Derby & Co Limited versus Weldon (No 9) which is unreported but referred to by Hobhouse J in Prudential Assurance Co Limited versus Fountain
Page Limited [[1991] 1 WLR 756] at 768-9. At Hobhouse J said: "On the authority of the Comfort Hotels case and Derby & Co Limited v
Weldon (No 9) witness statements and experts' reports served pursuant to the provisions of Or.38 or directions given thereunder are not served under compulsion and are not protected by the duties or undertakings which the court applies where there is compulsion." 
This dictum is contrary to the conclusion in Akins about the meaning of "compulsion of law" in [s122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) of the Act. Even so, in my opinion, Hoffmann J's dictum aptly describes the respondent's position when filing Dr Tinning's report. In Naylor v
Preston Area Health Authority [[1987] 1 WLR 958] at 967
Donaldson MR described the modern rule as follows: "........ whilst a party is entitled to privacy in seeking out the `cards' for his hand, once he has put his hand together, the litigation is to be conducted with all the cards face up on the table." 
Accordingly, I do not think at common law, in the circumstances of this case, it is significant, when considering whether if waiver should be imputed, whether the service of the report be regarded as voluntary or involuntary.

In his dissenting judgment Toohey J at 109 drew the distinction between the concept of limited waiver of professional privilege and imputed waiver. His
Honour said: "The concept of limited waiver of professional privilege is well accepted.
Where some uncertainty has arisen is the point at which ideas of fairness or unfairness intrude. Where the issue is one of limited waiver considerations of fairness do not arise. Fairness is relevant in determining whether there has been imputed waiver; the concept of limited waiver is an exception to express general waiver." 
His Honour (111) regarded the issue in the case as not determined by questions of fairness or unfairness but according to whether any disclosure to the Law
Society by Mr Goldberg was for a limited and specific purpose only, to answer the complaint made against him, and hence whether any waiver was so limited.
The principle of limited waiver does not assist in respect of the associated documents, privilege for which the respondent said had not been waived.

Gummow J in his dissenting judgment at 120 quoted from Wigmore on Evidence,
McNaughton Rev 1961, Vol 8, para 2327 on what constitutes waiver by implication. Included was the following passage: "There is always also the objective consideration that when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. He cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder." 
His Honour said at 120-1: "..... the question of `fairness' involves an inquiry as to whether the facts supply sufficient reason for depriving the client of the form of protection which the law confers upon communications between solicitor and client. In approaching any particular case in this fashion, it also is to be borne in mind that legal professional privilege is not a mere rule of evidence but a substantive and fundamental common law doctrine, a rule of law, the best explanation of which is that it affords a practical guarantee of fundamental rights." 
His Honour concluded by saying at 122-3: "As I have indicated, the interview with Mr Goldberg was conducted in a particular legal setting provided by the existence of the compulsive powers enjoyed by the Society, pursuant to statute, in dealing with complaints by clients. Looked at objectively, the occasion in which the disclosure was made by Mr Goldberg was not one in which he was an entirely free actor. Even without the backing provided in the statutory sanction, it might be thought incumbent upon Mr Goldberg, as a practitioner whose conduct has been called into question, to deal with it fully and frankly before the responsible professional body.

In Woollahra Municipal Council versus Westpac Banking Corporation [(1994) 33
NSWLR 529] at 540 and Network Ten Ltd versus Capital Television Holdings
Ltd [(1995) 36 NSWLR 275] at 283-4, Giles J treated as very significant the circumstance that an alleged implied waiver of legal professional privilege involved making documents available to enable the recipients to carry out their statutory duties and that there existed statutory compulsory processes.
I agree.

In the present case, the disclosure to the Society was of this nature. Even allowing for the advantage Mr Goldberg sought to gain by making the disclosure, the circumstances of the case supply no sufficient reason for depriving him of the form of protection which the law has deemed it specially necessary to throw around communications between solicitor and client." 
In the present case, Dr Tinning's report did not comply with the requirement in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p36) r13A that it set out "the facts on which the opinion is formed." Rather, the course was taken of concealing, by reliance on privilege, at least some of the facts on which it was formed. Even assuming the trial to be one without a jury, this may mean that the report is not admissible pursuant to r13B.
However, to this extent, the respondent sought to obtain an unfair advantage which it should not have. That being so, and despite the views to the contrary of the Master and McInerney J, I am of the opinion that at common law this is a case in which the respondent would not have been permitted to disclose as much as he pleased and to withhold the remainder.

In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Limited versus Atlantic and Great Lakes Steamship
Corporation (No 2) [(1981) Com LR 138] at 139
Mustill J in a passage quoted with approval by Templeman LJ in the Court of
Appeal in Great Atlantic Insurance Co versus Home Insurance Co [[1981] 1 WLR ] at , said that: "...where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged, the opposite party in the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question. To allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood." 
In General Accident Corporation versus Tanter [[1984] 1 WLR 100] at 113
Hobhouse J treated the words "deploying in evidence" as being used in a strict sense. "In other words, he is looking to see what is in evidence and what is not in evidence; and in applying the principle he repeatedly refers to what was given in evidence." In Maurice at 483 Gibbs CJ said that the rule was not so inflexible as Hobhouse J suggested. ".....the question is whether the disclosure or use of material that has been made renders it unfair to uphold the privilege in the associated material, and although the question whether the material that has been disclosed has been used in evidence is relevant, it is not decisive." The authors of Phipson on Evidence, 14th ed, at 527 say that the proposition that there cannot be a waiver of privilege over connected documents unless the principal document was "deployed in evidence" is wrong and should not be followed; Re Konigsberg [[1989] 3 All ER 289] at 295.
The learned authors say "the rationale of the waiver of privilege over associated documents is that a party is not entitled to show his hand in part.
It has no necessary connection with the way in which the trial progresses." In
Maurice at 498 Dawson J referred to this criticism of the decision in
Tanter and remarked: "In the United States it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subject matter." 
With the greatest respect, I do not think the application of the rule about connected documents should be confined in the way suggested in Tanter. This accords with the opinion expressed by Bracewell J in Clough versus Tameside &
Glossop Health Authority [[1998] 2 All ER 971] at 976.

The consequence of this is that it becomes necessary to consider whether the principle in Ng survives the statutory modification of the common law to accord with the Act. This brings me back to the caveat stated in the
President's judgment in Akins versus Abigroup Limited. His Honour said: "A nice question would arise where the matter in issue whether a document prepared for the dominant but not sole purpose of providing legal advice was privileged from disclosure in some ancillary process involving the pre-trial gathering of evidence. Grant versus Downs <case>; [(1976) 135 CLR 674] still represents the common law in this State. I recognise that most of the cases which arrived at the view which I have adopted saw it as an inevitable consequence that Grant versus Downs no longer applies in jurisdictions where the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) principles apply: see, eg Adelaide Steamship at 428-9." 
In Adelaide Steamship Co Limited versus Spalvins the Full Federal Court, Olney,
Kiefel and Finn JJ, said in a joint judgment, at 428-9: "We acknowledge that a consequence of this view is that the `sole purpose' test of Grant versus Downs ought not to be applied as part of the common law in [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) jurisdictions. Given that the `dominant purpose' test is the legislatively prescribed one where evidence is to be adduced, we can see no reason for a different test in ancillary processes. We would add that the reasoning in
Grant versus Downs provides no justification for the maintenance of a difference in approach. Rather its premise is to the contrary." 
In Adelaide Steamship Co Limited versus Spalvins in the course of ancillary proceedings concerning subpoenas issued by the respondents for the production of documents by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), the primary Judge determined that the legal professional privilege of the ASC in certain advices or communications had been waived and that documents ought to be produced. The central issue on that appeal was whether questions relating to loss of legal professional privilege ought to be determined by applying principles derived from the common law as it had developed to date, or from the provisions of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) (C'th).
The approach taken by the primary Judge to the question of implied waiver of privilege was one which had regard to the "double elements" of implied intention and of fairness and consistency; Maurice at 481 per Gibbs CJ. His
Honour concluded that the privilege had been waived.

At 425-6 the Full Federal Court said: "...... subject to the particular exceptions listed, [ss122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) and (4) inquire whether there has been a knowing and voluntary, or a consensual, disclosure of the `substance of the evidence', that evidence containing the confidential communication or the contents of the confidential documents of which [ss118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html) and [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html) speak. The test is a quantitative one, which asks whether there has been sufficient disclosure to warrant loss of the privilege. If what is disclosed falls short of the test posed by the section, there is no waiver. Importantly, the subsections are not concerned with any principle of `fairness' such as that developed by the common law and by which waiver may be imputed. It should, additionally, be said that of the subsections' quantitative test that its application may result in privilege being lost in respect of a discrete part or aspect of a confidential communication or confidential document where the matter disclosed only relates to, or else relates sufficiently to, that part or aspect." 
At 428 the Full Court concluded that such was the significance of the Act's provisions that their advent had created: "an entirely new setting to which the common law must now adapt itself, and adapt itself in such a way as to `include the Act as a fundamental part of its fabric': see G Calabresi, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes, Harvard UP,
Cambridge, 1982, p86; R versus Swaffield <case>; [(1998) 151 ALR 98]; on the analogical use of statutes in developing common law principles, see French J, `Statutory Modelling of Torts', in Mullany, `Torts in the Nineties', and the references therein; Bennion, `Statutory
Interpretation', 2nd ed, p369-70." 
Where there is inconsistency between the Act and its purposes on the one hand and the established principles of the common law on the other, the Act prevails to resolve the inconsistency. At 429 the Full Court said: "The effect of our decision is that [Pt .10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.10)
Division 1 of the Act should, through the common law, be applied derivatively to ancillary proceedings. We do not need to express a concluded view on the questions (a) whether that Division in fact codifies the law on client legal privilege and (b) whether the common law in Act jurisdictions ought in consequence be regarded as limited in its content to the principles in
Division 1. We need, however, to emphasise that, in so far as previously established principles of the common law are now inconsistent with the Act and its purposes, they are to be taken as being modified correspondingly so as to avoid such inconsistency. Disclosure or waiver falls into this category. We emphasise this for this reason. Mr Bennett QC submitted that [s122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) of the Act should not be seen as precluding resort in all circumstances but the common law in cases of waiver, especially in circumstances where the protection of the common law is claimed to be more extensive than that of the
Act. Reliance was placed upon that presumption in statutory construction against interference with fundamental rights accepted by O'Connor J in Potter v Minahan <case>; <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 427] (and see Pearce and Geddes, `Statutory Interpretation in
Australia', 4th ed, paras 5.16-5.17). The cases on `issue waiver', it is said, fall outside the purview of [s122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html) but should nonetheless survive despite this." 
Their Honours did not consider that guidance could properly be had from the principle of construction referred to.
 "The Act, no less than the common law, seeks to maintain the privilege and for relatively similar public interest reasons. While the incidence and possible applications of its principles are not co-extensive with those of the common law - the Act has its own considered scheme of the privilege - the fortuitous circumstance that in a particular instance the common law's principles may give a greater scope to the privilege than the Act's does not provide reason of itself for the survival of the common law principles." (429) 
The two manifestations of waiver, described as disclosure waiver of the
Maurice variety and implied consent waiver, had been displaced directly and derivatively for ancillary processes by ss122 (2) and (4) and s122 (1) of the
Act. At 429 their Honours said: "We would add that s122 does not provide the sole basis upon which privilege may be lost. It may be the case, for example, that the principles contained in other sections of the Act, and we refer specifically to s126 and to the difficultly worded s121 (3), may in a given instance result in the loss of privilege in circumstances where the common law would have procured a like outcome." 
It followed (see 430) that the test properly to be applied was that posed by the Act and that unmodified common law principles should not have been applied.

CONCLUSION 
The application of the decisions in Akins versus Abigroup Limited and Adelaide
Steamship Co Limited versus Spalvins to this appeal means that the provisions of the Act determine whether the respondent, despite the filing of a report from
Dr Tinning which referred to other documents, was entitled to resist the appellant's call for the production of those documents on the basis that legal professional privilege in them had been waived. Under the provisions of the
Act, legal professional privilege had not been waived by the respondent.
Accordingly, the decision of McInerney J was right and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

ORDER 
Appeal dismissed with costs.

POWELL JA: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the Judgment which has been prepared by Sheller JA, in which Judgment his Honour sets out the facts which have ultimately led to this appeal. Although I agree with his Honour that the appeal should be dismissed, it seems to me, with respect, that it is not necessary to resort to the provisions of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) in order to achieve that result. On the contrary, it seems to me that the fate of the appeal would have been the same even if the provisions of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) had never come into operation. 
It being accepted that the documents of which production and inspection are sought would, in the normal course, be the subject of legal professional privilege, and no question of express waiver of that privilege being raised, the question thus is whether waiver of that privilege should be implied from the fact that, in accordance with the direction given on 19 October 1995 Dr.
Tinning's report was filed or, alternatively, whether in all the circumstances of the case, the law ought to impute to the Defendant waiver of privilege in the documents concerned.

Whatever may earlier have been the position (see, for example, Warner v.
Womens Hospital [1]) the position would seem now to be that waiver is not to be implied or imputed where the document the delivery of which is relied upon to found the implication, or to support the imputation, of waiver was delivered - whether to the other party to the litigation or to a third party - pursuant to an order of a court or otherwise under compulsion of law unless the documents be later tendered in evidence on the hearing of the proceedings in which the parties are involved, or otherwise used in such a way on the hearing of those proceedings as would make it unfair to the other party not to treat the privilege as having been waived.

Thus, in Burnell v. British Transport Commission [2] counsel for the
Defendant, cross-examining a witness, put to the witness certain observations made by the witness in a written statement. Denning LJ (as he then was) said [3]: "... although this statement may well have been privileged from production and discovery in the hands of (the defendant) at one stage, nevertheless, when it was used by cross-examining counsel in this way, he waived the privilege, certainly for that part which was used; and in a case of this kind, if the privilege is waived as to the part, it must, I think, be waived also as to the whole. It would be most unfair that cross-examining counsel should use part of the document which was to his advantage and not to allow anyone, not even the judge or the opposing counsel, a sight of the rest of the document, much of which might have been against him." 
In George Doland Limited v. Blackburn Robson Coates & Co. [4],
Geoffrey Lane J (as he then was) held that the deliberate waiver of privilege of certain communications between solicitor and client relating to two particular subject matters before litigation became pending or contemplated, involved waiver of any other communications relating to those two subject matters, but did not involve waiver of the further privilege which applied to documents which were brought into existence after litigation was pending or contemplated.

In Nea Karteria Maritime Co. Limited v. Atlantic & Great Lakes Steam
Ship Corporation (No. 2) [5], Mustill J (as he then was) said: "I believe that the principle underlying the rule of practice exemplified by
Burnell v. British Transport Commission is that, where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged, the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question. To allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood. In my view, the same principle can be seen at work in George Doland Limited v. Blackburn Robson Coates & Co. in a rather different context." 
In Great Atlantic Insurance Co. v. Home Insurance Co. [6] the plaintiffs, when preparing their case, had received from their American attorneys a memorandum relating to the action. The first two paragraphs of the memorandum consisted of an account of a discussion between the attorneys and a third party and, in the course of discovery before trial, the plaintiff's solicitors disclosed only those two paragraphs of the memorandum. The solicitors intended to claim privilege for the remainder but omitted to do so.
At the trial, the plaintiff's counsel read out in open court the first two paragraphs of the memorandum under the impression that it was complete as it stood. When counsel on both sides became aware some days later that the memorandum as read out was incomplete, the defendant's counsel asked for disclosure of the additional matter on the ground that, even if the whole document was privileged, the disclosure of part of it to the court amounted to a waiver of privilege. Lloyd J (as he then was) upheld the claim and the plaintiffs then appealed. When delivering judgment dismissing the appeal,
Templeman LJ (as he then was) (with whose Judgment Dunn LJ agreed) after referring what Mustill J had said in Nea Karteria Maritime Co. Limited v.
Atlantic & Great Lakes Steam Ship Corporation (No. 2) [7] said [8]: "I agree and would only add that it would not be satisfactory for the court to decide that part of a privileged document can be introduced without waiving privilege with regard to the other part in the absence of informed argument to the contrary and there can be no informed argument without the disclosure which would make argument unnecessary.

Counsel for the plaintiffs attempted to distinguish the decisions in
Burnell v. British Transport Commission and George Doland Limited v.
Blackburn Robson Coates & Co. on the grounds that it was necessary in those cases for the whole statement to be disclosed in order that the consistency of the testimony of a witness could be scrutinised. In my judgment, however, the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading, that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not, nor can the judge decide without hearing argument, nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side. Once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased." 
Thus far, the authorities to which I have referred have dealt with the position where there has been a disclosure, or use, of part only of a privileged communication during the course of a hearing; they have not dealt with the position where documents have been disclosed to third parties, or even to a party to the proceedings, pursuant to an order of the court or otherwise under compulsion of law, nor have they dealt with the position of those documents which may be described as documents "associated" with documents which have been produced.

In General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp Limited v. Tanter [9], Hobhouse J (as he then was) was concerned to deal with such a situation.
In that case, the plaintiffs brought an action against a number of underwriters and a broking company. The underwriters' cross-claimed against the brokers and before the trial the broker's solicitors served a notice on the underwriters' solicitors under the Civil Evidence Act 1968 (UK) preparatory to seeking leave from the court to admit in evidence at the trial a memorandum written by one of the broker's directors to the broker's solicitors recounting conversations between two of the broker's directors and also between another director and one of the underwriting defendants and/or that defendant's solicitor. At the time of the memorandum, it had not been anticipated that the underwriters would claim against the brokers. The memorandum had not been disclosed on discovery because it was privileged. At the trial, and before leave to put the memorandum in evidence had been sought, the underwriters called the particular underwriting defendant and the broker's counsel produced the memorandum and cross-examined him as to its contents, after counsel indicated that he would be calling the particular director who had countersigned the memorandum to give evidence when the broker's case was presented. Counsel's efforts to have the particular underwriting defendant acknowledge the correctness of the memorandum were unsuccessful and no reference was made to it on re-examination. Counsel for the underwriters then applied to the court for specific discovery of all documents relating to the topics of conversation mentioned in the memorandum, particularly the relevant proofs of the evidence of the broker's directors and all relevant pre-trial communications between the brokers and their solicitors and counsel on the basis that privilege in the memorandum had been waived by the brokers and had thereby been waived in respect of all those documents and conversations.
Counsel also claimed the right to cross-examine the broker's witnesses on all those documents and topics.

Hobhouse J held that the application was premature, since at the time it was made leave had not been sought to put the memorandum in evidence pursuant to the 1968 Act and the particular director had not then given evidence. At that stage the memorandum had merely been used as a vehicle for cross-examination and was not part of the evidence before the court. The giving of notice under the 1968 Act before the trial operated as a waiver of privilege in the whole of the memorandum, but such waiver did not extend to the documents relating to the matters referred to in the memorandum. It was only if and when the memorandum was adduced in evidence at the trial that the issue of potential further waiver could arise and then it would have to be determined according to the underlying principle of fairness in the conduct of the trial. In the course of ruling on that question, Hobhouse J, having referred to the Judgment of Mustill J in Nea Karteria Maritime Co. Limited v. Atlantic & Great
Lakes Steam Ship Corporation (No. 2) [10] and, in particular, to the passage to which I have earlier referred, said [11]: "Looking at the reasoning of Mustill J, it seems to me clear that he is approaching the matter using the words `deploying in evidence' in a strict sense. In other words, he is looking to see what is in evidence and what is not in evidence; and applying the principle he repeatedly refers to what was given in evidence. .........

This judgment does not, in my view, support (counsel for the underwriters') submission. It does not support the submission that you do not have to take into account whether or not the document has been put in evidence as opposed to whether or not it has merely come before the court, or that privilege has been waived without its being put in evidence." 
The question of the effect upon legal professional privilege of the delivery of a document by order of the court or otherwise under compulsion of law was dealt with by Hobhouse J in Pamplin v. Express Newspapers Limited [12], a case arising in relation to a taxation of costs. Proceedings in relation to the taxation of costs in England were at the time governed by RSC Ord 62 and the Practice Notes issued in relation thereto. At the relevant time the
Practice Notes which had been issued required that, when bills of costs were lodged for taxation, they should be supported by the relevant papers, failure to comply with which requirement might have resulted in the bill being refused or the allowance for taxation reduced. The papers which were required to be provided included cases to counsel to advise with his advices; opinions and instructions to counsel to settle documents and briefs to counsel; the solicitor's correspondence and attendance notes and the solicitor's files.
Clearly enough, those classes of documents would consist of documents which were either wholly privileged or substantially so.

In Pamplin v. Express Newspapers Limited [13], Hobhouse J, while taking the view, as had Stevenson J in Hobbs v. Hobbs & Cousens [14], that the lodging of documents in association with the lodging of a bill of costs for taxation did not amount to a waiver of legal professional privilege, differed from Stevenson J and held that, that notwithstanding, the requirement to accord to the other party to the taxation procedural fairness might, in an appropriate case, require the taxing master to disclose what would otherwise have been privileged documents to that other party in order that he might raise objections to the taxation.

Attorney-General for the Northern Territory v. Maurice [15] required a consideration by the High Court of the position where the document in question had been distributed to parties in accordance with a practice direction but the document had not become part of the evidence in the proceedings in relation to which it was distributed. 
The proceedings in Attorney-General for the Northern Territory v.
Maurice [16] were proceedings in relation to a land claim which had been made pursuant to the provisions of the [Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern
Territory) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alrta1976444/) (Cth).
The Act provided (inter alia) for the appointment of an Aboriginal Land
Commissioner and authorised the Commissioner (inter alia) to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of his functions. Under that authority, the first Aboriginal Land
Commissioner, Toohey J, promulgated practice directions to govern the procedure of land claims, those practice directions requiring that a "claim book" be lodged with the Commissioner's Associate and provided that, except in special circumstances, no date would be fixed for the hearing of an application until the "claim book" relating to the application had been lodged.

In the case in question, the "claim book" was prepared and lodged with the
Commissioner and distributed to lawyers representing the other parties to the claim. The general nature of such "claim books" was described by Toohey J in an article entitled "Aboriginal Land" [17] as follows: "Claimants are required to lodge particulars of their claim, the primary purpose of which is to identify the land claimed and those said to be the traditional Aboriginal owners. The practice developed of lodging a claim book some weeks before the hearing. Usually this book is prepared by one or more of the anthropologists whom the claimants propose to call in support of their claim. The claim book has become a substantial and sophisticated document which not only identifies the land and the traditional owners. It plots sites of significance on a map, formulates the principle of local traditional land holding and, with the use of genealogies, identifies the traditional owners, gives some of the history of the claim area since white contact, and generally canvasses the advantages to the claimants and the disadvantages to others if the claim is acceded to." 
At an earlier hearing of the claim, counsel for the claimants tendered the "claim book", but the tender was not formally accepted or rejected. Counsel also made some references to the "claim book" in his opening address and in the course of his examination of two witnesses.

For reasons which need not be entered upon, the original inquiry did not proceed and the inquiry was later commenced de novo. On the fresh hearing, the claimants did not rely on the 1982 "claim book". The respondents sought to have produced documents some of which had been prepared for the purposes of the land claim and formed source material for the 1982 claim book.

As I read them, the burden of the several Judgments in the High Court was, first, that the "claim book" was akin to a pleading in ordinary civil proceedings; second, that the "claim book" had not actually been used as evidence on the earlier hearing; and, third, that such use as had been made of the "claim book" on the earlier hearing had not placed the respondents at any disadvantage; it following that there had been no waiver of legal professional privilege and, in particular, no waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to the source materials used to prepare the "claim book".

The question of the effect upon legal professional privilege of disclosure pursuant to an order of a court or otherwise under compulsion of law was discussed by the Court of Appeal in England in British Coal Corporation v.
Dennis Rye Limited (No. 2) [18] and Goldman v. Hesper [19].

In British Coal Corporation v. Dennis Rye Limited (No. 2) [20] the plaintiff brought an action against the defendants claiming a substantial sum of money which it was alleged has been overpaid on invoices issued by the defendants. The plaintiff also claimed damages for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation and conspiracy to defraud. The plaintiff subsequently handed over to the Police certain documents which had been created for the purposes of the action in order to assist the Police in their investigation into the allegations of fraud. The Police subsequently brought criminal charges against the defendants. Before the criminal trial began, the prosecution supplied the documents to the defendants in accordance with the established guidelines for the disclosure of documents to the defence and, during the trial, the plaintiff was ordered to disclose to the defendants a further set of documents which had been created for the purposes of the civil action and which were relevant to the criminal proceedings. The defendants were acquitted. In the civil proceedings which followed, the plaintiff applied for the return of both sets of documents and an injunction restraining the defendants from using the documents or any information taken from them in the action brought by the plaintiff or in any other legal proceedings involving either or both of the parties on the ground, inter alia, that the documents were protected by legal professional privilege. The judge granted the relief sought.

On appeal it was held that, since the plaintiff had made the two sets of documents available in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of criminal proceedings against the defendants, it would be contrary to public policy if that disclosure could then be construed as an express or implied waiver of the privilege to which the plaintiff was entitled in the civil action for which the documents had been created, and that accordingly, the documents remained privileged and could not be used by the defendants in the civil action.

Goldman v. Hesper [21] was another appeal relating to the question arising on a taxation of costs. In the course of his Judgment, Taylor LJ (as he then was) with whom Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR and Woolf LJ (as he then was) agreed, said (inter alia) [22]: "It is therefore clear that there is now a statutory requirement on a claimant for costs to disclose privileged documents to the court. Normally, where privilege exists it applies to protect disclosure not only to the opposing party, but also to the court. So the rule clearly makes inroads into that general protection. It follows that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs some measure of their privilege is temporarily and pro hac vice relaxed. In most cases, as Hobhouse J observed in
Pamplin's case, no problem would arise on taxation about privilege.
However, when the problem does arise the taxing officer has the duty of being fair to both parties: on the one hand, to maintain the privilege so far as possible and not disclose the contents of a privileged document to the paying party unnecessarily; on the other hand, he has to see that the party is treated fairly and given a proper opportunity to raise a bone fide challenge.
The contents of documents will almost always be irrelevant to considerations of taxation, which are more concerned with time taken, the length of documents, frequency of correspondence and other aspects reflecting on costs.
In my judgment the approach adopted by Melford Stevenson J in Hobbs' case ... was too rigid and uncompromising. There may be instances in which taxing officers may need to disclose part, if not all, of the contents of a privileged documents in striking the appropriate balance. He will no doubt use all his expertise and tact in seeking to avoid the situation wherever he can.
I do not envisage it occurring, except very rarely. Of course it is always open to the claimant not to rely on privileged documents which he regards as peculiarly sensitive. .........

By the same token voluntary waiver or disclosure by a taxing officer on a taxation would not in my view prevent the owner of the document from reasserting his privilege in any subsequent context. Applying this pragmatic approach to the present case, it seems to me that the course adopted by the
Registrar here was fair and reasonable.

The decisions of Hobhouse J in Pamplin v. Express Newspapers Limited [23] and of the Court of Appeal in England in Goldman v. Hesper [24] were considered by McHugh J in Giannarelli v. Wraith (No. 2) [25] when considering questions arising in a taxation of costs in the court which had been referred by the registrar sitting as a taxing officer. When dealing with those questions, McHugh J held: that it was open to a taxing officer to direct production of correspondence passing between a party, its solicitors and insurers; but that a party could refuse to produce documents on the ground that they were subject to the benefit of legal professional privilege; that the taxing officer was not entitled to refuse to tax the bill until the production of all the documents but must decide on all the evidence before him without drawing inferences adverse to the respondents from their reliance on legal professional privilege; that if the respondents decided to disclose privileged documents to the taxing officer he was obliged to make copies available to the appellants.

In Woollahra Municipal Council v. Westpac Banking Corporation [26] Giles
J (as he then was) held that there had been no implied waiver of a claim for legal professional privilege over documents which had been produced to a local government inspector under the threat of the exercise by the inspector of his powers of requiring compulsory disclosure.

In Goldberg v. Ng [27] the majority (Mahoney JA as he then was, and
Clarke JA) held that there had been a waiver of legal professional privilege by Mr. Goldberg since: the disclosure of the material in question in its privileged form to the
Law Society was a voluntary and considered disclosure; and that, while the disclosure to the Law Society was in the context of the complaint which had been made by the Ng's, the genesis of the complaint was the same dispute as that which had led to the proceedings which had been commenced by the Ng's against Mr. Goldberg in the Equity Division of the
Court.

In the appeal to the High Court from the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in
Goldberg v. Ng [28] the majority (Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) were of the opinion that, in the circumstances, a waiver of privilege ought to be imputed by operation of law since: the plain inference from the evidence was that the production of the privileged documents to the Law Society was a voluntary one and not one made in response to a real or imagined threat by the Law Society to exercise its power of compulsion; that the proceedings in the Equity Division of the Court and the Law
Society's procedures consequent upon Mr. Ng's complaint were but different emanations of the one dispute; and that in the circumstances, it would be unfair if the Ng's were deprived of access to and the possible use of the materials which had been used to provide an answer to and were treated by the Law Society as in fact providing an answer to their complaint.

The dissents of the minority in the High Court (Toohey and Gummow JJ) were based upon their view that the disclosure by Mr. Goldberg was not in the circumstances to be regarded as voluntary. Thus, Toohey J said [29]: "In the present case Mr. Goldberg disclosed material to the Society. He did so because there was a complaint against him by one of the respondents. He disclosed the material, not merely on the understanding but on the undertaking by the Society that there contents would be kept confidential. Disclosure was in the context of the investigation of the complaint by the Society exercising its powers under the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) (`the Act'), as it then stood. Complaints of professional misconduct could be referred by the Society Council to the Legal Profession Disciplinary Tribunal which could order the legal practitioner's practising certificate be cancelled. Additionally, the Society Council was empowered to cancel or suspend the practising certificate of a solicitor who failed to give a satisfactory explanation for specified conduct. Disclosure by Mr. Goldberg was made for the purposes of the Act and was confined to the Society. These considerations militate strongly against any implied or imputed waiver." while Gummow J said [30]: "However, I agree also with the statement of Kirby P that, to say that Mr.
Goldberg `chose' to make the disclosure he did, does not tell the full story.
In my view it is here that the critical point is reached. 
As I have indicated, the interview with Mr. Goldberg was conducted in a particular legal setting provided by the existence of the compulsive powers enjoyed by the Society, pursuant to statute, in dealing with complaints by clients. Looked at objectively, the occasion in which the disclosure was made by Mr. Goldberg was not one in which he was an entirely free actor. Even without the backing provided by the statutory sanction, it might be thought incumbent upon Mr. Goldberg as a practitioner whose conduct has been called into question to deal with it fully and frankly before the responsible professional body. 
In Woollahra Municipal Council v. Westpac Banking Corp and Network Ten
Limited v. Capital Television Holdings Limited, Giles J treated as very significant the circumstance that an alleged implied waiver of legal professional privilege involved making documents available to enable the recipients to carry out their statutory duties and that there existed statutory compulsory processes. I agree." 
In the present case, Dr. Tinning's report was filed, and a copy served, in pursuance of a direction given by the Court. As is clear, that report has not yet been, and may never be, tendered in evidence, nor has it been used in any way which would, in my view, make it unfair for the Appellant, at this stage of the proceedings, to be denied access to the documents to which it refers.
What course should be taken if, and when, it is sought to tender Dr. Tinning's report in evidence, or to have Dr. Tinning give evidence to the effect of that contained in his report, is not a matter which this Court is called upon to determined and can only properly be determined in the circumstances existing at the time.

As I have earlier indicated, in my opinion the Appeal should be dismissed with costs.

FITZGERALD AJA: I have had the advantage of reading the draft reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court. There is no need for me to restate the circumstances giving rise to this appeal. 
Correctly or otherwise,[31] the appellant concedes that the documents referred to in Dr Tinning's report would be subject to legal professional privilege and immune from an order for production if they had not been referred to in that report. I understood the appellant to concede that, by reason of the decision of this Court in Akins versus Abigroup Ltd,[32] her appeal cannot succeed in this
Court if the common law with respect to legal professional privilege was "derivatively" altered by the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) . However, she disputes that the Act had such an effect on the common law principles which are applicable to the present issue. On her argument, she must therefore establish that the respondent impliedly waived his legal professional privilege in the documents and/or that the law imputes such a waiver.
According to her submissions, the test of implied or imputed waiver is whether it would be inconsistent or otherwise unfair for the respondent to maintain his legal professional privilege in the circumstances,[33] notwithstanding the enactment of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

It is convenient to begin by assuming that the appellant has correctly stated the test to be applied.

The respondent filed and served Dr Tinning's report because, although he was not compelled to do so, it was necessary to do so if he intended to rely on the report in connection with the "liability issue" between the parties. It does not follow that filing and serving the report entitles the respondent to rely on it for that purpose. The appellant legitimately criticised the course adopted by the respondent, which does not comply with the Rules and is incompatible with the purposes of Practice Direction 81. However, the appellant did not really try to persuade this Court that the respondent could tender the report at trial over the appellant's objection as a statement of Dr
Tinning's opinion, notwithstanding that the report does not set out the facts on which his opinion was formed.[34] 
In my opinion, Dr Tinning's report is plainly inadmissible.[35] Further, in my opinion it should not be admitted. The objection to its reception into evidence is not a mere technicality. It is impossible to assess the worth of an opinion related to the negligence or otherwise of a medical practitioner which is based on unknown assumptions.

Plainly, therefore, there is no prospect of unfairness to the appellant at trial. The respondent's case will have to be put to the appellant's witness in cross-examination,[36] Dr Tinning's report will not be able to be tendered by the respondent and he will not be able to give evidence without leave,[37] and, if Dr Tinning does give evidence, the appellant, would, if appropriate, be permitted to reopen her case. It is unnecessary to discuss further possibilities. It is beyond question that the Court has ample power to prevent unfairness at trial.[38] 
Once this position is reached, it is difficult to find any foundation for the order for production of the documents sought by the appellant. She submitted that access to the documents might facilitate settlement, or assist in the preparation for cross-examination of Dr Tinning if he is called as a witness by the respondent. However, litigation remains an essentially adversarial process, and there are, as yet, limits on the extent to which a defendant must assist a plaintiff to prepare and settle or present his or her case. Indeed, that that is so is implicit in the appellant's acceptance that she must establish unfairness or inconsistency before she is entitled to the production of the documents which are referred to in Dr Tinning's report.

While fairness is a concept with a subjective component on which reasonable minds can differ,[39] the appellant has failed to persuade me that, in the circumstances described, fairness requires that the respondent be deprived on the legal professional privilege which is otherwise acknowledged to exist in the documents referred to in Dr Tinning's report. More particularly, nothing unfair has occurred or is likely to occur pre-trial, and, as I have said above, the course adopted by the respondents will not lead to unfairness at the trial.

It remains to add that, in circumstances in which the respondent has achieved nothing in the litigation by filing and service of Dr Tinning's report without the documents to which it refers, I can perceive no material inconsistency in his insistence in maintaining his legal professional privilege in respect of those documents.

In the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court, reference is made to other issues and to a number of decisions, principally English decisions, which are not all easily reconcilable. It is unnecessary for me to consider those matters.

As I said earlier, I understand that the appellant conceded that she cannot satisfy the different test which would be applicable if the common law with respect to legal professional privilege, pre-trial, has been "derivatively" altered by the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). As noted by Sheller JA, there are decisions of the Full Federal Court[40] and the Full
Family Court[41] which support the decision of this Court in Akins, and there are obviously good reasons for Australian intermediate appellate courts to march in step whenever possible.[42] However, as the President pointed out in Akins, the development of the common law by an intermediate appellate court by analogy to legislation is not without obstacle when the common law has been stated by the High Court in different terms from the proposed principle prior to the enactment of the material statute. The circumstance that the High Court might be prepared to depart from earlier decisions for the common law to evolve in conjunction with legislative change[43] does not necessarily make it appropriate for an intermediate appellate court to decline to apply a common law principle which has been stated by the High Court.[44]
Further, since there is a single common law for Australia,[45] the argument for derivative evolution of the common law by reference to statute might be less cogent if the new principle would result in the application of different common law principles in different Australian jurisdictions. However, the conclusion which I have otherwise reached makes it unnecessary for me to consider the effect of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) on this occasion.

I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
