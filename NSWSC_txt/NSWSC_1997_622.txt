TELSTRA CORPORATION versus Allan John WORTHING & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
COLE JA: This appeal raises the question whether the Compensation Court of New South Wales has jurisdiction to entertain a claim for workers compensation brought by an employee of Telstra Corporation Limited ("Telstra"). Telstra claims that it does not and, after filing a notice of conditional appearance to a claim brought in the Compensation Court by the first respondent, Allan John Worthing, filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the application for determination be struck out for want of jurisdiction. In a judgment delivered 10 July 1997, Truss CCJ dismissed that notice of motion holding that the Compensation Court had jurisdiction. From that decision Telstra has appealed. On the appeal, each of the Attorneys General for the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales intervened subsequent to notices served upon them pursuant to s.78B [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) . 
THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
On 11 September 1996 Mr Worthing filed an application for determination of his claim for compensation, claiming weekly payments of compensation pursuant to [s.37](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s37.html) [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) from 29
September 1994, for lump sums pursuant to [ss.66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and 67 of that Act for permanent impairment of his back, for medical expenses pursuant to [s.60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s60.html) of the Act, and for interest. He alleged that he sustained injury to his back whilst in the employee of Telstra, or its forebears, on 20 May 1986, 28 April and 2 June 1993. The application resulted in the filing of the notice of motion seeking dismissal of those proceedings for want of jurisdiction, such notice of motion being filed on 19 September 1996.

THE JUDGMENT OF TRUSS CCJ 
Truss CCJ held that "as regards the first two injuries the immunity of the
Commonwealth with which the proposed respondent would otherwise be clothed is inoperative by virtue of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/)".[1] She also addressed the proposition advanced by Telstra, but did not express a view concerning it, that the subject of workers compensation for its employees, including those of Telstra, was a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, being a matter relating to a department of a public service transferred to the Commonwealth within the meaning of s. 52(ii) of the
Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Her Honour also held, when considering the question of inconsistency within s.
 of the Commonwealth [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) that the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (Cth) did not "evince an intention to cover the field and thereby create an exclusive code in relation to the relevant subject matter to the exclusion of
State legislation." This final conclusion was reached having regard, in particular, to [ss.118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s118.html) and [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s119.html) of the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) , to which I will return.

CONTENTIONS ON APPEAL 
Telstra, supported by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, submitted that in relation to the claim for injury on 20 May 1986, the Workers Compensation Act  did not apply to the claimant as a matter of construction, and also because it was inconsistent within the meaning of [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), with either or both of the [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) (Cth) and the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth).
Regarding the claim for injury on 28 April 1988, it submitted that the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  did not apply to the claimant for the same two reasons. In relation to the injury on 2 June 1993 it submitted that the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  was inconsistent, for the purposes [s.109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), with the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) .

The respondent worker, supported by the Attorney-General for New South Wales, contended that there was no inconsistency between the State and Federal Acts within the meaning of [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
In addition, the Solicitor-General for New South Wales submitted that, regarding the first injury, whilst it was accepted that the Workers
Compensation Act 1926  did not purport to bind the Commonwealth or the
Australian Telecommunications Commission, the effect of s. 64 [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) was to make applicable as "surrogate Commonwealth law" that Act, whilst accepting that nonetheless the Workers Compensation Act 1926  was not applicable to the Commonwealth or the Australian Telecommunications commission to the extent of any inconsistency within [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Regarding the worker's second injury, which it was accepted that the 1987 Act purported to bind the Commonwealth and the Australian Telecommunications
Commission, it was argued that those bodies were an "employer" within the meaning of the Act, and it was thus contended that the Commonwealth and the
Australian Telecommunications Commission were bound by the [Workers
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) , again subject to any inconsistency within the meaning of [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) between the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  and any Commonwealth statute. Regarding the third injury, as the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporations Act 1991 (Cth) provided by s.
 of that Act that the AOTC was not to be treated as or to have the immunities of the Commonwealth, the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  prima facie bound the Corporation but again this was subject to any constitutional inconsistency with a federal statute.

It is apparent from the position adopted by both parties and both interveners, that unless the appellant can succeed upon the question of constitutional inconsistency, the appeal must be dismissed. The appellant made clear that it no longer wished to press the [s.
(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s52.html) point argued below, nor did it wish to press the argument based upon Telstra or its forebears having the constitutional immunity of the Commonwealth as the
Crown. These two aspects were not pressed in light of the decision of the High
Court in Re Residential Tenancies Tribunal of New South Wales & Ors; Ex parte Defence Housing Authority[2]. The appellant relied solely on the inconsistency argument. It is unnecessary to address the contention of the
Solicitor-General of New South Wales that [s.
](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s64.html) [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) rendered applicable the Workers Compensation Act 1926  as the claim of the worker was brought under the 1987 Act.

THE HISTORY OF TELSTRA 
Prior to 1 September 1971 there existed a Department of Government of the
Commonwealth of Australia known as the Postmaster General's Department.
However by s.4 of [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) the Australian Telecommunications Commission was created.

The [Postal and Telecommunications Commissions (Transitional Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/patcpa1975730/) , which commenced on 12 June 1975, provided by [s.16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/patcpa1975730/s16.html) that staff of the Postmaster General's Department be allocated either to the
Australian Postal Commission or the Australian Telecommunications Commission.
[Part
IV](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/patcpa1975730/index.html#p4) of that Act transferred the assets and liabilities of the Postmaster General's
Department to either the Australian Postal Commission or the Australian
Telecommunications Commission.

The Australian Telecommunications Commission was established as a body corporate by s.21 [Telecommunications
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/). [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/s21.html) provided: "The Commission is not subject to any requirement, obligation, liability, penalty or disability under a law of a State or Territory to which Australia is not subject." [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/s38.html) [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) provided that, for the purpose of enabling the Commission to perform its functions under that Act, there be established an Australian Telecommunications
Commission Service. That Commission had officers and employees.[3] Section (1) provided: "Subject to this Part, officers and employees hold office on such respective terms and conditions as the Commission determines." 
The [Telecommunications Amendment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/taa1988294/) (Cth), which commenced on 14 December 1988, amended the [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) to create the Australian Telecommunications Corporation. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/s6.html) of that
Act provided that, in consequence of a new s.4 and s.4A inserted in the [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) , the
Australian Telecommunications Commission was preserved and continued under the name of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation as a body corporate.

The [Australian Telecommunications Corporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/atca1989453/) (Cth), which commenced on 1 July 1989, defined in [s.3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/atca1989453/s3.html) "Telecom" to mean Australian Telecommunications Corporation, which was continued as a body corporate.[4] 
The Australian and Overseas [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1991214/) (Cth), which commenced on 1 July 1991, defined AOTC to mean "the company incorporated, or to be incorporated, under the Corporations Law of the
Australian Capital territory by the name Australian and Overseas
Telecommunications Corporation Limited." All of the property rights and liabilities of Telecom were, by [s.11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1991214/s11.html), vested in AOTC.

The Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Limited was registered as an unlisted public company limited by shares under the
Corporations Law of the Australian Capital territory on 6 November 1991. On April 1993 that corporation was renamed Telstra Corporation Limited. The [Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/taclaa1994516/) (Cth) amended the title of the Australia and Overseas [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1991214/) to the [Telstra Corporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/tca1991242/) .

APPLICABILITY OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES WORKERS COMPENSATION ACTS 1926 AND 1987 TO TELSTRA 
Telstra, supported by the Commonwealth Attorney General, have contended that, as a matter of construction, the Workers Compensation Act 1926  which was in force at the time of the first injury on 20 May 1986, and the [Workers
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  in force at the time of the second accident on 28 April 1988 did not apply to
Telstra. Thus it was contended in respect of each of those accidents that the
Compensation Court had no jurisdiction.

Mr Worthing's application was brought pursuant to the [Workers Compensation
Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) .
Schedule 6 [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p2) to that Act provides by cl.1 that: "Subject to this Schedule, Part 2 of this Act applies whether the injury was received before or after the commencement of that Part." 
Part 2 deals with the liability of employers to pay compensation. It was pursuant to that Part, and in particular s.9, that compensation was claimed.
The critical question thus is whether Telstra, or its predecessor, was an employer within the meaning of the 1987 Act.

Section 3(1), of the definition section, provides: "employer includes: any body of persons, corporate or unincorporate, the legal personal representative of a deceased employer, a Government employer, and a former employer." "Government employer" is defined to mean: "... the Crown or any department, person or body exercising executive or administrative functions on behalf of the Government of the State, and includes ..." 
At the date of the first accident (20 May 1986) the employer, then known as the Australian Telecommunications Commission, was a body corporate in consequence of s.21(1)(a) [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) . At the date of the second accident (28 April 1988) the employer, still known as the
Australian Telecommunications Commission, remained a body corporate. At the date of the third injury (2 June 1993) the employer, then known as Telstra
Corporation Limited, was a body corporate.

It is not at all clear that a statutory corporation such as the Australian
Telecommunications Commission created and incorporated by a Federal Act of
Parliament falls within the meaning of the expression "any body of persons, corporate ...", where used in the definition of employer in the 1987 Act. It is plain that such a body would not fall within the definition of "Government employer" as defined because that definition purports to restrict the meaning of Government employer to a body exercising functions on behalf of the
Government of the State . However, to my mind, having regard to the fact that the definition of "employer" in s.3 of the 1987 Act merely "includes" those bodies referred to in (a) to (d) inclusive, there is nothing in the definition which derogates from simply applying the normal understanding of the expression "employer" as referring to a person or body which employs people.
An employer is somebody who engages and pays a worker. The Australian
Telecommunications Commission, by Part V of the [Telecommunications Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) , is authorised to engage and pay officers and employees. It is thus, in my view, an employer. For similar reasons so is Telstra.

As a matter of construction I would hold that the Australian
Telecommunications Commission and Telstra Corporation Limited were each an "employer" within the 1987 State Act. On the assumption that Mr Worthing can establish that he was a worker employed in the sense of having been engaged by and paid by the Australian Telecommunications Commission, the 1987 Act does not deny the Compensation Court jurisdiction to hear his claim based upon the contention that the prospective respondent was not an "employer" within the meaning of the Act.

INCONSISTENCY WITHIN [S. 109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) OF THE [CONSTITUTION](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) provides: "When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the
Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid." 
The inconsistency may arise in a number of ways. The Commonwealth law may, when properly construed, indicate a legislative intention on the part of the
Commonwealth to occupy the whole legal field in respect of a particular topic, subject matter or relationship. In such a case any entry by the state law into that field will produce an impermissible inconsistency. As Aickin J said, an
Act may itself, or it may empower a tribunal "to prescribe completely and exhaustively what rights and obligations of the parties to the dispute shall be with respect to all the matters in dispute, i.e. those within the ambit of the dispute."[5] In a more restricted sense, a federal law may specify particular provisions regulating rights and relationships of particular categories of persons in particular circumstances, without indicating an intention to exclusively cover all aspects of such rights or relationships or circumstances involving particular persons or bodies. In that circumstance, once the more narrow field of relationships specified or regulated by the federal law is determined, any intrusion by a state law into that narrower field also produces impermissible inconsistency, although properly construed the federal law may not inhibit the state law from entering into the field relationships not specifically dealt with by the federal law. The critical point is that whether the federal law, properly construed, seeks to exclude totally a state law from the relevant relationship, or whether it deals only with specific field in a given relationship thus permitting a state law to deal with other aspects of that relationship, once the "field of the federal law" is determined, intrusion into that field by a state law is rendered impermissible by s. 109. As Aickin J said: "The "field" or subject matter of the State law is not necessarily of significance. The critical matter is the field of the federal law. If a State law "intrudes into or operates" within the field of such a federal law, or would alter, impair or detract from the operation of a federal law, then there will be inconsistency, whatever the topic or field of the State law."[6] 
Inconsistency within such a determined field of the federal law, be it broad or narrow, may be direct or indirect. As Aickin J said: "Whether it be right or not to say that are two kinds of inconsistency, the central question is the intention of a particular federal law. The field of its operation may be regarded as wide or narrow and produce inconsistency because of the intention to cover a particular field exclusively or because of an intention to regulate specific conduct so that any other regulation of that conduct is inconsistent because the attempt to regulate the identical conduct in a different manner, or perhaps at all, necessarily impairs the operation of the federal regulation of that conduct."[7] 
It may be express or implied. If the state law either seeks to, or does in its application, "alter, impair or detract from the operation of the federal law", it will be inconsistent within the meaning of s. 109. Sometimes, when the conflict between the federal and state law is direct and apparent, it may not be necessary to define the field of federal legislation,[8] but usually the starting point is to define the field of federal legislation.[9] That done the remaining question is whether the state law intrudes into that field directly or indirectly. [10] 
The nature of a "direct inconsistency" was discussed by Mason J in Ansett
Transport Industries (Operations) versus Wardley. His Honour said: "As a preliminary to an examination of the Agreement I should point out that the major thrust of Ansett's case is to establish the existence of what has been called "direct inconsistency", that is, the disconformity which is created by the presence of an absolute right to dismiss for any reason whatsoever, which Ansett finds in the Agreement, and the presence in the State
Act of a prohibition against dismissal for the prescribed reasons. "Direct inconsistency" is a description which has always been applied to cases in which it is impossible to obey both laws (R versus Licensing Court of Brisbane; Ex parte Daniell <case>; [(1920) 28 CLR 23]; Blackley versus Devondale Cream (Vic.) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1943) 68 CLR 151).] Cases of this kind have sometimes been treated as a separate head of inconsistency (O'Sullivan versus Noarlunga Meat Ltd <case>; [(1954) 92 CLR 565] at 592), though even when so treated they have generally been related to the "cover the field" test (O'Sullivan versus Noarlunga Meat Ltd <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 177] at 182, ; Swift Australian Co. (Pty) Ltd versus Boyd Parkinson <case>; [(1962) 108 CLR 189] at 207), apparently on the ground that direct inconsistency is confined to a situation in which simultaneous obedience to both laws is impossible.

As the various tests which have been applied by the Court are all designed to elucidate the issue of inconsistency it is not surprising that they are interrelated and that in a given case more than one test is capable of being applied so as to establish inconsistency. Especially is this so when it is the giving of a permission or the grant of a right by Commonwealth law that is the foundation of a claim of inconsistency. If, according to the true construction of the Commonwealth law, the right is absolute, then it inevitably follows that the right is intended to prevail to the exclusion of any other law. A
State law which takes away the right is inconsistent because it is in conflict with the absolute right and because the Commonwealth law relevantly occupies the field. So also with a Commonwealth law that grants a permission by way of positive authority. The Commonwealth legislative intention which sustains the conclusion that the permission is granted by way of positive authority also sustains the conclusion that the positive authority was to take effect to the exclusion of any other law. Again it produces inconsistency on both grounds: cf. Airlines of New South Wales Pty Ltd versus New South Wales <case>; [(1965) 113 CLR 54], where the permission for which the Commonwealth law provided was neither absolute nor comprehensive."[11] 
The approach of the various parties to inconsistency was different. Telstra and the Commonwealth Attorney-General approached the matter by endeavouring to show that by comparison of the various sections in the federal and state Acts the Commonwealth had by its laws exhibited an intention to cover the field described as the Commonwealth's, or its instrumentalities', relations with its employees, including workers compensation as an adjunct of that employment relationship or, as I understood it, alternatively, at least the field of workers compensation. The respondent worker contended that an historical analysis of the prior state and federal acts, and a consideration of the current federal Act, made clear that it was intended that there be parallel federal and state legislation dealing with workers compensation, with the choice of law and forum left to the worker. The State Solicitor-General contended that, in considering inconsistency, one only had regard to those provisions which directly affect the worker's specific claim. In that respect one looked at the "operational level" of the federal and state acts to see if there was inconsistency. Reliance was placed upon The State of Victoria &
Ors versus The Commonwealth of Australia & Ors (the Kakariki)[12] and The
Queen versus Winneke; Ex parte Gallagher[13].

I do not think that either of these cases propound a principle different to that to which I have referred previously. The Kakariki was concerned with a circumstance where there were concurrent powers, but the Commonwealth had not sought to exercise its power. Dixon J said: "When a state law, if valid, would alter, impair or detract from the operation of a law of the Commonwealth Parliament, then to that extent it is invalid.
Moreover, if it appears from the terms, the nature or the subject matter of a
Federal enactment that it was intended as a complete statement of the law governing a particular matter or set of rights and duties, then for a State law to regulate or apply to the same matter or relation is regarded as a detraction from the full operation of the Commonwealth law and so (is) inconsistent."[14] 
It was held there that inconsistency could have arisen if the Commonwealth had in fact sought to exercise its power but the legislation did not make clear that prior to the exercise of its jurisdiction, a concurrent state power could not validly exist.

Similarly in The Queen versus Winneke; Ex parte Gallagher it was made plain that each of the Commonwealth and a State could have a concurrent but different power each to establish Royal Commissions. Those powers did not conflict. If, however, the Commonwealth commissioner sought to retain a document, which the
State commissioner then sought, a conflict of powers would arise, and s. 109 would have the effect of giving priority to the Federal power, and thus the
Federal Royal commissioner.[15] 
For similar reasons it is to my mind plain that each of the Commonwealth and a
State are empowered to enact workers compensation legislation. Enacting those two pieces of legislation may, or may not, produce inconsistency depending upon their intended scope. Once the scope of the federal Act is determined, the question then arises whether the state Act purports to intrude into and qualify the operation of that federal Act. If it does, s. 109 strikes down the state Act but only to the extent of that inconsistency.

It follows that it is necessary to consider the totality of the federal legislation to determine if it discloses an intention to exclude entirely from a given field a state Act. If it does not, it is then necessary to consider that federal legislation on a narrower basis to determine the particular field which it covers. Once that is determined, the intent and operation of the state Act needs to be considered to ascertain whether it "alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of the federal law".

The fact that a federal law may not constitute a complete code in a given area does not mean that there can be no inconsistency with a state Act. It may be that the federal legislature intended to deal only with particular aspects of a relationship. In Australian Broadcasting Commission versus Industrial Court of
South Australia & Anor.[16] Murphy J said: "Although s. 109 operates directly, the determination of inconsistency requires conclusions on the intentions of the two laws. This can raise the difficult question of whether, through the operation of s. 109, the Parliament has precluded State laws or (by the choice of selective regulatory measures) has left the exercise of State power undisturbed except where the State and federal Acts collide (see Rice versus Santa Fe Elevator Corporation <case>; [(1947) 331 US 218] [[91 Law Ed. 1447]] and the cases cited there).

Where the federal law is on a topic of dominant federal interest, an intention to legislate exclusively (if not expressed) will generally be implied. The industrial relations of Commonwealth agencies and instrumentalities (particularly bodies operating nationwide) are of dominant federal interest.
The Parliament has not dealt with these relations completely or exhaustively, but it would be contrary to the general object of the laws establishing the bodies if the industrial relations could be regulated (perhaps differently in various States) by State laws."[17] 
This latter paragraph has not, so far as I am aware, since been referred to by the High Court. The weight of authority is to the effect that what is to be determined is the field which the federal legislation indicated an intention to cover. If the field be industrial relations, or here the worker's compensation entitlements, of employees of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth instrumentality or corporation operating nationally, the factors referred to by Murphy J give weight to interpreting that field as being an area of exclusivity of federal legislation, rather than concurrence of federal and state legislation with the employee having the right to select the federal or state law providing him with the greatest advantage. One would not readily interpret a federal Act dealing with federal employees operating Australia wide as expressing the intention of the federal Parliament, in relation to matters common to all Commonwealth employees, such as industrial relations or workers compensation, that there should be inconsistency between such employees' rights and obligations depending upon the state in which they were employed and their choice of law. Inconsistency of entitlements and obligations between workers employed under contracts of employment regulated by federal legislation on the one hand, and state legislation on the other, may be recognised, but clear words would be needed to convey the intention of the federal legislature that employees subject to the one piece of federal legislation were entitled to different rights and subject to different liabilities arising from that one piece of federal legislation [SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION ACT 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (CTH) 
The long title to this Act is: "An Act relating to the rehabilitation of employees of the Commonwealth and certain corporations and to workers compensation for those employees and certain other persons, and for related purposes." 
Section 5 defines employee to mean: "(a) a person who is employed by the Commonwealth or by a Commonwealth authority, whether the person is so employed under a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory or under a contract of service or apprenticeship; or a person who is employed by a licensed corporation" 
Subclause (b) was inserted by the [Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and
Compensation Amendment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ceracaa1992614/) [18]. A licensed corporation means a corporation which is the holder of a licence under [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ceracaa1992614/index.html#p8)
B. The object of [Part
VIII](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ceracaa1992614/index.html#p8)
B was to enable certain corporations to apply to have the Act apply in relation to their employees.[19] The Minister is permitted to declare any corporation to be an eligible corporation for that purpose if the corporation was, or is about to cease to be, a Commonwealth authority, or is carrying on business in competition with a Commonwealth authority or with another corporation that was previously a Commonwealth authority. Thus the intention is clear that existing and prior Commonwealth employees are or may become bound by the provisions of the Act. Certain persons are deemed to be employees[20], such as members of the Australian Federal Police and the members of the Defence Forces. Other persons are excluded from the operation of the Act, such as members of Parliament, certain judges and "a seaman to whom the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act applies."[21] 
By s. 6 circumstances constituting an injury arising out of or in the course of employment are specified. Section 7 indicates the circumstances in which a disease is said to have been contributed to by employment. Sections 8 and 9 indicate the manner in which normal weekly earnings are to be determined.
Sections 11 and 12 provide: "11. The liability of a relevant authority to pay compensation to a person under this Act is the liability of that authority to pay to the person such amount or amounts as are determined by that authority to be payable to the person under this Act." "12. An amount of compensation payable under a provision of this Act in respect of an injury is, unless the contrary intention appears, in addition to an amount of compensation paid or payable under any other provision of this
Act in respect of that injury." 
Section 13 addresses indexation.

Part II of the Act deals with injuries, property loss or damage and medical expenses. Section 14(1) provides that: "Subject to this Part, Comcare is liable to pay compensation in accordance with this Act in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work, or impairment." 
Sections 15 and 16 provide for compensation for loss or damage to property and for medical expenses. Part II Division 2 provides for compensation for injuries resulting in death, and for payment of funeral expenses. Part II
Division 3 provides for compensation for injuries resulting in incapacity and specifies the manner in which the amount of such compensation is to be calculated. Adjustments to those payments are provided if the injured worker is in receipt of superannuation (s. 20), or a lump sum benefit (s. 21) or both (s. 21A). Part II Division 4 addresses compensation for injuries resulting in a permanent impairment, the interim payment of such compensation and the final payment of such compensation. Provision is made for compensation for non- economic loss (s. 27), and a "Guide to the assessment of the degree of permanent impairment" is provided for by s. 28. Household and attendant care services are addressed in Division 5.

Part III deals with rehabilitation. It provides for assessment of an injured or impaired worker, the provision of rehabilitation programs, the payment of sums to assist in rehabilitation and the provision of appropriate employment whilst rehabilitation is being undertaken.

Part IV addresses the entitlement of employees to bring claims for damages, and its effect upon compensation payments. It addresses claims against both the Commonwealth and third parties.

Part V deals with the procedural aspects of claiming compensation including the giving of notice of injury, the bringing of the claim, and medical examinations. Part VI provides for a review of determinations by the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Part VII provides for the establishment of a body called Comcare. There is established by s. 89A a commission called the Safety, Rehabilitation and
Compensation Commission the functions which include ensuring there is no inconsistency in the administrative practices and procedures used by Comcare, a licensed authority and a licensed corporation in the performance of their functions. Comcare is financed from consolidated revenue in respect of such sum as is necessary to enable it to discharge liabilities which it has undertaken pursuant to s. 128 being the prior liabilities of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority to pay compensation.[22] Otherwise Comcare is financed by the receipt of premiums from Commonwealth departments and authorities.[23] 
Part VIIA provides for the grant of licences to various authorities as does
Part VIIIB. In essence they are self-insurer provisions relating to
Commonwealth authorities and declared corporations.

The penultimate part is Part IX headed Miscellaneous. Section 117 makes provision for employees engaged outside Australia for employment outside
Australia and performing their duties outside Australia. If there is a compensation scheme in force in the foreign country in respect of the
Commonwealth's employment of that employee, the Act does not apply.[24] If there is no compensation scheme applicable to such an employee, but there is a scheme applicable to employees of the Government of that country, that foreign
Government scheme applies to that employee.[25] 
To my mind, had the Act stopped there, it would have been plain that the
Commonwealth had set up an exclusive code addressing the topic of workers compensation for employees of the Commonwealth, its authorities, and persons employed by licensed corporations. At the widest level there would have been an apparent inconsistency with the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/)  which addressed similar, if not identical, topics to those to which I have referred in the Commonwealth Act.

Further, if the matter of inconsistency had been considered on the narrower approach the inconsistency would have been equally plain. The respondent's claim was for total continuing incapacity from 29 April 1994. Such a claim is brought pursuant to s. 36 and s. 37 of the State Act. By that Act the claimant, assuming he established his case, would be entitled to compensation at a rate equivalent to his current weekly wage for the first 26 weeks, such current weekly wage being determined in accordance with s. 42, and thereafter an amount equivalent to 90% of the worker's average weekly earnings subject to the matters set forth in s. 37. In contrast, the compensation payable under the Commonwealth Act pursuant to s. 19 is at a rate for the first 45 weeks calculated in accordance with the formula set out in s. 19(2), which relates to the employee's normal weekly earnings, and after that 45 weeks at a rate calculated in accordance with s. 19(3). The amounts of each weekly payment and the periods of each category of payment are different under the two acts.
Further, in consequence of ss.36 and 37 of the Commonwealth Act the worker's entitlement to payment of the compensation to which I have referred is made dependant upon him undertaking appropriate rehabilitation.

The respondent's claim in respect of his permanent injuries is brought pursuant to s. 66 of the state Act which imposes a ceiling of $100,000 on the sum payable, subject to escalation. In contrast, the sum payable for permanent impairment under the federal Act is that calculated in accordance with s. 24.
The amount payable is dependant upon the assessment of permanent impairment, which must be greater than 10% before any compensation is payable, and there is a ceiling on payments of $80,000.

The claim for the cost of medical payments is pursuant to s. 60 of the state
Act, and s. 16 of the federal Act. Although the provisions are similar, the amount payable under the federal Act is such amount as Comcare determines as appropriate for the medical treatment.

The respondent claimed for pain and suffering pursuant to s. 67 of the state
Act which provides for a ceiling of payments of $50,000 indexed. Compensation for non-economic loss is provided by s. 27 of the federal Act which specifies the amount of compensation as being the sum of $15,000 multiplied by the percentage of permanent impairment assessed under s. 24 together with a further $15,000 multiplied by the percentage determined by Comcare under the approved guide as the degree of non-economic loss. Plainly the conditions are different.

Finally, the respondent claimed interest pursuant to s. 113 of the state Act.
There is no equivalent provision under the Commonwealth Act.

It is thus apparent that there are gross inconsistencies between the
Commonwealth and the State provisions when considered on a detailed or narrow basis.

SECTIONS 52 AND 118 [SAFETY, REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION ACT 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) "Compensation not payable both under Act and under award . (1) A person who would, but for this section, be entitled to compensation under this Act and benefits under an award in respect of the same injury, or in respect of the same loss of, or damage to, property, is not entitled to both but shall elect whether to receive the compensation or the benefits. 
An election made by an employee is irrevocable. 
Where an employee makes an election to receive either compensation under this Act or benefits under the award but compensation is not payable under this Act, or benefits are not payable under the award, as the case may be, in respect of the injury, or the loss of, or damage to, property, the election has no effect. 
Where an employee has made an election to receive compensation under this Act, that compensation is not payable unless the employee makes a claim under section 54. 
Where an employee who has made an election dies, the election does not have effect in relation to his or her dependants. 
In this section, "award" means an award, determination, order or agreement by which provision is made for, or in relation to, the grant of any benefits to or in relation to employees or their dependants in respect of injury or disease causing death or incapacity, or in respect of the loss of, or damage to, property, in circumstances connected with the employment of those employees, being: a determination made under the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920; or an award or order made, or agreement entered into, under a law of the Commonwealth relating to conciliation and arbitration; or an award, determination or order made, or agreement entered into, under a law of a State or Territory." "Double benefits . (1) If: an employee recovers State workers' compensation in respect of an injury or the loss of, or damage to, property used by the employee; or 
State workers' compensation is recovered by, or for the benefit of, a dependant of a deceased employee; compensation is not payable under this Act to that employee in respect of that injury, loss or damage, or to, or for the benefit of, that dependant in respect of the injury that resulted in the death.

If, after any compensation has been paid by a relevant authority under this Act: to an employee in respect of an injury or the loss of, or damage to, property used by the employee; or to, or for the benefit of, a dependant of a deceased employee; any State workers' compensation is recovered by the employee in respect of that injury, loss or damage or to, or for the benefit of, the dependant in respect of the injury that resulted in the death, as the case may be, the relevant authority may recover the amount of compensation paid by it from the person to whom it was paid in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the authority.

A relevant authority that has received a claim may require the claimant to give may require the claimant to give it a statutory declaration stating whether any State workers' compensation has been paid to or in respect of the claimant in respect of the injury or loss of, or damage to, property, as the case may be, to which the claim relates. 
Where a claimant for compensation refuses or fails, without reasonable excuse, to give a statutory declaration under subsection (3), the claimant's rights to compensation under this Act in respect of the injury or loss of, or damage to, property to which the claim relates, and to institute or continue any proceedings under this Act in relation to that compensation, are suspended until the statutory declaration is given. 
Where the claimant's right to compensation is suspended under subsection (4), compensation is not payable in respect of the period of suspension. 
In this section: "State workers' compensation" means compensation recoverable under a law of a State or of a Territory, or of a foreign country, relating to workers' compensation." 
Section 52(6)(c) was introduced by the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Act 1984 ,26 at the time the provisions defining an employee to include a person employed by a licensed corporation were introduced. I do not think, however, that that aspect of history permits a reading down of the provisions of s. 52(6)(c) so as to apply only to such employees.

In my view the effect of s. 52(6)(c), and more particularly s. 118, which remains in its original form, makes it plain that the Commonwealth Parliament contemplated that notwithstanding the establishment of a complete regime for the payment of compensation to Commonwealth employees and those of
Commonwealth authorities and licensed corporations, such employees nonetheless had a right to seek and obtain workers compensation recoverable under a state law. Section 118(1) contemplates that happening and makes provision for it.
Section 118(3) permits a relevant authority, being Comcare, a licensed authority or a licensed corporation[27], to withhold payment of compensation under the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) until the employee has provided a statutory declaration "stating whether any state workers compensation has been paid to or in respect of the claimant in respect of the injury or loss of, or damage to, property, as the case may be, to which the claim relates." It seems to me necessarily to follow that the Commonwealth has not sought to exclude claims for state workers compensation in respect of injuries which might give rise to compensation under the federal Act.

Section 118(1) provides, as part of the Commonwealth compensation scheme, that no compensation is payable if the employee has received compensation under a
State Act. That must mean that the employee has the right to claim that compensation, and that state courts have jurisdiction to address that claim.
Section 118(2) does not purport to deny an employee who has received compensation under the federal Act, the right to compensation under the state
Act. Rather, it provides for recovery from the employee of the amount of compensation paid by the relevant authority under the federal Act from the employee. Again, that recognises the right and capacity of the employee to seek, obtain, and retain compensation payable under the state Act. Each of these two provisions are inconsistent with any view that the federal legislation is inconsistent with the state legislation whether viewed broadly or narrowly. Rather, the federal legislation recognises the existence of the state legislation and provides for the consequence of an employee having rights under the federal legislation availing himself of rights and entitlements under the provisions of otherwise inconsistent state law.

The response advanced on behalf of the appellant and the Commonwealth
Attorney-General to s. 118 was that it applied to a limited range of circumstances. It was suggested that the section was directed to the circumstance that the employee under state law could recover against a person other than the Commonwealth, where the employee is seconded to or transferred to the Commonwealth, or where a Commonwealth employee may be on exchange in the private sector.

I can see no basis for so limiting s.118. It is not in terms so limited, and its terms have a sensible operation given their natural meaning.

It follows, in my view, that there is no inconsistency within the meaning of [s. 109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and the appeal must be dismissed.

The appellant was granted leave to file in Court a summons for leave to appeal in case it should be held that the notice of appeal previously filed was inadequate in light of [section (6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s17.html)
Compensation Court Act. I would grant that leave to appeal, for greater precaution. I would dismiss the appeal with costs. No order for costs should be made in respect of either intervener.

TELSTRA CORPORATION versus Allan John WORTHING & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Cole JA. 
TELSTRA CORPORATION v 
Allan John WORTHING and Anor 
JUDGMENT 
STEIN JA: I agree with Cole JA. He has recited the three injuries suffered by the respondent worker whilst an employee of the appellant (Telstra) on 20 May 1986, 28 April 1988, and 2 June 1993 respectively. The worker filed an application for compensation in the Compensation Court of New South Wales claiming compensation under <case> (and other sections) of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) . 
Shorn of legal niceties, the respective arguments of Telstra and the Attorney-
General for the Commonwealth on the one hand and the worker and the Attorney-
General for New South Wales on the other, boil down to the question of inconsistency under <case> of the Commonwealth [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Stated more precisely, is the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) inconsistent with the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1975 (Cwlth) for the purposes of <case>.

EMPLOYER? 
There is an issue as to whether Telstra (and its predecessor) is an employer under the state compensation statutes. In the 1987 State Act `employer' is defined in <case> to include: any body or persons, corporate or unincorporate, the legal personal representative of a deceased employer, 
Government employer, and a former employer.
 `Government employer' is defined as meaning `the Crown or any department, person or body exercising executive or administrative functions on behalf of the Government of the State and includes ...'.

At all relevant times Telstra, and its predecessor the Australian
Telecommunications Commission (the ATC), was and remains a body corporate. I accept that <case> of the 1987 State Act does not extend the definition of `employer'.

It is clear that Telstra is not an employer within subparagraphs (b), (c) or of the definition of `employer'. It may however be an employer under paragraph (a). Importantly, the definition of `employer' is an inclusive one.
The paragraphs of the definition are no more than illustrative of employers.
In normal parlance an `employer' refers to one who employs people. An employer is a person or body which employs workers for reward. This is precisely what
Telstra (and the ATC) did. I agree with Cole JA that Telstra (and the ATC) are employers within the 1987 State Act.

INCONSISTENCY? 
Telstra and the Commonwealth Attorney-General submit that the [Telecommunications
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ta1975214/) (Cwlth), now repealed, `covered the field' by establishing an exclusive code for employment conditions. Further, it is submitted that the Compensation (Commonwealth
Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cwlth) and the [Safety, Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) `covered the field' by establishing an exclusive code for workers' compensation. It is submitted that the State compensation Acts were and are incompatible and, to the extent of the inconsistency, are invalid.

In my opinion, laws with respect to the terms and conditions of employment are distinct and different from laws relating to workers' compensation. They cover different fields or topics. In the field of workers' compensation the
Commonwealth and the States are both empowered to enact legislation - the powers are concurrent.

It is necessary to examine the Commonwealth laws to identify their application and ascertain whether they seek to exclude the state law. Whether the inconsistency be direct or indirect, the question is whether the state law intrudes, alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of the federal law.

The field of the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (the
SRC Act) is the workers' compensation of Commonwealth employers and employees of Commonwealth corporations or instrumentalities. Under <case>(b), by reason of the 1992 amendments, `employee' includes a person employed by a licenced corporation.

I agree with Cole JA that an examination of the SRC Act is consistent with it being an exclusive code for the compensation of injured workers of the
Commonwealth, its authorities and licenced corporations. When considered at a wide or narrow level, there appears to be an apparent inconsistency with the
NSW Acts. However, a close examination of ss 52 and 118 of the SRC Act leads to a different conclusion.

Section 52 of the SRC Act seeks to avoid `double counting' with regard to compensation. An employee or person entitled to compensation under the statute must elect between which compensation rights and award he or she pursues in respect of the same injury. Subsection (6) (c) (introduced in 1992 at the same time that certain licenced corporations were included) makes specific reference to an award or determination under a law of a State or Territory.

Of greater moment, however, is <case> relating to `double benefits'. The section provides: 
If: an employee recovers State workers' compensation in respect of an injury or the loss of, or damage to, property used by the employee; or 
State workers' compensation is recovered by, or the benefit of, a dependant of a deceased employee; compensation is not payable under this Act to that employee in respect of that injury, loss or damage, or to, or for the benefit of, that dependant in respect of the injury that resulted in the death.

If, after any compensation has been paid by a relevant authority under this Act: to an employee in respect of an injury or the loss of, or damage to, property used by the employee; or to, or for the benefit of, a dependant of a deceased employee; any State workers' compensation is recovered by the employee in respect of that injury, loss or damage or to, or for the benefit of, the dependant in respect of the injury that resulted in the death, as the case may be, the relevant authority may recover the amount of compensation paid by it from the person to whom it was paid in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the authority.

A relevant authority that has received a claim may require the claimant to give it a statutory declaration stating whether any State workers' compensation has been paid to or in respect of the claimant in respect of the injury or loss of, or damage to, property, as the case may be, to which the claim relates.

Where a claimant for compensation refuses or fails, without reasonable excuse, to give a statutory declaration under subsection (3), the claimant's rights to compensation under this Act in respect of the injury or loss of, or damage to, property to which the claim relates, and to institute or continue any proceedings under this Act in relation to that compensation, are suspended until the statutory declaration is given.

Where a claimant's right to compensation is suspended under subsection , compensation is not payable in respect of the period of the suspension.

In this section: "State workers' compensation" means compensation recoverable under a law of a State or of a Territory, or of a foreign country, relating to workers' compensation.

This provision was included in the original enactment in 1988. I agree with
Cole JA that the provision makes it apparent that notwithstanding that the legislation contemplated a regime for compensation for Commonwealth employees (and specific others) it was on the basis that these workers have the right to seek and obtain workers' compensation under relevant state and territory laws.
Section 118(1) of the SRC Act is plain. If state workers' compensation is recovered by the worker, then compensation is not payable under the Act with respect to the injury the subject of the claim. This must relate to successful claims for compensation under state workers' compensation legislation, such as the subject statute in NSW. The section clearly recognises the right of a employee to seek and be awarded compensation under the State Act. The provision is at odds with a view that the SRC Act is inconsistent with the state statute. Rather, the SRC Act recognises and accepts the state acts and is concerned to avoid double benefits for an employee where that person chooses to proceed under state or territory laws.

As against this, it is submitted on behalf of Telstra that <case> was intended to operate in a narrow and limited range of circumstances. It did not deal with or contemplate compensation from a Commonwealth employer. For example, it was suggested that the provision relates to circumstances where the employee can recover under state law against a person other than the Commonwealth. It is argued that the provision might be relevant where employees are seconded between the Commonwealth and a State or on exchange with the private sector.
Another suggestion which was made by counsel was joint employment.

The provision contains no indication that it is limited to the circumstances suggested. If it was so intended, it would have been relatively easy to spell it out. In my opinion, <case> (and <case>) of the SRC Act evince an intention to recognise mutuality between the Commonwealth, State and Territory workers' compensation systems. The provisions discussed fly in the face of inconsistency.

I agree with the orders proposed by Cole JA.
