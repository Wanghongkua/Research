CRIMINAL LAW - proceeds of crime - restraining orders  
JUDGMENT
This is an application for a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . The proceedings are ultimately proceedings for an order pursuant to [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act that the Defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the unexplained wealth of the Defendant.
The section provides that the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer setting out the matters that are contained in [s 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) and stating the grounds on which the suspicion referred to in that subsection is based if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 20 January 2017 who is an authorised officer of the Plaintiff. Mr Spark deposes to the fact that he suspects that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities as defined in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the Act, being the offences of cultivating a prohibited plant, being cannabis, contrary to [s 23(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s23.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and supplying a prohibited drug, being cannabis resin, contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of that Act. Those offences fall within the definition of serious crime related activity in [section 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Mr Spark holds the suspicion based principally on reading the facts sheet prepared by the investigating police in the matter. He deposes to having spoken to the supervising officer and asked him if he was familiar with the contents of the facts sheet, and that he believed to the best of his knowledge and belief that the contents of the facts sheet were true. The supervising officer provided affirmative answers to Mr Spark's enquiries.
I have read that facts sheet and I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion that the offences referred to have been committed is reasonably held on the basis of the material in that facts sheet.
The Plaintiff seeks that these orders be made without giving prior notice to the Defendant. That request is based upon what Mr Spark says in his affidavit, that by reason of his lengthy experience working with the Commission he is aware how quickly it is for people to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate and dispose of funds held in bank accounts in a way that attempts to defeat the operation of the Act.
I consider that the orders should be made without prior notice to the Defendant. The Defendant, in any event, has the right under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act for a review of the orders made.
