C Pecar versus National Australia Trustees Ltd [1997] NSWSC 1 (1 January 1997) 
CHRISTOPHER PECAR v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA TRUSTEES LTD & ANR 
THE ESTATE OF IVAN URLICH DECEASED /96 
WEDNESDAY 27 NOVEMBER 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
BRYSON J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff commenced the proceedings by Summons on 21 June 1996 seeking an order determining his alleged entitlement as son of the deceased to share in the distribution of the estate of the late Ivan Urlich pursuant to s.61B of the Wills Probate and Administration Act 1988, and consequential declarations and orders which would regulate the distribution of a share of the estate to him.

Ivan Urlich late of Dee Why, butcher, died intestate on 20 June 1995, and the first defendant National Australia Trustees Ltd obtained letters of administration of his estate from this Court on 13 December 1995. The widow of the deceased, Vesna Urlich, who is the second defendant, authorised National
Australia Trustees Limited to apply for administration. The deceased had no child other than the plaintiff, and the administration was conducted on the footing that the second defendant as widow was the only person entitled on intestacy. If the plaintiff's allegation, which she disputes, is made out, he too will be entitled on intestacy. The inventory of property filed with the
Probate application shows assets with attributed values totalling $684,355.09; the property included two home units and one of them, 10/24 Banksia Street,
Dee Why, valued at $200,000 is the second defendant's home and, it appears, was the matrimonial home. Entitlement would in that case be established in accordance with s.61B(3) of the Wills [Probate and Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/), with the greater part of the value of the assets going to the second defendant. It was suggested by counsel that if the plaintiff has an entitlement it is worth in the order of $300,000. Whatever his entitlement is, it is obviously significant.

The plaintiff now applies by Notice of Motion for orders under which the plaintiff's expert Dr Brian McDonald would be authorised to examine human tissue of the deceased Ivan Urlich held by Hanly Moir Pathology Pty Ltd for the purpose of comparing the DNA of the tissue with DNA in blood samples taken from the plaintiff with a view to determining the relationship of the plaintiff to the deceased; with related orders requiring Hanly Moir Pathology to release the tissue to Dr McDonald and requiring the defendants to facilitate its release.

The solicitor representing National Australia Trustees took no active part in the proceedings and informed me that the trustee company neither supports nor opposes the application.

In his affidavit evidence the plaintiff gives his personal history. He was born on 30 January 1959, when his late mother Anna Pecar was married to the late Chris Pecar the elder; he grew up in their household and regarded Chris
Pecar the elder as his father. He said that from comments made by his mother,
Ivan Urlich, friends and family over the years he believes that after having had a personal relationship in Croatia before she immigrated to Australia and married Chris Pecar the elder, his mother renewed the relationship with Ivan
Urlich after he too came to Australia, and Ivan became the plaintiff's natural father. As a child the plaintiff had a special relationship with Ivan Urlich as a person to whom he could go for consolation when in difficulties. He says that he was told when he was about 15 by Ivan Urlich in his mother's presence that Ivan Urlich was his father, and that later Ivan Urlich assured him while showing him his home unit, "Everything that is mine will be yours, providing you look after your grandmother in Croatia." Mrs Anna Pecar died in 1979.
After that event Ivan Urlich repeated words to the effect of this statement.
The plaintiff also gives evidence of its being reputed among adults of his parents' generation at the Yugoslav Social Club Warriewood that he was not the son of Chris Pecar the elder. He also gives other evidence of reputation. He states that, on the occasion of the marriage of Ivan Urlich with the second defendant, Ivan Urlich introduced the plaintiff to her as "his son" and that he made other references to the plaintiff in the same sense to relatives.
After Ivan Urlich died at Manly District Hospital on 20 June 1995, someone connected with the Manly District Hospital, where his body was, asked the plaintiff to sign a consent for autopsy as his son, which he did. He says that he wishes his expert to examine a blood sample taken from himself and tissue of the deceased held by Hanly Moir Pathology, and is prepared to allow the defendants to have blood taken from him for a DNA test, and that he is prepared to abide by the results.

In correspondence directed to the plaintiff's solicitor on 15 July 1996 the director of Hanly Moir Pathology, Dr Warick Delprado stated that Hanly Moir held tissue obtained at the time of the postmortem, and that it is possible to do DNA testing on the material held on microscopy unstained sections prepared from the paraffin blocks in which the tissue is embedded, and that the sections can be obtained from the material held.

Hanly Moir Pathology is not a party to the litigation. It was however named in the Notice of Motion as a person to whom the Notice of Motion was directed; but for some reason notice was not in fact given to Hanly Moir Pathology. In my view it would have been useful if notice had been given, but the terms of their correspondence to the plaintiff's solicitor lead me to think that Hanly
Moir Pathology would make the sections of tissue available if lawfully authorised and required to do so. That company has no apparent interest for or against taking such action, and should not be expected to make samples available or otherwise to deal with the samples except in accordance with lawful authority, bearing in mind that the samples were obtained postmortem on autopsy, apparently under authority obtained under Pt.V of the [Human Tissue
Act 1983](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/hta1983160/). It would have been preferable if Hanly Moir Pathology had been given notice to the application, but the appropriate course is to come to a view about what should be done in their absence, and if any order is to be made which affects them, the order should reserve leave for them to apply to set the order aside if they are so minded.

Upon the power of the Court to make the order counsel first referred to
Pt.4.6. of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and particularly [ss.166](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s166.html), [167](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s167.html), [168](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s168.html) and [169](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s169.html).
In my opinion however those provisions are not applicable to the present facts because, having regard to [s.166](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s166.html), the provisions relate to a request between parties to litigation to do something which requires conduct of the requested party, particularly in subpara (b) of [s.166:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s166.html) "To permit the requesting party, adequately in an appropriate way, to examine, test or copy the whole or a part of the specified document or thing". What the situation requires in this case is not that either of the defendants should request or require something. I am unable to see that they have any legal right to control disposition of the sample; what is required is that Hanly
Moir Pathology make the sample available.

Counsel next referred to Pt.25 r.8 of the Supreme Court Rules, which relates to inspection of property where sufficient relief is not available under [s.169](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s169.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). [Rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s8.html) would authorise orders requiring conduct of persons who are not parties, including inspection, taking samples and making observations and experiments.
 [Rule 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s8.html) refers to "any property" and is extended by subr.(4) thus: "In this rule `property' includes any land and any document or other chattel whether in the ownership, possession, custody or power of a party or not." It is for consideration whether tissue samples or other parts of a dead human body are property. Except in unusual circumstances, rights of ownership do not exist in them; see Doodeward v. Spence <case>; [(1908) 6 CLR 406]; where at 414 Griffith CJ expressed the view that a right to retain possession exists "... when a person has by the lawful exercise of work or skill so dealt with a human body or part of a human body in his lawful possession that it has acquired some attributes differentiating it from a mere corpse awaiting burial ...". This view would justify a right to retain possession of autopsy specimens, especially in this case where the human tissue is fixed in and an accretion to a paraffin block which itself is susceptible of ownership. In my opinion the pathology specimen is property within the general meaning of that term which connotes that property has an owner.

In my opinion however the word "property" in r.8 as extended by subr.(4) is not used so as to require that there be any right of ownership. The rule does not deal with rights of ownership but with adduction of evidence, and it was not significant for the purposes of the rule whether or not there was a right of ownership. In my opinion the autopsy samples are property within the meaning of r.8.

The power in r.8 is discretionary but I approach it with a general disposition favourable to attaining procedural justice by employing the powers of the court to enable litigants to bring forward relevant evidence even if they do not have a legal right to control the disposition of that evidence. This is the ordinary approach to applications for subpoenas which are issued as of course, both for the production of documents and for the attendance of persons. Where there appear to be reasonable grounds for expecting that relevant evidentiary material may be obtained, powers such as these should be exercised; subject however to fair terms to deal with the expense or inconvenience imposed on persons who are not parties.

Counsel representing the second defendant Mrs Urlich made a number of contentions against the orders sought. One contention was to the effect that [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/) prescribes a procedure which the trustee has invoked by giving a notice under subs.(8), conferring an opportunity on the plaintiff to apply under subs.(10) within 28 days, the time prescribed by Pt.70, r.5 of the Supreme Court Rules; and that the plaintiff cannot succeed because he is out of time. I would not finally dispose of such a question on an interlocutory application, but in my opinion the strength of it is very much with the plaintiff; it is unlikely that, on the final disposition of the proceedings, it would be held that a beneficiary is barred if an application is not made under subs.(10) within the time prescribed. The mechanism of s.63 is to authorise action by the trustee and protect a trustee who acts as so authorised; it contains no provision which appears to me to be intended to bar claims, although claims would probably be limited to enforcement against so much property as had not been distributed. The plaintiff's counsel pointed out that the application is brought within the period of three months specified by the Wills [Probate and
Administration
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/) [s.93.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/paaa1898259/s93.html) 
The second defendant's counsel also contended that the Summons was issued and the present application was made after the elapse of so much time that it would be inappropriate to grant the relief sought. He pointed to the difficulties and inconvenience for the second defendant in that at least to some extent distribution must be delayed until entitlement is established.
Further he pointed to the fact that the period of 18 months after death within which she may bring an application for further provision under the [Family
Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) will expire soon. In my opinion these circumstances do not constitute grounds on which I should withhold the court's assistance from the plaintiff.

Counsel also pointed out the inconvenience which might flow to the estate and to the second defendant if the plaintiff were to go further and make a claim under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/), which he would be entitled to do if he made out the allegation that he is the child of the deceased. While it is true that the plaintiff would in that event have a right to apply, and that the mere fact of paternity is itself a claim of a kind for provision, his whole circumstances and the nature of his relationship with the deceased, and the amount which would pass to him on intestacy mean that in practical terms he would have no prospect of obtaining further provision. To prevent that pointless complexity being introduced into the litigation I would make any order on terms that he should undertake not to make an application for further provision.

The second defendant's counsel also referred to ss.10 and 18 of the Children (Equality of Status) Act 1976 and contended that there is a presumption as to parenthood which demonstrates that the plaintiff's contention cannot succeed.

He also asked me to take notice (and I do take notice) of some documents and matters which occurred in proceedings 4046 of 1993. In that case, which related to the estate of the late Chris Pecar the elder, the plaintiff (as did another person) made an application for further provision out of the estate of the deceased. That application was made on the basis that the plaintiff was the son of the late Chris Pecar the elder; the plaintiff said in his affidavit in support of the proceedings: "3. I am the third child of Chris Pecar (my father) ...". This was not disputed and the order was based on it. He did not present a case on the basis that he was an eligible person as being a member of the household. The late Chris Pecar the elder referred to the plaintiff as "my son" in his will, and gave him a benefit in the will; and by his orders of November 1994 McLelland CJ in Eq. made an order in lieu of the provision in the will which increased the provision made.

During argument I commented that, while the possibility was new to me, it may be that the Children (Equality of Status) Act 1976 contemplates or allows for the possibility that a person may be established to be the child of two different fathers and entitled to rights of succession in each case; this would raise a legal conundrum resembling double-legitimacy, the possibility of which has been discussed and considered since medieval times, although it is not clear whether or not it has ever occurred. After further consideration it seems to me that, again speaking at the interlocutory stage and without attempting to dispose of the question finally, the proper interpretation of the Children (Equality of Status) Act is probably that it does assume that a child has only one father, and only one mother, and that the identity of the father is to be established in accordance with the rules prescribed by that
Act. Section 10 creates a presumption as to parenthood where a woman gives birth to a child during her marriage, and this presumption may be rebutted by proof on the balance of probabilities, dealt with by s.18. Having regard to s.18, the case successfully put forward by the plaintiff in the earlier litigation constitutes a considerable difficulty for acceptance of his evidence about statements by deceased persons and reputation in the present litigation; but s.18 leaves open the possibility that he may succeed on this question of fact. These provisions are soon to be replaced by the [Status of
Children Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soca1996199/), which is yet to be proclaimed but will probably commence on 1 January 1997. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soca1996199/s12.html) makes express provision about the effect of findings of paternity in litigation and appears to create a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff is the son of Chris Pecar the elder.

If the litigation is to proceed to trial it would in my opinion be appropriate that the plaintiff, on terms, should have the benefit of an order under Pt.25, r.8 requiring production of part of the tissue samples for expert examination.

However it is yet to be established whether the matter will proceed to trial.
A Notice of Motion for a stay or summary dismissal of the proceedings filed by the first defendant is pending. In the course of the application before me counsel for the second defendant made a number of observations to the effect that it was inappropriate that the litigation should continue because of inconsistency with the holdings in the earlier litigation, although he did not make any clear application. The earlier judgment may operate as an estoppel or otherwise to establish conclusively against all persons the plaintiff's personal status as son of the late Christ Pecar; that is, it may be a judgment in rem. It also requires consideration whether the litigation is to proceed or ought to be stayed as an abuse of process or on the grounds that the allegations on which it is based are scandalous in view of the plaintiff's having made, successfully, an entirely inconsistent allegation in other litigation. The view could reasonably be taken that it would be a scandal if he were to succeed in claims based on paternity in the estates of two different deceased men. The power of the court to stay proceedings is shown by authorities stemming from Reichel v. Magrath <case>; [[1982] AC .] 
The law was reviewed and applied by the Court of Appeal of England in Smith v. Linskills & Anor [[1996] 1 WLR 763], where the parties to the second litigation were not privy to the first litigation. In that case, and characteristically of the reported cases, the party who was restrained from making an allegation had made it in the earlier litigation and had suffered an adverse finding. The plaintiff made and based his case in the earlier litigation on an allegation entirely contrary to the allegation on which this case is based, and succeeded unopposed. This appears to me to make the present case stronger than the reported cases. The case law was also reviewed in Haines v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation & Ors (David
Hunt CJ at CL, 21 July 1995, unreported,) and his Honour said at page 15 that the issue must be one which the party propounding lost in the former case. The context suggests that David Hunt CJ at CL had in view the person who will be restrained not the subject of the restraint. In my opinion it is an event greater abuse to adopt the contrary position to one on which the litigant has earlier succeeded.

It is not essential for the exercise of this power that the parties to the litigation which is stayed should have been privy to the earlier litigation.
The authorities are discussed and commented on extensively in Mr Justice
Handley's forthcoming 3rd edition of Spencer Bower "The Doctrine of Estoppel by Res Judicata". I have had access to proofs; see Ch.26 "The extended doctrine of res judicata" at p352 and following.

Accordingly I am of the view that I should defer disposing of the present application until it is known whether the proceedings are to go any further.

Order: 
The plaintiff's Notice of Motion of 4 November 1996 is stood over generally with liberty to restore it for hearing on five days' notice after disposition of the First Defendant's Notice of Motion of 4 November 1996.
