JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (On claim of privilege by Ms Brenda Duchen in respect of components of client file - T4457) HIS HONOUR: A subpoena was served on Ms Brenda Duchen, solicitor, by the solicitors for the plaintiff on 16 February 2000.
 Access has been granted to the material produced by Ms Duchen. However, by letter dated 24 February 2000, Miss Duchen advised that privilege had not been waived by her three relevant clients and three documents have been isolated by her as material in respect of which she particularly asserts non waiver.
 The documents, on my perusal of them, appear clearly to record legal advice, and I will decline inspection.
 The documents will be retained and kept in a confidential, sealed envelope.
