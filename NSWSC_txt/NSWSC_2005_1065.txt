BARRETT J  
FRIDAY, 21 OCTOBER 2005  /04 AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION versus ELM FINANCIAL SERVICES PTY LTD & 11 ORS  
JUDGMENT  I have already made, by consent of the plaintiff (Australian Securities and
Investments Commission) and the defendants concerned, declarations of contravention and consequential orders against the ninth, eleventh and twelfth defendants in these proceedings: see Australian Securities and Investments
Commission versus Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd & Ors  <case> (11 October 2005); Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus Elm
Financial Services Pty Ltd & Ors  <case> (13 October 2005). I am now asked by ASIC and by each of the tenth defendant (Duncan Grant McCartney) and the eighth defendant (Dennis Terracini) to make consent declarations and consequential orders in respect of each such defendant.  As previously, statements of agreed facts have been tendered. The facts agreed by ASIC and Mr McCartney are contained in Exhibit M1. The agreed facts in relation to Mr Dennis Terracini are in Exhibit DT1. I have adopted the course outlined in the first of the earlier judgments with a view to deciding whether, on the basis of the agreed facts, this court is, in each case, satisfied that the statutory conditions for the making of declarations of contravention have been met.  In relation to Mr McCartney, the agreed facts establish that he was, at material times, an "officer" of each of Elm Financial Services Pty Ltd, Elm
Nominees Pty Ltd, Elm Management Pty Ltd, Elm Property Pty Ltd and E Star
Redfern Pty Ltd; that each of those companies contravened provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (in particular, Elm Financial Services and E Star Redfern together committed one contravention of [s.727(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html),
Elm Financial Services and Elm Nominees together committed two contraventions of [s.727(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html),
Elm Financial Services together with Fletcher Securities Pty Ltd together committed one contravention of [s.727(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html),
Elm Financial Services and Elm Nominees committed one contravention of [s.601ED(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ed.html),
Elm Financial Services alone committed one contravention of [s.601ED(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ed.html),
Elm Financial Services and E Star Redfern together committed two contraventions of ss.995(2), 999 and 1000(1)(a) - plus, in the case of Elm
Financial Services and E Star Redfern, [ss.1041E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041e.html), [1041F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041f.html)(1)(a) and [1041H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041h.html)(1) - Elm Financial Services and Elm Property together with Fletcher Securities
Pty Ltd together committed one contravention of [ss.1041E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041e.html), [1041F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041f.html)(1)(a) and [1041H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041h.html)(1) and Elm Financial Services alone committed two contraventions of [s.912A(1)(f))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s912a.html); that Mr McCartney, while an officer of the relevant company committing a contravention, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention; and that Mr McCartney thereby himself contravened [ss.180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) and [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html)(1) imposing duties upon officers.  I turn to Mr Terracini. The statement of agreed facts shows him to have been at material times an officer of each of Elm Financial Services, Elm Nominees,
Elm Management, Elm Property, Fletcher Securities, E Star Redfern and E Star
Surry Hills Pty Ltd. It also shows that he was himself a "providing entity" within the meaning of [ss.945A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s945a.html) and [946A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s946a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). The statement of agreed facts in relation to Mr Terracini refers to all of the contraventions by companies appearing in the statement concerning Mr McCartney plus a number of other contraventions, being a contravention by Elm Financial
Services of [s.945A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s945a.html), a contravention by Elm Financial Services and E Star Redfern together of [ss.1041E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041e.html), [1041F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041f.html)(1)(a) and [1041H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041h.html)(1) and four contraventions by Elm Financial Services alone of the last-mentioned sections. There is also reference in the agreed facts to contraventions by individuals (other than Mr Terracini) involved in the companies' activities.
It is shown by the agreed facts that Mr Terracini failed to take reasonable steps to prevent contraventions (both those by companies and those by individuals); also that Mr Terracini misused the authority he had over individuals. Resultant contraventions by Mr Terracini of [ss.180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) and [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html)(1) concerning duties of officers are accordingly established.  ASIC and each of the defendants has agreed that that defendant should be subjected to disqualification from managing corporations. In the case of Mr
McCartney, ASIC and he ask that orders be made causing him to be disqualified for a period of five years. In the case of Mr Dennis Terracini, the request made by ASIC and him is that he be disqualified permanently. It is proposed that Mr McCartney be ordered to pay costs of $50,000 (by instalments) and that
Mr Terracini be ordered to pay costs of the same amount (also by instalments) as well as paying $150,000 to the administrators of deeds of company arrangement entered into by the Elm companies, such payment to be made within eighteen months.  On the basis of the agreed facts, I am satisfied that the several alleged contraventions have been committed by each of Mr McCartney and Mr Terracini.
Declarations of contravention will be made accordingly.  As to disqualification, it can be said in the case of Mr McCartney that his wrong-doing is, in general terms, commensurate with that of other defendants in respect of whom disqualification for five years has been found appropriate.
An order leading to disqualification of Mr McCartney for the same period is warranted.  Mr Terracini's wrong-doing is of a more serious kind. He was the managing director of the Elm group and occupied a position of authority and influence in the conduct of its affairs. He therefore carried a particular responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure that those affairs were conducted in accordance with the law and in an honest way. He failed conspicuously to discharge that responsibility and has shown himself deserving of a more onerous sanction than that imposed upon the other defendants. I am satisfied that he should be disqualified permanently from managing corporations and that he should be ordered to make available the agreed funds which may go some way towards repairing the damage investors have suffered.  These proceedings arose from flagrant and systematic disregard for fundamental investor protection laws. While no aspect of those laws should, in the abstract, be regarded as more important than any other, I do wish to make particular comment on the scant regard that was paid to a relatively new provision, being [s.708(10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s708.html) which creates an exception to the requirement for disclosure to investors under [s.707.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s707.html) [Section (10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s708.html) is as follows:  "An offer of a body's securities does not need disclosure to investors under this Part if:  the offer is made through a financial services licensee; and  the licensee is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person to whom the offer is made has previous experience in investing in securities that allows them to assess:  the merits of the offer; and  the value of the securities; and  the risks involved in accepting the offer; and  their own information needs; and  the adequacy of the information given by the person making the offer; and  the licensee gives the person before, or at the time when, the offer is made a written statement of the licensee's reasons for being satisfied as to those matters; and  the person to whom the offer is made signs a written acknowledgment before, or at the time when, the offer is made that the licensee has not given the person a disclosure document under this Part in relation to the offer."  This is, as I have said, a relatively new provision. There was significant debate about it when its introduction was mooted. It was recognised at the time and must be re-emphasised now that [s.708(10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s708.html) casts particular responsibility upon a financial services licensee. The requirement that the licensee be "satisfied on reasonable grounds" as to the matters stated in [s.708(10)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s708.html) is one that must be approached with diligence and care. The licensee has a statutory duty to make inquiry about all matters relevant to the opinion it must form and then, of course, to consider whether, in the factual circumstances, there exist the reasonable grounds for it to be satisfied as to the matters stated. Woolly thinking about some general concept of "sophisticated investor" is entirely misplaced.  I mention this matter because it is made clear by the agreed facts that the licensed Elm companies were content to consider [s.708(10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s708.html) applicable where even the most cursory attention to the statutory criteria would have made it immediately clear that there were no reasonable grounds for forming the relevant opinions about the relevant investors.  Mr Terracini has given an undertaking to ASIC under s.93AA of the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth). A copy of this is Exhibit DT2. Mr Terracini is prepared to undertake to the court that he will comply with his s.93AA undertaking.  In relation to Duncan Grant McCartney (the tenth defendant), the court makes by consent the declarations and orders set out in the First Schedule to these reasons.  In relation to Dennis Terracini (the eighth defendant), the court makes by consent the declarations and orders set out in the Second Schedule to these reasons and notes and accepts the undertaking set out in that schedule.  I direct that Exhibits M1, DT1 and DT2 be retained as part of the record of these proceedings.
