EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (REVISED)
The current offender has offered to give evidence against a number of people who the evidence suggests would be motivated and capable of doing her and her family harm.
Her mother has just given evidence and in the course of doing so a medical certificate was tendered which has an address of a medical practice in a suburb in Sydney. It is necessary to protect the family of the now offender and would-be witness and is, in terms of the [Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/) , necessary to make an order to protect the safety of the offender's family and in particular the mother who was the last witness to give evidence.
Accordingly, I order that the address nominated in exhibit AC2 will be suppressed until further order of the Court.
