JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Section 10A enables an application to be made by a party for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for an order under <case> of the Act for the assessment by the Court as to the value of proceeds derived from illegal activities.
The application is supported by an application of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 December 2013. In that affidavit Mr Spark who is an authorised officer as defined in section 4(1) of the Act deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or crime related activities, being the offence of supplying prohibited drugs contrary to [sections 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) and [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html)(2) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/). Offences under [section 25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of that Act are serious criminal offences as defined in [sections 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph 4 of his affidavit. I have read the material in the affidavit and the documents annexed to it. 
Mr Spark has deposed to obtaining from the police officer who prepared the fact sheet his agreement that it was prepared by that officer, that the contents of it were true to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief and that the matters in the fact sheet were prepared based on the information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the fact sheet.
I am satisfied from having read the fact sheet and the other documents, that the suspicion formed by Mr Spark has been formed on reasonable grounds.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act requires the Court to make an order if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 
I am further satisfied as [section 10A(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) requires by the material annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and that some of the property in respect of which the restraining order is sought is situated in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed which property can be disposed of or transferred I do not consider that the Defendant should be given notice of this application before an order is made. I am also aware that Mr Spark long experience in this area. 
The Defendant has the ability to apply to the Court under [section 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) for a review of any order that is made to the party. 
In those circumstances I make orders contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the draft orders provided to me, I grant the leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 3 and 5. * * *
