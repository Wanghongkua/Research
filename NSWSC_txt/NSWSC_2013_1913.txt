JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst, as here, there is an application pending for an explained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the Act. 
The application is made in respect of the Defendant who is the sister of the person said to have committed particular offences which amount to serious crime related activity. 
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 12 December 2013. In that affidavit Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer as defined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s4.html) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that Van Tan Nguyen has engaged in a serious crime related activity, or serious crime related activities, being the offences of supplying a prohibited drug, knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, both contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), and the supply of a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to [s 25A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25a.html) of that Act. Those offences are all serious criminal offences as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s6.html) of the Act. 
The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph 5 of his affidavit. In particular Mr Spark received a facts sheet from the investigating officer. Mr Spark ascertained from that officer that the officer had prepared the facts sheet, that he believed it to be true and correct, and that it had been prepared on the basis of investigation carried out into the activities of Van Tan Nguyen. 
I have read all of the material contained in the facts sheet, and also the additional material that is exhibited to Mr Spark's affidavit. I am satisfied that the suspicion that Mr Spark has is one that is held by him on reasonable grounds. Section 10A(5) of the Act requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. 
I am further satisfied that <case> requires from that material that the Defendant is domiciled in New South Wales, and that the relevant property is also situated in New South Wales. 
Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the Defendant before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence of the speed and manner in which property can be disposed of, I do not consider the Defendant should be given notice of the application before the order is made. The Defendant has available rights under s10C of the Act to seek a review of the ex parte order made. 
Accordingly I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3, 5, 7 and 8 of the draft order, and I grant leave and liberty contained in paragraphs 4 and 6. * * *
