EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, who is the Attorney General for the state of New South Wales, seeks an order under ss 32 and 33 of the Evidence on Commission Act 1995. It does so by summons filed 18 May which is supported by the affidavit of Joanne Mooney filed on the same date. The affidavit has annexed to it a variety of documents which establish that there has been a request by the government of the Slovak Republic and particularly the Kosice District Court for certain evidence to be taken in the manner requested. That satisfies the provisions of <case>(a) of the Act.
The evidence of Ms Mooney also establishes that proceedings have been commenced in that country, they being proceedings relating to what will be argued to be over payments of the equivalent of maintenance to a child, the child having left that jurisdiction without telling the person who can, at least in this jurisdiction, be described as the plaintiff.
The affidavit also annexes a series of questions which on their face appear to indicate with particularity the kind of evidence that is being sought and appear to be relevant to the nature of the proceedings that have been brought in the Slovak Republic. I note in passing that question D which commences with the words "Please describe your personal situation" may be a little on the broad side but what follows indicates what is really being sought which is the witness's income and so forth.
I am satisfied that the orders that should be made and accordingly I make orders in accordance with the short minutes of order provided by the plaintiff.
