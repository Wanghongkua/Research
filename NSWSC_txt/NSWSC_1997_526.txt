Tsep Pty Ltd versus Pest Free Australia Pty Ltd and Ors Matter No 4472/97 [1997] NSWSC 526 (29 October 1997) 
Tsep Pty Ltd versus Pest Free Australia Pty Ltd & Ors /97 October 1997 
Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /97 TSEP PTY LTD versus PEST FREE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD & ORS 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application for an interim injunction. The plaintiff's case is very weak at the moment and if the situation were as the plaintiff says it is then one would have expected the court to have before it the statutory records of the first defendant. As they are not here, one can only conclude that they could not assist the plaintiff's case. 
On the material presently before the court, the plaintiff is not a shareholder of the first defendant. The best the plaintiff can say is that there is an agreement between the plaintiff and the second defendant or possibly the first defendant that if certain things happened it would be allotted 20 per cent of the shares in the first defendant company. Unless there were some other facts, it would seem to me that that would only sound in damages.

On the material before me at the moment, it is not a case for an injunction.
Accordingly, I refuse the interim relief. The proceedings are to continue by way of pleadings, the evidence to be by affidavit. Duly verified statement of claim to be filed and served no later than 5 November 1997 and thereafter pleadings in accordance with the rules save that the verified defence may be filed and served on or before 26 November 1997.

The proceedings should stand over to the Registrar's list at 9.30 am on 1
December 1997. I note that the defendant will file an appearance during the day. The plaintiff must pay the defendants' costs of the interim application today.
