JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
Austin J  September 2003  /2001 HEGGIES BULKHAUL LIMITED versus GLOBAL MINERALS AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: Heggies Bulkhaul Ltd ("HBL") is in possession of and currently operates a gravel and sand mining facility known as Penrose Quarry on land held under the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) by
Global Minerals Australia Pty Ltd ("Global"). The land comprises lots 1, 2, 3, and 5 in Deposited Plan No 253462. HBL was in possession of the quarry under a registered lease No 691505 ("the old lease") for a term of five years terminating on 9 November 2000. The old lease contained three options to renew for periods of 11 years each. The lessor was Australian Machinery
Equipment Sales Pty Ltd ("AMES"), but it transferred the land to Global by memoranda of transfer dated 8 December 1999, registered on 2 May 2000.  By its fourth further amended summons filed on 25 June 2003, HBL seeks relief of four kinds. First, it seeks declaratory orders as to the existence of, and an order for specific performance of, an agreement for a new lease of the quarry for a further term of 11 years commencing on 10 November 2000 on substantially the same terms as the old lease (subject to minor variations specified in the summons). It does so on two alternative grounds: first, it contends that an agreement for a new lease arose because it validly exercised the first option to renew under the old lease; secondly, it argues that in fact there was an agreement for a new lease made on or about 20 September
In either event, HBL contends that it has an equitable interest as lessee under an agreement for a new lease, although a new registered lease has not been granted to it.  Secondly, HBL seeks declarations that Global is not entitled to re-enter the land or terminate the agreement for the new lease or its equitable interest as lessee under that agreement. Specifically, it contends (contrary to the allegations of Global) that it is not in breach of any obligations under the old lease or the agreement for a new lease with respect to:  the payment of royalties due during the term of the old lease;  the payment of royalties due during the term of the agreement for a new lease;  its obligations to restore or rehabilitate the land under the agreement for a new lease;  any conditions of consent relating to the use of the quarry.  Thirdly, in the event that it is found to have breached any of its obligations under the old lease or the agreement for a new lease, HBL seeks to be relieved from forfeiture. Fourthly, HBL seeks to recover the sum of $295,778.73.  Global has made a cross-claim, but on the final day of the hearing, 1 July , some of the relief it previously sought was abandoned. The cross-claim current at the time of the final hearing was the amended cross-claim filed on May 2002. Global there sought a declaration that the purported exercise of the option by HBL was invalid; and also declaratory relief and other orders on the ground that if the agreement for a new lease were otherwise enforceable against it, HBL breached the terms of the agreement, and that as a result of these breaches Global was entitled to re-enter the property and to recover damages. The breaches alleged in the cross-claim were:  failure to carry out restoration and rehabilitation work, as particularised;  failure to pay royalties in the sum of $1 million accrued during the period 11 November 1995 to 1 May 2002;  carrying out unauthorised works, principally in relation to Area 10;  failure to provide various notices and consents, by the Environment
Protection Agency and the Department of Mineral Resources of New South Wales;  failure to take out and maintain public liability insurance for at least $10 million, and to provide evidence of renewal of a public liability policy;  failure to provide monthly sales statements;  failure to maintain the weighbridge and keep it in accurate working condition;  failure to indemnify Global in respect of GST payable on royalty payments since 1 November 2000;  refusing Global's agent entry upon the land for inspection.  The summons and cross-claim raised nine issues, which I articulated at the beginning of the hearing in December 2001: 
Did HBL validly exercise the first option to renew the old lease? 
Did HBL enter into a valid and enforceable agreement for a new lease of the quarry on about 20 September 1999? 
Did HBL fail to pay royalties due under the old lease or (if there is one) the agreement for a new lease? 
Did HBL fail to carry out restoration and rehabilitation works to the site, as required by the old lease or the agreement for a new lease? 
Did HBL fail to comply with Council requirements either by mining in unauthorised areas or by carrying out mining works in a manner not authorised by the Council and in breach of the relevant development consents, contrary to the requirements of the old lease or the agreement for a new lease? 
Did HBL fail to comply with other miscellaneous requirements of the old lease or the agreement for a new lease? 
Assuming there is an agreement for a new lease, is Global entitled to re- enter the land and determine HBL's interest in the agreement, and to claim damages? 
If so, is HBL entitled to relief against forfeiture? 
Is HBL entitled to recover from Global the sum of $295,778.73 [as revised in June 2003]?  The case has had an unfortunate history. It first came before me in the
Expedition List in June 2001, and after various directions hearings, I set it down for final hearing before me for a period of five days in December 2001, relying on the estimate of counsel. As the case developed at the hearing in
December 2001, the estimate of counsel proved substantially inaccurate, and it was necessary to adjourn the case, part heard, to April 2002.  In April and May 2002 there were developments more fully described in my judgment published on 10 May 2002 (Heggies Bulkhaul Ltd versus Global Minerals
Australia Pty Ltd  <case> Although more may have to be said later, when I come to deal with the question of costs, for present purposes it is enough to say that Global claimed to have discovered, in the days before the hearing resumed in April , that HBL had given it inaccurate information pertaining to the calculation of royalties, pursuant to orders made by the Court in October
It appeared that substantial quantities of clay may have been removed from the quarry and supplied to Wingecarribee Shire Council, without payment of royalties.  Eventually, after hearing evidence about the "clay issue", and evidence about some other discrepancies relating to weighbridge dockets, I granted
Global's application to vacate the remaining hearing dates, and I made orders for the appointment of a court expert under Part 39 of the Supreme Court Rules to report on stated questions. The expert reported in December 2002, and after further directions hearings, the case returned to me, for resumption of the part-heard final hearing, on 25, 26 and 27 June and 1 July 2003.  Final submissions were presented under the nine headings that I had set out in December 2001. However, it emerged from Global's final submissions that the only issues remaining in contention were numbers (1), (2), (3) (but only in limited respects), (7) (but only in the sense that, according to Global's final submissions, HBL is in occupation under a tenancy at will determinable upon one month's notice, and in those circumstances a right of re-entry does not arise), and (9). Global contended in its final submissions that issue (8) did not arise, and it conceded that no breach by HBL had been established in respect of its restoration and rehabilitation obligations, in respect of unauthorised activities, and in respect of the other miscellaneous matters raised in the cross-claim. The concessions are very significant, because a great deal of the evidence at the various components of the final hearing had been directed towards Global's allegations of breaches of those kinds.  Consequently the issues that I must now determine are within a relatively narrow focus. I shall do so, following the headings articulated in December
However, at the hearing the submissions under heading (2) identified two separate questions, namely whether HBL entered into a valid agreement for a new lease with AMES in 1999, and whether, if it did, it can now enforce that agreement against Global. I have altered the heading to reflect those two questions.  
Ownership and control of AMES and Global  The directors of AMES at all relevant times were Wayne Stafford, his brother Garry Stafford, and George Kekatos. The shareholders were Wayne and
Garry Stafford, Wayne's wife Rhonda Stafford, Wayne's father, and Mr Kekatos.
The directors of Global were, until recently, Susan Stafford (Garry's wife),
Rhonda Stafford and Voula Kekatos (George's wife), although George Kekatos has recently replaced Susan Stafford as a director. Wayne Stafford had the day-to- day management of Global until very recently, when Global was placed in receivership and voluntary administration. Mr Kekatos was the chief financial officer of Global.  Wayne Stafford has had a close and long-standing involvement in the operation of the quarry. With his brother and his father he commenced operations at the quarry in the 1980s. After the land was leased to HBL in , Wayne Stafford assisted HBL in its operations by developing new products, increasing the customer base and also assisting with the Eagle
Classifying Plant. Such was Mr Stafford's involvement that it is appropriate to infer, and I do infer, that any knowledge that came to him at any time relevant to this proceeding was knowledge of AMES; and in the period commencing on 8 December 1999 when the land was transferred to Global, any knowledge of Mr Stafford was knowledge of Global.  
Did HBL validly exercise the first option to renew the old lease?  By Clause 2 of the old lease, the Lessor devised the Land to the Lessee for the Term in consideration of the payment of the Royalties by the Lessee payable pursuant to the Lease, and granted the Lessee various rights and privileges for working the land as a quarry. Clause 3 of the old lease required HBL to pay the Lessor Royalties calculated in the manner set out in the clause. Clause 3.03 prescribed an annual Minimum Royalty for each of the five years of the Term of the Lease. Clause 3.04 provided for a New Rate to be determined by a review conducted on each of the Review Dates during the Term of the Lease, to be the greater of the Basic Royalty and an amount representing 12.5% of the average sale price of Minerals. Each of the words beginning with a capital letter is a defined term, but it is unnecessary to explore the definitions for present purposes.  Clause 8 of the old lease, dealing with the first option to renew the old lease, was in the following terms:  "8. FIRST OPTION  .01 If the Lessee shall desire to take a renewed lease of the Land for a term of Eleven (11) years and shall give to the Lessor previous notice of such desire not less than three months and no more than six months prior to the expiration of the term of this Lease and provided the Lessee is not then in default under the provisions of this Lease whether express or implied the
Lessor will at the cost and expense of the Lessee grant to the Lessee a renewal of this Lease for a further term of Eleven (11) years upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in this current Lease with the exception of this Clause and provided however that the Prevailing Rate for determining the Royalties payable pursuant to Clause 3 of this Lease for the first year of the renewed lease shall be determined as set out in Clause 8.02 of this Lease as at and effective on the date of commencement of the first option period as if such date were a date of review under this lease PROVIDED THAT Clause 3.03 shall not apply during the first option period.  .02 The Prevailing Rate for determination of the Royalties payable for the first year of the commencement of the first option period shall be the New
Rate determined pursuant to Clause 3.04 of this Lease as at and effective on the date of commencement of the first option period multiplied by the Standard
Quantity as if such date were a review date under this Lease. Rent reviews shall thereafter take place in accordance with Clause 3.04 of the Lease on the
Review Dates."  On 7 September 1999 Mr Kekatos wrote on behalf of AMES to Phillip Breeze, as managing director of HBL. The letter was headed "Exercise of Option Lease
No 691505 Penrose Quarry". Mr Kekatos referred in the letter to clause 8.01, and proceeded:  "However the Lessor hereby confirms and agrees that it hereby waives the restriction on the early exercise of the Option of Renewal contained in Clause .01 of the Lease and hereby consents to the said earlier exercise of the
Option for Renewal."  The letter also referred to the rent review provisions of clause 8.02 of the lease, and confirmed that there would be no increase in the current rate of royalty payment upon the exercise of the option of renewal, for the first year of the term of the renewed lease. The letter invited HBL to forward a formal notice of exercise. Wayne Stafford, who was a director of AMES, gave evidence that AMES requested the early exercise of the option, so that it could tell its bank that it had a further long-term lease of the property.  On 17 September 1999 Mr Breeze on behalf of HBL wrote to Mr Kekatos of
AMES, saying:  "Following your agreement to waive Clause 8.01 and allow the Option to be exercised at today's date, HBL hereby gives notice of exercise of the first option to renew."  The letter did not specifically refer to the proposal regarding clause .02, but since Mr Breeze's letter was in reply to AMES' letter of 7 September and purported to take up the offer to exercise the option early, it is appropriate to infer (and I do infer) that the letter of 17 September accepted
AMES' offer regarding clause 8.02.  Mr Breeze wrote to Mr Kekatos again on 20 September 1999, referring to his letter of 17 September and confirming "full details of our discussions and subsequent agreement". The letter asserted that (1) agreement had been reached to waive clause 8.01, allowing HBL to give notice of exercise of the first option at 17 September, and (2) in clause 3.04(b) the reference to 12.5% was to be replaced with 11%. The letter then said:  "Subject to your written confirmation of the second point, HBL gives notice of exercise of the first option to renew effective from November 2000."  On 20 September 1999 Mr Kekatos wrote to Mr Breeze referring to Mr Breeze's letters of 17 and 20 September (incorrectly designated "June") and confirmed "the Company's acceptance of the that exercise" [sic]. The letter said that
AMES would instruct its solicitors to prepare and submit the renewal lease in due course. The letter continued:  "Further the Company hereby confirms that in consideration of the above early exercise of the Option of Renewal [and provided that your company continues to observe all the terms and conditions of the lease from the date hereof including the continuing obligation to pay the royalty reserved in accordance with the lease] then the Company agrees to the amendment of Clause 3.04(b) of the lease by the removal of '12.5%' in that clause and replacement with '11%' effective from this date forth."  It will be seen that in this correspondence, the parties to the old lease departed from the provisions of clause 8.01 concerning the exercise of the option to renew. They did so in three respects:  in relation to the time for exercise of the option (clause 8.01), which was brought forward;  in relation to the rate of royalty payment for the first year of the term of the renewed lease (clause 8.02), which was not to be increased above the current rate;  in relation to the terms of the lease to be granted, in that Clause 3.04 would be amended so that the percentage rate to be used in calculating royalties was to be varied from 12.5% to 11%.  Global submitted that in light of these departures, the arrangement the parties reached was not exercise of the option contained in the old lease; rather, it was an arrangement under which the parties, by a process of counter-offer and acceptance, reached a new agreement for lease. I agree with this submission.  In Gilbert J McCaul (Aust) Pty Ltd versus Pitt Club Limited (1959) 59 SR 122, an option to renew a lease was expressed to be conditional upon punctual payment of rent during the term. The lessee had frequently failed to pay rent punctually, but nevertheless purported to exercise the option for renewal. The
Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that the option had not been validly exercised. Their Honours said (at 123-4):  "In the present case the lessor irrevocably offered to grant a lease. Its offer prescribed the time and manner for acceptance. Only by performing the conditions prescribed could it be accepted and result in an agreement for lease. A purported acceptance without performance of the prescribed conditions would not and could not be an acceptance of the offer. It would in reality be a counter offer by the original offeree requiring acceptance by the original offeror if an agreement were to result."  (These observations assumed the "irrevocable offer" theory of options, but it seems to me that the outcome would be the same if the "conditional agreement" theory were applied.)  In my opinion a similar analysis applies where a lessee purports to exercise an option subject to a condition to the effect that the terms of the new lease be different from what is prescribed in the option clause. The lessee's notice cannot be acceptance of the lessor's offer to grant a new lease (or satisfaction of the conditions of the agreement to do so), and must in reality be a counter-offer which the lessor is free to accept or reject.  For present purposes a distinction between two situations must be borne in mind. In the first situation, the parties to a lease validly amend the terms of the lease and then the lessee exercises the option to renew the amended lease. There has been a valid exercise of the option to renew the lease, although the lease which is renewed has been amended. In the second situation, the lessee purports to exercise an option to renew the lease conditionally upon the lessor agreeing to an amendment that will apply in the renewed term.
The lessor agrees to the amendment and to the renewed term. In the second situation, the correct analysis is that there has been no renewal of the lease, but instead, the lessee has offered to take a new lease on terms not identical with the lease that would arise upon exercise of the option. The lessor has accepted the lessee's offer to take a new lease on those different terms, and so an agreement to grant a new lease has arisen.  In my opinion the present facts contain elements of, and variations to, those two situations. The offer to allow early exercise of the option and keep to the current royalty rate for the first year of the renewed term came from
AMES, by its letter of 7 September 1999. HBL was given the opportunity to agree to the variation of clause 8.01 prior to exercising the option under the varied clause. By its letter of 17 September, HBL purported to accept the variation of clause 8.01 to allow early exercise, and then forthwith to give notice of exercise of the option pursuant to the amended clause. By implication, it accepted the offer to vary clause 8.02 to maintain the current royalty rate for the first year of the renewed term.  Thus, it appears from these two letters that the parties agreed to vary the terms of the existing lease prior to the exercise of the option, and immediately thereafter the option was exercised. If there were nothing more to the facts, this would be an example of the first situation, and there would have been a valid exercise of the first option to renew the old lease (as varied prior to exercise).  However, it appears that there were some additional discussions, confirmed in HBL's letter of 20 September but not appearing in its letter of 17
September. The additional discussions led to an agreement between HBL and AMES to vary clause 3.04(b) for the renewed term, by replacing 12.5% with 11%.  It is not clear from the evidence whether the arrangements to alter the percentage royalty rate in clause 3.04(b) were reached, in discussions, before or after HBL's letter of 17 September, though clearly enough to discussions reached their conclusion before HBL's letter of 20 September. If the discussions were concluded before 17 September, then HBL's letter of that date did not completely reflect the arrangements between the parties and may not have amounted to a valid exercise of the option to renew at the unamended royalty rate. If the discussions about the royalty rate were not concluded until after 17 September, then the letter of 17 September would appear to have been a valid exercise of the option to renew the lease at the old royalty rate.  It seems to me, however, that it does not matter whether the discussions about the revised royalty rate were concluded before or after the letter of 17
September. If the letter of 17 September gave rise to a valid exercise of the option to renew at the old percentage royalty rate, that renewal was revoked by the correspondence of 20 September. HBL's letter of 20 September, properly construed, was an offer to exercise the option upon a new basis, namely the basis that the percentage royalty rate in clause 3.04(b) be amended from 12.5% to 11%. That letter was not an offer to amend the agreement for a renewed lease that had arisen out of the prior exercise of the option, because in its terms, the letter offered a fresh exercise of the option to renew, subject to
AMES' agreement to the amended percentage royalty rate as well as to early exercise. It was that new offer that AMES accepted by its letter of the same date.  Thus, on 20 September 1999 there was an offer of a new lease on certain terms by HBL to AMES, and acceptance of that offer, creating an agreement for a new lease. Notwithstanding some of the language of HBL's letter and later correspondence, there was no exercise of the existing option for renewal.  
Did HBL enter into a valid agreement for a new lease of the quarry on about 20 September 1999, and if so, is the agreement now enforceable against Global?  Global conceded that the correspondence summarised above gave rise to a new agreement for lease, though it was not an exercise of the option contained in the old lease. So much is clear from the terms of the correspondence itself.  The new agreement for lease was between HBL and AMES. It was an agreement for a lease for 11 years, commencing 10 November 2000, on the same terms and conditions as if HBL had exercised the option, subject to replacing 12.5% with % in clause 3.04(b). It was in writing, and there is no reason to suggest that it would not have been enforceable by HBL against AMES, assuming there was no breach by HBL entitling AMES to terminate. The more difficult question is whether the new agreement is now enforceable by HBL against Global, as the present registered proprietor of the land.  Later in these reasons for judgment I shall consider some evidence to the effect that HBL and AMES agreed to vary the payment terms of the old lease during its currency. These agreements were to the effect that:  * the lessor would not be entitled to any royalty is in respect of "clay" sold by HBL to Wingecarribee Shire Council;  * the Standard Quantity of Minerals, after which the Further Royalty was payable, would be increased from 250,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes (referred to in some evidence as the "holiday tonnes" arrangement); and  * the reduction in the percentage royalty rate payable under clause 3.04(b) from 12.5% to 11%, agreed in connection with the new lease, would take effect during the term of the old lease.  The agreement for a new lease incorporated the variations to payment obligations that had been agreed between AMES and HBL. As with the obligation to grant a new lease, there is a difficult question whether any of these variations agreed between HBL and AMES are enforceable against Global.  AMES transferred its reversionary interest in the property to Global on 8
December 1999. The transfers were registered on 2 May 2000. Wayne Stafford gave evidence explaining that the transfers were made after the National
Australia Bank had called up a loan to AMES which had been guaranteed by the directors and shareholders.  There are analytically two grounds of upon which HBL contends that the agreement for a new lease, incorporating variations of the payment terms, is enforceable against Global. First, HBL says that [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) permits it to enforce AMES' contractual obligation to grant a new lease against Global, notwithstanding the law of privy of contract. Secondly, HBL submits that Global holds its interest in the land subject to HBL's unregistered equitable interest under the agreement, having regard to principles of priority between competing interests and proprietary estoppel, or that it is prevented from denying HBL's claim to a new lease by an estoppel by convention. I shall consider these two grounds in turn.  The two grounds are not entirely unrelated, although their connection is difficult. Problems arise because [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) stems from 16th century English legislation operating in a system of common law title, upon which the more modern concept of title by registration under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) has been superimposed, and subsequently the old provision has been substantially re- enacted without clarification of its role in the registered title system.  [Section 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html)  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) is in the following terms:  "The obligation of a covenant entered into by a lessor with reference to the subject-matter of the lease shall, if and as far as the lessor has power to bind the reversionary estate immediately expectant on the term granted by the lease, be annexed and incident to, and shall go with that reversionary estate, or the several parts thereof, notwithstanding severance of that reversionary estate, and may be taken advantage of and enforced by the person in whom the term is from time to time vested by conveyance, devolution in law, or otherwise, and if and as far as the lessor has power to bind the person from time to time entitled to that reversionary estate, the obligation aforesaid may be taken advantage of and enforced against any person so entitled."  Subsection (2) makes it clear that the section applies to leases made after the commencement of the Act.  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s6.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) states that "except as hereinafter provided, this Act, so far as inconsistent with the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), shall not apply to lands, whether freehold or leasehold, which are under the provisions of that Act." However, there is a more specific provision in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s116.html), which overrides <case> for present purposes. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s116.html) states that "the provisions of this Part [Part 8, which includes [s ]](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) shall apply to leases and sub-leases of land under the provisions of the [Real
Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), notwithstanding anything in that Act contained."  The implications of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s116.html) will be explored later. At this stage it should be noted, however, that [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s40.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) replicates [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) to a certain extent. It provides, inter alia, that the registered proprietor is to be regarded as being seized of the reversion expectant upon any registered lease, and is subject to the covenants and conditions expressed to be performed on the part of the lessor. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) seems to have a wider operation in two respects, as regards [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) land: first, it is not ex facie confined to registered leases; and secondly, it extends the right of enforcement to an assignee or other person in whom the term is vested.  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) derives from the statute 32 Hen VIII c 34, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s2.html) (the
Grantees of Reversions Act 1540). The common law did not allow a covenant to run with the reversion, except to the extent that the assignee of the reversion was permitted to sue upon those implied covenants that resulted from the fact of demise: Wedd versus Porter [[1916] 2 KB 91.] The statute of altered the common law, giving lessees and their assigns the same rights and remedies against grantees of the reversion, for breach of any covenant or condition of the lease, as they might have had against the lessor: see GP
Stuckey, The Conveyancing Act 1919-1969 with Annotations (2nd ed, 1970), p
But the section gave rise to a number of difficulties. It was held to apply only where the original lease was by deed, on the principle that agreements by parol are not covenants and cannot run with the land: Standen v
Christmas <case>; [(1847) 10 QB 135]; Bickford versus Parson <case>; [(1848) 5 CB 920.] This problem has been held to be overcome by the wording of the successor provisions to the 1540 Act, as noted below. Another difficulty with the old statute was that upon severance of the reversion, covenants could not be enforced by the assignee of part of the reversion. This problem has been overcome by the introduction in the modern statute of the words "or the several parts thereof, notwithstanding severance of that reversionary estate": see Woodfall's Law of Landlord and Tenant (28th ed, 1978 by VG Wellings),
Volume 1, p 455.  The most important limitation on the scope of the 1540 Act was that it applied only to covenants that "touched and concerned" the land: see Davies v
Town Properties Investment Corpn Ltd [[1903] 1 Ch 797]; Barnes v
City of London Real Property Co [[1918] 2 Ch 18.] The modern provision refers to an obligation "with reference to the subject-matter of the lease", a phrase that is, at least potentially, less restricting. In Breams
Property Investment Co Ltd versus Stroulger [[1948] 2 KB 1], at 7, Scott LJ (with whom Bucknill and Asquith LJJ agreed) said:  "The phrase 'subject-matter of the lease' was, as we know, substituted for the ancient expression 'touching and concerning the land.' Professor Cheshire's elucidation of its meaning on pp.214-5 of the 5th ed. of his book on 'Modern
Real Property,' in my respectful opinion, supplies the true test. 'If a simple test,' he says, 'is desired for ascertaining into which category a covenant falls, it is suggested that the proper inquiry should be whether the covenant affects either the landlord qua landlord or the tenant qua tenant. A covenant may very well have reference to the land, but, unless it is reasonably incidental to the relation of landlord and tenant, it cannot be said to touch and concern the land so as to be capable of running therewith or with the reversion.'"  Their Lordships held that a provision in an agreement between landlord and tenant restricting the landlord's right to give a notice to quit satisfied
Professor Cheshire's test and ran with the land, and was therefore enforceable against a transferee from the landlord.  Global has made an impressive submission as the scope of <case>, that deserves to be set out in full:  "Section 118 of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) does not have the effect of causing an agreement to lease for a renewed term to bind the person to whom the lessor transfers the reversion, when the lessor and lessee enter into the agreement to lease outside the terms of their existing lease, because:  [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) annexes the obligation of covenants to the reversionary estate. 
The nature of a reversionary estate is:  "A reversion is such part of a grantor's interest as is not disposed of by his grant ... Thus if a tenant in fee simple grants a life interest, the fee simple which he retains is a reversion. His estate in fee simple in possession has become a fee simple in reversion. ... On the grant of a lease, the lessor retains a reversion.' [RE Megarry & HWR Wade, The Law of Real Property, (3rd ed, 1966), pp 185 and 622]. 
A reversionary estate is necessarily concurrent with the lesser interest or interests carved out of it. It can have no existence before those interests come into being and must end when they do. In relation to a lease, the reversionary estate exists only until the lease expires by effluxion of time or is otherwise determined. 
If a reversionary estate ceases to exist, covenants that run with it cease to be enforceable. This position has been modified by statute where intermediate reversionary estates in a hierarchy of estates or interests come to an end by surrender or merger [Conveyancing Act 1919, <case>, reproducing the English Law of Property Act 1925, <case>] but there is no equivalent statutory provision extending the binding effect of covenants beyond the end of the reversionary estate to which they are annexed. 
It follows that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) does not support the enforcement of covenants after the relevant lease (and hence the reversionary estate) comes to an end. 
If a lease contains a covenant granting the lessee an option to renew, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html), if it applies, has the effect that:  the covenant granting the option binds the landlord; and accordingly,  if the tenant exercises the option, an agreement for the grant of a lease comes into existence, enforceable as a contract by and against both the landlord and the tenant, each of whom is a party to it. 
On the other hand, if the landlord transfers the reversion at this point, [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) does not allow the enforcement of the agreement to lease against the new landlord. It cannot be enforced as a covenant running with the reversion, because at the time when the tenant is entitled to performance, the lease will necessarily have come to an end, and with it the reversionary estate to which the obligation is annexed. 
So, an agreement for lease is enforceable at law against a landlord only as a contract; that is, it is enforceable only against the person who was the landlord at the time the option was exercised."  [The submission then addresses the question of priority between the equitable interest of a tenant under an agreement for lease and the legal or equitable interest of a transferee from the lessor. I consider that point below.]  Interesting though this submission is, my view is that it misconceives the operation and effect of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html)
It is undoubtedly correct that, where the holder of an estate in fee simple grants a lease, the reversionary estate during the term of the lease is that part of the estate in fee simple that the lessor has not disposed of by granting the lease. However, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) does not purport to annex the lessor's covenant obligation solely to the lessor's reversionary estate during the term of the lease. It annexes the lessor's obligation to "the reversionary estate immediately expectant on the term granted by the lease" [emphasis supplied]. In a simple case where the lessor is the holder of the fee simple not subject to any other intermediate interests, the reversionary estate to which the section applies includes both the lessor's reversionary estate during the term of the lease, and the full fee simple upon the expiration of the term of the lease. Upon the expiration of the term, the fee simple becomes the estate immediately expectant on the term granted by the lease. The lessor's obligations then run with the fee simple, although (being obligations by covenant of the lessor qua lessor to the lessee qua lessee) they remain obligations connected to the former lease.
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s122.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), which was referred to by counsel for Global in oral argument, is not of assistance, being equally open to the construction urged by Global and the construction preferred by me.  If Global's submission were correct, the original lessor would have no obligation to an assignee of the original lessee once the lease had been terminated, even in respect of breaches of covenant that occurred prior to termination. Indeed, it would be in the lessor's interests, once the lease had been assigned by the original lessee (to whom, alone, the lessor's obligations were owed in contract) to achieve early termination. If the termination itself involved a breach of obligation, the assignee of the lease would be unable to enforce the obligation or take advantage of it against the lessor. A similar analysis would apply in a case where the original lessee remained in possession, but the lessor assigned the freehold. Those undesirable conclusions should be reached only if the statutory language demands that outcome. It does not do so, in my view, because the reversionary estate identified in the section is not only the lessor's reversionary interest during the term of the lease, but also its reversionary interest expectant on the lease upon its termination.  Global did not cite any cases which specifically support its construction of the section. Moreover, its construction of the section is inconsistent with the outcomes in decided cases, although the cases to which I have been referred do not expressly consider the meaning of the words "reversionary estate immediately expectant on the term granted by the lease". It has been held that a covenant to renew a lease runs with the reversion under the section and is therefore enforceable against a successor in title of the lessor - a rule that became firmly established by judicial decisions early this century: see Alcova Holdings Ltd versus Pandarlo Pty Ltd [(1988) 15 NSWLR ], at 61 per Bryson J; note also Re Hunter's Lease  <case>; [(1976) 136 CLR 326)] the English Court of Appeal held that the UK section applies to permit a lessee to obtain specific performance, against a successor in title of the lessor, of an agreement for lease arising out of the exercise of an option agreement that had been entered into contemporaneously with the lease. Although the lessee's writ was filed before the expiration of the term of the original lease, the hearings at first instance and on appeal occurred, and relief was granted, after the term had expired. Chaisumdet versus Ming On
Trading Pty Ltd (1990) NSW ConvR para 55-518, if correctly decided (see the discussion below), would also be contrary to Global's submission.  To assess the application of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) in the present circumstances, it is useful to begin with its application to a simple case of option to renew. The following propositions may be stated: 
If the registered proprietor of [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) land, being the lessor of a registered lease of the land containing an option to renew, transfers the reversionary estate after the lessee has validly exercised the option, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) has the effect that the transferee is bound to grant a new lease to the lessee pursuant to the exercise of the option. The lessor is obliged by covenant, prior to transfer of the reversionary estate, to honour the exercise of the option by granting a new lease in accordance with the option provisions of the old lease. In undertaking that obligation, the lessor had the power to bind the reversionary estate. The obligation of that covenant therefore is annexed and incident to, and goes with the reversionary estate. The lessor had the power to bind subsequent registered proprietors of the land by registered lease. Consequently the lessee may enforce the obligation against the transferee. 
The same analysis applies where the reversionary estate is transferred before the option to renew has been exercised. The lessor's obligation by covenant to grant a new lease if, at some future time, the option is validly exercised goes with the reversionary estate, and is enforceable by the lessee against the transferee if, after the transfer, the option is validly exercised.  Here, however, there has been no exercise of an option but instead, the parties to an existing lease have, during the term of the lease, varied the payment obligations in certain ways, and they have also entered into an agreement by correspondence for the grant of a new lease. Does [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) apply so as to bind the transferee to the obligations that have arisen under the variations of the existing lease and the agreement for a new lease, to which it was not party, so that the lessee can enforce these obligations against the transferee? This question raises three issues of construction of [s :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html)  * first, whether the words "the obligation of a covenant" apply where the obligation arises out of an agreement under hand but not under seal;  * secondly, whether the wording of [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html), which literally applies to any "obligation ... entered into by a lessor with reference to the subject-matter of the lease", should be held to apply to agreements to vary payment obligations in an existing lease, and to an agreement between lessor and lessee during the term of the lease, but not forming part of the lease, with respect to the creation of a new lease on partially different terms;  * thirdly, given that the land in the present case is held under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), and the transferee has become the registered proprietor of the land, whether the operation of the section is subject to the statutory rules of priority under the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/).  As to the first issue, the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) of New
South Wales does not assist us by offering an extended definition of "lease" (compare Thomson versus Cross <case>; [[1954] VLR 635], where Sholl J relied (at 644) on definitional provisions to hold that the Victorian equivalent of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) extended to any tenancy in writing, though not to a parol tenancy; and as to the definitions relevant to the present English provisions, see Woodfall's
Law of Landlord and Tenant, op cit, p 455-6. The position in this State is, in my opinion, governed by some English cases, which have decided that the words "the obligation of a covenant" should be construed so as to take into account the rule in Walsh versus Lonsdale [(1982) 21 Ch D 9], under which equity will treat a lessee in occupation under a written lease or written agreement for lease as equivalent to a legal lessee, where specific performance is available. Thus, in Weg Motors Ltd versus Hales, where an option to renew was granted under an agreement in writing but not under seal, Lord
Evershed MR and Harman LJ said ([1961] Ch at 73):  "It is next objected that the option contract is under hand only. We have been unable to see the force of this. The lease itself would have taken effect in equity if under hand only, and we do not think that the word 'covenant' in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s142.html) [of the Law of Property Act 1925, not materially different from <case>] is limited to covenants under seal."  Donovan LJ reached the same conclusion (at 76).  There were earlier decisions to the same effect, dealing with the predecessor to <case> of the Law of Property Act, namely <case> of the
Conveyancing Act 1881. While it was held in Blane versus Francis [[1920] 2 KB ] 6 that the section did not apply where the agreement was merely verbal, in Rickett v
Green [[1910] 1 KB 253], at 259, Darling J said that although a lease for a term exceeding three years, not under seal, was void at law, "still in equity it is looked upon as a lease, and in my judgment must be treated, as between the parties, as if it were a lease under seal." Then in Cole versus Kelly [[1917] 1
KB 252] it was held that the section applied where both parties signed letters embodying a bargain for the continuation of a tendency. In Rye versus Purcell [1926] 1KB 446, at 452, McCardie J extended the latter decision to a case of a verbal agreement confirmed by letter signed on behalf of lessor only.  I see no reason for declining to follow the English cases in the construction of <case> of the New South Wales Act. The principles reflected in the cases were established before the enactment of the Conveyancing Act, and may be taken to have been before the draughtsman of the New South Wales legislation.  As to the second issue (whether <case> applies to the lessor's obligation to accept reduced payments under agreements to vary payment obligations in an existing lease) and its obligation to grant a new lease under an agreement between lessor and lessee for a new lease, there are some relevant observations in Weg Motors Ltd versus Hales. The full facts of the case were complicated, but the only facts relevant to the present case may be stated briefly. Two parties entered into an agreement under hand that in consideration of one of them (the lessee) taking a lease from the other (the lessor), "executed after these presents", the lessee would have an option to renew on specified terms. The lease was executed immediately after that agreement, on the same day, and the lessee went into possession under it. One of the questions was whether the option to renew could be exercised and enforced by the lessee against a transferee of the reversion, having regard to s 142 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK).  The application of the section to the instant facts raised an issue that does not arise in the present case. There the option agreement was entered into before the lease. The English Court of Appeal held that the relationship of lessor and lessee came into existence when the option agreement came into force, because the option agreement did not commence until, in consideration of lessor's promise to grant an option, the lessee executed the lease (at 69 and 73 per Lord Evershed MR and Harman LJ, and at 76 per Donovan LJ).
Consequently the lessor's obligation to grant a renewed term on exercise of the option was properly described as an obligation of a covenant entered into by the lessor with respect to the subject matter of the lease.  On the question whether the section applies to a covenant not contained in the lease itself, Lord Evershed MR and Harman LJ said (at 73):  "Next, it is said that this covenant, like the covenants referred to in the preceding section 141 which deals with the benefits of a lessee's covenants, only applies to covenants contained in the lease. That is so in the case of section 141 but in this section 142 the language is different. It is 'entered into by a lessor with reference to the subject matter of a lease.' We take 'subject matter' to mean the demised property. This contract satisfies those words and we see no reason why, provided the relationship of lessor and lessee exists, a covenant to renew should not be included in an independent document."  Donovan LJ said (at 76):  "The section does not in terms require a covenant for renewal to be in the lease itself. In this respect it differs from the Statute of Henry VIII and section 141 of the Act, and the difference seems to me to tell as much in favour of the plaintiffs [the lessees, who were seeking to enforce the promise to renew] as the defendants. The argument would be stronger if it were true that when the option agreement was signed the relationship of lessor and lessee of the premises affected had not been brought into being, but I think it had."  It appears to me that the agreements to vary payment obligations in the old lease fall within the wording of <case>, on the authority of the Weg Motors case. They were entered into by the lessor, AMES, with reference to the subject matter of the lease They satisfy Professor Cheshire's exposition of the meaning of <case>, adopted by the English Court of Appeal in Breams
Property Investment Co Ltd versus Stroulger. They are arrangements entered into by the lessor and lessee at the time, qua landlord and qua tenant respectively.  However, the position regarding the agreement for a new lease is not so straightforward. The agreement is not an agreement to grant an option, but it is nevertheless (being an agreement to grant a new lease on partially different terms from the existing lease) capable of being regarded as an agreement creating an "obligation ... entered into by an existing lessor with reference to the subject-matter of the lease" in favour of the lessee.  The difficulty is that an agreement between lessor and lessee for a new lease upon the expiration of the existing term does not appear to fit within
Professor Cheshire's exposition of the meaning of <case>. When a lessor agrees to grant a new lease in circumstances where there is no question of exercise of an option to renew, it is not doing so qua landlord but qua holder of the fee simple (or any other estate capable of supporting the intended lease). The agreement is not made with the tenant qua tenant, but with a person whose existing capacity as tenant is not a prerequisite to the agreement.  In my opinion, however, Professor Cheshire's test is satisfied in the special circumstances of the present case. One starts with the proposition that the test is satisfied where the lessor is obliged to grant a new lease because an option for renewal contained in the existing lease has been exercised. In such a case the covenant to grant a new lease is found in the option clause in the original lease, and is therefore a covenant affecting the landlord qua landlord and the tenant qua tenant. Next, the Weg Motors case is authority for the proposition that the test is satisfied where the option for renewal is not in the lease, but is found in an agreement which is expressed to operate upon commencement of the lease and is between the lessor and lessee as parties. The mere fact that the option agreement is separate from the lease does not, in those circumstances, prevent it from being said that the lessor's obligation under the option agreement is an obligation undertaken by the lessor qua landlord in favour of the lessee qua tenant.  Now, the present case is not so very different from that situation. This is not a case where a lessor and a lessee have commenced their negotiation for a new lease by turning to a blank page. Here, there was an option for renewal in the lease instrument itself. The negotiations were not conducted in isolation from the option clause. Rather, they were specifically directed to the exercise of the option, subject to three amendments. Although in law the agreement that emerged was not an agreement arising out of exercise of the option, it was an agreement based on the existing option clause, modifying its effect only to a limited degree. I have no difficulty in concluding, on the special facts of this case, that the lessor's obligation to grant a new lease under this agreement is as much an obligation of the lessor qua landlord to the lessee qua tenant as was the obligation in the Weg Motors case.  As to the remaining ingredients of <case>, it is not disputed that in the present case, the lessor had the power to bind the reversionary estate to the obligation to vary the payment obligations. Nor can be disputed that the lessor had the power to bind the reversionary estate to the obligation to grant a new lease, because it was at the time the registered proprietor of the estate in the simple, seeking to extract a commitment from the lessee to a new lease in order to satisfy its mortgagee's requirements.  Section 118 allows the lessee or its assigns to enforce the obligation against a subsequent holder of the reversionary estate only "if and as far as the lessor has the power to bind" that person. It seems to me that a lessor who negotiates a variation to the lessee's payment obligations during the term of the lease has the power to do so in a manner that binds any subsequent taker of the reversionary estate. It would be irrational for <case> to apply so as to restore the original unvaried lease terms upon every change in the identity of the holder of the reversionary estate. The position is more difficult where the lessor's obligation creates an equitable interest in the lessee, because at general law the equitable interest will be defeated by a bona fide purchaser of the residuary estate for value without notice, and so it is arguable that the lessor has no power to bind every subsequent holder of the residuary estate. That raises the general question of priority between the person seeking to enforce the obligation, and the present holder of the residuary estate.  
Section 118 and priority between competing equitable proprietary interests  Section 118 operates to create a statutory exception to the doctrine of privity of contract, in two ways. First, it allows an assignee of a lease from the original lessee to enforce the lessor's obligation. Second, it allows the lessor's obligation to be enforced against a subsequent holder of the residuary estate. The section does not, in terms, confer upon the person entitled to enforce the lessor's obligation any proprietary interest in the residuary estate or the land. The question whether the lessor's obligation creates any proprietary interest in the person entitled to enforce it depends upon proper analysis and characterisation of the lessor's covenant.  There is a distinction, important in the present case, between an obligation of the lessor that is merely personal although running with the residuary estate under <case>, and an obligation of the lessor that gives the lessee a proprietary interest.  One can envisage many examples of an obligation of former kind - for instance, an obligation by the lessor to reimburse the lessee for certain specified kinds of expenditure made in respect of the demised premises. The right to enforce the obligation is not a proprietary right, and so (for example) if the person owing the obligation becomes bankrupt or goes into liquidation, the person entitled to enforce the obligation ranks as an unsecured creditor. And yet an assignee from the lessee may enforce such an obligation under the section; and the statutory right may, according to <case>, be enforced against the person who takes the residuary estate from the original lessor, because the obligation is annexed to the estate.  In the present case, the lessor's obligation to accept reduced payments in consequence of agreements to vary payment obligations under the old lease falls within this category. The payment reduction arrangements are annexed by s 118 to the residuary estate. They are as binding on the lessor's successor in title as any of the personal covenants of the lessor under the original lease. There is no separate proprietary interest created by the variation, which simply becomes an incident of the leasehold relationship. No further question of priority needs to be considered.  An obligation of that kind is to be contrasted with the lessor's obligation under, say, an option to the lessee to purchase the demised premises, or an agreement between the lessor and the lessee for a new lease. In such a case the lessor's covenant, being specifically enforceable in equity, gives the lessee an equitable proprietary interest in the demised premises. The interest will prevail over the interest of a later holder of the residuary estate if the applicable priority rules say so. The competition between the two interests is determined by the priority rules and it is unnecessary to have recourse to <case>.  Nevertheless, if it is read literally, <case> might appear capable of overriding the normal priority rules, so that the person entitled to enforce the lessor's obligation may enforce it as a right annexed to the residuary estate, even by a decree of specific performance, and even in circumstances where his proprietary interest does not have priority over the interest of the subsequent taker of the residuary estate. It is important to note, however, that <case> creates a general rule, which applies to all lessor obligations, regardless of whether the obligation creates a proprietary interest. Whatever may be the position for old system land, the High Court has held, in Leros
Proprietary Limited versus Terara Proprietary Limited <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 407], that the indefeasibility provisions of the Torrens system (especially the provision that is [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) of New
South Wales) set up special rules for priority between competing proprietary interests in Torrens land, and in so doing they override the general rule created by [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html)
The High Court's reasoning applies even though [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s116.html) says that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) applies to leases of land under the provisions of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) "notwithstanding anything in that Act contained".  In the Leros case the respondent was the assignee of an unregistered lease for five years, with an option to renew for a further seven years. There were two subsequent transfers of the land, and then a transfer to the appellant. The question was whether the respondent could assert its interest under the unregistered lease against the appellant as the present registered proprietor of the land, having regard to the effect of certain caveats.  Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ (with whom Deane and Gaudron JJ agreed on this point) referred (at 417) to the Western Australian provisions broadly corresponding with <case> (s 78, found in Part VII of the Property Law Act) and s 42 (s 68 of the Transfer of Land Act). There was also a provision (s 69 of the Property Law Act) equivalent to <case>, which they noted. After observing that an unregistered lease of land held under the Transfer of Land Act is a lease for the purposes of <case> (s 118 in NSW), and consequently the option to renew ran with the reversion, they added:  "But this is not to say that Part VII of the Property Law Act overrides the specific provision made in the concluding words of <case> of the [Transfer of
Land] Act with respect to the invalidity of an option to renew. It would not be right to attribute to the general words of <case> of the Property Law Act an intention to repeal the specific provision in <case> of the [Transfer of Land]
Act."  The relevant part of <case> is as follows:  "42(1) Notwithstanding the existence in any other person of any estate or interest which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority, the registered proprietor for the time being of any estate or interest in land recorded in a folio of the Register shall, except in case of fraud, hold the same, subject to such other estates and interests and such entries, if any, as are recorded in that folio, but absolutely free from all other estates and interests that are not so recorded except: ...  a tenancy whereunder the tenant is in possession or entitled to immediate possession, and an agreement or option for the acquisition by such tenant of a further term to commence at the expiration of such a tenancy, of which in either case the registered proprietor before he or she became registered as proprietor had notice against which he or she was not protected: 
Provided that:  the term for which the tenancy was created does not exceed three years, and  in the case of such an agreement or option, the additional term for which it provides would not, when added to the original term, exceed three years."  According to the High Court, <case> overrides <case> to the extent that <case> would produce a different outcome. But that does not mean that <case> is irrelevant. For example, it would be open to a tenant in occupation under a one-year lease in writing to enforce a provision of the lease for an option to renew for two years, against a transferee who became registered as proprietor with notice of the lease and option, on the basis that:  the tenant has priority over the registered proprietor under <case>(d), and  s 118 permits the tenant to enforce the lessor's obligation against the registered proprietor, by obtaining an order for specific performance.  In Snowlong Pty Limited versus Choe [(1991) 23 NSWLR 198], at 204,
Wood J put forward a different analysis. He expressed the opinion that <case> should be read as confined to registered leases, and to have the same effect as [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s40.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) has for such leases. His Honour observed that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) "cannot have the effect of displacing the indefeasibility provisions of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), or of elevating an unregistered lease taking effect as a tenancy at will, determinable on one month's notice, to a lease for a term of years, with an option for renewal, which registration would have secured".  Wood J's judgment was delivered before the High Court decided the Leros case. In light of the High Court's decision, I respectfully disagree with
Wood J's analysis of the scope of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html), although not with his Honour's conclusion that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) did not apply to the facts before him. There is nothing in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html), or any other provision of the Conveyancing Act, to suggest that <case> should be confined to registered leases. Section 116 states that the provisions of
Part 8, which includes <case>, apply to leases and sub-leases of land under the provisions of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), without suggesting any such limited construction. The fact that if it were confined to registered leases, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) would have the same effect as [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s40.html) is an argument against such a construction, rather than in favour of it. His
Honour's concern that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) must not be regarded as displacing the indefeasibility provisions of the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) is adequately addressed by the application of the High Court's observations in the Leros case, according to which the special priority rules of the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) override the more general provisions of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html)
His concern about elevating a tenancy at will to a lease for a term of years does not seem to take into account that an unregistered lease or agreement for a lease may be enforceable in equity.  I therefore conclude that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) overrides [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) in circumstances where they are both otherwise applicable and would produce inconsistent outcomes, but [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) is still capable of applying where it does not operate inconsistently with [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html)
Thus, for example, it operated to permit HBL to enforce against Global, during the term of the old lease, the promises by AMEZ to accept reductions in royalty payments.  Counsel for Global contended that, once it is recognised that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) operates to override [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html),
Global is entitled to assert the indefeasibility of its registered proprietorship against HBL's claim to specific performance of the agreement for a new lease for a term of 11 years, since a lease for so long a term is outside the limited exception to indefeasibility recognised in sub-paragraph .  Global relied on some observations by Bryson J in Alcova Holdings Pty
Limited versus Pandarlo Pty Ltd [(1988) 15 NSWLR 53.] There the plaintiff was a tenant of Torrens land, in possession under a lease, that was unregistered and not in the approved form, for a term of two years, which contained an option to renew for a further two years. After the plaintiff exercised the option, the term of the original lease expired but no new lease was granted, although the plaintiff remained in possession. At that point the lessor transferred the land to the defendant, who sought to resist the plaintiff's application for specific performance of the renewed lease. Bryson
J held that the plaintiff was in possession under an equitable leasehold interest for the renewed term of two years, since the option had been validly exercised; and that interest was protected by [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html), since the defendant had notice of the plaintiff's interest prior to the transfer.  The defendant submitted that it had priority under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) because the plaintiff had nothing more than an unregistered agreement for lease, and therefore no "tenancy" other than a tenancy at will determinable by one month's notice. After carefully considering the history and proper construction of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html),
Bryson J concluded (at 59 and 63) that a tenant in possession under an agreement for lease has a "tenancy" for the term of the agreement. Where the tenancy is for a term not exceeding three years, it is protected by [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) against a registered proprietor who subsequently takes with notice.  Although the decision in Alcova Holdings is distinguishable from the facts before me, because here the term of the agreed new lease is to be 11 years, it is helpful as to general principles, when read in conjunction with
Jordan CJ's well-known exposition of the law relating to the creation of legal leasehold interests, in Dockrill versus Cavanagh <case>; [(1944) 45 SR 78.]
Bryson J's reasoning confirms that for statutory purposes such as [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html), a tenancy arises where there is an immediate entitlement to possession (at
G), whether the entitlement arises out of a formal grant or an agreement.  A tenant in possession of [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) land under a written agreement to grant a lease for a term in excess of three years, which has not been performed by the grant of a lease in the approved form as required by [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s53.html) of that Act, is at law a tenant at will, having regard to <case>-23E of the
Conveyancing Act, whose tenancy is determinable by one month's notice under s of the Conveyancing Act. But the agreement may be enforced as an agreement in writing to confer an interest in land, in view of <case> of the Conveyancing
Act. Assuming the agreement to be specifically enforceable, occupation under the agreement gives the tenant an equitable interest satisfying the requirement of writing in <case>(a) and corresponding to the legal interest that the tenant would have had if the agreement had been performed. Bryson J's observation (at 57), that the "claim for a legal interest ... rests in agreement and equitable estate, not in a legal interest", encapsulates the tenant's true position.  In September 1999 HBL obtained, as against AMEZ, a specifically enforceable agreement for a new lease. It continued in possession on and after 10 November in reliance on the agreement, and in the expectation that a new lease would be granted by Global in accordance with the agreement. HBL cannot rely on sub-paragraph (d) of <case> to give priority to its equitable interest over Global as registered proprietor, because its equitable interest relates to an agreement for a term longer than the three-year term permitted by sub- paragraph (d). Unless the exception for fraud can be invoked, or HBL can make out some equity directly against Global, <case> will have the effect that
Global as registered proprietor holds the land absolutely free of HBL's unregistered interest.  Counsel for Global placed reliance on a passage in Bryson J's judgment in
Alcova Holdings (at 57), where his Honour agreed with the proposition that the plaintiff's position would have been "hopeless" under <case> if the transfer had been registered prior to the exercise of the option. Further, he said (at ) that "if the freehold had been transferred during the first two years", then "registration would have defeated the option". I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations, and I take them to mean that if, at the time of registration of the transfer, the plaintiff had been in occupation under the initial two-year term, and had subsequently validly exercised the option, the plaintiff would have failed to obtain specific performance of the agreement for the extended term arising out of the exercise of the option. This is no doubt because the additional term, when added to the original term, would exceed the three-year period allowed by subparagraph (d) of <case>. But
Bryson J expressly refrained from considering whether the plaintiff could have enforced the original term against the new registered proprietor (at 63), and he emphasised (at 57) that the plaintiff had not invoked the exception for fraud. I therefore do not regard these observations by his Honour as inconsistent with the case presented to me by HBL.  Chaisumdet versus Ming On Trading Pty Ltd is out of line with the analysis presented so far. In that case the lease was of property held under the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), for a term of three years, to the defendants as lessees, containing an option for renewal for a further term of three years. The plaintiffs were the purchasers of the reversion from the original lessor. They purchased subject to existing tenancies listed in a schedule to the purchase contract, including the defendants' lease. They were even allowed a fee for registration of the lease on settlement of the purchase. The lease was never registered. The defendants purported to exercise the option for renewal, after the plaintiffs had become registered proprietors. The plaintiffs refused to recognise this, and sought possession. The defendants cross-claimed, seeking specific performance.  The plaintiffs relied on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) and their registered title, contending that in the absence of fraud, their title was free of the lease because, the combined term of the lease and option exceeding three years, [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) did not apply. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs' conduct amounted to fraud, on the authority of Bahr versus Nicolay (No 2) <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 604], but Lusher AJ does not appear to have decided the case on the basis of fraud. He held it was open to the defendants to assert that they had validly exercised their option to renew the lease, and that equity would grant specific performance of the agreement to grant a new lease for a further three years. He then said (at 58,868):  "The plaintiffs answer this approach by submitting that the plaintiffs are not parties to the original lease containing the option and there was no assignment, and there is no privy of contract between them, hence there is no equity raised against the plaintiffs. However [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s117.html) and [118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) in my opinion operate, particularly [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html), to enable the defendant lessees to enforce the option covenant against the plaintiff lessors. That section expressed shortly enables the obligation of a covenant by a lessor may be taken advantage of and enforced by the person in whom the term is vested against the person from time to time entitled to the reversion expectant on the lease. Both sections apply to land under the [Real
Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)."  If [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) had been applied, the plaintiffs as registered proprietors would have held their title, except in the case of fraud, absolutely free of the unregistered leasehold interest asserted by the defendants, because the option for renewal, when added to the original term, exceeding three years and therefore the exception in [s (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) would not have applied. Since it appears that fraud was not relied upon, and no personal equity was asserted against the plaintiffs, the facts that the plaintiffs had notice of the defendants' unregistered interest, received an allowance for a registration fee on settlement, and subsequently received rent from the defendants, would not have altered the outcome. His Honour's decision in favour of the defendants, in reliance on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html), therefore allowed [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) to override the statutory priority rule of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html)  In the Snowlong case Wood J expressed the opinion that Chaisumdet was not correctly decided, insofar as it allowed [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) to displace the indefeasibility provisions of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). I respectfully agree. The Chaisumdet case is contrary to the proposition subsequently adopted by the High Court in the Leros case, that the particular provision in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) overrides the general provision in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html)
It is contrary to the reasoning in Bryson J in Alcova Holdings, to the extent that his Honour asserted (at 57 and 63) that the tenant could not have obtained specific performance of the option if the freehold had been transferred during the original term - in Chaisumdet, as in Alcova
Holdings, the option was for an additional term which, when added to the original term, exceeded three years and was therefore not protected by sub- paragraph (d).  In summary, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s118.html) cannot be used in the present case to give priority to HBL's equitable interest over Global's title as registered proprietor, unless there is fraud, or some other circumstances that would entitle HBL to assert its unregistered interest against Global as registered proprietor.  
Equitable claims against the registered proprietor  It is first necessary to consider the principles governing the fraud exception to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html), and governing the other circumstances in which an unregistered interest may be asserted against the registered proprietor.  Several propositions are clear. First, there is no fraud for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) if a person does no more than to acquire title and become the registered proprietor with notice of a prior unregistered interest, and assert that his title is free of that interest: Mills versus Stokman <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 61], at 78 per Kitto J; the Leros case, 174 CLR at 418 per
Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ; Friedman versus Barrett [[1962] Qd R 498.] Secondly (though not directly applicable here), once the unregistered interest is defeated by registration of an inconsistent dealing in favour of a new proprietor, it is extinguished for all purposes and cannot be asserted against any later proprietor: the Leros case, 174 CLR at 418-9 per Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ. Thirdly, [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) and [43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s43.html) do not prevent an equitable claim being made against the registered proprietor based on the assertion that the conduct of the registered proprietor has given rise to the equity: Barry versus Heider <case>; [(1914) 19 CLR 197]; Breskvar versus Wall (1971) 126 CLR 376; Frazer versus Walker [1967] 1 AC 569.  There is some uncertainty about the scope of the fraud exception to [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html)
One view is that it is confined to fraud relating to the circumstances in which the person against whom the unregistered interest is asserted became the registered proprietor. Another view is that fraud for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) extends to the registered proprietor's subsequent conduct. In Bahr versus Nicolay (No 2) <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 604] the Bahrs sold land to Mr Nicolay, who leased it back to them for three years. Their contract provided, in clause 6, that on the expiration of the lease, the Bahrs would enter into a contract to re-purchase the land.
Mr Nicolay sold the land to the Thompsons by a contract containing a provision (clause 4) by which the Thompsons acknowledged the existence of the re- purchase provision of the earlier contract. The Thompsons became the registered proprietors and informed the Bahrs that they recognised the re- purchase clause and would agree to re-sell the land on the terms of that provision. But they subsequently refused to do so.  The High Court held that the Bahrs were entitled against the Thompsons to specific performance of the agreement to re-sell the land. All members of the
Court took the view that the agreement between Mr Nicolay and the Thompsons, especially clause 4, involved more than a mere acknowledgement of the existence of the rights of the Bahrs under clause 6 of their contract. This was therefore not a case of a person becoming registered proprietor merely with notice of an unregistered interest. From that point the reasoning of the members of the High Court was not uniform.  Mason CJ and Dawson J held (at 618-9) that the Thompsons' acknowledgement created an express trust by which they held the land subject to the rights of the Bahrs under the first contract. Wilson and Toohey JJ held (at 638-9) that when they took a transfer of the land knowing of and accepting the obligation to re-sell, the Thompsons became subject to a constructive trust in favour of the Bahrs, and they remained bound by their undertaking to hold their title subject to the rights of the Bahrs notwithstanding registration of the transfer.  Mason CJ and Dawson J also held that the conduct of the Thompsons in repudiating their recognition of the Bahrs' equitable interest constituted fraud for the purposes of the provisions of the Transfer of Land Act of
Western Australia, equivalent to [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) and [43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s43.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). They expressed the view that fraud, for the purpose of the statutory exception to indefeasibility, is not confined to fraud in obtaining a transfer or securing registration of it. They said (at 615):  "The section restricts, in the interest of indefeasibility of title, rights which would exist otherwise at law or in equity. And granted that an exception is to be made for fraud why should the exception not embrace fraudulent conduct arising from the dishonest repudiation of a prior interest which the registered proprietor has acknowledged or has agreed to recognise as a basis for obtaining title, as well as fraudulent conduct which enables him to obtain title or registration? In the context of a <case> [of the Transfer of Land Act, broadly comparable with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s42.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)] there is no difference between the false undertakings which induced the execution of the transfer in Loke Yew [Loke Yew versus Port Swettenham Rubber Co Ltd [[1913] AC 491]] and an undertaking honestly given which induces the execution of a transfer and is subsequently repudiated for the purpose of defeating the prior interest. The repudiation is fraudulent because it has as its object the destruction of an unregistered interest notwithstanding that the preservation of the unregistered interest was the foundation or assumption underlying the execution of the transfer."  Wilson and Toohey JJ did not agree with this view, because in their
Honours' opinion the fraud to which the statutory exceptions relate is "fraud committed in the act of acquiring a registered title" (at 633). The evidence did not establish, in their Honours' view (at 636-7), that the transfer from
Mr Nicolay to the Thompsons was undertaken to deprive the Bahrs of their existing right to repurchase the land. The evidence showed, however, that the
Thompsons took their transfer with knowledge of clause 6 and accepted an obligation to re-sell to the Bahrs, and in the circumstances they became subject to a constructive trust in favour of the Bahrs (at 638). They said (at -9):  "If it be the position that the appellants' interest under clause 6 fell short of an equitable estate, they nonetheless had a personal equity enforceable against the second respondents [the Thompsons]. In either case ss 68 and 134 of the Act would not preclude the enforcement of the estate or equity because both arise, not by virtue of notice of them by the second respondents, but because of their acceptance of a transfer on terms that they would be bound by the interest the appellants had in the land by reason of the contract with the first respondent."  Brennan J found that there was a contractual stipulation between Mr
Nicolay and the Thompsons, by which the Thompsons undertook to Mr Nicolay hold their title subject to the Bahrs' interest, either arising out of clause 4 of their agreement or by a collateral agreement (at 651-2). He said (at 654):  "A registered proprietor who has undertaken that his transfer should be subject to an unregistered interest and who repudiates the unregistered interest when his transfer is registered is, in equity's eye, acting fraudulently and he may be compelled to honour the unregistered interest. A means by which equity prevents the fraud is by imposing a constructive trust on the purchaser when he repudiates the unregistered interest. That is not to say that the registration of the transfer to such a proprietor is affected by such fraud as may defeat the registered title: the fraud which attracts the intervention of equity consists in the unconscionable attempt by the registered proprietor to deny the unregistered interest to which he has undertaken to subject his registered title."  For present purposes, what emerges from the judgments is that:  an unregistered interest may be asserted against the registered proprietor if there was fraud at the time of transfer or registration, under the fraud exception to <case>;  if the registered proprietor subsequently engages in unconscionable conduct intended to deny or defeat the unregistered interest, the holder of the unregistered interest may obtain relief against the registered proprietor, either because the registered proprietor's conduct comes within the fraud exception to <case>, or because the conduct creates an equity which the holder of the unregistered interest may assert against the registered proprietor;  but such an equity will not be created merely because the registered proprietor asserts his registered title after acquiring it with notice of the unregistered interest, the additional ingredient being some form of acknowledgement of the unregistered interest, or an agreement or undertaking to act in accordance with it, from which the registered proprietor later resiles.  The Snowlong case is an example of facts held to contain the "additional ingredient". In that case the contract of sale of land disclosed the existence of an unregistered lease agreement for a term of five years plus options. A copy of the unregistered lease agreement was annexed to the contract, and under the contract the purchaser agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the lease. Wood J carefully analysed the judgments in Bahr versus Nicolay (No ). His Honour found that the contract of sale gave rise to an undertaking by the purchaser to take title subject to a lease in the terms annexed to the contract. The case was not merely one of a purchaser having notice of a third party's rights, but rather it was a case where the purchaser agreed or undertook to recognise those rights. Applying the reasoning of Mason CJ and
Dawson J, he found that the facts gave rise to an express trust, or in the alternative, the purchaser's subsequent repudiation of the undertaking would constitute fraud for the purposes of <case>. He expressed the view that the same result would be achieved if the reasoning of Wilson and Toohey JJ, or the reasoning of Brennan J, were to be applied.  
Application of priority principles in present case  At the time of transfer of the land from AMES to Global, and at the time of registration of that transfer (there being no material factual distinction between the two times), HBL was lessee in possession under the old lease, which was a registered lease for 11 years, not due to expire until November , with three options for renewal for 11 years each. At both of those times there was in place an agreement by correspondence between HBL and AMES that
AMES would grant HBL a new lease for 11 years, with two options for further renewals and otherwise on the terms of the old lease, subject to agreed modifications. The agreement arose at the request of AMES, to suit its funding arrangements. Although strictly speaking it was not an exercise of an existing option to renew the old lease, it is plain from the correspondence that both
HBL and AMES regarded the transaction as in substance an exercise of the option to renew the old lease.  The agreement was entered into on behalf of AMES by George Kekatos. Since the directors of Global were the wives of Wayne and Garry Stafford and George
Kekatos, who were the directors of AMES, and Wayne Stafford had day-to-day management of Global, and George Kekatos was its chief financial officer, I infer that Wayne Stafford had actual knowledge of the arrangements for a new lease between HBL and AMES at the time they were made. This inference is supported by his own evidence. As I have said, his knowledge is to be attributed to Global. No contention to the contrary was put to me in Global's final submissions.  This is not a case of an arms-length transferee acquiring land with notice of an unregistered leasehold interest, as in the Leros case, the Alcova
Holdings case, Chaisumdet and Snowlong. Here the owners and controllers of AMES and Global were the two Stafford families and the Kekatos family. The transfer was made to restructure funding arrangements.  Although evidence of the AMES/Global relationship is obviously relevant to
HBL's contentions, if there were nothing more to the facts, this would be a case (like, for example, Friedman versus Barrett [[1962] Qd R 498)] where the registered proprietor has taken its title with notice but not fraudulently, and therefore its registered title prevails over the unregistered equitable interest. But there is some additional evidence in the present case, which has great significance.  After AMES executed transfers of the land to Global, Mr Kekatos on its behalf wrote a letter to Mr Breeze at HBL dated 16 December 1999. The purpose of the letter was to seek the consent of HBL to the transfer, since HBL had lodged a caveat in respect of a joint venture agreement to which it was a party. The letter said that AMES had entered into arrangements to transfer the property of the quarry to "a company [namely Global] controlled by the respective wives of the current directors of this company". It sought HBL's consent to registration of the transfer to Global, and consent to a transfer of the current mortgage. It continued:  "As you may be aware the lease to your company is registered on the title to the property and will not be affected by any Transfer as stated above as the buyer will always take title subject to the registered lease. It is only in relation to the Caveat lodged in respect of the joint venture arrangement that we will require your written consent."  I infer that HBL consented to the transfer, which was subsequently registered. The letter of 16 December 1999 does not refer specifically to the agreement for a new lease that Mr Kekatos had himself negotiated with Mr
Breeze only three months earlier. However, since the parties regarded the agreement for a new lease as an exercise of the first option to renew contained in the existing registered lease (as is evident from the terms of the September correspondence), the reference in the letter of 16 December to "the lease to your company" should be taken to encompass the agreement to renew the lease. Therefore by that letter Mr Kekatos was assuring Mr Breeze and HBL that the transfer would not affect either the old lease or the arrangements for a new lease.  Although in the circumstances the matter was not put to any of HBL's witnesses, it is appropriate to infer that HBL would not have consented to registration of the transfer if there had been any suggestion that its position in relation to the renewal of lease might have been affected, without first clarifying its position.  In my opinion Mr Kekatos' letter of 16 December 1999, construed as I have indicated, followed by HBL's consent to the transfer of the land, is comparable to the acknowledgements and undertakings held to be determinative in Bahr versus Nicolay (No 2) and the Snowlong case. In those cases, however, the acknowledgements and undertakings were given on behalf of the registered proprietor. Here, Mr Kekatos purported to write the letter on behalf of AMES rather than Global.  There are, nevertheless, some additional facts which, in my view, lead to the inference that Global authorised the letter and is bound by the state of affairs which it sets out. Global had actual knowledge, at all relevant times, of the arrangements giving HBL an interest under an agreement for a new lease.
The letter was written after execution of the transfers in favour of Global.
It described Global as a company controlled by the wives of the current directors of AMES. The wives were in fact the directors of Global, but Mr
Kekatos (who wrote the letter) was the chief financial officer and Wayne
Stafford (who had day-to-day management of Global) was aware of its contents.
Although there is no direct evidence that the directors of Global resolved to authorise the letter, those circumstances warrant the inference that the letter was authorised by Global.  The letter on its proper construction acknowledged the interest of HBL under the registered lease and under the arrangements for renewal. It contained a representation, and impliedly an undertaking, that HBL's interest would not be affected by the transfer. In my opinion, by application of the reasoning of Mason CJ and Dawson J in Bahr versus Nicolay (No 2), the letter created an express trust under which, upon becoming registered proprietor,
Global held the fee simple, already subject to the registered lease, in trust to grant a new lease to HBL pursuant to their agreement of September 1999.
Further, in terms of their Honours' reasoning (especially in the passage at extracted above), this was a case of an undertaking to recognise HBL's interest in a new lease, apparently honestly given, which induced HBL's consent and permitted registration of the transfer, but was subsequently repudiated in final submissions at the hearing, for the purpose of defeating
HBL's prior interest. That repudiation was fraudulent for the purposes of s , because it had as its object the destruction of HBL's unregistered interest notwithstanding that the preservation of the unregistered interest was the foundation or assumption underlying HBL's consent to the registration of the transfer.  While, like Wood J in Snowlong, I prefer to adopt the analysis of Mason
CJ and Dawson J, the same substantive result would follow, still on the basis that Global authorised the letter of 16 December 1999, by the application of the reasoning of Wilson and Toohey JJ, and the reasoning of Brennan J.  Counsel for Global submitted near the end of the final day of the hearing that it was not open to HBL to make a submission of fraud, when the matter had not been raised before the final day of the hearing. That submission cannot be right. The final and critically important ingredient of fraud was supplied only when Global repudiated any obligation under the agreement for renewal of the lease, an event which occurred only through the submissions of its counsel earlier on the final hearing day. HBL can hardly have been expected to plead fraud prior to the time.  My conclusion, that Global holds its title subject to HBL's equitable interest, gives HBL an entitlement to direct relief against Global to protect its interest. It also means that <case> does not operate inconsistently with s in the present case. Section 118 provides a further conceptual foundation for decreeing specific performance of the agreement for lease against Global.  If my conclusion that Global authorised the letter of 16 December 1999 is incorrect, there are nevertheless grounds for finding that HBL's equitable interest may be asserted against Global, arising out of some evidence of
Global's conduct amounting to acquiescence in HBL's interest after the land was transferred to it. I shall call this evidence, for convenience and without pre-judgment, "the estoppel evidence". If Global had merely acquiesced in the state of affairs set out in the letter some time after it was written, the decisions in Bahr versus Nicolay (No 2) and the Snowlong case would not be applicable, because both of those cases proceed on the basis that there was some acknowledgement or undertaking with respect to the prior equitable interest at the time of transfer to the registered proprietor. Subsequent acquiescence would not provide the basis for finding an express or constructive trust of the kind identified in the cases, and in the absence of anything linking the conduct of Global to the event of transfer, it would be unlikely that the facts could be brought within the fraud exception to <case>.  However, as I have said, the holder of a prior unregistered interest may assert it against the registered proprietor if some equity can be established against the registered proprietor itself, arising out of its conduct after the transfer took place. Here, relying on the estoppel evidence as well as the letter of 16 December 1999, and the evidence about the AMES/Global relationship, HBL submitted that such an equity arose on two grounds, namely proprietary estoppel and estoppel by convention.  
The estoppel evidence  In my opinion the estoppel evidence, to which I shall now turn, shows that from December 1999 until 1 July 2003, Global has engaged in a course of conduct, the overall effect of which is that it has consistently and routinely recognised that the arrangements between it and HBL are no different from the arrangements that previously existed between AMES and HBL.  Thus, on 21 August 2000 Mr Kekatos wrote on behalf of Global to HBL concerning royalty payments and rates for periods extending beyond 10 November , that is, beyond the expiration of the existing lease. The letter referred to the agreed reduction of the percentage royalty rate to 11% and specifically referred to the letter that Mr Kekatos wrote on behalf of AMES on September 1999 as "our letter", effectively equating Global with AMES.  On 30 October 2000 Mr Stafford on behalf of Global wrote to HBL enclosing a page of calculations showing the dollar amount said to be due to Global for the period November 1999 to November 2000, which included a reference to "new royalty lease", and extended back to a time prior to the execution of the transfers of the land in favour of Global. The letter acknowledged the existence of the "holiday tonnes" arrangement.  On 1 November 2000 Mr Kekatos on behalf of Global wrote to HBL referring to a meeting on 31 October in relation to royalty payments, and proposing an interim arrangement for a monthly royalty based on a rate derived from the average selling price for the period to 11 November 1999. The letter assumed that a review would take place by reference to the "terms of the lease".  After the old lease expired on 9 November 2000, HBL continued in possession of the quarry and paid Global monthly royalty payments up to and including July 2001. Proceedings were commenced in May 2001. On 15 August 2001 interlocutory orders were made by Hamilton J upon HBL undertaking to pay a royalty amount into court. The orders were subsequently varied. Dr Ferrier, the expert appointed under Part 39 of the Rules, gave evidence showing that royalties were paid, or paid into court, up to April 2002.  When, in early 2001, HBL proposed to sell the Penrose Quarry business and therefore to assign its interest in the lease, it approached Global for consent to the assignment. By letter dated 14 March 2001, Mrs Kekatos on behalf of Global wrote to HBL saying:  "I am instructed on behalf of the Board of Directors to advise that the company has no objection to the proposed assignment of the lease provided that your company complies with the requirements specified in Clause 4.09.2 of the lease and further meets all its obligations due pursuant to the lease up to the date of assignment."  This letter proceeded on the basis that there was, in March 2001, a lease (or in equitable interest to be granted a lease) to be assigned, and that
Global was the lessor in respect of that lease.  A similar assumption can be found in correspondence between the solicitors for HBL and Global concerning preparation of a new lease following the "exercise of the option to renew". The correspondence ran from 3 April 2001 to April 2001. In their letter of the latter date, the solicitors for Global wrote to HBL's solicitors conveying their instruction that HBL was in default of various provisions of the lease, and that pending satisfactory resolution of those matters, their instructions were not to provide an engrossed lease to
HBL. The assumption appears to have been that there was an existing lease in respect of which Global might wish to assert its legal entitlements. On 17 May HBL's solicitors wrote to Global's solicitors asserting that HBL was entitled to have a new lease engrossed because Global was estopped from denying that there was an agreement for lease or that HBL had validly exercised its option to renew.  During the period from April to July 2001, Global made various demands upon HBL upon the basis that HBL was in possession on the terms of the renewed lease. It made claims for shortfalls in royalty payments. On 24 April and 4
July 2001 it gave notices with respect to alleged breaches of the lease relating to restoration or rehabilitation of the land and compliance with conditions of consent, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s129.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), asserting an entitlement to re-enter and forfeit the lease in the event of failure to comply with those notices. Another notice in similar form was given on 7
December 2001.  Since December 2000 HBL has undertaken work and incurred expense in relation to its occupation of the quarry on the basis that was obliged to do so pursuant to the terms of the renewed lease. I infer that it acted on this basis because of the agreement of September 1999, its consent to the transfer of the land to Global, the fact that it had remained in occupation and had paid and continued to pay royalties, and the fact that Global proceeded on the same basis.  For example, between December 2000 and June 2001 HBL constructed a pipeline from area 10 to the washing plant at a cost of $250,000. It attended meetings with the Council concerning compliance with planning and environmental requirements. It attended to various environmental issues including the installation of erosion and sedimentation control systems. In addition to these matters, counsel for HBL prepared a detailed submission headed "detriment evidence", providing particulars of activities HBL claimed it had undertaken on the basis that it was entitled to a renewal of the lease, subject only to the issues that had been raised as to breach. It is unnecessary for me to set out that detailed evidence here, although having considered it, my view is that it amply reinforces the proposition emerging from the evidence I have described, that HBL has conducted its affairs, by expending effort, money and otherwise, on the basis that it was entitled to a renewal of the lease.  At no stage before the last day of the hearing on 1 July 2003 did Global seek to distinguish its position from the position of AMES by relying on absence of privity and its indefeasible title. Instead, the emphasis of
Global's defence and cross-claim has been to assert, in great detail, breaches of the provisions of the lease in respect of matters occurring before and after registration of the transfer of the land in its favour. The written submissions prepared on behalf of Global for the purposes of the hearing prior to 1 July 2003 gave no hint that Global would seek to deny HBL's entitlement to a renewed lease in reliance on lack of privity and its registered title.  Counsel for Global contended that the estoppel evidence established only a mutual recognition of HBL's entitlement to continue to occupy under the old lease and then, on and after 10 November 2000, to occupy under a tenancy at will. There is, as counsel submitted, an important distinction between a case where the parties expect the lease to come into existence, and a case where the parties regard themselves as already bound to grant and take a lease. But in my opinion the evidence as a whole brings this case squarely into the latter category. The letter of 16 December 1999 implies that the transfer to
Global was assumed not to have affected HBL's position as tenant under the old lease and under the agreement that had been made only months earlier. Within the estoppel evidence, there are specific acknowledgements that the holiday tonnes and 11% arrangements affected Global. Mrs Kekatos' letter of 14 March was expressed in terms of consent to the assignment of an existing lease rather than merely consent to a new tenant under a proposed lease not yet granted. Global's [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s129.html) notices were drawn on the basis that there was a continuing lease for a term after 9 November 2000. The cross-claim also implied that HBL was in occupation under something more than a tenancy at will. I therefore reject the submission made on behalf of Global.  
Is it too late for Global to rely on the estoppel grounds?  Although counsel for HBL indicated in his final submissions that he might wish to make submissions about estoppel depending upon how Global presented its case in final submissions, and estoppel was asserted by HBL's solicitors in correspondence as early as 17 May 2001, the estoppel grounds were only fully articulated in HBL's submissions in reply on the final hearing day. This was undoubtedly because it was only on the final hearing day that Global sought to rely on its registered title and to contend that it was not a party to the variations to the payment obligations under the old lease, or to the agreement for a new lease.  Global contends that HBL cannot now claim an estoppel of any kind, because  * the claim to that effect was not identified in any of the four versions of HBL's summons;  * HBL has adduced no evidence relating to it from any of its directors or officers;  * consequently, Global has been denied the opportunity to cross-examine on this issue; and  * Global has also been denied the opportunity to adduce evidence in its own case on this issue.  I disagree with Global's submissions. HBL did not file a statement of claim (something which, in retrospect, would have been a wise step). The relief it seeks, declaratory relief and specific performance in respect of the agreement for a new lease, is relief sought against Global rather than the counterparty to the agreement, AMES, but there is no indication in the summons of the basis upon which HBL claims to be entitled to that relief as against
Global. Counsel for Global said that as a matter of practice, if HBL wished to rely upon any form of estoppel it should have sought a declaration in terms specifically articulating that ground. In my opinion it is strictly open to
HBL to make any submissions that demonstrate its entitlement to the relief it sought in the summons, even though it now contends that its entitlement derives from estoppel and the orders sought in the summons do not suggest any such contention.  More importantly, however, the occasion to rely upon estoppel arguments arose only on the last of the hearing, as I have said. Before that time it appeared from Global's cross-claim and the correspondence that is in evidence that Global's case did not rely on absence of privity and the indefeasibility of its title to the land, but on a multitude of breaches of the old lease before and after it took title, and of the new agreement for lease after
November 2000. Indeed, the cross-claim implies, in substance, that Global proceeded on the basis that it was entitled to assert breaches of the lease against HBL, and therefore that it was itself bound by the terms of a lease.
In my opinion it does not lie with Global, having conducted its case on an entirely different basis until last day of a hearing that took place over a very extended period of time, now to assert that it is too late for HBL to raise an issue that needed to be raised only in response to Global's last- minute argument.  I accept, of course, that it was always necessary for HBL to prove its entitlement to relief against an entity other than the one with whom its arrangements were made. Indeed, counsel for HBL invoked [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) in his principal submission, before the issues of privity and indefeasibility of title were raised by Global. But it was not unreasonable, in view of all of the evidence, for HBL to proceed on the basis that the point about the different entities would not be taken against it at the hearing.  As to HBL's failure to call its directors or officers to prove the ingredients of estoppel, and the consequent denial to Global of the opportunity to cross-examine on this issue, the answer is that HBL puts its case now on the basis of the evidence already before the Court, and in particular, in reliance on correspondence and other documentary evidence. That is also the answer to Global's complaint that it has not had the opportunity to adduce its own evidence in reply to the estoppel argument. The case has been conducted on the basis of voluminous and apparently comprehensive documentary evidence, and Global has not suggested that there is any document not already in evidence that it would have sought to put into evidence if the estoppel argument had been raised earlier.  
Proprietary estoppel  In Ramsden versus Dyson (1866) LR 1 HL 129, Lord Kingsdown said (at 170):  "The rule of law applicable to the case appears to me to be this: If a man, under a verbal agreement with the landlord for a certain interest in land, or what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation, created or encouraged by the landlord, that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land, with the consent of the landlord, and upon the face of such promise or expectation, with knowledge of the landlord, and without any objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a court equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation."  While his Lordship's observations were in a dissenting speech, it is accepted that his dissent was with respect to the facts rather than the law: see Plimmer versus Wellington Corporation [(1984) 9 App Cas 699], at 713. His statement of principle has become a leading formulation of what is sometimes called proprietary estoppel or estoppel by acquiescence, although some recent observations in the High Court suggest that it should be treated as merely an instance of a broader, overarching principle of estoppel by conduct:
Commonwealth versus Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394, at 410-411 per Mason CJ and at per Deane J.  The doctrine of proprietary estoppel is capable of being used to complete an otherwise imperfect gift: Dillwyn versus Llewelyn <case>; [(1862) 4 De GF & J 517]
It has been considered or applied often in Australian cases: for example,
Riches versus Hogben [[1985] 2 Qd R 292], Waltons
Stores (Interstate) Limited versus Maher <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 387], Silovi Pty Ltd versus Barbaro [(1988) 13 NSWLR 466],
Austotel Pty Ltd versus Franklins Selfserve Pty Ltd [(1989) 16 NSWLR 582],
Commonwealth versus Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR 394, Giumelli versus Giumelli <case>; [(1998) 196 CLR 101] and Wykes versus Samilk Pty Ltd [[1998] Aust Contract R -097.] In my opinion, while the later cases expand the scope of equitable estoppel (including proprietary estoppel) in some ways, none of them casts any doubt on Lord Kingsdown's statement as an accurate account of the law applicable to facts of the kind envisaged by his Lordship.  In this case the evidence shows that HBL has remained in possession of the quarry from the time it was transferred to Global until the final days of the hearing, under an expectation that was created by Global when it authorised
AMES' letter of 16 December 1999, and that was encouraged by Global by its conduct (the estoppel evidence) after it took transfers of the land, the explanation being that HBL would have a new lease on the terms agreed between it and AMES. Without objection by Global, HBL laid out money on the land and otherwise expended effort in performance of its assumed obligations as lessee in the period from 10 November 2000 to July 2001, upon the face of that expectation.  Lord Kingsdown's statement applies on the basis of my finding that Global authorised the letter of 16 December 1999, but it would also apply if Global did not authorised the letter but acquiesced in the manner shown by the estoppel evidence. The application of Lord Kingsdown's statement means that a court of equity will compel Global to give effect to the expectation, now that it has unconscionably purported to resile, if that is the appropriate remedial response to address the unconscionability.  In Burnside Sub-branch RSSILA Inc versus Burnside Memorial Bowling Club Inc [(1990) 58 SASR 324], Jacobs, Cox and Matheson JJ found that on the facts before them, both parties acted on a mistaken assumption that they had entered into agreements that bound them both (at 345). Then they said (at 346):  "We have already referred to the passages in the judgments from Verwayen that would apply the doctrine of estoppel, including estoppel by acquiescence, to a case in which the mistake was a mistake of law. There is a question whether such an estoppel can arise where the party to be estopped shared the other party's mistaken view, that is, did not knowingly stand by in the sense that the landowner knowingly stood by in Ramsden versus Dyson."  It was unnecessary for the Court to resolve that question because, on the facts, the estopped party was aware of the informality of the agreements in circumstances where it would be unconscionable for it to deny their binding effect. In the present case, Global shared with HBL would a common assumption that it was bound to honour the arrangements of September 1999 by granting HBL a new lease, subject to questions of repudiation for breach. But in this case, as in the Burnside Memorial case, it cannot be said that Global did no more than share a mistaken assumption about HBL's rights. Mr Kekatos and Mr
Stafford were well aware that Global was not party to the arrangements of
September 1999. It was open to them to insist that if there was to be a new lease after the transfer of the land to Global, it should be negotiated by a fresh agreement between HBL and Global. It was open to them to require HBL to vacate the premises upon the expiration of the old lease unless HBL entered into a new lease in a timely fashion. They chose to proceed in another fashion, by asserting breaches of lease entitling Global to repudiate. For the purposes of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, this is therefore not a case of a mere common but mistaken assumption about rights.  I am persuaded that HBL has made out the ingredients of proprietary estoppel as against Global, whether or not (as I have found) Global authorised the letter of 16 December 1999. HBL therefore has an equity against Global which it may assert by appropriate remedial relief. There can be little doubt that in the present circumstances, the appropriate relief is to require Global to make good the expectation created by its conduct, by compelling it to grant
HBL a new lease on the terms agreed by AMES.  
Estoppel by convention  Estoppel by convention is a species of common law estoppel, described in traditional terms by Spencer Bower and Turner, Estoppel by Representation (3rd ed, 1977, p 157) as founded on an agreed statement of facts the truth of which is assumed, by the convention of the parties, as the basis of a transaction into which they are about to enter. In Amalgamated Investment & Property Co Ltd versus Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd [[1982] 1 QB ] the
English Court of Appeal held that there was an estoppel by convention where the parties to a loan guarantee which wrongly identified the loan, subsequently acted and organised their affairs on the incorrect assumption that the guarantee covered the loan. As Lord Goff of Chieveley observed in
Kenneth Allison Ltd versus AE Limehouse & Co [[1992] 2 AC 105], at 127, the
Amalgamated Investment case applied estoppel by convention to a situation, rather different from the one described by Spencer Bower, where "both parties proceed on the basis of a common, but mistaken, assumption as to the legal effect of a certain transaction between them, and in consequence one party is so influenced by the conduct of the other that it would be unconscionable for the latter to take advantage of the former's error".  Subsequent English cases have followed the Amalgamated Investment case, although it is thought that in English law the formulation of principle by
Lord Denning MR (at 122) may not accurately represent English law: see R
Derham, "Estoppel by Convention - [Part "](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p1), [(1997) [71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p71)
ALJ 860], at 865. Whatever formulation may be precisely correct in
England, it is now plain (contrary to Spencer Bower's formulation) that the estoppel may arise where the common assumption of the parties is an assumption about the effect of the law, rather than an assumption of fact: Kenneth
Allison Ltd versus AE Limehouse & Co, at 127 per Lord Goff of Chieveley;
Republic of India versus India Steamship Co Ltd <case>; [[1998] AC ], at It appeared for a time that Australian law diverged from English law in this latter respect. In Con-Stan Industries Pty Ltd versus Norwich Winterthur
Insurance (Aust) Ltd <case>; [(1986) 160 CLR 226], it was alleged that an estoppel by convention had arisen because a business relationship between an insured, a broker and an insurer was conducted on the assumption, incorrect in law, that the broker alone was liable to the insurer for the premium. Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan and
Dawson JJ said (at 244):  "Estoppel by convention is a form of estoppel founded not on a representation of fact made by a representor and acted upon by a representee to his detriment, but on the conduct of relations between the parties on the basis of an agreed or assumed state of facts, which both will be estopped from denying."  Their Honours held that the doctrine of estoppel by convention had no application to the facts for two reasons:  "First, there is no estoppel unless it can be shown that the alleged assumption has in fact been adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Dabbs versus Seaman <case>; [(1925) 36 CLR 538] at 549. In the absence of proof of custom, there is no evidence that the parties adopted the alleged assumption. Secondly, just as estoppel by representation requires a representation of fact, so too estoppel by convention requires the assumed state of affairs to be an assumed state of fact: Greer versus Kettle [[1938] AC 156] at 170; Spencer
Bower & Turner, Estoppel by Representation (1977) 3rd ed, p 167-8. The state of affairs relied on by Con-Stan is that the parties conducted their business relationship on the basis that the broker was alone liable to the insurer for the premiums. That is clearly an assumption as to the legal effect of their conduct, and not an assumption of fact. The submission with respect to estoppel accordingly fails."  Australian law has developed since the Con-Stan case, particularly in the context of estoppel by representation. As Gummow J observed in Caboche v
Ramsay (1993) 1 <case>; [119 ALR 215], at , the statement in Con-Stan that estoppel by representation requires a representation of fact must be read subject to the later observations by various members of the Court in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd versus Maher <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 387], at 415-6, , 452 and 458; Foran versus Wight <case>; [(1989) 168 CLR 385], at 435 and 457; and Commonwealth versus Verwayen (1990) 170 CLR , at 413, 445 and 501. Those observations are to the effect that there is no longer a distinction between representations as to law and as to fact in the field of estoppel by representation. If that is the position regarding estoppel by representation, it would be odd if the position were different regarding estoppel by convention, when they are co-species of estoppel in pais (Caboche, at 236) and are equally candidates to be subsumed into the "one over-arching doctrine of estoppel" of which Mason CJ (170 CLR at 410) and
Deane J (at 444-5) spoke in Verwayen.  Eslea Holdings Ltd versus Butts [(1986) 6 NSWLR 175] was decided just after Con-Stan, and Samuels JA (with whom Kirby P agreed,
McHugh JA dissenting) discussed it in detail (at 185ff). He said that the second basis of decision was an obiter dictum, although he was bound to pay it the very greatest respect and attention. After carefully analysing cases referred to in the Con-Stan judgment, he concluded (188) that those authorities were consistent with the view that conventional estoppel applies where the assumed state of affairs is as to legal effect. Noting that the High
Court had not disagreed with the Amalgamated Investment case, where the assumption turned upon the legal effect of the guarantee, he concluded that the High Court's dictum was intended to have a limited effect (at 188), and to apply only to assumptions about general propositions of law.  The reasoning of Samuels JA has subsequently been criticised (the criticisms are summarised by Derham, op cit, p 866). Nevertheless his approach was followed by Hodgson CJ in Eq (as his Honour then was), who considered the issue after the three more recent High Court cases, in Hilton Hotels (Aust)
Pty Ltd versus Sunrise Resources (Aust) Pty Ltd (2000) 9BPR 97,811. Hodgson CJ in
Eq said (at [71]):  "There is a statement in Con-Stan Industries versus Norwich Winterthur Insurance
Ltd <case>; [(1986) 160 CLR 226] that, 'just as estoppel by representation requires a representation of fact, so too estoppel by convention requires the assumed state of affairs to be an assumed state of fact'. However, this statement was obiter, and in any event should not in my opinion be taken as applying to assumptions as to private rights or the legal effect of particular agreements as distinct from assumptions as to the general law: see Eslea Holdings Ltd v
Butts [(1986) 6 NSWLR 175] at 185-9 per Samuels JA, with whom Kirby P agreed; cf
Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd versus Maher <case>; [(1988) 164 CLR 387] at 415-16, 435, 452, 457; Commonwealth versus Verwayen (1990) CLR 394 at 500; and Lee versus Ferno Holdings Pty Ltd [(1993) 33 NSWLR ."](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2033%20NSWLR%20404 "View LawCiteRecord" )  After considering these authorities, the authors of Meagher, Gummow and
Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4th ed, 2002, by RP Meagher, JD
Heydon and MJ Leeming, 540) conclude that it is now clear that the doctrine extends to assumptions of law. It is at least clear to me that no other view is open in this State at first instance.  There is room to doubt whether the common assumption of the three entities in the present case should be classified as including an assumption of law. In
Riseda Nominees Pty Ltd versus St Vincent's Hospital (Melbourne) Ltd [[1998] 2
VR 70],
Callaway JA observed (at 77) that an assumption as to the existence of private legal rights may be regarded as an assumption of "facts" for the purposes of conventional estoppel. Earlier, in Noyes versus Klein (1984) 3 BPR 97,178,
Kearney J found that there was a conventional estoppel in a case where the assumed fact was as to the existence of a binding lease agreement between landlord and tenant. However it seems to me that the assumption in the present case, while not an assumption about the general law, was nevertheless an assumption about the legal effect, with respect to Global, of arrangements that had been made between HBL and AMES. But that is not now an obstacle to applying the doctrine of estoppel by convention.  The estoppel evidence, when considered together with the evidence of the
AMES/Global relationship and the letter of 16 December 1999, establishes that
HBL, AMES and Global have, at all times since execution of the instruments of transfer of 8 December 1999, conducted their relations with one another on the basis of an assumed state of affairs. The assumed state of affairs is that
Global is bound by the variations to the payment obligations agreed between
HBL and AMES, and by the arrangements for a new lease made in September 1999 - in other words, that Global came to occupy the same position vis-a-vis HBL, and had the same rights and obligations in that respect, as AMES had before the transfer.  In my opinion the evidence brings the present case within the doctrine of estoppel by convention, both with respect to the arrangements for variation of the payment obligations, and with respect to the arrangements for the new lease. Therefore Global is estopped against HBL from questioning the truth of that assumed state of affairs.  Consequently estoppel by convention provides a basis, additional to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html), for HBL to require Global to adhere to the variation of payment arrangements agreed between it and AMES. Whereas under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html) it is entitled to an order for, in effect, specific performance of the agreement to vary the old lease in these ways, the estoppel may entitle it to nothing more than an injunction to restrain Global from acting inconsistently with the assumed state of affairs. But the distinction in remedial outcomes may have no practical significance.  The position regarding its obligation to grant a new lease is somewhat different. HBL has established an entitlement to an order for specific performance of the agreement by Global, on two grounds: first, a combination of the principles set out in Bahr versus Nicolay (No 2) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html); and second, proprietary estoppel. Although estoppel by convention is also available, the weaker injunctive relief to which it naturally leads seems insufficient to vindicate HBL's rights. So estoppel by convention is best seen as a "fallback" ground, as regards the obligation to grant a new lease.  
Did HBL fail to pay royalties due under the old lease or the agreement for a new lease?  When the final hearing commenced in December 2001, there were many issues between the parties with respect to the payment of royalties. HBL sought declarations that Global was not entitled to re-enter the land or terminate the old lease or the new lease agreement on grounds of any alleged failure by it to pay royalties to Global under the leases. HBL also contended that it had overpaid royalties by a substantial amount. On the other hand Global sought declarations that HBL had breached the lease from 1 December 1996 to date, both by failing to keep proper records in certain respects, and by failing to pay $1 million for royalties payable under the lease. Global also contended that it was an implied term of the lease that HBL was liable to Global for any
Minerals removed from the land but not accurately weighed at the weighbridge.
It sought declarations that HBL unlawfully removed Minerals from the land without its consent and that this conduct constituted a repudiation of the lease. A focus of attention in the latter respect was the clay sold by HBL to
Wingecarribee Shire Council in 2000 and 2001.  Allegations about the "clay" issue and other claimed discrepancies in weighbridge dockets led eventually to my appointment of a court expert under
Part 39 of the Supreme Court Rules. The expert, Dr Ferrier, reported in
December 2002. His task was to provide his opinion on a list of matters with respect to the period from 10 November 1995 to 30 April 2002, relating to tonnage of material extracted and passing over the weighbridge and the average sale prices of that material, the amounts charged by HBL, and royalty payments by HBL. Dr Ferrier reported on these matters to the extent that he was able to do so, and on stated assumptions, he expressed his opinion as to the annual underpayment or overpayment of royalties for that period.  He found that the overall underpayment or overpayment depended upon the resolution of four matters, which he understood to be in dispute between the parties, which he expressed as follows:  whether royalties were payable in respect of sand that had been imported from the Joannou Quarry and resold from the Penrose Quarry;  whether royalties were payable on the sale of clay or fill;  whether further royalties became payable after 250,000 tonnes or 350,000 tonnes for the 34-month period 12 January 1998 to 13 November 2000 (the "holiday tonnes" issue); and  whether further royalties were payable at the rate of 11% or 12.5% from 20
September 1999.  Noting that there were 16 possible combinations of these four variables, he prepared a "royalty model" summarising his opinion of the overpayment or underpayment for each possible combination of the four variables. Scenario 1 assumed that no royalty was payable in respect of sand imported from the
Joannou Quarry or in respect of clay, that "holiday tonnes" should be allowed to HBL, and that the royalty rate from 20 September 1999 should be reduced to %. On those assumptions, there was in Dr Ferrier's opinion an overpayment of $295,778.73 by HBL during the period from 10 November 1995 to 30 April 2002.
Dr Ferrier then worked through the remaining 15 scenarios, finishing with scenario 16, in which royalties were payable on the Joannou sand and clay, no holiday tonnage was allowed, and there was no reduction in the 12.5% royalty rate. That produced a net underpayment for the period of $121,472.61. I should note that the first 10 scenarios produced overpayments of royalties for the period, though each subsequent scenario produced a figure less than scenario , and the last six scenarios produced underpayments, the highest being in scenario 16.  Dr Ferrier's royalty model was prepared on the assumption, reflecting the questions put to him by the Court as settled between the parties to the proceeding, that amounts owing by or to the lessor could be netted off over the whole of the period from November 1995 to April 2002, notwithstanding the change in the identity of the registered proprietor on 2 May 2000.  As to whether material extracted from the Penrose Quarry might not have passed over the weighbridge, Dr Ferrier reported that it was apparent during his review of the internal controls in place at the Penrose Quarry that it would be quite possible for material to be taken without going over the weighbridge. However, he said, during the course of his review he did not become aware of any information that would confirm that any material was sold or given away by HBL that did not pass over the weighbridge.  When the final component of the hearing began, in light of Dr Ferrier's report, counsel for HBL handed me some full and detailed written submissions, prepared on the assumption that all issues between the parties about the payment of royalties were still in play. However, in his final submissions, on the last hearing day, counsel for Global abandoned many of the contentions that had been made by his client at earlier stages of the hearing. On the question of HBL's alleged failure to pay royalties, Global abandoned its contention about the Joannou sand, but maintained its position with respect to the "clay" issue, the "holiday tonnes" issue and the question whether the royalty payment rate had been reduced to 11% as from 20 September 1999. It added the contention that HBL was not entitled to net off the positions of
Global and AMES as if they were one entity.  In summary, the only remaining royalty issues are: 
Was there an arrangement, binding on Global, that royalties would not be payable on the clay sold to Wingecarribee Shire Council? 
Was there an arrangement, binding on Global, that the Standard Quantity of
Minerals, after which Further Royalties would be payable, was increased from ,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes in the period of 34 months from 13 January to 13 November 2000? 
Did the agreement to alter the Further Royalty rate, payable under clause .04(b), from 12.5% to 11% take effect on 20 September 1999 or only in the renewed lease from 10 November 2000? 
Was HBL entitled to deduct from payments due to Global the amount of overpayments to AMES?  
Royalties on "clay"  Global contended that the material removed from the quarry and sold to
Wingecarribee Shire Council, often referred to in evidence as "clay", was a
Mineral for the purposes of the definition in clause 1.06 of the lease. Wayne
Stafford gave evidence on behalf of Global that the material was in fact decomposed basalt (basalt being expressly mentioned in the definition). Mr
Rankin gave evidence on behalf of HBL that royalties were not paid on the material because it was not a "Mineral" under the lease. Then in final submissions HBL accepted that the clay was a Mineral for the purpose of the lease. In the last analysis, the issue whether the "clay" was a Mineral as defined does not matter, because I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was an agreement between AMES and Global, respectively, and HBL, under which HBL was at liberty to sell this material to the Council without paying royalties under the lease.  HBL relied on the evidence of Brenda Egan, Keith Dunbier and Narlissa
Briggs, as well as documentary evidence.  Ms Egan was the group credit manager of HBL. She gave evidence that early in 2000, she received a telephone call from Wayne Stafford in which he made a number of complaints about rates, something that was not uncommon for him to do. She went to Mr Breeze, then the managing director of HBL, and they both spoke to Mr Stafford on a conference call (although she said in cross- examination that she was not in the room for the whole conversation). During the conversation, Mr Stafford said:  "We've got a new job with the Council to cap one of its tips. This is great because we can get rid of the clay to get to the basalt and I'll get commission on it."  Ms Egan said that the question of royalties on the clay was raised, and although she could not recall whether it was Mr Breeze or Mr Stafford who spoke, she recalled that the words spoken were to the effect, "royalty will not be paid on this job." She recalled that there was no disagreement with this statement.  Mr Dunbier was manager of the Penrose Quarry for HBL until August 2000. He dealt extensively with Wayne Stafford, whom he regarded as having the day-to- day control of the quarry. He gave evidence that in about March 2000 he put forward a spreadsheet proposal for the extraction of the clay and its supply to the Council, with the assistance of Mr Stafford. The proposal involved purchase of an excavator and payment of a royalty of $1 to the lessor. Mr
Breeze rejected the proposal, and then subsequently the extraction of the clay went ahead, using one of the quarry's existing machines. Mr Dunbier expressed the opinion that Wayne Stafford was aware at all times that the clay was being excavated and sold to the Council.  He said that on the morning of 22 April 2002, he received a telephone call from Mr Stafford, and they had a conversation to the following effect: 
Mr Stafford: "Do you remember that material we sold to the Council in 2000?" 
Mr Dunbier: "Yeah, didn't you agree to waive your rights to royalty on that?" 
Mr Stafford: "I agreed to no such thing."  Ms Briggs was employed by HBL as a trainee manager at the Penrose Quarry from 2000 to March 2001. Early in 2000 Wayne Stafford trained her in management matters. She was involved in the delivery of clay to the Council, and she identified various documents created in connection with that work. The documents included a purchase order from the Council dated 2 March 2000 for the supply and delivery of "clay"; a job master form which she created on 13
September 2000 for internal processing by HBL; a report she prepared for Mr
Stafford analysing the Penrose Quarry product sold in the calendar year 2000, including an entry for "clay"; a weekly production report for Mr Stafford which summarised tonnes sold and hours worked; and a daily tonnage summary, prepared on a weekly basis for Mr Breeze, copied to Mr Stafford, identifying tonnage of clay. Some of these reports were prepared and given to Mr Stafford after 2 May 2000, when Global became registered proprietor of the quarry.  Wayne Stafford gave evidence denying that there was any arrangement under which royalties would not be paid on material sold to the Council. He said he thought royalties were being paid on that material, which he said was always referred to as "decomposed basalt".  In my opinion the evidence of HBL's witnesses is to be preferred to the evidence given by Wayne Stafford, to the extent of the inconsistencies. His evidence that the material was always referred to as "decomposed basalt" was specifically contradicted by Ms Briggs, who took instructions directly from him, and was inconsistent with the documents identified by Ms Briggs, including reports provided to Mr Stafford. Eventually Mr Stafford accepted under cross-examination that the material was referred to as "clay" in HBL's records as well as in documents prepared by Mr Stafford himself.  Mr Stafford's evidence that he thought royalties were being paid on clay was contradicted by other evidence. First, it was contradicted by Ms Egan's evidence of the telephone conference of Mr Breeze, Wayne Stafford and herself early in 2000. Global attacked Ms Egan's evidence because it was evidence of only part of a conversation. In my opinion Ms Egan gave clear and truthful evidence, to which she adhered consistently in cross-examination. The fact that she was not able to recall the whole of the conversation did not, in my view, undermine the evidence she gave about the parts she remembered. Her evidence was to the effect that during the telephone conference, it came to be understood between Mr Breeze (who is no longer the managing director of
HBL)and Mr Stafford that there would be no royalty paid on the material supplied to the Council. I do not regard the absence of evidence directly from
Mr Breeze as an impediment to my finding that the conversation took place as deposed to by Ms Egan, given the strength of her evidence.  Secondly, Mr Stafford's evidence was contradicted by Mr Dunbier's evidence of his telephone conversation with Mr Stafford on the morning of 22 April , from which it appears that, at least by 22 April 2002, Mr Stafford was aware of HBL's position with respect to the clay. Mr Stafford denied Mr
Dunbier's version of that conversation, but I prefer Mr Dunbier's evidence because of the weaknesses in Mr Stafford's evidence.  Thirdly, it was contradicted by Mr Dunbier's evidence that he prepared the spreadsheet proposal early in 2000 with assistance from Mr Stafford, to the extent that Mr Dunbier's evidence suggests that Mr Stafford was involved in the process of negotiation with the Council.  Fourthly, it was contradicted by an e-mail dated 21 November 2000 from Mr
Rankin to Mr Stafford. In that e-mail, Mr Rankin provided Mr Stafford with tonnage figures to challenge Mr Stafford's claim to payment of additional royalties. The figures provided by Mr Rankin included figures for clay. Mr
Stafford conceded in cross-examination that the difference between his calculation and the figures in the e-mail could be explained by the absence of royalties on materials supplied to the Council.  My conclusion is that an agreement was reached between Mr Breeze on behalf of HBL and Mr Stafford early in 2000, according to which royalties would not be charged on the material supplied to the Council. Mr Stafford was at that time in a position to bind AMES, still the registered proprietor of the quarry, because he was a director and was actively involved in the management of AMES. In my opinion the agreement made in early 2000 was intended to be, and was, binding upon AMES.  Mr Stafford also had day-to-day management of the business of Global, and was in a position to bind it to the agreement. Global was at that time the unregistered transferee of the land. In my opinion, when Mr Stafford agreed with Mr Breeze on the telephone that royalties would not be charged on materials supplied to the Council, he did so on behalf of both the registered proprietor and transferor of the land, and on behalf of the unregistered transferee. Any doubt about whether Global was bound by the arrangement is removed by consideration of the documentary evidence, from which it was clear that Mr Stafford, in his position of manager of the business of Global, received reports after 2 May 2000 which made it clear that HBL was continuing to extract and supply clay to the Council. Having made the arrangement with Mr
Breeze early in the year 2000, Mr Stafford must have realised that if clay was still being supplied to the Council, the extraction was occurring on the same basis.  My conclusion is that neither AMES nor Global is entitled to royalties in respect of the clay extracted from the quarry and sold to the Council.  
Increase in the Standard Quantity to 350,000 tonnes ("holiday tonnes")  The lease provided that HBL was to pay royalties comprising the Minimum
Royalty and the Further Royalty. The Minimum Royalty was payable in respect of amounts of Minerals up to the Standard Quantity. The lease defined the
Standard Quantity as 250,000 tonnes.  On 29 May 1998 AMES wrote to HBL, expressing its willingness "to help HBL with a goodwill gesture to help finance the Penrose upgrade". The letter set out an agreement under which HBL would go ahead with the proposed upgrade, and:  "Provide [sic] that HBL continues to pay all Royalties due and payable in accordance with clause 3.1 of the lease of 13th November 1995, then AMES will for a period of 34 months, or up to 13 November 2000, not require HBL to pay excess royalties to the amount of 350,000 tonnes. Any tonnes above 350,000 tonnes will be treated as excess royalty and be paid in accordance with the lease."  The letter set out some conditions, which are no longer relevant. It was signed by Wayne and Garry Stafford as directors of AMES, and countersigned by
Max Dunbier and Terry Fordham as directors of HBL.  On 8 July 1998 Mr Breeze on behalf of HBL wrote to Mr Kekatos confirming that the "renegotiated royalty arrangement dated 29 May 1998" had been tabled at an HBL board meeting, the minutes of which recorded the changes in the royalty arrangement between 250,000 and 350,000 tonnes. On 18 July 1998 Mr
Kekatos wrote to Mr Breeze confirming that the agreement set out in the letters of 29 May and 8 July 1998 was not conditional as stated in the letter of 29 May, and consequently "the agreement may be treated in all respects as a variation of the terms of the royalty agreement being registered number and therefore in all respects the royalty agreement as now varied represents the basis of your companies [sic] use and occupation of the Penrose
Quarry". On 31 August 1998 Mr Breeze wrote to AMES on behalf of HBL stating that the details set out in the letter of 18 July were acceptable to HBL.
There was no registered variation of the old lease.  Global submitted that these arrangements constituted an agreement between
HBL and AMES, which was operative for the period of 34 months from 13 January to 13 November 2000; but on 2 May 2000 Global became the registered proprietor of the land and was not subject to the contractual variation contained in the letter. According to Global's submission, it was entitled to disregard the holiday tonnes arrangement and seek payment of the Further
Royalty for Minerals extracted in excess of 250,000 tonnes.  In my opinion Global's submission fails for two reasons, earlier discussed: namely, the contractual obligation by AMES not to seek payment of the Further Royalty up to 350,000 tonnes is enforceable by HBL against Global under <case>; and there is an estoppel by convention operating against Global to prevent it from relying on the terms of the original lease that were varied by the agreement.  
Commencing date for increased Further Royalty rate  The first mention in correspondence of the agreement to alter the percentage royalty rate from 12.5% to 11% was in HBL's letter to AMES dated 20
September 1999. That letter confirmed the details of an agreement in two parts. The first part was the agreement to waive clause 8.01 to permit early notice of exercise of the first option. The second part was the agreement to alter the percentage royalty rate.  Global submitted that the terms of HBL's letter suggested an intention that the amended rate would take effect in the renewed lease. I disagree.
Although HBL's letter does not stipulate that the alteration of the percentage royalty rate was to commence immediately, that is a natural construction of the letter, given that the other part of the agreement commenced on that day.
There is nothing commercially irrational in such an arrangement. HBL was agreeing to give early notice of exercise of the option at the specific request of AMES and to suit AMES' circumstances, and in such a case it would not be surprising that the party agreeing to the concession would expect to receive an immediate benefit in return.  In my opinion, the matter is put beyond doubt by the terms of the letter of confirmation written by Mr Kekatos on behalf of AMES to Mr Breeze of HBL on the same day, 20 September 1999. The letter confirmed that AMES agreed to the amendment of clause 3.04(b) by replacement of 12.5% with 11% "effective from this date forth". The quoted words are crystal clear. They have the effect that at the next Review Date (apparently 10 November 1999), when the percentage rate was to be employed, the rate to be used was 11% rather than .5%. Once again there was no registered variation of the old lease.  In its submissions Global drew attention to some additional words of the
AMES letter, namely the words "provided that your company continues to observe all the terms and conditions of the lease from the date hereof including the continuing obligation to pay the royalty reserved in accordance with the lease". Global submitted that this proviso could not apply to a single act (namely the amendment of the current lease) that was to take effect immediately. Again, I disagree. The proviso, if effective, may have allowed
AMES to insist upon the greater percentage rate as a kind of penalty rate in the event of non-compliance by HBL with the terms of the lease, but there is nothing in the proviso that would render it inconsistent with the new percentage royalty rate becoming operative forthwith.  Global also reiterated, in this context, its submissions that the higher rate of 12.5% should apply as from registration of the transfer in its favour on 2 May 2000, because on that date it took the land subject to the registered lease but not subject to any contractual variation of it. Once again, I disagree with that submission on the grounds relating to <case> and estoppel by convention.  
Overpayments to AMES  Global submitted that it was entitled, after it became registered proprietor on 2 May 2000, to royalties on all Minerals in respect of which payments accrued after that date, without any deduction or set-off of royalties (if any) overpaid by HBL to AMES. It drew attention to clause 4.01.1 of the lease, according to which HBL covenanted to "pay the Royalties on the days and in the manner aforesaid clear of all deductions except such as by the law the Lessee is compelled to make notwithstanding agreement to the contrary."  Global submitted that the words "clear of all deductions" operate to prevent HBL from deducting or setting off any overpayments to AMES. It referred to Batiste versus Lenin  <case>, where Bryson J construed the words "without deductions" literally, and submitted that the words "clear of all deductions" should be construed in the same fashion. An appeal from Bryson J's judgment was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal: <case>  In developing this submission, Global made the following points:  overpayments are not rent, since "rent is a sum issuing out of the land demised payable by the lessee to the lessor for the right to occupy that land and all that went with it and use it for the purpose for which it was demised" (Junghenn versus Wood [(1958) 58 SR 327], at );  at common law overpayments of rent cannot be set off against arrears of rent (Fuller versus Happy Shopper Markets Ltd <case>; [[2001] 1 WLR 1681], at 1689 and 1691);  overpaid rent does not run with the lease but is a personal claim by a tenant against the former landlord (Ory & Ory versus Betamore <case>; [(1993) 60 SASR 393], at 405-406).  As I understood his submissions, counsel for HBL conceded this point. He said:  "In relation to the question of principle, we accept that in order to recover over-payments of rent from Global, we have to identify over-payments made to
Global because we are not suing upon any covenant. It is, in effect, a restitutionary claim."  As he was instructed to do, Dr Ferrier made calculations for the whole period from 10 November 1995 to 30 April 2002 as if the lessor were a single entity. In light of HBL's concession, it will be necessary to separate the calculations for scenario 1 so as to identify that part of the total figure representing overpayments to Global.  
Is Global entitled to re-enter the land and determine HBL's interest in the agreement, and to claim damages?  Global submitted that HBL is in occupation of the Penrose Quarry as a tenant at will under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s127.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), on the terms of the expired lease, apart from the terms relating to duration of the lease and others unsuitable to an implied holding over tenancy (citing Redfern & Cassidy, Australian Tenancy Practice & Precedents, vol 1, [3065]).
It submitted that a right of re-entry (for example, for non-payment of rent) is unsuited to a tenancy at will determinable on a month's notice, and a term giving such a right would not be implied into such a tenancy: Bigazzi v
Brandigo Pty Ltd (1981) 2 BPR 9341. Accordingly, Global submitted, it is in a position to terminate the tenancy at will without needing to have recourse to a right of re-entry, simply by giving the one month's notice required under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s127.html)
The question whether HBL is entitled to relief against forfeiture does not arise, according to Global's analysis.  I agree that if one were to consider only the strict position at law, disregarding the agreement for a new lease, HBL would be in occupation of
Quarry as a tenant at will, determinable under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s127.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) on one month's notice. My view, however, is that Global is under an equitable obligation, reinforced by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s118.html), to perform the agreement for a new lease entered into between HBL and AMES on September 1999. HBL is in occupation under the agreement for a new lease, and is to be treated as if it had the tenancy that would be conferred upon it by performance of the agreement, under the rule in Walsh versus Lonsdale. Global should be ordered to perform the agreement and should be restrained from exercising its legal right to determine the tenancy.  The evidence does not establish any entitlement on the part of Global to resist specific performance of the agreement on the ground that HBL is in breach of any of the obligations that the new lease would impose on it. In final submissions, Global did not contend for any breach of the terms of the old lease or the new agreement for lease, or of any other tenancy, except by non-payment of the full amount of royalties alleged to be due to it. I have decided against each of the submissions made by Global on this subject.
Therefore there is no breach available to Global.  
If so, is HBL entitled to relief against forfeiture?  The issue of relief against forfeiture was addressed comprehensively by
HBL in written submissions, before the extent of Global's concessions on allegations of breach I came evident. I was taken in some detail to the principles governing relief against forfeiture, set out in such cases as
Pioneer Quarries (Sydney) Pty Ltd versus Permanent Trustee Co of NSW Ltd (1970) 2
BPR 9562; Platt versus Ong <case>; [[1972] VR 197]; Stieper versus Deviot Pty Ltd (1977) 2 BPR 9602; and Hayes v
Gunbola Pty Ltd (1986) 4 BPR 9247.  In view of Global's concessions with respect to breaches and my decision under the last heading, the question of relief against forfeiture does not now arise. In final submissions counsel for Global, after submitting that the issue of relief against forfeiture did not arise, said:  "I will make this express concession that if your Honour were against us as to the nature of the tenancy and held that it was a tenancy in respect of which forfeiture were appropriate, then there is nothing in the facts of this case which would provide your Honour with a basis for refusing to exercise your discretion in favour of granting relief against forfeiture."  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to observe, in case the matter goes further, that if Global had succeeded in establishing that it was entitled to recover additional payments from HBL because of the "clay" issue, or its ability to escape the arrangements made by AMES with respect to holiday tonnes and the reduced percentage royalty rate, or because it could resist any deduction of overpayments to AMES, HBL's breach would not be of a kind that would lead the Court to deny relief against forfeiture, assuming HBL were to tender the amount found to be owing to Global. Specifically, the evidence would not support any finding that any such breaches were wilful. Although, as
Hope J remarked in the Pioneer Quarries case (at 9572), a lessee is not entitled to relief against forfeiture as of right, and the Court has a discretion in the matter, re-entry is regarded as security for the payment of rent, and if the landlord is able to obtain payment of his rent, relief to the tenant is refused only in very special circumstances.  
Is HBL entitled to recover from Global the sum of $295,778.73 [as revised in June 2003]?  My opinion is that HBL is entitled to recover from Global whatever amount is established as the overpayment of royalties made by HBL to Global (as opposed to AMES), according to the principles that I have adopted. My findings, coupled with concessions by Global, mean that scenario 1 of Dr
Ferrier's royalty model applies and there is a net overpayment, but the amount will be less than the figure of $295,778.73, because that includes overpayments to AMES. HBL has made out its case for judgment in its favour for whatever amount is properly calculated. I shall give directions for HBL to calculate the overpayment to Global.  My provisional view is that overpayments made after 16 December 1999 should be treated as overpayments to Global. That was the date upon which AMES notified HBL that the quarry had been transferred to Global. But I am prepared to receive submissions at or before the next directions hearing should either party contend for a different date.  
Conclusions  HBL has made out its entitlement to declaratory orders as to the existence of the new agreement for the lease of the quarry, and that Global holds its interest as registered proprietor subject to that agreement. It is entitled to an order that Global specifically perform the agreement by granting it a new lease of the Quarry for further term of 11 years, otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of the previous lease (including the option to renew for two further terms of 11 years each), subject to the modifications that were agreed between HBL and AMES according to my findings, to the extent that they are relevant to the renewed term. Global is also entitled to the declarations it has sought to the effect that it is not in breach of any obligations under the old lease or the agreement for the new lease with respect to stated matters, and that Global is not entitled to re-enter the land or terminate the agreement for the new lease or its equitable interest as lessee under that agreement. There is no occasion to make any order by way of relief against forfeiture, but an order should be made restraining Global from terminating
HBL's tenancy or occupation of the quarry pending the grant of the new lease.  Global's cross-claim has failed, except on the technical point that there was no valid exercise of the option to renew the lease, there being instead a valid new agreement for lease. The appropriate course is for the cross-claim to be dismissed.  HBL has succeeded in establishing an entitlement to recover overpayments from Global, but the amount of the overpayments is still to be quantified. I shall direct HBL to prepare and submit to Global and my associate a document setting out the amount for which it claims to be entitled to enter judgment against Global in respect of overpayment of royalties, and I shall stand the proceedings over for subsequent directions. I shall direct HBL to bring in short minutes of the other orders for consideration on that later occasion. I shall also hear the submissions of the parties with respect to costs. I shall consider, at the directions hearing, whether it will be necessary to find another hearing day to deal with these various matters.
