June 1997) `MILANO INVESTMENTS PTY LTD V GROUP DEVELOPERS PTY LTD` `2317/97` `Tuesday 13 May 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG, J` `` `JUDGMENT:` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is an application by a purchaser under a contract for the sale and purchase of property at Maroubra to extend Caveat 2907066, which it has placed on the title to protect its interest under the contract. Leave was given this morning to amend the summons to seek specific performance of that contract.` ` The matter proceeded today technically on an ex parte basis. However, Mrs V
C Gillings, a director of the company, attended the court without legal representation. Authority prevents me from accepting her appearance as an appearance of the company.` ` What I did, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s26.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), was to call Mrs Gillings as the court's own witness, so that she could tell her tale in the only way possible, from the witness box. Before the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), there was some doubt as to whether judges could call witnesses in civil proceedings though probably they could; Obacello Pty Ltd versus Taveraft Pty Ltd [(1986) 10
FCR 518.] The wide power given by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s26.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) takes away any doubt.` ` The court is more and more being faced with litigants in person, and the procedure adopted in this sort of case is fair because it both allows the litigant to tell the court its side of the case and also gives the other side a record of what the litigant's case is on oath. At some stage, Mr Kerr of counsel for the plaintiff, rightly objected to some of the evidence that was being given but, as it was only being received on the present application to extend the caveat, it seemed to me that it should be just let flow.` ` Mrs Gillings made it clear that she considers that the defendant company has four defences to a claim for specific performance, namely, (1) that the counterparts of the contract in question are not identical in form; (2) that the purchaser company never affixed its seal to the contract; (3) that the vendor irregularly affixed its seal in that the Secretary, Mrs Gillings, did not sign under the seal but signed to the left of it; and (4) that there was undue influence or undue pressure put on the other director of the defendant,
Mr Gillings, to agree to the sale.` ` It is not for me to consider the weight of any of those defences. There is sufficient there to make me decline to make any order for specific performance today, though I could not have done so anyhow as the contract does not appear to have been stamped, and there is no evidence that the purchaser is ready, willing and able to complete. This lack of material is explained by the fact that the purchaser never intended to press for a full decree of specific performance today, it merely wanted to extend the caveat until further order.` ` Under <case> of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/rpa178/), the court is to extend the caveat if it considers it just to do so in a case where the caveat may have substance. The material before the court shows that the purchaser's claim that there is a contract may well have substance, and so it is appropriate that the caveat be extended until further order, in order that that claim can be contested.` ` I will stand the matter of the specific performance over for three weeks before the Registrar. The plaintiff's affidavits are to be filed and served no later than 21 May 1997, and I will stand the matter over then to the
Registrar's list on 3 June 1997 at 9.30 am. Any documents to be served on the defendant may be served at Level 1, 803 Anzac Parade, Maroubra. ` ``The Exhibits may be returned.

I will make order 1 in the summons that Caveat 2907066 be extended until further order of the court. Costs reserved.
