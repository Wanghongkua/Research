REGINA versus MARK FRANCIS MARCOVICH /98 May 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: In the matter of Mark Francis Marcovich, matter number 18 in today's list, Mr. Lloyd of Queen's Counsel appears for the applicant who seeks bail pending an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia in a point that had arisen in proceedings in which, prior to my coming onto the bench, I had advised. 
The Court of Criminal Appeal judgment squarely turned on that point and the application for leave squarely turns upon that point on which I had advised a co-accused in the very same trial. It is a point that occasioned the Court of
Criminal Appeal such interest as to delay the judgment in that court for a year. It is a matter of some contention and a matter of some wider implication than in respect of the individual case.

In the circumstances, it is a matter in which I should not sit. I therefore disqualify myself.
