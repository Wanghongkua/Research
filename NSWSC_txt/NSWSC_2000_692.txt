AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Reasons - Admissibility - press cuttings - public interest - [ss 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s15.html) & [16](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s16.html) [Defamation Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/) - qualified privilege) The defendant tendered a bundle of newspaper clippings including MFI's 3, 6, , 13, 31, 33, 34 and 35 together with a video of the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation's 7.30 Report of 4 August 1992 (MFI 11). On 18 July I admitted the documents into evidence as Exhibit 264.
 The material was tendered on the issue of "public interest".
 It was tendered on that issue in relation to the defence under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s16.html) (contextual truth) and as relevant to issues arising under the defence of qualified privilege.
 At T5199.35-40 it is stated for the plaintiff that in relation to the defence under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/s15.html) there was no issue that the imputations the defendant was seeking to justify related to a matter of public interest. That position was not taken with respect to contextual imputations.
 It is to be understood that the material, if admitted, is to be admitted only as evidence of matters in fact published by the respective instruments of the media and not the truth of the contents nor the honesty of opinions held by leader writers and columnists nor the factual foundation for any such opinions.
 It was argued by the defendant that in addition to the material being relevant to the issue of public interest as required by the justification defences by statute, it is relevant to issues arising under the defence of qualified privilege at common law.
 This aspect of the defence will be approached in three ways: first, what is described as traditional common law qualified privilege founded upon reciprocity of duty and interest. The second category of common law privilege to be relied upon is said to be that "identified" by the High Court in
Lange versus Australian Broadcasting Corporation <case>; <case>; [(1999) 3 WLR 1010.] It is in relation to the second and third categories in particular that it was said that this material is of relevance insofar as it is capable of demonstrating that the plaintiff who had held high office, as the holder of such office, and in terms of his sexual conduct, as a matter of fact, irrespective of the cause, was the subject of "public interest".
 The notion of a subject of public interest is wide in its ambit (see, for example, the discussion in Bellino versus Australian Broadcasting Corporation <case>; [(1995-6) 185 CLR 183], though noting the High Court was there concerned with the application of s (8) of the Criminal Code (Q.)).
 For the plaintiff it was argued that the decision of the Court of Appeal (14
June 1984) in Chappell versus Mirror Newspapers Limited [(1984) Aust Torts
Reports 80,691] conclusively excludes the admissibility of this kind of evidence. With that submission I cannot find myself in agreement. The Court of
Appeal was there concerned principally with the use of newspaper cuttings in relation to a defence under <case>, the misuse of such material in relation to the defence of truth and its unavailability in the there relevant areas in respect of reputation.
 It was further submitted that insofar as the bulk of the material (save for about two articles) makes no reference to the sexual conduct referred to in the imputations, it is thereby irrelevant and inadmissible. I am not persuaded by that argument in the context of the relationship of the imputation to a matter of public interest; the phrase "relate to" cannot be so narrow, nor in relation to what I will simply describe, for present purposes, as the "status" of the plaintiff in relation to the two components of the defence of qualified privilege referred to above.
 The submissions adumbrated in the course of argument as to the admissibility of the folder of documents will no doubt be amplified in the substantive submissions as to whether or not the defence of qualified privilege has been made out and if it is still a live issue whether or not the contextual imputations relate to a matter of public interest.
 I am persuaded that the tendered material is "relevant" to those issues as advanced for the defendant. The bundle of documents including those marked for identification I set out at the beginning of these reasons thus became exhibit 264.
