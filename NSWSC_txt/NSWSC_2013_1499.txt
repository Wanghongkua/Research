JUDGMENT
On 17 September 2013 I gave judgment on a Notice of Motion filed 6 September 2013: Van Der Velde as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Jagjit Singh and Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Sarbjit Kaur versus Singh <case> The judgment dealt with the right of the trustee to obtain possession of the Certificates of Title by reason of his appointment as trustee of the bankrupt estates of the Defendants. 
I made an order pursuant to <case> [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) requiring the Defendants to produce the Certificate of Titles for the properties and an alternative order that,0 if they failed to do so, pursuant to [s 138](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s138.html) of the [Real Property Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) the Registrar-General issue a new Certificates of Title for the properties. 
At the hearing of the Motion my attention was not drawn to that part of [s 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s15.html) of the Act which provided that the order must specify a day to be named for the production by the person of the Certificates of Title. Application is now made by the Plaintiff pursuant to r 36.17 UCPR (the "slip rule") to vary order 2 to name a date upon which the Certificates of Title are required to be produced.
I am satisfied that the matter falls squarely within r 36.17. If the matter had been raised at the hearing the order would have included a date by which the Certificates of Title were to be produced: Barrell Insurances Pty Ltd versus Pennant Hills Restaurants Pty Ltd [(1983) 58 ALJR 51] at 876-877. 
Accordingly order 2 made on 17 September 2013 is varied to read as follows: 
An order pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s15.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) that the
Defendants be required to produce the Certificate of Titles on or before 22
October 2013 for the following properties: i. the land and premises known as Unit 7, 33 Bowden Street, Harris Park in the
State of New South Wales, being the whole of the land comprised in Folio
Identifier 7/SP11723; and ii. the land and premises known as 148 Aberglassyn Road, Rutherford in the
State of New South Wales, being the whole of the land comprised in Folio
Identifier 1822/1090379.
In the circumstances the amended order is to be served on the Defendants by 5pm on 15 October 2013.
