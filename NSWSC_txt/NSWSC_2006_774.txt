Friday, 28 July 2006  /06 Wei Hong Meng versus Biguang Pan  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application for short service of a notice of motion and summons. The summons seeks an order pursuant to [s
O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74o.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) for leave to the plaintiff to lodge a further caveat in respect of land in folio identifier 1/521192. The notice of motion seeks orders for short service of the summons. Counsel has also moved this morning ex parte for an order that the operation of an existing caveat lodged on the title of the property be extended until Friday, 4 August 2006.  In his affidavit, the plaintiff deposes to being a 50 percent shareholder in the company which is the registered proprietor of the property and to having been purportedly removed as a director of the company. He deposes that in
September last year he "lodged caveats on the properties owned by [the company] to protect my shareholding and investments". It appears that a lapsing notice was served in April 2006 and the caveat, in due course, lapsed.  A further caveat was lodged on or about 30 June 2006 in which the plaintiff describes the claimed estate or interest in the land in the following terms:  "Caveator is 50 percent shareholder and director of registered proprietary company. ASIC records have been illegally changed."  The Registrar-General has given notice that as this caveat relies on substantially the same facts, and claims the same interest, as the previously lapsed caveat, its lodgement was in breach of [s
O](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74o.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) and it will be removed in seven days unless there is a contrary order of this court.  It is plain that the matters relied upon by the plaintiff as giving rise to an equitable interest in the land do not do so. At best, the plaintiff is a shareholder in the company which owns the land. It is trite that a shareholder does not have an equitable interest in the property of the company. No caveatable interest is shown.  I think the only appropriate order is the summons be dismissed. I so order.
