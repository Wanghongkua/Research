Appeal upheld;
Declaration and orders made in the Common Law Division of the Supreme
Court by Ireland J, set aside;
Conviction and sentence imposed by Mr M Dowd LCM reinstated; and
The appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.
JUDGE1
KIRBY ACJ This appeal comes from a declaration by Ireland J that a conviction recorded by Mr M Dowd LCM against the respondent Mr E B Kennard, was bad in law so that the appellant, MT G A Fitzgerald, a police officer, should be prohibited from proceeding upon it and the conviction quashed.
The facts are stated in the judgment of Cole
JA. Three questions are presented for decision:
Is the appeal to this Court from the effective discharge of a criminal offence, ordered by Ireland J, such as to impose upon this Court principles of restraint proper to appeals against acquittals and discharge of criminal accusations?;
Did Ireland J err in holding that, to make out a charge of indecent assault under [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), the prosecution must prove that an assault has occurred "in the customary sense", ie that the accused by conduct intentionally or recklessly put the victim in fear of physical or other unlawful danger?; and
Did Ireland J err in holding that, to establish the offence under [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) with which the respondent was charged, it was necessary to prove that he gave consideration to whether the complainant was consenting or not so that a failure to advert to that issue, if accepted, would prevent conviction? 
Double jeopardy
I agree with Cole
JA that having regard to the procedure which the respondent pursued under [s 112](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s112.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), the matter is still alive within the court system. The respondent should be taken to understand that the further appeal to this
Court (and, if special leave were granted, the still further appeal to the High Court of Australia) are part of the ordinary process of determining the lawfulness of his conviction or acquittal. In that sense, the declaration and orders of Ireland were not equivalent to a verdict of acquittal by a jury after a trial on the merits. See Registrar, Court of
Appeal versus Craven (No 2), Court of Appeal unreported, 30 June 1995; (1995)
NSWJB 70 and cases there cited. See especially Davern versus Messel <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR ], 37, 55. Whilst the present case remains within the Court system, decisions at different levels of the hierarchy are not a final acquittal or conviction of the respondent. In this appeal, this Court has its function to discharge.
Until the end of the appellate line is reached, the proceedings between the appellant and the respondent have not been finally adjudicated upon. There is therefore no impediment in this Court's determining the appeal on the merits.
 
Indecent assault
The amendment to the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924, s 5 (which introduced <case>, the precursor to the section under which the respondent was charged) certainly adopted a formula of words which gave support to the conclusion which Ireland J reached. Instead of persisting with an adverbial expression ("indecently assaults"), the drafter adopted a disjunctive phrase giving rise to a possible construction of separate components ("whoever assaults ... and at the time ... commits any act of indecency"). But very shortly after this amendment, the Full Court of the
Supreme Court was called upon to give meaning to the new definition. In R v
Sorlie <case>; [(1925) 25 SR 532 (FC)], the Court rejected the submission that there must be "not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind and an independent act of indecency". The authority of this holding has stood for more than seventy years. When [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) was drafted in like terminology, it must be assumed that the andafter and Parliament were aware of
Sorlie and intended the same approach to be applied. It is now too late to resurrect the rejected arguments of 1924, to re-dissect the statutory requirements and to oblige the prosecution to prove both an assault and an independent act of indecency.
I therefore agree with the other members of the
Court that, to the extent that Ireland J concluded that it was necessary for the appellant to prove an assault "in the customary sense", ie that he intentionally or recklessly put his victim in fear of immediate physical or other unlawful danger, he erred.
This foundation for his Honour's declaration and orders is therefore removed.
It is not clear how important this step was to the ultimate determination reached by Ireland J. The magistrate had found that the respondent certainly touched the complainant and this was not in dispute. He also found that the act of touching caused her "sufficient fear to make it within the meaning of the definition a hostile act". The complainant gave evidence that she was afraid for her position when the respondent proceeded to touch her. Whilst some of the complainant's conduct was ambiguous and even arguably ambivalent it was open to the magistrate (who had advantages which neither Ireland J nor this Court enjoy) to believe the complainant, as he clearly did. Therefore, upon whichever statutory test was applied, its requirements would have been fulfilled upon the findings of the magistrate. But the correct statutory test was that expressed in 1924 in Sorlie. Despite the disjunctive expression of the statutory formula for indecent assault it is enough that an assault should be proved which of itself amounts to the commission of an act of indecency.
This is not a surprising conclusion given that the social purpose of the offence is to restrain, and where it occurs, to sanction assaults which are directed, relevantly, to such parts of the person of the victim as to involve an act of indecency. The requirement, which Ireland J thought to be necessary, to prove an assault in the traditional sense, would undermine the achievement of the sensible purpose of the statutory offence. To the extent that longstanding authority and supervening legislation apparently based upon it does not persuade, the proper and intended application of the offence should remove any lingering doubts.
 
Non-advertent recklessness
This leaves the issue of whether, absent knowledge in the accused that the complainant was not consenting, his failure to address his mind at all to the existence or absence of her consent was fatal to the proof by the prosecution of the offence under [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/).
The magistrate's finding involved an acceptance that the complainant did not consent to the respondent's touching of her person in areas of her body that would ordinarily be regarded as private and intimate.
The magistrate concluded that, although the respondent did not act intentionally to over-ride the want of clearly given consent on the part of the complainant, he did act recklessly.
This was so because: "He simply put the mailer out of his mind in a sufficiently reckless fashion to enable me to come to the finding that there was in fact so far as he was concerned the necessary mens rea to commit the offence." 
Ireland J determined that this finding was legally wrong. He held that it was not enough that the respondent should have failed to avert to whether the complainant was, or was not, consenting to his actions. It was necessary for the prosecution to prove either that the accused adverted or that he intended to act "whether the victim consents or no".
There are passages in the judgments of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in R v Henning, unreported, CCA , 11 May 1990 and R versus Kitchener [(1993) 29
NSWLR 696 (CCA)] which established that, for an offence of sexual intercourse, the necessary intention may be established by inadvertent recklessness or non-advertent recklessness. See eg Kitchener, 703. The respondent criticised
Henning and Kitchener. He argued that they were wrongly decided and should not be followed by this Court.
However, Henning and Kitchener are now established statements of the law in this State. They are regularly applied. An invitation, in effect, not to follow them has been declined by the Court of Criminal
Appeal in R versus Tolmie,
CCA , unreported, 6 October 1995. Until the legislature amends the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) or the High Court overrules Henning, Kitchener and Tomie, they must be taken to establish that inadvertent recklessness or non-advertent recklessness sufficiently make out the intention necessary for offences of sexual intercourse as provided by the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The respondent persuaded Ireland J that a point of distinction between the offences dealt with in Henning and
Kitchener was the absence of a statutory provision "deeming the (accused) to have the necessary knowledge as a foundation for his recklessness". In respect of [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) there is no provision equivalent to the former s
D(2) referred to in Henning and Kitchener. Nor is there an applicable provision such as <case> which was invoked by the Crown in Tolmie.
This appeal therefore squarely presents the issue of whether, absent such statutory extension, applicable in Henning, Kitchener and Tolmie but inapplicable in this case, the common law will fill in the gap and do the same work.
Section 61D(1) was, for all relevant purposes, identical to <case> in the
Act as present. It states: "61R For the purposes of sections 61I and 61J a person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse is to be taken to know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse." 
It will be observed that <case> is not extended to apply to <case>. It is only under the less serious provision of <case> that the respondent was charged.
Does this make a difference, as Ireland J inferred?
To answer this question, it is necessary to ask another. Why did
Parliament consider that it was necessary to provide in the terms of the former <case> and the present <case>? Why were such provisions necessary if, as the appellant asserts, the common law did the work of importing knowledge of non-consent where the accused is reckless as to whether the other person consents or not? Presumably, a point of differentiation was intended by
Parliament. Otherwise it would have been simple to extend the application of s
R to other sexual offences including those under <case>. By implication, the reason for holding back from applying <case> to offences under <case> is that it was thought appropriate to apply a higher standard in the case of the more serious offences under s 61I and 61J than under other sexual offences, including <case>. Upon this view, the social object of <case> is to make the point that the accused's knowledge of the absence of the consent of the victim of sexual intercourse may be proved by establishing recklessness.
It will, by statutory provision, be taken in such cases to equate to knowledge of non-consent. In less serious invasions of sexual integrity, such as indecent assaults, the usual rule of the common law will obtain. In such cases, the prosecution will be obliged to prove, without benefit of statutory presumptions, that the accused did not knew that the victim was not consenting or knowing that the victim might not be, decided to go ahead.
Like Ireland J, I feel obliged to give effect to the differentiated language of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) as relevant to the offence under [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) charged here. This approach appears consonant both with the ordinary principle governing proof of intention on the part of the accused and with the recent authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State. In R versus Bonora [(1994) NSWLR 74 (CCA)] at 75, Finlay J, dealing with a case of indecent assault under <case> of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) summed up the position, accurately in my view: "For there to be an assault the law requires an intentional application of force to the person of another which is unlawful. For it to be an unlawful act of the accused there must be no lawful justification for it.

Consent in this case would be a lawful justification or excuse.
Moreover, to establish the guilty mind of the accused the
Crown must prove not only that the woman in this case did not consent but that the accused had a guilty mind in that he knew she was not consenting or, aware that she might not be consenting nevertheless determined to touch her." 
The jury's verdict determined their acceptance that the young woman did not consent to the intentional touching of her. The flaw in the trial is that the jury was never asked to find whether the Crown had also established that the accused knew she was not consenting or, aware that she might not be consenting, nevertheless determined to touch her. This requires this Court to intervene and quash the convictions." (emphasis added)
I have every sympathy for the proposition, advanced for the appellant that, in cases of indecent assault such as those likely to be prosecuted, the total indifference of the accused to the consent, or absence of the consent, to the indecent touching is unacceptable and should be criminally sanctioned.
Such a view is consistent with what I said in Kitchener and reaffirmed in
Tolmie. But it is important to realise that the departure in those cases from the long established requirement upon the prosecution to prove that the accused's wrongful acts were done intentionally, was sustained by support in the statutory presumption for which Parliament had expressly provided. There is no such presumption in the instant case. The ordinary rule must therefore be applied. That rule is as stated in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Bonora.
 .
Given the differentiation provided by the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) as to the consequences of recklessness for different, and more serious, cases of sexual invasion of another person, I do not consider that this Court can proceed simply to apply the general common law doctrine about non-advertent recklessness. What might have been possible had <case> of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) not existed is, in my view, impermissible, given that Parliament has expressly provided for some, but not other, cases. For this reason, I do not feel at liberty, however sympathetic I may be, to apply to a prosecution for indecent assault in this State the general law as to non-advertent recklessness stated in other cases, including R versus Kimber [(1983) 3 All ER 316 (CA)], 319. I acknowledge the care that must be used in the application of the canon of construction known as expressio unius. See Houssein and Anor versus The
Under-Secretary, Department of Industrial Relations and Technology NSW and
Anor <case>; [(1982) 148 CLR 88], 343. But the apparent deliberateness of the special treatment of [ss 61I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61i.html) and [61J](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61j.html) in <case> of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), and the apparently intentional non-application of the presumption there stated to the lesser offences of sexual assault such as stated in [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) (with which the respondent was charged) obliges this Court to reflect the differentiation which Parliament, with apparent care, has enacted. The principle that criminal statutes are strictly construed and that established doctrine as to the obligation of the prosecution to prove the accused's intention beyond reasonable doubt is not displaced without clear language cannot be overridden simply because the result may appear socially undesirable. See Murphy versus Farmer [(1988) 165 CLR 19], 20. If Parliament intends, for the purposes of [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html), that a person who indecently assaults another person without consent of that person and who is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the assault is to be taken to know that that other person does not consent to the indecent assault, it can so provide. To this date, it has not done so.
 
Relief
The result is that I agree with the other members of the Court that this
Court may entertain the appeal and contemplate setting aside Ireland J's discharge of the respondent.
I also agree with the other members of the Court that Ireland J erred in the construction which he gave to the constituent parts of the offence of indecent assault under [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/).
Where I differ from the majority is in relation to the proper approach to non-advertent recklessness in this case.
 .
With respect, I do not feel that Henning, Kitchener or Tolmie provide the solution to this case for each depends either on the former s 61D of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) or <case>, neither of which are available to the appellant in his prosecution of the respondent.
Because I believe that Ireland
J's approach to the test to be applied was ultimately affected by his Honour's misunderstanding of the components of the offence under [s 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html), I cannot sustain the declaration and orders which he made. Nor is it clear that Mr Dowd LCM correctly addressed his mind to the critical question concerning the respondent's belief about the complainant's consent or absence of consent. That question has since been accurately explained in Bonora, in the passage from the judgment of Finlay J which I have extracted.
To the complaint that the resulting construction of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) is odd, ie that knowledge must be proved in the less serious case of indecent assault and will be presumed from reckless indifference in the more serious cases of sexual intercourse, there are two answers. That is what Parliament has expressly provided. And arguably that it reflects the view that, for serious invasions of the dignity and privacy of the victim, the law requires the accused to be aware of consent or lack of it. Whereas for the great variety of conduct (some of it relatively trivial) which may, in law, constitute indecent assault (as the courts have defined it) the prosecution should still have to prove advertent knowledge to fix the accused with a criminal conviction and the serious consequences that potentially flow from it.
The proceedings in the Supreme Court are brought pursuant to [s 112](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s112.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). Under [s 112(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s112.html) of that Act the Court may, in addition to ordering that the justice and the prosecutor be restrained from maintaining the conviction, make such further order as the nature of the case requires.
The nature of the case requires that the matter be returned to the Local
Court for further findings to be made in the light of the elucidation of the applicable law. For this to be done, it is appropriate that the conviction entered against the respondent by Mr Dowd LCM should be quashed and an order made that the proceedings be returned to the Local Court.
 
Orders
I favour the following orders:
Appeal allowed;
Set aside the declaration and orders of Ireland J;
In lieu thereof: 
Order that the conviction recorded against the respondent, Ernest Bruce
Kennard be set aside; 
Prohibit the appellant from proceeding upon or in respect of the said conviction; 
Order that the proceedings be returned to the Local Court to be dealt with in accordance with law;
In accordance with the condition on the grant of leave to appeal, the appellant to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.
JUDGE2
SHELLER JA I have had the benefit of reading the judgment prepared by Cole
JA. I need not repeat the facts or the circumstances which brought this appeal before the Court.
 
INDECENT ASSAULT [Section 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) uses language, introduced by s5 of the
Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924, which departs from the composite expression "indecently assaults" in favour of isolating two matters for consideration; whether by the conduct complained of a person assaulted another person and whether at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, the person committed an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person. In 1925 in R versus Sorlie <case>; [(1925) 25 SR 532] at 535 Street CJ with the concurrence of the other members of the Court rejected the contention that what was contemplated was not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind, and an independent act of indecency. His Honour said: "I think that any assault, which of itself amounts to the commission of an act of indecency upon the female assaulted or which is of such a character as to involve an act of indecency upon her, comes within the terms of the section, and is a punishable offence." 
So the law has stood since.
In R versus Court [(1989) AC 28] at 47-8 Lord Goff said that no distinction was drawn in the section of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (UK) providing for the offence of indecent assault between an assault and a battery.
 ".... the expression 'indecent assault' must have been intended to embrace both an assault and a battery though, paradoxically, an indecent assault will normally take the form of a battery.

Furthermore in practice recklessness must very rarely be relevant in cases of indecent assault, except in cases where the defendant was reckless whether the victim was consenting or not - as to which see R versus Kimber [(1983) 1 WLR 1118.] The mental element must in fact, I imagine, nearly always be simply intention; ... "
In Faulkner versus Talbot [(1981) 1 WLR 1528] at 1534 Lord Lane CJ described an assault as "any intentional touching of another person without the consent of that person and without lawful excuse". It need not necessarily be hostile or rude or aggressive; see generally Court at 41-2 and 47-8. In The Queen v
Phillips <case>; [(1971) 45 ALJR 467] at 472 Barwick CJ said that in his opinion physical contact, even if intentional and involving the application of force, was not a battery at common law unless it was made in "an angry, revengeful, rude, insolent or hostile manner". Later at 473 his Honour said that with respect to the need for hostility in the act which was said to be an unlawful assault under the Tasmanian Criminal Code he did not mean in any wise to trench upon the ground which had been covered by discussion in connection with indecent assaults.
"In that area I would respectfully agree that the circumstances of the physical contact of one person with another which makes that contact indecent make it unnecessary upon a charge of indecent assault to establish some 'hostility' over or above the actual circumstances of the indecency in the contact of the two persons." In Boughey versus The Queen <case>; [(1986) CLR 10] Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ in a joint judgment at 26 referred to the Chief Justice's judgment in Phillips and said that, to the extent that passages in it provided literal support for the proposition that a physical attack upon a person cannot constitute common law battery unless accompanied by actual hostility towards the victim, they should not be accepted as good law. I read the judgment of
Gibbs CJ as agreeing with this; 15. On the other hand the fifth member of the Court, Brennan J, at 38-9 said that the statement by the Chief Justice was no novel statement of the common law. His Honour added, however,: "To apply force to another without his consent is, generally speaking, a hostile act and therefore unlawful." 
CONSENT
Consent transforms what would otherwise be unlawful into accepted and therefore acceptable conduct; Secretary, Department of Health and Community
Services versus JWB and SMB (Marion's Case) <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 218] at 233. Thus to prove that the touching was unlawful the Crown must prove that it was without the consent of the person touched.
In this case the magistrate found that the touching was without the complainant's consent.
 
MENS REA
R versus Morgan <case>; [(1976) AC 182] was an appeal against convictions for rape. At least three members of the House of Lords stressed that rape consisted in intentionally having intercourse with a woman who does not consent; 201, 215 and 237. The guilty state of mind is that intention. At 214 Lord Hailsham said: "Once one has accepted, what seems to me abundantly clear, that the prohibited act in rape is non-consensual sexual intercourse, and that the guilty state of mind is an intention to commit it, it seems to me to follow as a matter of inexorable logic that there is no room either for a 'defence' of honest belief or mistake, or of a defence of honest and reasonable belief or mistake. Either the prosecution proves that the accused had the requisite intent, or it does not. In the former case it succeeds, and in the latter it fails. Since honest belief clearly negatives intent, the reasonableness or otherwise of that belief can only be evidence for or against the view that the belief and therefore the intent was actually held ..."
Elsewhere in his speech Lord Hailsham said (at 209 and 215) that if the intention of the accused is to have intercourse nolens volens, that is recklessly and not caring whether the victim be a consenting party or not, that is equivalent on ordinary principles to an intent to do the prohibited act without the consent of the victim. ".... the prohibited act is and always has been intercourse without consent of the victim and the mental element is and always has been the intention to commit that act, or the equivalent intention of having intercourse willy-nilly not caring whether the victim consents or no." Intention is not established if the accused believed the victim had consented. But if the accused had no such belief or was indifferent to whether the victim consented or not the offence was made out. At 221 Lord
Simon acknowledged the policy of the law and its concern to hold a fair balance between victim and accused.
In He Kaw Teh versus The Queen <case>; [(1985) 157 CLR 523] at 571-2 Brennan J said that in Morgan the speeches treated the relevant external elements of the crime (sexual intercourse and the non-consent) as integral parts of the whole act to which a single mental state (intent) applied. It followed that intent applied not only to the physical act of intercourse but to the element of non-consent.
At 578-9 his Honour said: "If the question whether
Morgan should be followed were to arise for decision in this Court, I should think it relevant to consider whether the act involved in the crime includes non-consent as an integral part of the act involved or as an attendant circumstance and, if the latter, whether a woman's freedom to give or withhold consent to extra-marital intercourse is properly protected by holding a man liable to conviction for rape only if he has extra-marital intercourse knowing that the woman is not consenting or whether he should be liable to conviction for rape unless he has at least reasonable grounds for believing and believes that she consents.
The policy of the law, to which Lord Simon of Glaisdale referred in Morgan, is a valid consideration when applied to statutory offences as it is when applied to common law offences."
In R versus Kitchener [(1993) 29 NSWLR 696] at 702-3 Carruthers J, with whose judgment the President and Smart J agreed, quoted with approval the concept of the requisite mens rea explained in Morgan and in R versus Brown [(1975) 10 SASR 139] at 147. In particular his Honour quoted Lord Cross' statement at 203 "....
rape, to my mind imports at least indifference as to the woman's consent" and
Lord Edmund-Davies' statement at 225 "the man should have the necessary mens rea if he set about having intercourse either against the woman's will or recklessly, without caring whether or not she was a consenting party" as well as the last two of Lord Hailsham's statements to which I have referred. In
Kitchener Kirby P said at 697: "To criminalise conscious advertence to the possibility of non-consent, but to excuse the reckless failure of the accused to give a moment's thought to that possibility, is self-evidently unacceptable. In the hierarchy of wrongdoing, such total indifference to the consent of a person to have sexual intercourse is plainly reckless, at least in our society today. Every individual has a right to the human dignity of his or her own person. Having sexual intercourse with another, without the consent of that other, amounts to an affront to that other's human dignity and an invasion of the privacy of that person's body and personality. It would be unacceptable to construe a provision such as s61D (2) so as to put outside the ambit of what is 'reckless' a complete failure to advert to whether or not the subject of the proposed sexual intercourse consented to it or declined consent. Such a law would simply reaffirm the view that our criminal law, at crucial moments, fails to provide principled protection to the victims of unwanted sexual intercourse, most of whom are women. Our law is not unprincipled or inadequate in this regard.

Nor is the construction of s61D (2) preferred by me inconsistent with the basic rule that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt the requisite intent on the part of the accused. The Crown does so, relevantly, by showing that the accused is 'reckless' as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse. This can be shown not only where the accused adverts to the possibility of consent but ignores it, but also where the accused is so bent on gratification and indifferent to the rights of the victim as to ignore completely the requirement of consent."
The section in the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) referred to, s61D (2), which has since been repealed, provided that a person who had sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who was reckless as to whether the other person consented to the sexual intercourse should be deemed to know that the other person did not consent to the sexual intercourse. The appellant submits that no equivalent section so provides in relation to an offence under [s61L.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) 
INDIFFERENCE TO CONSENT
However, in my opinion, the principle expounded in Morgan and accepted in the Court of Criminal Appeal derives from the view that the mens rea of rape is to have intercourse with a non-consenting woman or to have non-consensual intercourse;
Morgan at 237 per Lord Fraser. This view with which I agree is underpinned by the policy considerations touched upon by Lord Simon and spelled out by the President in Kitchener. Proof of the offence of indecent assault tends, as Lord Goff pointed out, to focus on whether the defendant was reckless as to whether or not the victim consented. If the accused believed the victim consented, the necessary intention is not proved. But as in rape if the accused was indifferent to whether the victim consented that is equivalent to an intent to do the prohibited act without the consent of the victim. I agree with Lawton LJ, who, when delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in R versus Kimber at 1121-2, an appeal against a conviction of indecent assault, pointed out that the prosecution has to prove that the defendant intended to lay hands on his victim without her consent.
 "If he did not intend to do this, he is entitled to be found not guilty; and if he did not so intend because he believed she was consenting, the prosecution will have failed to prove the charge.
It is the defendant's belief, not the grounds on which it was based, which goes to negative the intent.

In analysing the issue in this way we have followed what was said by the majority in DPP versus Morgan <case>; [(1976) AC 182:] see Lord
Hailsham at 214 and Lord Fraser at 237. If, as we adjudge, the prohibited act in indecent assault is the use of personal violence to a woman without her consent, then the guilty state of mind is the intent to do it without her consent.
Then, as in rape at common law, the inexorable logic, to which Lord Hailsham referred in Morgan, takes over and there is no room either for a 'defence' of honest belief or mistake, or of a 'defence' of honest and reasonable belief or mistake."
At 1123 his Lordship described the defendant's state of mind by the colloquial expression "couldn't care less". He said: "In law this is recklessness. Had the jury been directed on recklessness we are sure they would have found that he had acted recklessly. That would have been enough to support a conviction of the offence charged."
In R versus Bonora [(1994) 35 NSWLR 74] at 80 Abadee J, with whose judgment
Finlay and Simpson JJ agreed, after referring, amongst other cases, to Kimber and Court said that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the
Crown was also required to prove that the appellant was aware at the time of each of the incidents that the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether she was consenting or not. As
I have said, such recklessness is demonstrated by an indifference whether the victim is a consenting party or not. In this case the respondent said that: "It didn't enter my mind" whether the victim may not have wanted him to touch her." 
CONCLUSION
For the reasons I have given and with respect I disagree with the conclusion arrived at by Ireland J and his reasons therefor and agree with the orders Cole JA proposes.
JUDGE3
COLE JA By leave, Glen Anthony Fitzgerald, a police officer informant in proceedings commenced in the Local Court has appealed against the decision of
Ireland J upholding a summons filed by Ernest Bruce Kennard, the defendant in the Local Court proceedings, pursuant to which Ireland J declared that the conviction recorded against Mr Kennard for an offence against [s.61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) was bad in law, and ordered: "(i) Pursuant to [s.112](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s112.html) of the [Justices Act. 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) the defendants are prohibited from proceeding upon or in respect of the conviction recorded against the plaintiff.

The conviction is quashed."
The second defendant in the proceedings before Ireland J was the magistrate, Mr Michael Dowd LCM, who filed a submitting appearance save as to costs.
Mr Kennard elected to proceed pursuant to [s.112](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s112.html) [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) seeking the orders in fact made, rather than appeal to the District Court pursuant to [s.122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). In those circumstances, as Counsel for Mr
Kennard acknowledged, no question of double jeopardy arises. That concession was properly made for two reasons. First, electing to proceed under [s.112](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s112.html) involves the right conferred by statute on the appellant to appeal against an order so made. Second, if the appellant succeeds and the conviction is reinstated, that order constitutes a conviction in respect of which an appeal may then be brought pursuant to [s.122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).
 
THE FACTS AS FOUND
The facts giving rise to conviction were not in serious dispute. Mr
Kennard, an electrical contractor, entered premises occupied by a Miss S and others at the request of their landlord to effect electrical repairs to defective power points. Some of the defective power points were in Miss S' bedroom and some were in the sitting room. Ireland J found, correctly, that the Magistrate had made the following findings which were essentially undisputed: ". On the morning of 1 February 1993, the plaintiff, an electrician, visited the home of the complainant to undertake some repair work. While repairing the power points in the bedroom and lounge room he spoke intermittently to the complainant and she offered him a glass of orange juice.
He later sat on the lounge with the complainant and inquired about a scar on her arm and her leg. While the complainant was describing the cause of the scars, the plaintiff started to rub the scar on her leg. The complainant stated she was too scared at the time to object. The plaintiff then rubbed the complainant on the back for a short time and gave her a hug, both of which she did not voice objection to. He then tried to kiss her on the face, but she moved away.
The complainant took out her photo album, showing the plaintiff pictures of her family and boyfriend to show she was happily involved with someone. The complainant then put the albums back into the bedroom and returned to sit on the lounge with the plaintiff.
They discussed dolphins for a while and she showed the plaintiff her jewellery box and he undid a knot in her necklace.
The complainant's friend, who lived in the front half of the house, then appeared and asked the complainant if she was ready to leave for a shopping trip. After the friend left, the plaintiff stood up and asked the complainant for a hug, she did not respond because she was scared and confused. He proceeded to hug the complainant, rubbing her leg then moving his hands towards her bottom. He asked her if she had nice breasts, and attempted to touch her breast. She moved away at this point and he asked her if she would like to see him again, to which she responded "I don't know" because she was scared.
The plaintiff then left."((1) Appeal Book, p.66-67) 
SECTION 61L [CRIMES ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) [Section 61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) provides: "Any person who assaults another person and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the person, is liable to imprisonment for five years." 
FINDINGS OF THE MAGISTRATE
Mr Kennard gave evidence before the Magistrate. He gave the following evidence concerning his mental attitude regarding whether the complainant consented to his actions: "Q. Were you, in your mind, were you 100 per cent, 100 per cent that she wanted you to make advancements towards her, was that in your mind that she'd done all these friendly attitudes and it was per cent that she wanted you to touch her? 
A. I couldn't say what was in my mind at that stage." 
Q. But you certainly, can
I suggest, or can you answer the question, was it in your mind that she may not have wanted you to touch her, kiss her neck? 
A. No.

Q. ... (not transcribable) ... try and grab her boob, did that ever enter your mind or did you just keep that out of your mind? 
A. It didn't enter my mind."((2) Appeal Book, p.47O-U)
The Magistrate found: "I am prepared to accept from the complainant that that touching was certainly without her consent and that that touching induced in her sufficient fear to make it within the meaning of the definition 'a hostile act'."((3) Appeal Book, p.59M-P)
He further held that an act of indecency had occurred finding: "Nevertheless as I indicated earlier I am prepared to accept the complainant's evidence in relation to the rubbing of the leg and moving the arm up towards the bottom and taking that into account with the kissing and the other actions I am satisfied that all together they also constituted an act of indecency within the meaning of [s.61L."((4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) Appeal book, p.59R-U)
Regarding consent the Magistrate found: "As I indicated I am prepared to accept the evidence of
Miss S that certainly she didn't consent ...
It is of course the position that it is not necessary for a complainant to offer actual physical resistance to any particular act of that type to constitute or to negative any consent but clearly the mere fact that she did nothing is not of itself an indication that consent was granted. One has to look at that in the whole light of the circumstances of what happened at that particular time to see whether there was some element of recklessness so far as the defendant is concerned.
Bearing in mind the whole of these circumstances and in particular the circumstances in which the defendant came to the house, the position of the complainant, obvious comparative, youth and even allowing for the fact that there was nothing that she actually said or did which he took to indicate that there wasn't consent, nevertheless I consider that he simply put that matter out of Ins mind in a sufficiently reckless fashion to enable me to come to the finding that there was in fact so far as he was concerned the necessary mens rea to commit the offence"((5) Appeal Book, p.60E-L) 
THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUPREME COURT PURSUANT
TO S.112 [JUSTICES ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/)
On appeal Ireland J found: "The notion of assault is used in the traditional sense. it will need to be proven that the accused intentionally or recklessly, by his or her own actions, put the victim in immediate physical and unlawful danger (Venna <case>; [(1976) QB 421)."] and later: "The Magistrate found on the facts that the complainant did not consent to the plaintiff's actions and as a result was placed in a situation of apprehension.

The mens rea component of assault requires the accused to have intentionally or recklessly put the victim in fear of immediate and unlawful danger. As it was determined that the plaintiff did not intentionally frighten the complainant, recklessness as to the behaviour of the plaintiff had to be proven. The magistrate concluded that the plaintiff had acted recklessly by not giving any real consideration to whether the complainant was consenting to his actions."((6) Appeal Book, p.68R-69B)
His Honour then referred to Vallance versus The Oueen((7) <case>; [(1961) 108 CLR 56).]
From that authority, in relation to consent, his Honour found the test to be: "Whether or not the accused foresaw the likelihood of wounding the victim and ignored the risk. Such a test should also be applied in the situation of indecent assault."((8)
Appeal Book, p.69K)
Reference was then made to Regina versus Kitchener((9) [(1993) 29 NSWLR 696)] which his Honour accepted as enunciating that in sexual assault cases, recklessness as to consent will be satisfied if the accused fails to advert at all to the question of consent. That authority was distinguished because the
Court there was dealing with the provisions of s.61D(2) [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), now repealed, which provided: "(2) For the purpose of subsection (1) and (1A), a person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse shall be deemed to know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse."
His Honour then expressed his conclusion in the following terms: "Absent a statutory provision deeming the plaintiff to have the necessary knowledge as a foundation for his recklessness (and there is no such provision with respect to [s.61L)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html), the learned
Magistrate in finding the plaintiff to have not intentionally frightened the complainant and to have not given any real consideration to whether she was consenting to his actions, fell into error in concluding that the plaintiff was guilty of indecent assault, it having not been proven that he foresaw the likelihood of the complainant being put in fear and proceeded with his actions regardless of that risk. See also Hemsley [(1988) A Crim R 334] at 337."((10) Appeal Book p.69V-70F) 
Submissions on Appeal
The appellant argued that the decision of Ireland J exhibited two errors.
First it was said that in holding that it was necessary to prove an assault "in the customary sense", and thus it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused intentionally or recklessly by his actions put the victim in fear of immediate physical and unlawful danger, his Honour erred. To establish the assault referred to in [s.61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html) it was said to be unnecessary to prove an element of intentional or reckless hostility so as to create that fear, on the part of the respondent.
Second, it was argued that Ireland J fell into error in finding that it was necessary, in relation to consent, to prove that W Kennard foresaw the likelihood of the complainant being put in fear and proceeded with his actions regardless of that risk. The necessary element of mens rea in relation to consent was said to be established in indecent assault cases pursuant to [s.61L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61l.html), as in cases of rape or sexual intercourse without consent, by its being established that failure to give any true consideration to whether the complainant was consenting established the necessary recklessness regarding whether there was, or was not, consent notwithstanding absence of a deeming provision such as that contained in s.61D(2) (now repealed).
 
HISTORY OF THE OFFENCE OF INDECENT
ASSAULT
The offence of indecent assault was first enacted in the Criminal Law
Amendment Act 1983((11) 46 Vic.No.17). Section provided: "Whosoever indecently assaults any girl under the age of 14 years whether with or without her consent shall be liable to penal servitude for 5 years. And whosoever indecently assaults any female of or above the age of 14 years shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years."
In the Crimes Act 1900((12) Act, No. 40) the same wording was retained with the provisions being split and enacted as ss.77 and 78, the latter dealing with a female of or above the age of years.
Section 5 Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924((13) No. 10, 1924) introduced section 76 in the following terms: "Whosoever assaults any female and, at the time of, or immediately before or after such assault, commits any act of indecency upon or in the presence of such female, shall be liable to imprisonment for 3 years, or, if the female be under the age of 16 years, to penal servitude for 5 years."
The legislative debates do not make clear why the wording of the section was changed.
The appellant's submission was that the new wording merely reflected the way the phrase "indecently assaults" had been interpreted in practice, it being an expression used in the Offences Against the Person Act, (UK)((14) 247 25 Vict.c100 s.52).
Shortly after the amended wording was introduced in 1924, the Full Court of New South Wales decided R versus Sorlie((15) (1925) 25 SR 532) in which an accused was charged under s.76. The Solicitor General, Weigall, is recorded as having submitted: "The section was passed to remove doubts as to what constituted indecent assault, Archibold 26th ed.p.1033."
That 1922 edition of Archibold stated that it was necessary to "prove an assault, accompanied with circumstances of indecency on the part of the defendant".((16) See also
Beal versus Kelley [(1951) 2 All ER 763] at 764. where Lord
Goddard CJ adopted that as a correct definition of indecent assualt.)
In Sorlie, Street CJ, with whom Ferguson and James JJ concurred, stated: "It had been contended before us that that evidence is insufficient to establish a charge under s.76, and that what is contemplated by that section is not merely an indecent assault but an assault of some kind, and an independent act of indecency.
I do not agree. I think that any assault, which of itself amounts to the commission of an act of indecency upon the female assaulted or which is of such a character as to involve an act of indecency upon her, comes within the terms of the section, and is a punishable offence." 
THE NATURE OF AN ASSAULT WITHIN THE MEANING OF S.61L
It is established law that the assault ingredient in any indecent assault charge may involve either physical contact, being a battery, or a threat to the victim involving a reasonable apprehension of immediate and unlawful personal violence. As Lord Ackner said in Regina versus Court((17) [(1989) 1 AC 28] at 41): "It was common ground before your Lordships, and indeed it is self evident, that the first stage of the proof of the offence is for the prosecution to establish an assault The "assault" usually relied upon is a battery, the species of assault conveniently described by Lord
Lane CJ in Faulkner versus Talbot [(1981) WLR 1528], 1534 as "any intentional touching of another person without the consent of that person and without lawful excuse. It need not necessarily be hostile or rude or aggressive, as some of the cases seem, to indicate". But the "assault" relied upon need not involve any physical contact but may consist merely of conduct which muses the victim to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.
In the case law on the offence of indecent assault, both categories of assault feature." .
To similar effect, Lord Goff in Court said: "Now, if one looks just at the words of the statute, the ingredients are simply that there shall have been an assault, and that the assault shall have been indecent I take first the requirement that there shall have been an assault. In English law, an assault is generally distinguished from a battery. in the case of an assault, the relevant act is an act which muses another person to apprehend the infliction of immediate. unlawful force on his person; in the case of a battery, it is the actual infliction of unlawful force on another person. The mental element in both an assault and a battery may consist of either intention or recklessness: see Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, th ed. (1983),pp.
 and 356 and cases there cited. In either case, it is a defence that the defendant acted with consent or with lawful excuse."
The distinction between what I shall call "battery assault" and "apprehended unlawful force assault" is important when one considers the element of mens rea or intent, for in the case of battery assault the physical contact between the two persons, unless it falls within a recognised exception, constitutes and establishes the assault. That this is so is recognised by both ancient and modem authority. The principle is that, subject to certain exceptions, a person has a right to his or her own "bodily integrity".
To interfere with that integrity by touching, absent lawful excuse or consent, constitutes an assault.
In Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services versus J W B and F M
B (Marion's Case)((18) <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 218] at 233), Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said: "The corollary of these provisions, which embody the notion that, prima fame, any physical contact or threat of it is unlawful, is a right in each person to bodily integrity. That is to say, the right in an individual to choose what occurs with respect to his or her own person. in his Commentaries (55), Blackstone wrote: "(T)he law cannot draw the line between the different degrees of violence and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it, every man's person being sacred, and no other having a right to meddle with it in any the slightest manner." 
Consent ordinarily has the effect of transforming what would otherwise be unlawful into accepted, and therefore acceptable, contact. Consensual contact does not, ordinarily, amount to assault. However, there are some exceptions to the requirement for and the neutralizing effect cf, consent and therefore qualifications to the very broadly stated principle of bodily inviolability. In some instances consent is insufficient to maim application of force to another person lawful.
For example, a person in the Northern Territory mm render a killing lawful by consenting to be killed (56) and at common law a comparable qualification exist with respect assault in some circumstances.
Attorney General's Reference (No.6 of 1980) held that those entering into a consensual fight were guilty of assault if they intended to inflict bodily harm (58).
The rationale for this exception appears to rest in the idea that some harm involves public, not just personal, interest . Moreover, the absence of consent is irrelevant in a lawful arrest or in circumstances which mount to self-defnece.
A further exception of this kind is reflected in Collins versus Wilcock (6), where It was said that in respect of physical contact arising from the exigencies of everyday life - jostling in the street, social contact at parties and the like - there is an implied consent "by all who move in society and so expose themselves the risk of bodily contact"; or that such encounters fall "within a general exception embracing all physical contact which is generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life."
Thus, in the case of an alleged indecent assault upon a female, if it be established that, without the consent of the victim, the accused touched her, that will normally constitute the ingredient of assault, unless the touching arises from the exigencies of everyday life. It will be rare that the exigencies of life exception will apply in cases of sexual or indecent assault. Thus the normal issue will be, as here, whether the victim consented to the physical contact. In such a case no question arises regarding whether the victim was put in fear of physical violence by acts of the accused which might be categorised as "angry, revengeful, rude, insolent or hostile". The physical contact, absent consent, establishes the assault. Where the physical contact was intended, the element of mens rea in such an assault is established.
Where, however, the assault is constituted not by physical contact but by reasonably apprehended violence by the victim resulting from conduct engendering that reasonable apprehension, it is necessary to show that the conduct was of a nature, described in the cases as "angry, revengeful, rude, insolent or hostile", for, if that were not shown, the conduct could not give rise to the reasonable apprehension of physical violence asserted. Where the conduct of the accused is of an "angry, revengeful, rude, insolent or hostile" type, the question will arise for decision whether in engaging in that conduct the accused intended to put the victim in fear or recklessly engaged in the conduct unconcerned whether it engendered fear in the victim or not.
However such questions do not arise where the assault alleged is intentional physical contact. In the present case the physical contact constituting the assault, namely the placing of the hands upon the victims legs without consent, was clearly intentional. It follows, in my view that
Ireland J was in error when he said: "The mens rea component of assault requires the accused to have intentionally or recklessly put the victim in fear of immediate and unlawful danger.
As It was determined that the plaintiff did not intentionally frighten the complainant, recklessness as to the behaviour of the plaintiff bad to be proven."((19) Appeal Book, p.68U)
Regarding the question whether it is necessary to establish separately both an assault, and an act of indecency as section 61L in terms seems to contemplate, Sorlie is authority for the proposition that the act of assault may itself constitute the act of indecency. Further, it accords with the view of Barwick CJ expressed in
The Queen versus Phillips((20) (1971) 45 (ALJR) 467 at ) where his Honour said: "In thus expressing my view with respect for the need for hostility in the Act which is said to be an unlawful assault under the Code I do not mean in any wise to trench upon the ground which has been covered by discussion in connection with indecent assaults. In that area I would respectively agree with the circumstances of the physical conduct of one person with another which makes that contact indecent make it unnecessary upon a charge of indecent assault to establish some "hostility" over or above the actual circumstances of the indecency and the conduct of the two persons."
That passage has the endorsement of Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ in Boughey v The Queen((21) <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 10] at 26).
Further, it accords with common sense. To be pedantic, there may be a fraction of time, either before or after a contact assault in which the act of the accused may constitute an act of indecency. In the case of a sexual assault, it might be the accused exposing himself before making contact with the victim. In the present case it could be said that the placing of the hand upon the victim's leg constituted the assault with the moving of the hand towards the bottom constituting the act of indecency. However, looking at the circumstances as a whole, it is accurate to say that the act constituting the assault also constituted the act of indecency.
That will frequently be the case in cases of indecent assault.
There is nothing in Saraswati versus The Queen((22) <case>; [(1990) 172 CLR 1)] to the contrary of the views I have expressed above.
 
CONSENT
If the complainant had consented to the placing of the hands on her leg and movement towards her bottom, the kissing or the hug, there would have been no assault, and thus no indecent assault contrary to s.61L.
Mr Byrne, Counsel for Mr Kennard, successfully submitted before Ireland J that it was necessary for the informant to prove that, in circumstances where there was a finding that the complainant had not in fact consented, nonetheless Mr
Kennard "foresaw the likelihood of the complainant being put in fear and proceeded with his actions regardless of that risk".((23)
Appeal
Book, p.69S-70C) That being so held, Ireland J concluded that the Magistrate was in error in finding that Mr Kennard had acted recklessly by not giving any real consideration to whether the complainant was consenting to his actions.
It has always been the law that the onus is on the Crown to establish absence of consent if a prosecution for a sexual assault, or indeed any assault, arising from physical contact, is to succeed. The mental ingredient required to be established by the Crown in such cases is an intention on the part of the accused to perform the act, be it of intercourse or other form of sexual or indecent assault without the consent of the victim or "willy nilly not caring whether the victim consents or no".((24) Director of Public
Prosecutions versus Morgan <case>; [(1976) AC 182] at 215 per Lord Hailsham.) The position was analysed by the English Court of Appeal in R versus Kimber.((25) [(1983) 3 All
ER 316] at 319) Lawton LJ on behalf of the Court said: "The offence of indecent assault is now statutory: see s14 of the
Sexual
Offences Act 1956. The Crown had to prove that the appellant made an indecent assault on Betty. As there are no words in the section to indicate that Parliament intended to exclude mens rea as an element in this offence, it follows that the Crown had to prove that the appellant intended to commit it. This could not be done without first proving that the appellant intended to assault
Betty. In this context assault clearly includes battery. An assault is an act by which the defendant intentionally or recklessly causes the complainant to apprehend iummediate, or to sustain, unlawful personal violence: see R versus Venna <case>; [(1975) 3 All
ER 788] at 793, (1976) QB 421 at 428-429. In this case the appellant by his own admissions did intentionally lay his hands on Betty.
That would not, however, have been enough to prove the charge. There had to be evidence that the appellant had intended to do what he did unlawfully. When there is a charge of indecent assault on a woman, the unlawfulness can be proved, as was sought to be done in R versus Donovan (1934) 2 KB 498, (1934) All ER
Rep 207, by evidence that the defendant intended to cause bodily harm. In most cases, however, the prosecution tries to prove that the complainant did not consent to what was done. The burden of proving lack of consent rests on the prosecution: see R versus May [(1912) 3 KB 572] at 575 per Lord Alverstone CJ. The consequence is that the prosecution has to prove that the defendant intended to lay hands on the his victim without her consent. If he did not intend to do this, he is entitled to be found not guilty; and if he did so intend because he believed she was consenting, the prosecution will have faded to prove the charge. It is the defendant's belief, not the grounds on which it was based, which goes to negative the intent.

In analysing the issue in this way we have followed what was said by the majority in DPP versus Morgan <case>; [(1975) 2 All ER 347] at 361-362, , (1976) AC 182 at 214, 237 per Lord Hailsham and Lord
Fraser. If, as we adjudge, the prohibited act in indecent assault is the use of personal violence to a woman without her consent, then the guilty state of mind is the intent to do it without her consent. Then, as in rape at common law, the inexorable logic, to which Lord Hailsham referred in Morgan, takes over and there is no room either for a 'defence' or honest belief or mistake, or of a 'defence' of honest and reasonable belief or mistake (see <case>; [(1975) 2 All ER 347] at 319)
Kimber was cited with approval by the House of Lords in R versus Court((27) [(1989) AC 28] at 47), applied by the English Court of Criminal Appeal in Satnam
S a Kewal S((28) (1983) 78 Cr App R, p.149), and by the New South
Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R versus Kitchener((29) [(1993) 29 NSWLR 696)] at 81)
There are two other passages in the decision in Kimber which are of importance. First, the court accepted that the analysis of consent in Morgan was not confined to the event of rape. As Lawton LJ said: "Lord Hailsham started his speech by saying that the issue as to belief was a question of great academic importance in the theory of English criminal law"((31) All ER at 320).
Second, the judgment concluded, in dealing with the attitude of the accused, with the following passage: "His own evidence showed that ha attitude to her was one of indifference to her feelings and wishes. This state of mind is aptly described in the colloquial expression, "Couldn't care less". In law this is recklessness. Had the jury been directed on recklessness we are sure they would have found that he had acted recklessly. That would have been enough to support a conviction of the offence charged."((32) (19831 3 All ER at 320)
In Morgan Lord Hailsham, in dealing with the "inexorable logic" that resulted in there being no room either for "a defence of honest belief or mistake, or of a defence of honest and reasonable belief or mistake, said: "Either the prosecution proves that the accused had the requisite intent, or it does not. In the former case it succeeds, and in the latter it fails. Since honest belief clearly negatives intent, the reasonableness or otherwise of that belief can only be evidence for or against the view that the belief and therefore the intent was actually held ..."((33) [(1976) AC 214)]
It was argued by Mr Byrne that in circumstances where the Crown could not prove that the accused knew consent was absent, the onus was upon it was to establish that the accused believed that consent may be absent but nonetheless decided to proceed with the offending actions. He contended that the Crown in this case was seeking to change that established position at law by asserting that it was sufficient for the Crown to establish in the accused "absence of belief in consent". The first of these alternatives he described as "advertent recklessness" in that the accused must be shown to have adverted to the question whether consent was present or may be absent. The latter he described as "inadvertent recklessness" because the recklessness in proceeding with the offending acts occurred absent any belief one way or the other concerning the existence of absence of consent.
In my opinion this submissions misstates the law so as to create an apparent but unreal distinction. If the Crown proves, to adopt the words in
Kimber, that the accused was "indifferent to her feelings and wishes", that is, to whether she was or was not consenting, such that it can be said that he "couldn't care less" in that regard, recklessness in relation to consent is established. If the Crown established, to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact, either that the accused believed that consent may be absent, or that he was unaware whether consent was present or not and, uncaring in that regard, pressed on with his actions, in my opinion it would be established that the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant consented or not.
It follows, in my view, that, regarding consent, established failure by the accused to advert to the question of consent in cases of assault occasioned by physical contact, with the accused intending to and in fact proceeding with the offending acts, discharges the onus of proof on the Crown to establish the absence of consent to those acts so as to render them an assault within the meaning of s.61L [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). It also follows, in my view that, contrary to Mr Byrne's submissions, R versus Kitchener((34) [(1993) 29 NSWLR ).] Was correctly decided. I respectfully adopt the remarks of Kirby P where his Honour said: "To criminalise conscious advertence to the possibility of non-consent, but to excuse the reckless failure of the accused to give a moment's thought to that possibility, is self-evidently unacceptable. In the hierarchy of wrong-doing, such total indifference to the consent of a person to have sexual intercourse is plainly reckless, at least in our society today. Every individual has a right to the human dignity of ins or her own person. Having sexual intercourse with another without the consent of that other amounts to an affront to that other's human dignity and an invasion of the privacy of that person's body and personality. It would be unacceptable to construe a provision such as s61D(2) so as to put outside the ambit of what is 'reckless' a complete failure to advert to whether or not the Subject of the proposed sexual intercourse consented to it or declined consent. Such a law would simply reaffirm the view that our criminal law, at crucial moments, fails to provide principled protection to the victims of unwanted sexual intercourse, most of whom are women. Our law is not unprincipled or inadequate in this regard."((35) [(1993) NSWLR 696] at 697)
The view which I have expressed is reinforced by the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in Regina versus Henning((36) (unreported) May 1990 Court of
Criminal Appeal.) where Gleeson CJ, Campbell and Mathews JJ said: "In other words, he says, that a conscious advertence to the possibility of non-consent is a necessary element of recklessness under section 61D(2), and the jury must be so directed. He refers to the judgment of White J in R versus Egan and Ors 91983) [15 ACT 20] at page 24:- "The meaning of the words "recklessly indifferent" has been examined and explained in a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal: for example in Wozniak [(1977) 16 SASR 67],
Bray CJ said at 74: "If it is, as I have suggested on reflection might be a preferable test, an intention to have intercourse without any belief in consent, then that belief is lacking if he realises that she might not be consenting but nevertheless proceeds with intercourse." 
The learned Chief Justice used the words "might not be" advisedly. Counsel contended in that case that the man had to realise that she probably was not consenting. His Honour rejected that contention. He said: "In short, the requirement of a belief in the probability of non-consent, as opposed to whatever degree of possibility is involved in the word 'might', has never as far as I can see, been held to be a necessary ingredient of rape and it is implicitly excluded in all the formulations I have been able to discover." 
It should be noted that his Honour used the word "realises".
this will become of significance in relation to partial intoxication. There must be a sufficient basis of substratum of fact, proved by the prosecution from the circumstances, including what the woman says and does, which discloses to the man the fact that the woman might not be consenting. Once it is clearly proved that she might not be consenting, then he man is recklessly indifferent if he presses on with intercourse without clearing up that difficulty of possible non-consent." 
Later again his Honour said:- "The appellants were entitled to infer consent, if there was a sufficient basis therefor, but not to assume it. An accused person is never entitled to assume anything about consent once it is in doubt and once that doubt is sufficiently realised by the man. upon receiving notice of the possibility of her non-consent, he is put upon inquiry before he proceeds to intercourse. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt, often in very complex sexual situations, that the man had notice "realised" - Wozniak) that she might riot be consenting yet pressed on with intercourse, thus being recklessly indifferent as to whether she was consenting." 
Without disagreeing with any of the above, all of which seems to be manifestly sensible and correct, we do not think it follows that a conscious advertence to the possibility of a non. consent is necessary to a finding of recklessness under section 61D(2). A failure to advert at all to the question of consent, in other words treating it as an entirely irrelevant factor, would almost certainly amount to either knowledge or recklessness if consent was in fact withheld"((37) (unreported) May 1990 Court of Criminal Appeal)"
These remarks are equally opposite to indecent assault cases.
It follows, in my opinion, that Ireland J fell into error in the two respects advocated by the appellant. I would propose that the declaration and orders made by his Honour be set aside and that the conviction and sentence imposed by Magistrate Dowd of 13 October 1993 be reinstated.
It was a condition of the granting of leave that the appellant pay the respondent's costs of this appeal. Order accordingly.
