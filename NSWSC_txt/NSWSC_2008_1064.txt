CRIMINAL LIST 
MICHAEL GROVE J October 2008 /2619 REGINA versus Daniel WILKIE 
JUDGMENT - On application for directed verdict At the close of the Crown case the accused moved for a directed acquittal on counts 1 and 3 of the indictment. I refused the motion and indicated that I would later express reasons. Those reasons follow.
 Each of those counts charged a breach of <case> (2) of the Corporations
Law. The kernel of the submission was that the Crown had failed to lead evidence, that as a director of FAIG, the accused either profited from his position as a director or failed to avoid a conflict of interest. It was acknowledged that an identical submission was rejected by Howie J in a trial at which, coincidentally, the accused was also, with others, charged. It was submitted that his Honour was not referred to relevant High Court authority and that his ruling was wrong. I consider that it was not. See R versus Burroughs,
Mainprize and Wilkie 28 October 2005.
 Reference was made to the history of <case> and in particular a discussion of one of its "predecessors" which was <case> of the Companies Code, which had been traced in the judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Angas Law Services v
Carabelas <case>; [(2005) 226 CLR 507.] Also referred to were several cases dealing in one way or another with the extent of fiduciary duties. I do not recite what can be read in those cases.
 The accused's submission was entirely dependent upon the proposition that the offence created by <case> is equivalent to, and therefore limited to, breach of fiduciary duty. Such equivalence and limitation is not specified in the terms of the provision which reads: "An officer of a corporation shall at all times act honestly in the exercise of his or her powers and the discharge of the duties of his or her office." The definition of officer contained in <case> includes persons who would not in the ordinary course of things and by the nature of their offices come to owe fiduciary duties by this provision but they would be bound to act honestly. I see no reason to read down the scope of <case> to apply only to those whose duties are fiduciary in nature.
 Further, I am in agreement with the understanding expressed by Howie J of the judgment in Marchesi versus Barnes <case>; [(1970) VR 434] and the reservations about what could be thought to flow from the reasons of Allen J in Corporate Affairs Commission versus Papoulis [(1990) 20
NSWLR 503.] In short, a charge of dishonesty by an officer punishable pursuant to s (2) does not comprehend as an essential element either the acquisition of profit from position by the alleged offender or failing to avoid a demonstrated conflict of interest.
