REGINA versus Brian FRUGTNIET 
JUDGMENT 
SPERLING AJA: On 5 December 1991, the appellant, Brian Frugtniet, was arrested and charged. On 12 December 1994, he was convicted on five counts of using a false instrument and five counts of making a false instrument after a trial in the District Court before Gibson DCJ and a jury. He has since served the sentence, which was for a minimum term of eighteen months commencing on 12 December 1994, with an additional term of six months. 
The offences were committed in the course of a dishonest scheme involving the use of forged bank cheques to purchase travellers' cheques from travel agents.

A principal witness for the Crown was a Mr B J Dallimore, initially a participant, who had turned informer. He placed the appellant at a meeting of the participants at which the scheme was formulated and which, according to other evidence, took place on 9 October 1991. He also said there was a subsequent meeting between the appellant and himself on 12 December 1991 when plans were again allegedly discussed.

Later, Mr Dallimore recanted. On the hearing of an appeal against conviction heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mr Dallimore gave evidence that the appellant was not present at the meeting of 9 October 1991 and was not involved in the scheme at all. Mr Dallimore was disbelieved by the Court of
Criminal Appeal. The appeal was dismissed on 21 June 1996. Detective Sergeant
P Vickery, the officer-in-charge of the police investigation, gave short evidence at the hearing of the appeal (a point which later becomes relevant).

The Court of Criminal Appeal was constituted by Gleeson CJ, Allen and James
JJ. The primary judgment was given by James J. The two other members of the court agreed without further reasons.

It is apparent from James J's judgment that there were strong reasons for rejecting Mr Dallimore's new account of events. These were (i) that it was inconsistent with a story given consistently by Mr Dallimore over a period of years; (ii) that Mr Dallimore's explanation for giving the original evidence was implausible, namely, to help a Mr Schmalstieg (another of the persons involved), in that his original evidence put Mr Schmalstieg at the meeting and as being otherwise involved, Mr Schmalstieg had since left Australia, it would have been more logical for Mr Dallimore to have "fingered" a Mr Seyfarth (another of the actors), and Mr Dallimore had an extensive criminal record involving dishonesty; (iii) that Mr Dallimore's reasons for recanting his earlier evidence were implausible, namely, that he felt sorry for what he had done, Mr Dallimore's evidence on appeal that he did not know until recently what had happened to the appellant as a result of Mr Dallimore's original story being false (as found by James J); (iv) that, when asked in the course of his evidence on the appeal whether he had been offered money to change his story, Mr Dallimore had prevaricated; (v) that the case against the appellant at the trial did not depend on Mr Dallimore's evidence alone, the same story being evidenced in other ways which corroborated Mr Dallimore's original account.

Mr Dallimore had turned informer shortly before the appellant's arrest in
He was then utilised by the police to carry a listening device in aid of their investigations.

It is now known that the application for the warrants came before James J on November 1991. The application was made by Sergeant R P Selby. Detective
Sergeant Vickery was present. The material before James J on that occasion included a statement by Detective Sergeant Vickery dated 14 November 1991. It is before us. The targets of the investigation were, at that stage, specified.
They were members of the appellant's family, but they did not include the appellant. None of the material before James J mentioned the appellant, so far as the evidence before us has disclosed. No evidence obtained by use of a listening device was adduced at the appellant's trial. Indeed it was not so much as mentioned at the trial that a listening device had been employed.

Notably, Mr Dallimore offered his assistance to the police on 18 October 1991, nine days after the initial planning meeting at which Mr Dallimore later placed the appellant in his evidence at the trial. Yet the information about the scheme provided by Mr Dallimore as incorporated by Detective Sergeant
Vickery in his statement dated 15 November 1991 does not implicate the appellant at all.

Detective Sergeant Vickery's statement of 15 November 1991 did however contain material adverse to Mr Dallimore. That related to Mr Dallimore's background.
It was as follows: "On 1 March 1990 Brent John DALLIMORE, born 17.4.82 was arrested by Detective
Sergeant WEST and SCHILIRO for a large number of fraud matters committed on several financial institutions throughout the Sydney area. The informant was subsequently interviewed and charged with seven hundred and five counts of
Obtain Financial Advantage by Deception (Section 178BA) and three counts of
Receiving (Section 188) of Stolen Credit Cards. At the time of interviewing the informant stated that he was involved in the above frauds with another man who was the organiser and supplier of the credit cards. The informant further stated that he did not wish to divulge any further information in relation to this man as the co-offender has many `connections' and he feared for his safety. The informant appeared at the Downing Centre Local Court where he pleaded guilty to those offences. He was subsequently committed from that court to the Sydney District Court for sentence. At this stage the defendant is currently on bail for these matters awaiting sentence." 
The appellant filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High
Court from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court appeal was deemed to be abandoned in September 1997. The appellant applied by summons to reinstate the application for special leave to appeal. On 16 January 1998, the summons was adjourned to give the appellant the opportunity of moving this court.

On 5 February 1998, the appellant filed an application in this court seeking the following orders: "1. A declaration or such appropriate order that the decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeal comprising Gleeson CJ, Allen and James JJ dated 21 June 1996 be set aside on the basis that Court of Criminal of Appeal was invalidly or improperly constituted having included His Honour Justice James in the Court.
An order that the appeal against conviction and the application for leave to appeal against sentence be re-heard before a properly constituted Court of
Criminal Appeal.
Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court deems fit.
Costs." 
The application came before this court on 29 May 1998. The court was constituted by Powell JA and Young and Sperling JJ. The court heard argument and reserved its decision.

Powell JA presided at the hearing of this appeal. Since then, as was foreshadowed, the appellant has secured the appointment of the other two members of the court as acting judges of the Court of Appeal and has instituted parallel proceedings in that Division. The other members of the court are accordingly referred to in this judgment as Young AJA and Sperling
AJA. It was common ground at the hearing that, on completion of these procedures, the court as presently constituted could make its determination with the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal and of the Court of Appeal.

The appellant's case before us was that James J was disqualified by reason of apprehended bias from sitting on the hearing of the appellant's appeal to the
Court of Criminal Appeal by reason of the information which came before him on the application for listening device warrants, and that the appeal should accordingly be reheard and redetermined.

I accept, for the purposes of the argument, without deciding, that an appropriate procedural framework exists to accommodate this argument and that, if James J was disqualified by reason of apprehended bias, the appeal should be reheard and redetermined.

I should, however, make the following observation in that connection. In
Saxon (Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 April 1998, unreported), Wood J mentioned denial of procedural fairness as an exception to the rule in
Grierson <case>; [(1938) 60 CLR 431] that a Court of Criminal Appeal has no power to reconsider an order dismissing an appeal which has been perfected by entry of the order.
Smart J agreed (reserving the question of judgments obtained by fraud). I agreed in substance, although I put the point a little differently. Pantorno <case>; <case>; [(1997) 71 ALJR 875], Dawson and Gaudron JJ said with reference to Grierson: "The view was expressed in Pantorno that an intermediate court of appeal can entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected (Pantorno versus The Queen <case>; [(1989) 166 CLR 466] at 474, per Mason CJ and Brennan J; at 484, per Deane, Toohey and Gaurdron JJ.)." 
That supports what was said in Saxon. However, a re-examination of
Pantorno leads me, with respect, to doubt whether it can be stated as a universal proposition that a denial of natural justice will always provide grounds for a Court of Criminal Appeal re-opening an appeal notwithstanding that the order of the court has been entered. The proposition may be less secure than was conveyed by Saxon. The exception, if that is the way it should be categorised, may depend on the nature and extent of the denial of procedural fairness. What was said in Saxon in this connection should, therefore, in my respectful opinion, be received with caution. I should add that it was not necessary to decide the point in Saxon.

But, however that may be, as I have stated, I proceed in this case on the assumption - without deciding - that the appellant is entitled to have the prior determination of the Court of Criminal Appeal reheard and redetermined if James J was disqualified by reason of apprehended bias from sitting on the appeal.

A judge is disqualified by reason of apprehended bias if fair minded people might reasonably apprehend or suspect that the judge has prejudged or might prejudge the case: Webb and Hay <case>; [(1994) 181 CLR 41.] The fair minded observer is deemed to have knowledge of the material objective facts (per Deane J at 67-8), that is, the material facts as ascertained by the appellate court: R versus S (Court of Criminal Appeal, 13
August 1997, per Hunt CJ at CL).

Authorities were cited supporting the argument that there are circumstances where a judge who has entertained an application for a listening device or similar warrant may have to disqualify himself or herself from sitting on a subsequent case.

Before saying something about those authorities, it is necessary to note certain of the provisions of the [Listening Devices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lda1984181/).
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lda1984181/s16.html) provides that, on an application for a warrant, the judge must be satisfied only that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion or belief by the appellant that a prescribed offence has been, is about to be or is likely to be committed and that the use of a listening device is necessary for the purpose of enabling evidence to be obtained of the commission of an offence or the identity of the offender: [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lda1984181/s16.html)
The judge is to have regard to the nature of the offence, the extent to which the privacy of any person is likely to be affected, any alternative means of obtaining the evidence or information, the evidentiary value of any evidence obtained, and any previous warrant sought or granted: [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lda1984181/s16.html) 
For these purposes, the judge is required to make a very limited kind of finding. The requisite level of satisfaction is low. What is involved is more a matter of impression than anything else.

As for the authorities, there is no general rule that a judge who entertains an application for a listening device is thereby disqualified from sitting in subsequent proceedings which have a nexus with material put before the judge on the application. That has only to be stated to be self-evidently correct.
There might be nothing in the material which is adverse to a party in subsequent proceedings or nothing significant enough to conceivably have any relevant effect on the judge's mind.

No question of disqualification had to be decided in any of the cases to which reference has been made, and none of them went further than to say that disqualification may be a result. The cases lay down no principles to differentiate between those circumstances which might would give require disqualification and those which would not.

In Love versus Attorney General for New South Wales [(1990) 169 CLR 307], 322, the court gave as a reason for construing the state act as giving an option to judges not to perform the function of processing applications for interception warrants: "After all, exercise of the power (to issue a warrant) may disqualify a judge from sitting in a case in which evidence is sought to be given of a conversation intercepted pursuant to the warrant." 
In Grollo versus Palmer <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 348], the question was whether the Commonwealth statute authorising federal judges to issue interception warrants was a valid law.
Brennan CJ and Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ recorded the policy argument advanced against judges processing such warrants. The argument included the prospect of bias being apprehended if a question arose as to the validity of such a warrant. That argument, it was said, could be met by the adoption of an appropriate practice. It was said that a judge who had issued a warrant could ensure that he or she did not sit on any case to which the warrant related.
The implication was that the judge might be precluded from doing so because of apprehended bias.
 (I pause to mention the impracticability of this suggestion if one extends the area of concern to include any derogatory information conveyed on the application for a warrant concerning informants, targets, the associates of informants and targets and anyone else. The recording of such details and their secure and secret preservation in an accessible form would be a very large exercise.) 
In the same case, McHugh J also reviewed the policy considerations for and against investing judges with the function of issuing such warrants. He said (at 380): "Highly prejudicial information in relation to a person may have been secretly provided to the judge, information upon which the judge may have relied in authorising the issue of the warrant. Because the applications and the identity of judges are secret, the parties to proceedings are not aware that the judge is in possession of information that is prejudicial to one of them; the affected party is unable to ask the judge to disqualify him or herself on the grounds of apprehended bias." 
As I have said, none of these statements goes further than to say that disqualification may be a consequence of processing an application for a warrant. Whether disqualification is a consequence would depend on the circumstances of the case.

The only element in the material before James J on the application for a warrant in this instance that was conceivably adverse to the appellant's interests was the material concerning Mr Dallimore to which I have referred.

It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that this could not provide grounds for disqualification because the same evidence was adduced before the Court of
Criminal Appeal. I have to reject that submission. Reasonable and informed apprehension of prejudgment or of a prejudiced mind is the touchstone. On the appeal, a view had to be formed about Mr Dallimore's creditworthiness on evidence which - let it be assumed - included evidence of Mr Dallimore's background. If it was to be reasonably apprehended by an informed person that
James J might have come to the hearing of the appeal having prejudged Mr
Dallimore's creditworthiness or with a mind prejudiced against him, it would be no answer that the antecedent state of mind would have made no difference to the outcome of the appeal because the evidence on appeal included the earlier material. A judge must bring an unprejudiced mind to the task of evaluating the evidence for and against any matter in issue and the arguments that may be advanced on either side. It is no answer that the judge would have come to the same conclusion anyway.

The same answer must be given to the Crown's argument that the balance was very strongly against Mr Dallimore's creditworthiness in relation to his evidence on the appeal. Again, the test is not whether a prejudgment or prejudiced mind might have made a difference to the outcome. A serious possibility of prejudgment or of a prejudiced mind is sufficient.

The Crown submitted that any apprehended bias had been waived. The Crown relied on the fact that papers provided to the appellant prior to the hearing of the appeal included a statement by Sergeant Selby in which she said she attended before James J on the application for the warrants. Copies of the warrants were annexed. The appellants legal advisers were therefore on notice, it was said, that James J had issued the subject warrants.

There are two reasons why this argument must be rejected. Firstly, the material did not disclose Detective Sergeant Vickery's statement which is the document that contained the information adverse to Mr Dallimore. The gist of the appellant's complaint is not that James J had processed the application but that information adverse to Mr Dallimore was put before him at that time.

Secondly, Sergeant Selby's statement was one of 4,000 or so pages of documentation supplied to the appellant's legal advisers at that time. I am not satisfied that the statement would have come to the notice of the appellant or of his legal advisers sufficiently to satisfy the necessary element of informed election not to object to James J sitting on the appeal.

The Crown has a more persuasive argument. That is that there is no serious prospect, in the circumstances of this case, that - from the standpoint of a reasonable and informed observer - the judge might have prejudged the issue of
Mr Dallimore's creditworthiness or come to that issue on the hearing of the appeal with a prejudiced mind. The argument is as follows.

First, four and a half years had elapsed between the application and the appeal. Statistics showed such applications were frequent. In 1991 the Court entertained 260 applications, in 1992 687, in 1993 449, in 1994 460, in 1995 , and in 1996 583. That means that, on average, a judge of the Common Law
Division, processed between twenty and fifty applications a year and something in the order of 150 applications between the application for the warrants and the hearing of the appeal in this case. Then, Mr Dallimore was not a target in the investigation. His creditworthiness was not something James J had to evaluate on the application. The judge would not have seen Mr Dallimore on the application. No question relating to the application arose at the trial and no evidence obtained by use of a listening device was given at the trial which might conceivably have jogged the judge's memory when he read the record of the trial and heard argument on the appeal.

These considerations tend strongly to the conclusion that James J would not have formed any adverse opinion of Mr Dallimore on the material before him (because he had no occasion to make any such evaluation), but - even more strongly - they make it extremely unlikely that James J would have remembered having received information about Mr Dallimore or that he would have retained any impression concerning Mr Dallimore which he might have formed at the earlier time.

As against this, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the name
Frugtniet is unusual. Members of the appellant's family by that name were targets of the police investigation and were mentioned as such in Detective
Sergeant Vickery's statement. The scam which became the subject of the appellant's trial was unusual and was referred to in detail in the statement.
Detective Sergeant Vickery attended on the application and gave evidence on the appeal. These matters, it was submitted, were capable of being seen as likely to bring the application for the warrants to the judge's mind together with the adverse information concerning Mr Dallimore which was conveyed to him at that time. There was then the real possibility that the notional observer would apprehend the possibility of bias in the relevant sense.

Giving due weight to the appellant's points, I am not satisfied that a reasonable and informed observer would have apprehended as a serious possibility at the time of the appeal that James J might have formed an adverse opinion of Mr Dallimore's creditworthiness at the time of the application or that the judge might have remembered anything adverse to Mr
Dallimore's creditworthiness by way of information or impression.

Lastly, I should mention the appellant's submission that Detective Sergeant
Vickery and a Mr J Singh of the Victorian Crown were present at the hearing of the appeal and both were aware that James J had processed the listening device application. It is a large assumption that either of these gentlemen would have remembered that it was James J who had processed a listening device application, not directed to the apprehension of this appellant and made some four and a half years earlier.

Even if this be assumed, the argument then runs along the lines that they should have brought the matter to James J's attention. The short answer to that point is that there is no reason to suppose that James J would or should then have disqualified himself. That is because there is no reason to believe that the judge might have made any evaluation of Mr Dallimore's creditworthiness at the earlier time or that he would - even if reminded of the warrant application - have found he had retained any such impression or any memory of the information that was put before him on the earlier occasion which was adverse to Mr Dallimore. It would not have appeared to the judge any more than it does to me that a reasonable and informed observer might think there was a serious possibility to the contrary. In these circumstances, the judge would have had no occasion to disqualify himself.

Apprehended bias is not made out. I propose the following orders.
In the proceedings in the Court of Appeal, summons dismissed.
In the proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal, application dismissed.

REGINA versus BRIAN FRUGTNIET 
JUDGMENT 
POWELL JA: The facts which gave rise to the application with which the Court is now concerned to deal are set out in the Judgment prepared by Sperling AJA which I have read in draft. 
During the course of argument on the application the members of the Court, then sitting only as the Court of Criminal Appeal, expressed doubts as to the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is a statutory court, to review a
Judgment of the Court, differently constituted, even if, as was said to be the case here, that earlier Judgment was said to have been vitiated by a denial of procedural fairness. In the light of the doubts then expressed by the members of the Court the applicant's legal advisers later applied to the Chief Justice to have Young and Sperling JJ appointed additional Judges of Appeal so that, if need be, the Court as then constituted might, as the Court of Appeal, exercise the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. To that application the Chief Justice has since acceded.

I am disposed to think that the Court of Appeal might exercise the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review, and, if appropriate, to quash a
Judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal which is said to have been vitiated by a denial of procedural fairness. However, notwithstanding the views expressed by Wood J (as he then was) in R. v. Saxon (Court of Criminal
Appeal 21 April 1998) I have the gravest doubt as to the power of the Court of
Criminal Appeal, differently constituted, to review an earlier Judgment of the
Court said to have been vitiated on that ground, and I do not consider that the decisions of the High Court in Pantorno v. R. ((1989) <case>; <case>; [71
ALJR 875)] provide any sure foundation for the existence of any such power.

However, as I agree with the views expressed by Sperling AJA as to the substantive matter which was argued on the hearing of the application, it is not necessary for me to express a concluded view as to the questions to which
I have earlier referred.

I agree that the application should be dismissed.

REGINA V Brian FRUGNIET 
JUDGMENT 
YOUNG AJA: The facts and relevant circumstances are set out in the Judgment of Sperling AJA which I have read in draft. I agree with His Honour's reasons and conclusions, but wish to consider in greater depth some of the arguments raised as to jurisdiction. 
The original appeal was to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That Court is established by the [Criminal Appeal Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s3.html) makes the Supreme Court the Court of Criminal Appeal to be constituted by three or more Supreme Courts Judges as the Chief Justice may direct. Various people are given the right to resort to the Court. The Court is given by the statute specific powers in particular those set out in [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6.html), [6A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s6a.html), [7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s7.html), [8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s8.html), [8A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s8a.html) &
[12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s12.html).

The Court appears to be a statutory court and, in early cases was so considered, see R versus Burns <case>; [(1920) 20 SR 351], . However, this view was overruled by the High Court in Stewart versus The
King <case>; [(1921) 29 CLR 234], 240 (see also Ex Parte Neville (1966) 85 WN (Pt1) 372). 
However, it must still be remembered that the raison d'etre for the Court was the fact that, under the general law, there was no right of appeal in criminal cases. Accordingly, when there is an appeal against conviction, the right to appeal must be found within the statute, or not at all. This seems to me to be the basis for such decisions as Grierson versus The King <case>; [(1938) 60 CLR 431.] 
The present case is not one where the principal relief sought is an order appealing from a conviction or sentence. The first prayer for relief is for a declaration or other appropriate order that the decision of the Court made 21
June, 1996 was invalid because the Court included James, J and for a rehearing of the appeal.

In the light of cases such as Reg versus Saxon (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal .4.1998 as yet unreported) I had doubts at the hearing as to whether the
Court of Criminal Appeal could deal with the application. I also had doubts as to whether the Court of Criminal Appeal had power to make a declaratory order.
Certainly I did not know of any case where such an order had been made.
However, there was a much stronger case for saying that the Court of Appeal could do both. It was thus suggested to counsel that we should, as has happened before on a couple of occasions, sit as both the Court of Criminal
Appeal and the Court of Appeal. This was reluctantly agreed to by both parties.

Courts possess the jurisdiction and powers conferred on them by the relevant statutes and, in addition, implied powers, inherent powers and accrued powers.
I should qualify this statement in three respects. First, the statute may negate or modify the implied, inherent or accrued powers. Secondly, there is some overlap in those last three categories. Thirdly, the terms "implied" and "inherent" are often employed in different senses by different scholars. In particular, many judges and authors consider them together under the "Inherent
Jurisdiction" head, see eg Connelly versus DPP [[1964] AC 1254], 1347 and
Mason, The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court [(1983) 57 ALJ 449.] 
I consider that the preferred definitions of these ancillary powers are as follows. "Implied powers are those that arise out of and are necessary to carry out the authority expressly granted" to the court (Inherent Powers of the Courts, Felix F Stumpf, (National Judicial College, Reno, 1994)) p 5.
"Inherent powers consist of all powers reasonably required to enable a court to perform efficiently its judicial functions, to protect its dignity, independence and integrity, and to make its lawful actions effective" (
Carrigan, Inherent Powers and Finance, 7 Trial Magazine 22 (1971)) quoted by
Stumpf at p 4. Accrued powers are powers necessary to adjudicate on any question or claim which is necessary to decide or is not severable from, a matter which a court has to decide; Philip Morris Inc versus Adam P Brown Male
Fashions Pty Ltd [(1981) 148 CLR 457.] 
In the USA, the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers has meant that the court's inherent powers extend to ordering the Executive Government to resource it properly, see eg O'Coin's Inc versus Treasurer of County of
Worcester [287 NE 2d 608], 612 (Mass) (1972). There has not yet been the necessity to exercise this power in Australia, but its existence shows the very wide matters that are covered by implied, inherent and accrued jurisdiction.

The mainstream of authority is on the power of courts to ensure that the processes of the law provide a just result in all litigation both criminal and civil. Thus, if there is no procedural machinery provided, the court provides it as best it can (Connelly versus DPP supra at p 1347). Courts have an inherent power even sua sponte to dismiss proceedings that have long remained dormant, Link versus Wabash Railroad Co <case>; <case>; [384 US 333] . Courts, particularly those at the apex of the judicial system, must ensure that technical rules do not embarrass the court by allowing an unfair trial to stand.

However, this last illustration comes into conflict with another principle, that of finality of litigation. Ordinarily that latter principle will prevail,
Bailey versus Marinoff <case>; [(1971) 125 CLR 529.] But, in exceptional situations, this will not be so.
Instances are found in Taylor versus Taylor <case>; <case>; [(1984) 154 CLR 518], 526.

What little authority there is on this point discloses that it is more likely that a court at the apex of the hierarchical pyramid will exercise this extraordinary power than a court lower down. The main, but not exclusive ground for its exercise is that the original hearing has been a "nullity".

I do not consider that the word "nullity" should be taken in a strictly literal sense. In one sense no determination of a superior court of record is a nullity. What the word connotes in this context is that the hearing was so defective that a gross injustice would be committed by allowing the decision to stand. An illustration is provided by Cameron versus Cole <case>; [(1944) 68 CLR 571.] In that case, the Bankruptcy Court seemed to have ignored a provision which required it not to make a sequestration order against a serving member of the armed forces. When the matter was brought to its attention, the court annulled its order and reheard the case. The High Court held that the Court of Bankruptcy had acted properly, Rich, J saying at 589 that "... there has been no valid trial at all. The setting aside of an invalid determination lays the ghost of the simulacrum of a trial, and leaves the field open for a real trial." 
Not every procedural irregularity will constitute a "nullity" in this sense.
Although this should be obvious, I explicitly state it because Mr Pappas' submissions for Mr Frugniet seemed to assume that if a procedural irregularity could be established, the decision of the previous Court of Criminal Appeal could be treated as a simulacrum of an appeal and disregarded.

Some, but not complete guidance, as to what might constitute a nullity for present purposes may be found in the applications for a prerogative order where, notwithstanding something undesirable had happened at a trial, no relief was granted. An example in a civil trial that comes close to the present problem is Ex Parte Prentice; Re Hornby (1969) 90 WN [(Pt )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s1.html) . In that case, even though the Court of Appeal deprecated the practice of a District Court Judge who had refused to approve of an infant's settlement of an action then hearing the action himself, it declined to give prerogative relief. There are myriad examples, one that comes to mind is an unreported decision of Maguire, J that a witness remaining in the court after an order excluding witnesses had been made was not a matter which warranted prohibition. As McDonald, J recently said in Flynn versus DPP [[1998] 1 VR ], , "what must be demonstrated is that the error is so fundamental to the decision of the court as to strike at the very roots of its order and to invalidate it." See also the words of Mahoney, JA in Director-General of the Attorney-General's Department versus District Court of NSW [(1993) 32 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281993%29%2032%20NSWLR%20409 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 411 and Commissioner of Police versus District Court of NSW (1993) 31
NSWLR 606, 634.

In the present case, the "nullity" alleged was the fact that James, J was involved in the proceedings at an early stage when issuing a warrant under the [Listening Devices Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lda1984181/) and then years later sat as a member of the appellate court. There are passages in
High Court authorities as to the undesirability of such a judge sitting at the trial (see eg Love versus AG [(1990) 169 CLR 307], 322 and Ousley versus R <case>; [(1997) 148 ALR 510], 526 and, generally, Grollo versus Palmer <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 348]). However, I agree with the submissions of Mr Berman for the Crown that the High Court does not suggest automatic disqualification if such a judge sits. Further, a case such as the present, where there is no use made of the evidence obtained by use of the warrant at the trial and the judge who grants the warrant sits on appeal is even more removed from one where one might think that there had been no real hearing by a properly constituted tribunal.

Had it been necessary to rule on the jurisdictional question, I would have held that there was jurisdiction for the Court of Appeal and possibly the
Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene in an appropriate case. I would not have been convinced that the present was such an appropriate case. The alleged defect to my mind falls far short of making the previous hearing a nullity. It follows that I prefer the reasoning of Sperling, J in R versus Saxon (Supra) to that of Wood, J. However, as I have said above and as Sperling AJA notes in his draft judgment in the instant case, the proposition that there is an exception to the finality rule when there has been a procedural irregularity is too wide.

Had the court considered that it should intervene, I would have found difficulty in formulating an order. It is clear that the Court of Appeal has no authority to make a prerogative order against a member or members of this bench sitting as the Supreme Court, Ex Parte Groot: Re Myers [(1958) 75 WN .] 
A declaration of invalidity of a superior court judgment is only made in the rarest of case such as where the defendant in fact did not exist, Burr v
Anglo-French Banking Corporation Ltd [(1933) 49 TLR 405], or in cases of fraud. See Zamir, The Declaratory Judgment (Stevens & Sons London ) p 169 ( a passage omitted from the second edition). A declaration of invalidity may be made if the tribunal was improperly constituted (Young on
Declaratory Orders 2nd ed (Butterworths Sydney 1984) [1502]) though there has only been one reported case on the point, Saffron versus Delaney [(1953) 53 SR ] where the claim failed on the merits.

The most recent reported instance of a declaration of invalidity of a superior court's decision is Bell-Booth versus Bell-Booth [[1998] 1 NZLR 375 (Smellie], J) reversed [[1998] 2 NZLR 2 (Court] of Appeal).
In that case, a judge had died after announcing his decision, but before giving reasons. Smellie, J declared that there had been no decision, but was reversed on appeal.

A problem that exists for a person obtaining such a declaration is that the original decision still appears on the court records, see Barham v
Stevenson [[1975] 1 NSWLR 31], 49.

A final procedural problem is that it is questionable whether there is power to order a rehearing after a declaration of nullity. Despite the considerable theoretical problems associated with this question, it is usually assumed that if the first hearing is regarded by certiorari, declaration or otherwise as a simulacrum of a trial, a rehearing should be ordered. Indeed, this obligation to rehear in the case of the prerogative orders was in classical times enforced by way of mandamus, see Ex parte Nolan; Re Mayger <case>; [(1947) 48 SR 143], and see also R versus Barker <case>; [(1762) Burr 1265]; [97 ER 823]; R versus Licensing Court of Innisfail; Ex parte Del Vecchia [[1926] St R Qd 43]; Cameron versus Cole (supra); R versus Northumberland Compensation
Appeal Tribunal: Ex Parte Shaw <case>; [[1952] KB 338](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%201%20KB%20338 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 354 & 357; R versus Industrial Appeals Court; Ex Parte Henry Berry & Co
Ltd <case>; [[1955] VLR 156], 165.

Accordingly, whichever way one looks at this application it must fail. As the main thrust of the application was a matter within the purview of the Court of
Criminal Appeal, it is not appropriate to make any order as to costs.
