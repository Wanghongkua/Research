JUDGMENT - Ex tempore  October , 2010  This is a series of applications by the receivers and the administrators of
Clivpee Limited for the transfer of nine proceedings in this Court to the
Supreme Court of Victoria.
 The applications are made either pursuant to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/s5.html) of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/joca1987427/) or, if the more appropriate statutory jurisdiction is that of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), then, pursuant to [s
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1337h.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth). It is said that the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) may be the more appropriate statutory jurisdictional basis because all proceedings are appeals from decisions of the receiver to reject certain claims by creditors of the company in administration and also in receivership.
 It does not really matter, for the purposes of determining these applications, whether the jurisdiction being exercised is that of the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) or the jurisdiction afforded to the Court, pursuant to [s
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1337h.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). As
Barrett J says in Global Realty Development Corporation versus Dominion Wines Ltd (in liq) <case> at <case> ff, the essential considerations of discretion to be exercised under both the [Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/joca1987427/) and [s
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1337h.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) are the same.
 If need be, I would have granted leave to amend the Plaintiff's applications to add a claim based under [s
H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1337h.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). The result is the same, regardless of which jurisdiction was invoked, as a matter of substance.
 I intend to deal only briefly with the relevant considerations.
 There are nine separate proceedings in this Court in which creditors of
Clivpee Limited wish to appeal from decisions of the receivers rejecting their claims. Mr Lucarelli of Counsel, who appears for the receivers, points to the fact that both the receivers and the administrators are located in Victoria because Clivpee's business head office was in Victoria, although it conducted business in New South Wales and probably other States as well.
 Mr Lucarelli submits, with his customary eloquence and cogency, that it would be conducive to the efficient and expeditious administration of
Clivpee's affairs, both in receivership and in administration, that one Court, and probably one Judge of that Court, case manage - if not hear - all these applications as well as any future applications of a similar nature. Mr
Lucarelli frankly concedes, however, that he cannot say that either the factual issues or the legal issues in the nine proceedings in this Court are so closely aligned as to justify an order that all proceedings be heard together, the evidence in one being evidence in the other.
 He says, however, that there is already, in the Victorian Supreme Court, a substantial piece of litigation which may involve some of the issues which may arise in some of the nine proceedings in this Court, but he does not say that the similarity of issues would provide any template for management of the nine proceedings in this Court.
 In a very corporate large insolvency, special arrangements are sometimes made in a court to have one judge case manage a variety of different applications which may be made in that administration so as to produce some sort of cost and time efficiency. If those arrangements were already in place for the administration of Clivpee in the Victorian Supreme Court, that may well have been a weighty factor in the exercise of discretion in this case.
 However, the circumstances in this case are that, apart from one piece of litigation already in the Supreme Court of Victoria, all other litigation involving rejection of creditors' claims by the receivers has been commenced in this Court. The effect of what the receivers and administrators are asking is that nine cases from the New South Wales Supreme Court be added to the one case in the Victorian Supreme Court, supposedly in the interests of efficient administration of the insolvent affairs of Clivpee.
 The fact that these nine cases are appeals from the decisions of the receivers and administrators does not alone warrant a conclusion that any real economy in terms of cost or time saving would be achieved by the transfer of the proceedings to Victoria.
 Mr Lucarelli suggests that the nine cases in this Court could be case managed together. I think it is fair to say that that position at the moment appears to be no more than a desirable possibility, having regard to the various factual and legal issues that may arise severally in each of these proceedings. Certainly, none of the Plaintiffs in these proceedings could agree today on a common timetable for case management or even on a common date for a future directions hearing.
 It may be, in the longer term, that if these cases proceed in the New South
Wales Supreme Court, one Judge - whether it be in the General List of the
Equity Division or the Corporations List - comes to be sufficiently familiar with the general contours of all proceedings so that that he or she can effectively case manage all the litigation in an efficient and cost-saving manner. However, that remains to be seen, as the issues in each proceeding emerge.
 It is sufficient for present purposes to say that nothing has been made to appear at this stage which warrants the transfer of proceedings, quite properly commenced in the New South Wales Supreme Court, to the Victorian
Supreme Court.
 I therefore dismiss these applications.
