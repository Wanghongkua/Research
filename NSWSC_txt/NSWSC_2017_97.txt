JUDGMENT
The plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of a forfeiture order under [s 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) of the Act and an unexplained wealth order pursuant to [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the Act.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act says that the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person whose interest in property is sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime related activity, stating the grounds on which the suspicion referred to therein is based, and the court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 16 February 2017. Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the defendants have engaged in serious crime related activity or activities. In the case of the first defendant, the offences are cultivating a prohibited plant of a greater than a commercial quantity and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. Those offences are contrary to [s 23](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s23.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and [s 193B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) respectively.
In the case of the second defendant, the offence is knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. Both the drug offences and dealing with the proceeds of crime offence are serious criminal offences pursuant to [s 6(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). 
Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading the facts sheets prepared by the police after the arrest of the defendants. In relation to the first defendant, Ms Bourne sought from the officer she believed had prepared the facts sheet, confirmation that he had done so, that the facts sheet was true to the best of his knowledge and belief and that the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by police as a result of their investigation. The officer concerned replied in the affirmative to those questions adding that the facts sheet was prepared by him in conjunction with another officer.
When he replied to Ms Bourne he also said this in his email: 
Currently detectives are in the process of charging Jamie Dunn's father,
Bruce Dunn, at Dubbo Police Station. These charges relate to firearms and dealing with the proceeds of crime offences identified through a search warrant at the property referred to the day before the email was sent.

The officer concerned attached the facts sheets both for Bruce Dunn and for
Jamie Dunn.
I am satisfied, therefore, that Ms Bourne's suspicion as to the commission of serious crime related activities by Bruce Dunn is reasonably held.
Ms Bourne also annexes the results of searches carried out by persons in her office from such places as the LPI and the RMS. I am satisfied from an examination of those searches that her suspicion that the defendants own the property shown in that material is reasonably held.
I am also satisfied from reading the facts sheets concerning both Jamie and Bruce Dunn that her suspicion that the offences have been committed is reasonably held.
The plaintiff seeks that the orders be made without prior notice to the defendants. It does so based on what Ms Bourne says in paragraph 12 of her affidavit, that through her experience with the plaintiff, she is aware that in the absence of a restraining order it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages of real estate and to dispose of motor vehicles very quickly and to backdate the motor vehicle transfer forms in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act.
I am satisfied that the orders should be made without prior notice to the defendants. The defendants have their rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review.
I note the usual undertaking as to damages is given by the solicitor for the plaintiff. On that basis I make orders in terms of paras 1-5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 of the draft order. I grant the leave and liberty in paras 6 and 9.
The matter is stood over for directions before the common law registrar at 9am on Monday 15 May 2017.
These orders may be entered forthwith.
