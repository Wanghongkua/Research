JUDGE1
KIRBY P These proceedings involve an appeal to the Court from an interlocutory decision of Rolfe J in the Common Law Division of the Supreme
Court. The Court also has before it an appeal to Allen J from a decision of
Master Malpass, which was removed into this Court by order of Allen J.
The issues raised involve questions of constitutional law, as well as an alleged estoppel. The parties agreed before this Court to limit the argument to the constitutional law issues. If the appellants are successful on the constitutional law point, any examination of the estoppel issues would be unnecessary. If they are unsuccessful, then it was decided that this Court would examine the estoppel arguments at a later date. Since the decision of
Master Malpass was concerned solely with the alleged estoppel, it is not necessary for this Court to examine that decision at this stage. I therefore turn to the constitutional question.
 
The Commonwealth leases a Property to the appellants
The facts of this case, relevant to the constitutional question, are not in issue between the parties.
The Commonwealth of Australia let residential premises at Lot 2 Anton Road, Luddenham to the appellants. The lease purported to be subject to a Residential Tenancy Agreement pursuant to the [Residential
Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) (the Act). The initial lease was for a term of one year, 10 weeks and six days. The lease commenced on 17 May 1991 and ended on 31
July
At the expiration of that term the appellants were permitted to stay in the premises on the same terms, by inference unless and until the agreement was ended in accordance with the Act.
It was alleged by the Commonwealth, and conceded by the appellants, that although rent was paid for some time, from 28 February 1992 the appellants fell into arrears. On 14 December 1992, as a result of this failure to maintain their rental payments, the Commonwealth served a Notice of
Termination of the Residential Tenancy Agreement on the appellants. The notice purported to terminate their right to occupy the premises from 8 January 1993.
The appellants remained in possession of the premises.
The Commonwealth then commenced proceedings against the appellants in the
Supreme Court of New
South Wales. The proceedings were instituted on 23 April
The Statement of Claim sought judgment for possession, leave to issue a
Writ of Execution for possession, judgment for the unpaid rent and for further rent accruing to the date of judgment or when the property was vacated by the appellants (whichever was earlier), interest, and costs.
On 2 February 1994 judgment was entered against the appellants in default of a Defence being filed on their behalf The Commonwealth was awarded possession of the land. The appellants were ordered to pay the sum of $18,400.56 as well as $898 in costs.
The appellants then filed a Notice of Motion seeking a stay of execution of the Writ of Possession, and an order that the judgment for possession be set aside. A stay was granted by Finlay J. The motion for an order setting aside the judgment was heard by Rolfe J. This appeal is against the decision of Rolfe
J and his Honour's orders.
After the filing of the appeal, the appellants filed a fresh Notice of
Motion seeking to set aside the default judgment. They produced a number of affidavits in support of this motion. It was this which was the motion which was heard by Master Malpass who dismissed it on 26 May 1995. The appellants appealed from the order of Master Malpass to a Judge of the
Common Law
Division. This is the proceeding which, in turn, came before Allen J. On 13
June 1995 Allen J referred the appeal to this
Court. As I have indicated, for the time being, this Court has chosen to set the appeal from Master Malpass to one side and to address the constitutional issue. If it is resolved favourably to the appellants they do not need the estoppel arguments which represent their alternative strategy to defeat the Commonwealth.
 
The primary judge refuses to set aside the default judgment for possession
To be successful in an application to set aside a default judgment, the applicant must ordinarily satisfy two conditions. First, there must an arguable defence on the merits of the case. Secondly, the applicants must be able to explain the delay which has arisen in defending the proceedings. In the present case, the Commonwealth did not argue that the second element, the explanation of the delay, had not been established. Therefore Rolfe J was only concerned to consider whether there was a bona fide defence on the merits.
The first defence pressed by the appellants before his Honour was stated as follows: "In answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim, the defendants (appellants) deny that the plaintiff (respondent) is entitled to any of the relief claimed therein in this
Honourable Court and say that the plaintiff is precluded from seeking any such relief in this Honourable Court pursuant to the provisions of [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/)."
The second defence was based an estoppel which was alleged to have arisen pursuant to an agreement between the appellants and the Commonwealth's solicitors. Because of the constitutional implications of the first defence, the Attorney-General for New
South Wales intervened pursuant to [s 78A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78a.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth). He supported the arguments of the appellants.
[Section 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) (the Act) provides: "71. No proceedings in the Supreme Court, the District Court or a Local Court to obtain recovery of possession of residential premises subject to a residential tenancy agreement shall be commenced by a landlord against a tenant or former tenant of the landlord."
The intention of Parliament in enacting this provision is clear enough.
It is to ensure that disputes concerning leases subject to a Residential
Tenancy Agreement should be heard by the Residential Tenancies
Tribunal established by the Act rather than by the courts.
[Section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s4.html) of the Act provides: "4. Except as provided by [s 132](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s132.html) (a provision which deals with the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation and is not relevant in this case) this Act binds the Crown, not only in the right of New South Wales but also, so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, the Crown in all its other capacities."
Rolfe J began his analysis of the appellants' intended defence based on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the Act by examining the decision of the High Court of Australia in The
Commonwealth versus Rhind <case>; [(1966) 119 CLR 584.] His Honour explained that that case had been relied upon by the appellants to show that "a section may provide a defence without amounting to a deprivation of jurisdiction". However, his
Honour concluded that the decision did not advance the case for the appellants.
Rolfe J then examined, what he termed, "the nature and effect of the rights created by [s 71".](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) After examining the decisions in The Commonwealth v
Evans Deakin Industries Limited and Anor <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 254], his Honour concluded that both of those decisions supported the view that [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) did not constitute a defence to the present proceedings. He stated: "The distinction drawn in Anderson is between, on the one hand, a legislative provision which prevents the ventilation of the rights of the parties in their respective capacities as lessor and lessee, or former lessor and former lessee and, on the other hand, a legislative provision which regulates those rights in a duly constituted suit between the parties. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) says nothing about the rights of the parties in the capacity of lessor and lessee. It precludes a consideration of any such rights. Therefore there is no suit to which [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) (of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/)) is referable and hence, no rights exercisable in that suit. In my opinion the rights conferred by [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) are not rights which fall within the contemplation of [s 64."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html)
Rolfe J therefore concluded that the appellants' argument based on [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act did not constitute a defence on the merits to the action by the
Commonwealth. His Honour also found that the argument based upon the alleged estoppel did not constitute a bona fide defence. He therefore dismissed the appellants' motion. It is from that order of dismissal that the appeal comes, by leave earlier granted, to this Court.
 
Issues raised before the Court of Appeal
The relevant issues which have arisen before the Court are as follows: 
Whether [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act is a provision which denies jurisdiction to the courts in question, or whether the section creates a defence to any proceedings brought contrary to its terms? 
If [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act simply provides a defence, whether the New South Wales
Parliament had the intention, and, if so, the power, to make that defence under the Act available against the Commonwealth? 
If [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act provides a defence, but this defence is not available against the Commonwealth by the terms of the Act, whether it is available against the Commonwealth by reason of the operation of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary
Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth)? and 
If [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act does deprive the courts of jurisdiction rather than provide a defence, whether [s 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) (2) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) operates so as to deny jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in the present case? 
A subordinate and consequential question arises as to the jurisdiction of the
Residential Tenancies Tribunal to hear and determine proceedings involving the
Commonwealth as a party.
 
The proper characterisation of [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act - a defence
The leading authority on the proper construction of sections such as [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act is the decision of the High Court in The Commonwealth versus Rhind <case>; [(1966) 119 CLR 584.] That case concerned [s 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/s2a.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/), which was a predecessor to <case> of the Act. Relevantly, [s 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/s2a.html) provided: "2A. (1) No action of ejectment in the Supreme Court or a
District Court, or proceedings under <case> of this Act, for the recovery of any land or premises or part of any land or premises from the tenant or any person claiming under him who is actually occupying such land or premises or part shall be commenced by the landlord if there is situated on the land or the premises are or include, a dwelling house ..."
In Rhind, the Commonwealth had commenced an action in ejectment in the
Supreme Court of New South Wales. The trial judge (Brereton J) accepted the defence put by the tenant that the Supreme Court was denied jurisdiction by the terms of [s 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/s2a.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant Act 1899](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/). However before Brereton
J had entered judgment, the Commonwealth appealed to the Full Court against the direction to enter judgment.
The Commonwealth raised the constitutional validity of [s 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/s2a.html) before the Full Court. In accordance with the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), as it then stood, the matter was thereupon automatically removed into the High
Court.
Four of the five justices sitting on the case in the High Cowl, namely
Barwick CJ, McTiernan, Taylor and Owen JJ, considered that, upon its removal to the High Court, the case was to be treated as if it had been commenced in that Court, as an original action of ejectment. Thus, since <case> of the
New
South Wales Act did not purport to apply to actions commenced in the High
Court the section could be of no application in that case.
Menzies J took a different view. His Honour considered that the proceedings before the High Court were in the nature of an appeal (the process being removed from the Full Court), and therefore, the High Court was required to consider whether Brereton
J had been correct in applying <case> to deny the
Supreme Court jurisdiction.
Although it was not necessary for his decision, given that he had held that <case> was not applicable in the High Court Barwick CJ examined the nature of the section. Clearly these comments were obiter dicta. However, his Honour said, at 598: "... as they have been fully debated, and as my view of the effect of <case> of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) in this case may not be shared by others, I should express my opinion upon the several questions which have been thought to be involved in the cause which has been removed here. Logically, the first question is whether <case> does effect a limit to the otherwise general State jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in ejectment. For if it does, the invested federal jurisdiction will shrink pro tanto. Also, the Crown would not, in my opinion, have any prerogative right to bring an action in a court which by statute that Court has no jurisdiction to entertain. But I have come to the conclusion that <case> merely provides a defendant who can bring the plaintiff and the subject mailer within its terms with a defence to an action of ejectment in the Supreme Court. Language which may be sufficient to deprive a statutory court such as the District Court of jurisdiction is not necessarily apt to limit the jurisdiction of a superior court such as the Supreme
Court of New South Wales. In my opinion, <case> does not set a limit to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and thus does not reduce the ambit of the federal jurisdiction of that Court in ejectment invested by [s 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) (2) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/)."
Barwick CJ plainly considered that <case> created a defence to proceedings brought contrary to the terms of the section, and was not a provision which denied jurisdiction to the Supreme Court. McTiernan J agreed with the reasons given by the Chief Justice.
Although he approached the case in a different manner, Menzies J reached the same conclusion on nature of <case>. At 606,
Menzies J stated: "The foregoing consideration of the problem does take for granted that [s 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/s2a.html) of the [Landlord and Tenant Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/) is what it appears to be, viz., a law prohibiting persons within the description to be found therein from resorting to the jurisdiction of the Court and not a section depriving the
Supreme Court of jurisdiction with the consequence that the 
Commonwealth would have sued in a court without any jurisdiction to entertain its action: cf [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), [s 39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) (2) ... I am satisfied, therefore, that <case> does not limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in ejectment actions."
Of the other members of the High Court sitting in Rhind, Owen J felt it unnecessary to comment upon this issue, whilst Taylor
J expressed the view, at , that <case> was a provision which operated so as to limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
 .
In summary, Barwick CJ in obiter remarks and McTiernan J supported the proposition that <case> provided a defence rather than a limitation on the
Supreme Court's jurisdiction. Menzies J did so as part of the ratio decidendi of his decision. Against these opinions stands the decision of Taylor J.
Counsel for the Attorney-General for New South Wales also referred to the decision of this Court in Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority versus Stewart [(1972) NSWLR 735 (CA).] It was submitted that in that case, the Court (comprising of
Hardie JA, Street CJ in Eq, and Hutley AJA) had referred with apparent approval to a concession by counsel that the obiter remarks of the High Court in Rhind, were decisive in determining the proper construction of <case>.
Although it is not of great significance, this submission appears to be correct.
The Commonwealth argued that [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act should be read as denying jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, rather than providing a defence. Although the Commonwealth emphasised the obiter nature of the remarks in Rhind, its submission was that [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) of the Act should be interpreted differently to <case>, since <case> was in much more limited terms than its successor. The Commonwealth submitted that, in its provisions, the present Act was closer to the [Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1948](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1948257/) especially <case>. That statute was considered by the High Court in The Commonwealth versus Anderson <case>; [(1960) 105 CLR 303.] In that case, Dixon CJ indicated that the provisions of the 1948 Act excluded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
A close examination of both provisions suggests, that <case> and <case> should, in all relevant senses, be treated as identical. Dixon CJ's analysis of the 1948 Art, a quite differently worded statute, could not change this assessment. Rhind was decided six years after Anderson, although none of the justices in Rhind found it necessary to refer to Anderson in reaching their conclusions as to the proper construction of <case>. From Rhind it appears that, on its true characterisation, <case> (like <case> there considered) creates a defence to proceedings brought contrary to the terms of the section. Section should not be read as denying jurisdiction to the Supreme Court. Instead, it creates a defence, as the majority in Rhind concluded of a like provision.
 
The defence created by <case> of the Act is available against the Commonwealth
Clearly, the New South Wales legislature, in enacting the [Residential
Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), intended to bind the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, if it had the power to do so. [Section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s4.html) of the Act is unambiguous in this respect. However, it is equally clear, within decisions binding upon this
Court, that the State legislature did not have the power to do so. Counsel for the Attorney-General of New South Wales acknowledged that, despite certain comments by the High Court in the recent me of Jacobsen versus Rogers <case>; [(1995) 69
ALJR 131 (HC)] meant that at least so far as this Court was concerned, a State Parliament does not have the power to control the legal rights and duties between the Commonwealth and others. Interestingly, it is worth noticing the obiter remarks of Barwick CJ in Rhind which indicated that, if <case> had sought to create a defence as against the Commonwealth as landlord, it would have been ultra vires the New
South
Wales Parliament to that extent. Undoubtedly then, [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the Act cannot apply to the Commonwealth of its own force.
However, the appellants submitted that [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) could apply to the
Commonwealth by way of the operation of 64 of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth). In doing so, it was argued, it applies by reason of the enactment of the Federal
Parliament which has undoubted power to bind the Commonwealth in this respect.
[Section 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of that Act provides: "Rights of parties
In any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject"
In Asiatic Steam Navigation Co Ltd versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1956) 96 CLR 397] at 427, Kitto J described the effect of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) as follows: "(It) must be interpreted as taking up and enacting as the law to be applied in every suit to which the Commonwealth or a
State is a party, the whole body of the law, statutory or not, by which the rights of the parties would be governed if the
Commonwealth or State were a subject instead of being the
Crown."
This interpretation was also adopted in Maguire v Simpson <case>; [(1977) 139 CLR ] at 383. In the present case it would therefore appear, that [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) would operate to expose the Commonwealth to the effect of the New South Wales law.
That is, in the dispute between the Commonwealth and the appellants, the rights of parties would be held, as nearly as possible, to the same as they would be if the suit were between two subjects. Since the appellants would have been able to rely upon [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) if their landlord had been a subject i.e. an ordinary Australian citizen or resident, rather than the Commonwealth, [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) had the effect of permitting them, indirectly, to rely on the [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) as a defence to the action initiated by the Commonwealth.
In opposing this interpretation of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), the
Commonwealth relied primarily on the decision of Dixon CJ in Anderson. In considering whether the Landlord and Tenant Amendment
Act 1948-1958 (an Act which expressly stated that it did not apply to the Crown in right of the
Commonwealth) could apply to the
Commonwealth by virtue of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/), Dixon CJ said, at 310: "... the essential condition of the application of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) is the existence of the suit to which the Commonwealth is a party and as a result of <case> (2) of the Judiciary Act 1903-1958 that includes a suit in the Supreme Court in which the Commonwealth is plaintiff. It is obvious therefore that no provision of
State law which provides that such a suit shall not be brought in the Supreme Court as between subject and subject can be source of such rights." 
At 311, Dixon CJ continued: "It is difficult, indeed it is impossible, to find in Pt III the creation of definite rights between subject and subject operating independently of the authority of the competent courts, the petty sessions and proclaimed tenancy courts. In other words the provisions contained in Pt III are not the source of definite rights between subject and subject capable of appropriation under [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) to the purpose of determining what are the rights between the Commonwealth and its tenants in a suit in the High Court or
Supreme Court.
Provisions of a State law of such a land denying general jurisdiction which would otherwise exist over a subject matter and committing the subject to a special tribunal armed with particular powers and discretions in the judicial administration of State legislative restrictions on common law rights cannot supply the rights between subjects to be applied pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) in the actual exercise of the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court and High Court invested by the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) or [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/). In the application of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) you begin with the exercise of the jurisdiction and of the suit brought by or against the Commonwealth or State. [Part III](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/index.html#p3) is based essentially upon the condition it prescribes that no such suit can be brought between subject and subject because their legal relations in the relevant subject matter are regulated otherwise. There can be no resulting rights between subject and subject which can be treated as the same between the
Commonwealth and the overholding tenant whether absolute or as nearly as possible."
Rolfe J considered that the distinction drawn in Anderson was between "a legislative provision which prevents the ventilation of the rights of the parties" on the one hand, and "a legislative provision which regulates those rights in a duly constituted suit between the parties", on the other. With respect, I think that this approach to the operation of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) is too restrictive. I do not consider that it represents what Dixon CJ was saying.
The Chief Justice's remarks in Anderson were usefully interpreted and re- expressed by Gibbs J in Maguire. Having referred, with approval, to the approach to [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) followed by Kitto J in Asiatic Steam
Navigation Co Ltd versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1957) 96 CLR 397], Gibbs J said, at 384, in reference to Anderson: "All this case decided is that a provision of a State law which prevents a court from exercising jurisdiction in a suit of a particular kind is not applied by [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) because it is only when the court has jurisdiction that [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) can operate." [Section 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) can, and will, operate to ensure that the rights of a subject will be the same whether the suit is against another subject or the
Commonwealth or a State. This is an equitable provision by which the
Commonwealth surrenders, by its own legislation, certain immunities which would otherwise attach to it from its nature and from the inheritance of the royal prerogative. Plainly the section will be of no use if the court, in any particular situation, is without jurisdiction. In such a case there will be no scope for the rights of the parties, be they subject or Crown, to be exercised and determined. However, if the court does have jurisdiction, there will not be a bar to the operation of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html), even if some legislative provision has the effect of creating a defence which prevents "the ventilation" in the court of certain rights of the parties. In Maguire, the High Court applied [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) so as to make the Commonwealth subject to a [Limitation Act 1969](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) , regardless of the fact that the limitation statute prevented the "ventilation" of the substantive rights which the Commonwealth, could otherwise have enforced.
I have already indicated that [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s71.html) of the Act operates so as to provide a defence to proceedings brought in breach of the terms of the section. It does not deny the
Court's jurisdiction over the dispute. Accepting the analysis of
Anderson undertaken by Gibbs J in Maguire, there is no reason why
Anderson should prevent the application of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) to this case. In this way, the Commonwealth is subject to [s 71.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) It is so not by the terms of the State Act as such, but by its own legislation.
However, the Commonwealth submitted an additional reason why <case> should not apply in this case. It argued that the rights of the Commonwealth and of the appellants could not be "as nearly as possible" the same as they would be if the dispute were between two subjects. It was not made particularly clear why, in this case, the rights could not be "as nearly as possible" identical.
However, as I understood the argument, it appeared to turn on the special position of the Crown, of which the Commonwealth was relevantly a manifestation.
The phrase "as nearly as possible" was considered by the High Court in
The Commonwealth versus Evans Deakin Industries Ltd <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 254.] In their joint judgment, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson Deane and Dawson JJ said of it, at -5: "The natural meaning of the expression appears to be that suggested by Kitto J in Asiatic Steam Navigation Co. Ltd v
The Commonwealth: "as completely as possible"
Kitto J went on to say (at 428) that <case> in effect requires the court "to put out of account any special position of the
Crown, and as far as possible to decide all questions of right in the same way as they would have been decided if the Commonwealth or State had been a subject" It is unnecessary to consider for present purposes whether in some cases at least it would be right to consider the special position of the Crown, but this is not a case of that kind Here the Commonwealth in entering into a building contract, was not performing a function peculiar to government, it was making a contract of a kind commonly entered into by ordinary members of the public and the determination of the rights and liabilities of the Commonwealth by reference to the Subcontractors' Charges Act (the State Act then before the Court) would not be incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth or detrimental to the public welfare."
Adopting the characterisation of the phrase sanctioned by the majority of the High Court in the above passage, I can see no reason why the phrase would prevent the application of <case> of the Act to the Commonwealth in the present case. In leasing the land to the Whitefords, the Commonwealth was not performing a function peculiar to government. Rather, it was entering into an ordinary contract, such as is regularly entered into by members of the public i.e. by ordinary subjects. Once it chose to enter such a contract, and, in particular, once it chose to enter into a Residential Tenancy Agreement, the
Commonwealth was bound in this State by the law of New South Wales which attached to such Agreements.
I cannot see how the imposition of the Act could be considered to be incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth, intrusive upon its governmental functions or detrimental to the public welfare.
I can therefore find no reason why the Commonwealth should not be held to be subject to [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) as any other person would be.
 
The power of the Tribunal to determine the Commonwealth's claim
This conclusion leads me to one final matter which was raised during argument before this Court. Given that the Commonwealth is, upon the view which I favour, unable to prosecute proceedings relating to this dispute in the Supreme Court (or in the District Court, or any Local Court) its only alternative is, as [s 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the Act intended, to bring the proceedings before the Residential Tenancy Tribunal. However, the members of the Tribunal are not tenured judges. The Tribunal cannot enforce its own orders other than orders for possession. The Tribunal's procedures are generally quite informal. The question therefore arises: can the Tribunal exercise power over the
Commonwealth?
I do not see why not.
The alleged difficulties are, in fact, illusory.
The Tribunal is not invested with federal jurisdiction as such. Nor is it exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The difficulties which might need to be considered if the Tribunal were a federal body present no obstacle in this case since the Commonwealth will take State bodies as it finds them. It cannot require that they satisfy special conditions deemed necessary or desirable by the Commonwealth. Within its own governmental sphere, a number of Federal disputes are dealt with by tribunals, notably the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A similar pattern of creating specialist tribunals with particular jurisdiction and informal procedures has been evident in the State sphere, as in the Federal. There is no reason why, within their jurisdictions, such tribunals should not be availed of by the
Commonwealth when other subjects are obliged to do so, at least in circumstances such as the present, where the Commonwealth is not performing a function particular to its character as a governmental entity. The
Commonwealth should submit its dispute with the Whitefords to the Tribunal as any other lessor would be required to do.
It would lead to enormous confusion and discordancy of substantive and procedural law in New South Wales if the position of the Commonwealth as a lessor were to be different and in some way privileged. There is no reason why it should be so. There is every reason why it should not. The Federal Parliament has ensured that it should not by the enactment of the assimilating provisions of [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/).
Although I do not think that the Residential Tenancies Tribunal would need to be invested with federal jurisdiction as such in the present circumstances, the opposite conclusion would not necessarily be fatal to conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal in a case involving the Commonwealth.
In The Commonwealth versus The Hospital Contribution Fund and Ors <case>; [(1981) 150 CLR ], Gibbs CJ, at 57, said that: "a (State) court composed of laymen, with no security of tenure, might effectively be invested with (federal) jurisdiction under [s 77](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s77.html) (iii) (of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/))."
Furthermore, in Harris versus Caladine <case>; [(1991) 172 CLR 84], McHugh J, at 159 -160, said: "... the (Federal) Parliament might confer federal jurisdiction on a State court whose members did not have the security of tenure and remuneration afforded by [s 72](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s72.html) (of the Federal [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)) ... "
It is clear that these statements do not provide unequivocal support for the proposition that the Tribunal is empowered to exercise power over the
Commonwealth. However, they do show that the requirements imposed by the
Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) will be applied with flexibility in circumstances such as the present. The Commonwealth entered into a Residential Tenancies
Agreement with the Wbitefords. It thereby acknowledged that it would be bound by the requirements Which attach to such Agreements. The requirements include submission of disputes to the Tribunal. Later, it seems, the Commonwealth had second thoughts and now wishes to avoid both the agreement it entered into and the assimilation of its position to that of other landlords for which the
Federal Parliament has provided. This endeavour fails. The Commonwealth should be required to submit to the decision of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal if it wishes to claim relief pursuant to the Agreement it entered. Orders 
The orders which I favour are: 
Appeal allowed;
Set aside the orders of the Common Law Division (Rolfe J); 
In lieu thereof, order: that the default judgment therein be set aside;
That the appellants have leave, within 14 days, to file their proposed defence;
That upon the filing of that defence the Commonwealth's statement of claim in so far as it seeks judgment of the Supreme
Court for possession and leave to issue a writ of execution for possession out of the Supreme Court, be dismissed;
Order that the appellants pay the Commonwealth's costs of the motion for extension of time within which to be permitted to file a defence; .
Order that otherwise the Commonwealth pay the appellants' costs at first instance; 
Order that the Commonwealth pay the appellants' costs of the appeal; and
Liberty reserved for further orders as required.
JUDGE2
SHELLER JA [Section 71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) provides that no proceedings in the Supreme Court to obtain recovery of possession of residential premises subject to a residential tenancy agreement shall be commenced by a landlord against a tenant or former tenant of the landlord. On April 1993 the Commonwealth by statement of claim commenced just such proceedings in the Supreme Court. On 2 February 1994 the Commonwealth obtained judgment in default of defence and an order for possession. By notice of motion of 24 April 1994 the defendant tenants applied to have the order for possession set aside. On 5 August 1994 Rolfe J dismissed this application. The tenants appeal.
The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear proceedings in which the
Commonwealth is a party can only be federal jurisdiction invested in it by [s39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/). Because the investiture of this jurisdiction is only "within the limits" of the jurisdiction of that Court "whether such limits are as to locality, subject matter, or otherwise", the operation of [s39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) is ambulatory and relates to the limits for the time being of the jurisdiction of the State Court; The Commonwealth versus Rhind [(1966) 119 CLR 589.]
The first question is whether [s71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s71.html) operates to limit the invested federal jurisdiction. In Rhind's case the majority of the Court (Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Menzies
JJ) considered that s2A (1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act -1965 merely provided a defendant who could bring the plaintiff and the subject matter within its terms, with a defence to an action of ejectment in the Supreme Court; at 598, 600 and 606-7. As it happens the dicta to this effect of Barwick CJ and McTiernan J were obiter but the dictum of Menzies J was part of the ratio.
Taylor J thought that s2A (1) did limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Owen J expressed no opinion on the point.
[Section 2A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/s2a.html) (1) of the [Landlord and Tenant Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lata1899177/) provided that no action of ejectment in the Supreme Court for the recovery of any land or premises from the tenant should be commenced by the landlord in the circumstances therein described. The effect of the sub-section is indistinguishable from that of s7l. The majority view requires the conclusion in the present case that s7l provides a tenant or former tenant with a defence and does not detract from the invested federal jurisdiction. It is unnecessary to decide whether State law could lawfully deny the Commonwealth access to the Supreme Court exercising federal jurisdiction.
The next question is whether the defence under s7l operates to defeat the
Commonwealth's proceedings in the Supreme Court. [Section 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) provides that in any suit in which the Commonwealth is a party, "the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject." [Section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s4.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) provides that the Act binds the Crown "not only in right of New South Wales but also, so far as the legislative power of Parliament permits, the Crown in all its other capacities." There is much to be said in principle for the view that the
Commonwealth having made a contract in New South Wales is affected by laws of the State which regulate how that contract may be enforced; The Commonwealth of Australia versus Bogle <case>; [(1953) 89 CLR 229] at 138. However this may be the words of [s64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) have the effect that the rights of the Commonwealth as a party to proceedings and the rights of all other parties are governed by a statute that would be applicable if both parties were subjects; Maguire versus Simpson <case>; [(1977) 139 CLR 362] at 376-7, 396-7 and 408. In The Commonwealth of Australia versus Evans Deakin Industries Limited <case>; [(1986) 161 CLR 254] at 264-5, five members of the High Court in a joint judgment adverted to the theory, rejected in Maguire versus Simpson, that [s64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s64.html) did not refer to the substantive rights of the parties and said: "The Supreme Court is given jurisdiction to entertain a suit to which the Commonwealth is a party by the combined effect of [s39](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) and [s75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s75.html) (iii) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). When an action is brought against the Commonwealth in the Supreme
Court the condition for the operation of [s64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s64.html) is satisfied: see
The Commonwealth versus Anderson (1960) 105 CLR at 310. Once the suit is commenced the substantive rights of the parties shall be, as nearly as possible, as in a suit between subject and subject. If the Commonwealth were a subject,
Evans Deakin, as sub-contractor, would, on the facts alleged in the statement of claim, be entitled to enforce the charge given by the
Subcontractors' Charges Act. The qualification to s64 expressed by the phrase 'as nearly as possible' would not render the
Subcontractors' Charges Act inapplicable. That phrase has been differently paraphrased by different judges, as the discussion by Stephen J in Maguire versus Simpson shows. The natural meaning of the expression appears to be that suggested by Kitto J in Asiatic Steam Navigation Co Ltd versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1956) 96 CLR 397] at 427: 'as completely as possible'. Kitto J went on to say at 428 that s64 in effect requires the court 'to put out of account any special position of the Crown, and as far as possible to decide all questions of right in the same way as they would have been decided if the Commonwealth or
State had been a subject'. It is unnecessary to consider for present purposes whether in some cases at least it would be right to consider the special position of the Crown, but this is not a case of that kind."
The Commonwealth is a landlord which made a residential tenancy agreement with the defendants and is in no special position.
Rolfe J said that there was no suggestion that the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court was affected. The issue was the nature and effect of the rights created by s71. He concluded that the Commonwealth of Australia versus Anderson <case>; [(1960) 105 CLR 303] was clear authority for the proposition that s7l did not constitute a defence to the proceedings. In particular his Honour referred to the following passage in the judgment of Dixon CJ at 310: "It may be conceded, at all events for the purposes of the argument, that once you have a suit in the High Court or the
Supreme Court to which the Commonwealth is a party, then for all purposes to which the words 'rights of parties', on the true meaning of the provision, extend, the law as between subject and subject must so far as possible be taken to supply the rights of the parties notwithstanding that one is a goverment.
It is perhaps not unimportant to bear in mind that it is the rights of parties as in a suit between subject and subject, not the law, that are to apply as nearly as may be.
But in any case the essential condition of the application of s64 is the existence of the suit to which the Commonwealth is a party and as a result of s39 (2) of the Judiciary Act -1959 that includes a suit in the Supreme Court in which the Commonwealth is plaintiff. It is obvious therefore that no provision of State law which provides that such a suit shall not be brought in the Supreme Court as between subject and subject can be the source of such rights. Now a provision of
Pt III of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1948-1958 which is essential to its operation is s69, making courts of petty sessions the only competent courts for the purposes of the material provisions of Pt III which govern in substance the regulation of the rights at common law as between subject and subject. Clearly s69 can have no effect under [s64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) yet it is an inseverable part of the regulation of the rights of landlord and tenant contained in [Pt III](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/index.html#p3) of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1948-1958."
In Maguire versus Simpson at 384 Gibbs J said of The Commonwealth v
Anderson: "All that this case decided is that a provision of a State law which prevents a court from exercising jurisdiction in a suit of a particular kind is not applied by s64 because it is only when the court has jurisdiction that s64 can operate.
The statement by Dixon CJ that 'it is the rights of parties ...
not the law, that are to apply' was described by Windeyer
J in Downes versus Williams <case>; [(1976) 126 CLR 61] at 83 as 'somewhat cryptic and elliptical' and it is in many cases difficult to see the significance of the distinction which
Dixon CJ drew, since if rights are applied the law which is their source can for practical purposes be regarded as equally applicable.
However, Dixon CJ may have had in mind no more than the very situation with which The Commonwealth versus Anderson was concerned, ie, a case in which the law which it was sought to apply affected the jurisdiction of the court and not the rights of the parties in the court which was exercising jurisdiction."
The distinction may be a nice one but the majority in Rhind's case, albeit two of them obiter, have said that a section substantially to the same effect as s7l does not prevent the
Supreme Court from exercising jurisdiction but gives to the defendant a defence. Once it is accepted that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction, s64 operates in the manner described in Maguire versus Simpson and The Commonwealth versus Evans Deakin Industries Limited. For these reasons
I agree with the orders proposed by Kirby ACJ.
JUDGE3
POWELL JA The facts which have given rise to these proceedings, and the issues which have arisen for determination, have been set out in the Judgment which has been prepared by Kirby P and need not be repeated by me. If I may, with respect, say so, it seems to me that the debate upon the question of the effect, and efficacy, of [s.71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/)") upon which the Court has been invited to adjudicate, seems to me to be one which is, in the ultimate, purposeless. I say this for the following reasons: - if, as the Commonwealth, relying on the decision of the High Court in The
Commonwealth v. Anderson ((1) <case>; [(1960) 105 CLR 303)], has submitted, the true view of [s.71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) is that, relevantly, it limits the jurisdiction of this Court in such matters, and if, as seems now to be accepted, the effect of the vesting, pursuant to the provisions of [s.77(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s77.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and of [s.39(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth), in this Court of federal jurisdiction within "the limits" of this Court's jurisdiction is ambulatory (The Commonwealth v.
Rhind ((2) [(1966) 119 CLR 585))] then the nett result is, merely, that, relevantly, this Court could not enter the Judgment in ejectment in favour of the Commonwealth against the Appellants. However, as the dismissal of the present proceedings would not be a dismissal on the merits, it would remain open to the Commonwealth to commence proceedings in the High
Court pursuant to the provisions of [s.75(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s75.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) seeking
Judgment in ejectment (see, The Commonwealth v. Rhind ((3) (supra)); if, however, as the Appellants, relying upon the decision of the High
Court in The Commonwealth v. Rhind ((4) (supra)), together with the decisions of the High Court (Maguire v.
Simpson ((5) <case>; [(1977) 139 CLR 362)] relating to the operation of [s.64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s64.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth), have submitted, the effect of [s.71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) is, relevantly, to remove from all lessors of residential properties - including the Commonwealth - the right which they would otherwise have, to bring proceedings in ejectment in this
Court, a "defence" based upon the provisions of [s.71](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s71.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) is, in reality, but "a dilatory plea", for, while it must be given effect to so as to lead to this Court entering Judgment in favour of the Appellants, it would remain open to the Commonwealth to commence proceedings in the High Court pursuant to the provisions of [s.71(iii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s71.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) seeking Judgment in ejectment (The Commonwealth v. Rhind ((7) (supra)).
However, notwithstanding my views as to the ultimate utility of the task which the Court has been called upon to perform, our task remains that of determining the question of law which has been presented to the Court.
As will be apparent from what I have written above, it is my view that whichever of the two approaches which have been advanced be correct, the result is still that, in the present case, it is not open to this Court to enter
Judgment in ejectment in favour of the Commonwealth against the
Appellants. This being so, I agree with the Orders which have been proposed by
Kirby P.
