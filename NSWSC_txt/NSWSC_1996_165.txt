JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Handley JA.
 
CLARKE JA I agree with Handley JA.

HANDLEY JA: On 21 February 1995 this Court gave judgment in the second appeal brought to determine the compensation payable by the Minister to Mr Bryan Haig for the resumption under the [Public Works Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pwa1912159/) on 11 January 1985 of Portion 36 of Parish of Gungarlin for incorporation in the Kosciusko National Park. That judgment is reported [(1995) 85 LGERA 435.] 
The proceedings have a long history. On 31 October 1988 the compensation payable to the appellant was assessed by Bignold J in the Land and Environment
Court at $395,500, on the basis that <case> of the [Public Works
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pwa1912159/) was applicable. The Minister appealed, and on 20 December 1990 this Court held that compensation was payable under <case> and not <case>. It set aside the assessment and remitted the proceedings to the Land and Environment Court to determine the compensation under <case>. The decision is reported [(1990) 21
NSWLR 482.] On 5 August 1991 the High Court refused leave to appeal. On May 1994 Bignold J assessed the compensation payable under <case> at $208,600. Mr Haig appealed to this Court and the Minister cross-appealed. On February 1995 this Court dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross-appeal in part, determining the compensation payable at $191,100. On 24 November 1995 the High Court refused leave to appeal.

Section 126 (1) of the [Public Works
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pwa1912159/) provides that compensation awarded or adjudged to be paid by the Constructing Authority "shall be paid" within one month after such amount is determined. The Minister made payments on account of the compensation to be assessed and on 7 August the balance of the compensation assessed by Bignold J plus statutory interest was paid. Although this Court set aside this assessment, it did not determine the compensation properly payable, but remitted the proceedings to the Land and Environment Court for that purpose. Accordingly at that stage the extent of any over-payment by the Minister could not be determined. This no doubt explains why no application was then made to this Court for an order that the excess be refunded.

Such an application was foreshadowed on 16 December 1994 at a late stage in the argument on the second appeal. Senior counsel then appearing for Mr Haig was taken by surprise and it was not possible for the Court to deal with the application at that time. The Minister by Notice of Motion filed on 9 November now applies for orders directing a refund of the overpaid compensation together with interest. The Court may make such orders even though the formal order of 21 February 1995 has been entered. See Production Spray Painting Pty
Limited versus Newnham (No 2) [(1991) 27 NSWLR 659] at 661.

The evidence for the Minister establishes that the amount overpaid for compensation and statutory interest was $250,403.33 and that this overpayment was made on 7 August 1989. Mr Haig submitted arguments on discretionary grounds why a refund should not be ordered. However the Court has no general discretion to exercise in a case such as this. A successful appellant is entitled as of right to restitution of any amounts overpaid pursuant to the judgment reversed. See Production Spray Painting Pty Limited versus Newnham (No 2) .

The Minister is entitled to an order that this amount be repaid with interest (Ibid and the cases there cited). He seeks an order under <case> of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) for interest to be paid from 7 August 1989 until judgment. Interest will then accrue under <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) until payment.

Under <case> (1) the Court has a discretion as to the rate of interest, the amount on which it should be paid, and the period during which it should be payable. Mr Haig in his written submissions contended that the amount on which interest was payable should be calculated by deducting: "from the amount paid for <case> compensation and (s 126A) interest ... the amount awarded for <case> compensation plus interest until the present date ...
I submit that the new award should be subject to the provisions of the (Public
Works) Act in relation to payment, which includes the payment of interest at the rate set out in the Act until the amount is paid".

This submission fails to take proper account of the fact that Mr Haig was paid the balance of the award under <case> and statutory interest on 7 August 1989, and has had the benefit of that money ever since. The calculation proposed by the Minister gives Mr Haig full credit for the amount of the ultimate award under <case> as from 7 August 1989. He has had the benefit of that amount in the meantime and will retain any interest or other income earned from it. He is not entitled to a double deduction for this amount, or for interest on it.

Mr Haig also relied on the history of this litigation including the conduct of the parties in the Land and Environment Court as outlined by Bignold J in his judgment on costs of 6 March 1996, a copy of which was made available to the
Court without objection after it had reserved judgment. These matters, in my view, are not relevant in determining the period for which interest should be paid. The plain fact is that since 7 August 1989 Mr Haig has had the benefit and use of the overpayments to which in the event he was not entitled which he must now refund.

Mr Haig submitted that the Court should not order interest to be paid retrospectively, but this is contrary to long established authority. In
Rodger versus The Comptoir d'Escompte de Paris <case>; [(1871)
LR 3 PC 465] at 475-6 Lord Cairns said: "It is contended, on the part of the respondents here, that the principal sum being restored to the present petitioners, they have no right to recover from them any interest. It is obvious that, if that is so, injury, and very grave injury, will be done to the petitioners. They will by reason of an act of the
Court have paid a sum which it is now ascertained was ordered to be paid by mistake and wrongfully. They will recover that sum after the lapse of a considerable time, but they will recover it without the ordinary fruits which are derived from the enjoyment of money. On the other hand those fruits will have been enjoyed, or may have been enjoyed, by the person who by mistake and by wrong obtained possession of the money under a judgment which has been reversed. So far therefore as principle is concerned, their Lordships have no doubt or hesitation in saying that injustice will be done to the petitioners, and that the perfect judicial determination which it must be the object of all courts to arrive at, will not have been arrived at unless the persons who have had their money improperly taken from them have the money restored to them, with interest, during the time that the money has been withheld".

Accordingly Mr Haig must be ordered to refund the overpayment with interest from 7 August 1989 until judgment.

The Minister submitted that interest should be calculated at the rates payable from time to time specified in SCR Schedule J. This was the course adopted in
Production Spray Painting Pty Limited versus Newnham (No 2) (above) at 663.
However the [Public Works
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pwa1912159/) contains in <case> A its own provisions for the payment of interest on compensation. The evidence discloses that the rate for amounts over $50,000 notified by the
Treasurer pursuant to <case> A (5) in force between 12 January 1986 and 7
August 1989 was 12.5%. There is no evidence as to the statutory rates since, although the Court has reason to believe that they have been changed a number of times.

Mr Haig received interest on the compensation originally awarded at the rate of 4% until 11 January 1986 and at the rate of 12.5% thereafter. Justice and consistency requires this Court to apply the statutory rate or rates for the time being in force in awarding interest on overpaid compensation ordered to be refunded.

Since this application only became necessary because the Minister failed to ask for complete relief on adequate notice at the hearing of the second appeal he should be ordered to pay the costs of this motion. See Production Spray
Painting Pty Limited versus Newnham (No 2) (above) at 663.

In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
Order that Bryan Haig pay the Minister the sum of $250,403.33, together with interest thereon, from 7 August 1989 to date of judgment at the rates from time to time notified by the Treasurer under <case> (5) of the [Public
Works Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pwa1912159/); 
The parties to bring in short minutes before Handley JA on 29 May 1996 at 9.30 a.m. containing a calculation of such interest to that date and providing for the entry of judgment that day for the above amount, together with such interest.

The Minister to pay the costs of Mr Bryan Haig of this motion.

All costs in this Court to be set off.
