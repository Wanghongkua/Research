JUDGMENT
The Plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of an unexplained wealth order under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act. The summons is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 18 January 2017. She is an authorised officer of the Plaintiff.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act requires the Court to make an order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer setting out the matters contained in that subsection and stating the grounds on which the suspicion referred to therein is based, and the Court considers there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.
Ms Bourne deposes to a suspicion and belief that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity, being the offence of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193c.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) involving money laundering. That offence is a serious criminal offence as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne principally bases her suspicion on a reading of the facts sheet prepared by the NSW police after the arrest of the Defendant and a co-accused. Ms Bourne sent an email to the officer she believed who prepared the facts sheet asking him if he had done so, if the contents of the facts sheet were true to the best of his knowledge and belief, and if the facts sheet was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. She received affirmative answers to those questions.
I have read the facts sheet and I am satisfied that the suspicion held by Ms Bourne that the offence has been committed is reasonably held.
The Plaintiff asks that orders be made without prior notice to the Defendant. That is based on paragraph 7 of Ms Bourne's affidavit. Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that she is aware that in the absence of a restraining order it is possible for people to enter into an unregistered mortgage in relation to real estate very quickly, to dispose of funds held in bank accounts very quickly and dispose of motor vehicles or backdate forms notifying the RMS of the disposal of the motor vehicle.
I am satisfied that it is appropriate that orders should be made without prior notice to the Defendant. The Defendant has his rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to review these orders.
