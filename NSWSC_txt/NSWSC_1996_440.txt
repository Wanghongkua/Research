REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
THE COURT: The plaintiff Mr Anthony Michael Powick has, by summons, sought a declaration and relief in the nature of certiorari in respect of orders made on 9 March 1995. On 30 October 1995 his Honour Mr Justice Newman dismissed Mr Powick's application. He has appealed to this Court against his Honour's judgment. 
The application arises from the provisions of the [Periodic Detention of
Prisoners Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/). The basis of the application is as follows. On 22 August 1994 Mr Powick was convicted of two counts of larceny of a motor vehicle and one count of simple larceny. It would appear that in respect of each of the two counts of larceny of a motor vehicle he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment and in respect of the count of larceny to six months imprisonment and that all of the sentences were to be served concurrently. However, the Court imposing the sentences ordered that they were to be served by way of periodic detention pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s5.html) of the Act.

It is not in question but that Mr Powick failed to comply with the terms of the orders for periodic detention.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) of the Act provides that if an order for periodic detention is in force in respect of a person, the relevant court may cancel the order in the circumstances there referred to. It is not in question but that, by reason of his non-compliance with the terms of the order, the order for periodic detention in respect of each of the offences could be cancelled under that section. The Commissioner for Corrective Services made application for the cancellation of the orders accordingly. A copy of the application dated 27
January 1995 was before the learned judge.

It is not in question but that at the relevant time Regulation 52 made under the Act provided for service. That regulation provided: "52(1). Where, pursuant to [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) of the Act, a court proposes to consider the question of whether an order for periodic detention in respect of a person should be cancelled (whether on application by the person or the Commission or on its own motion), the clerk of the court shall cause written notice of the proposed hearing of that question to be given by post to the person and to the Commission.
 . A notice under this clause shall be treated as having been given to a person by post if it is posted addressed to the person at the last address for the person known to the clerk of the court." 
Notices were served on Mr Powick in accordance with Reg 52. It has not been submitted that service was defective.

The application for cancellation of the periodic detention orders was listed to be heard on 9 March 1995. Mr Powick did not attend. Evidence was presented to the magistrate to establish the grounds upon which the periodic detention orders could be cancelled. Orders for cancellation were made accordingly.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the Act provides that where an order for periodic detention is cancelled under, inter alia, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) the order for periodic detention shall cease to have any force or effect and: "27(c) any unexpired portion of the sentence of imprisonment to which the order applied shall be deemed to be a separate term of imprisonment imposed at the time of the cancellation, which term of imprisonment shall commence ... " 
The commencement and term of the sentence is not here in question.
 [Section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) provides: "27(4) If an order for periodic detention is cancelled under this Part, the court, in its discretion, may: direct that any unexpired portion of the sentence to which the order relates is to be taken to consist of a minimum term and an addition term set under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/index.html#p2) of the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/); and ...

Any such minimum and additional term and parole order have the same effect as if they had been respectively set and made under the [Sentencing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/)." 
The transcript of the proceeding before the magistrate, copy of which is before the Court, indicates that the attention of the magistrate was drawn to the provisions of [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html)
The magistrate declined to fix a minimum and a maximum term within the subsection.

Warrants were issued for the apprehension of Mr Powick and he was subsequently taken in custody to serve the relevant sentences.

Before this Court reference was made to the fact that three sentences were imposed upon Mr Powick upon his convictions in 1994 and that (as it was suggested) applications were made for cancellation of the periodic detention orders only in respect of two of such sentences. As far as the basis of the application to the Supreme Court is concerned nothing now appears to turn upon any such matter and insofar as concerns what was then done, it has not been argued that a basis for present relief is to be found in it.

We come now to consider the bases upon which Mr Ramage QC, for the applicant
Mr Powick, has sought the relief in question. He has placed the applicant's claim upon two bases. The first relates to the notice given to Mr Powick of the application for cancellation of the periodic detention orders. In his detailed written submissions, Mr Ramage QC submitted that the notice was defective because it did not draw to the applicant's attention the existence of an opportunity to have an order made under [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) fixing a minimum and a maximum period to be served. It was submitted that the notices were inadequate and defective in that they made no mention of the obligation of the Court, on an application for cancellation, to cancel the periodic detention orders for the reasons set forth in [s (3A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s25.html) and otherwise the mandatory effects of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s25.html); that the notices did not refer to the consequences which would flow from the cancellation of the sentences; and that they made no mention of the discretion in [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) 
The material placed before the Court in relation to the present application includes, inter alia, the three notices served upon the applicant Mr Powick under [s (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s21.html) drawing his attention to some of the consequences of non-compliance with the periodic detention orders. The material includes also a "Notice to Detainees" apparently served upon Mr Powick at or about the time of his conviction and sentence. That notice drew to his attention that if he was absent without leave from periodic detention consequences would follow or be apt to follow.
The notice indicated, inter alia, the following: "PLEASE NOTE: ...

On the third AWOL you will be taken to Court and the Court will cancel your periodic detention order and sentence you to full time gaol." 
The notice does not refer to [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) 
The principles of procedural fairness apply in the present case. Mr Ramage cited, inter alia, Kioa versus West <case>; [(1985) 159 CLR 550]; J versus Lieschke <case>; <case>; [(1990) 170 CLR 596] and to the decision of this Court in New South Wales Meat
Authority versus Randall (Court of Appeal, 20 April 1994, unreported). These principles, in their application, envisage that where a proceeding is brought against a person which may result in orders to his detriment, notice of the proceeding must be given. In certain circumstances, procedural fairness has been held to require that notice be given not merely of the fact of the proceeding but also of some of the detriments which may result to the person against whom the proceeding has been brought. Parker versus Director of Public
Prosecutions [(1992) 28 NSWLR 282] and Roos v Director of Public Prosecutions [(1994) 34 NSWLR 254] illustrate this application of the principle of procedural fairness. But the principle does not require that in all cases the notice spell out all of the detriments which may result from the proceeding; it does not require that the rights which the parties may have upon that application be drawn to their attention. As Newman J indicated in his judgment, what the principle requires depends upon the circumstances of the case: see Kioa versus West <case>; [(1985) 159 CLR 550] at 615, per Brennan J. In the opinion of the Court it was not necessary that the notice of the application indicate to Mr Powick the effect of the cancellation of the periodic detention orders or the consequences apt to flow from them, either generally or by reason of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html)
As has been indicated, the effect of the cancellation of a periodic detention order is that, in accordance with [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) the unexpired portion of the sentence is deemed to be a separate term of imprisonment imposed at the time of the cancellation. The consequence of the cancellation is accordingly to that extent prescribed by the statute. The statute and the regulations did not provide for the form of notice to be given to Mr Powick but he was or at least is to be taken to have been aware that the cancellation of the relevant orders would mean that his period of imprisonment was to take effect by imprisonment and not by way of periodic detention. The fact that the term of imprisonment was one fixed by [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) was not a matter which the principle of procedural fairness required to be brought to his attention.

Mr Ramage, in his careful argument, relied principally upon the omission to refer Mr Powick to the fact that, on the cancellation application, he could seek to have a minimum and a maximum term fixed pursuant to [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html)
The Court is of the opinion that the principle of procedural fairness does not require that that be specified in the notice of the cancellation proceeding.
It does not require that there be notification of every detriment or possible detriment which may flow and every right or power which may be available upon the hearing of an application. There is a limit to the extent to which matters of this kind must be specified.

The extent of the principle and of its application in the context of an appeal to the District Court, as illustrated in the Parker and the Roos cases was recently considered by this Court in Ho versus Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor [(1995) 37 NSWLR 393] at 398; see also Hughes versus Director of Public Prosecutions (Court of Appeal, 15 March , unreported). As the Court there indicated, the principle of procedural fairness is a principle of substance not of form. To say this is not to deny that a right to apply to have a minimum and maximum term fixed may not, in a particular case, be a right of importance but, as has been indicated, the principle does not require that every aspect of the proceeding and the consequences which may flow from it are to be specified in the initiating document. The Court is of opinion that the principle does not require reference to [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) 
The second matter relied upon by Mr Ramage QC was the refusal of the magistrate to direct that the sentence consist of a minimum and an additional term under [s (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html)
His submission accepted that the magistrate had in this regard a discretion but his submissions suggested, in substance, that, there being no reasons given for the magistrate's exercise of the discretion, it should be inferred that the discretion was exercised by reference to considerations or without reference to considerations within the ambit of the provision. The submission suggested, inter alia, that it was necessary for the magistrate to make further inquiry into the circumstances than, from the information before the
Court, he is to be inferred to have made.

The Court is of opinion that such inferences should not be drawn. Mr Powick did not appear upon the application. He did not suggest anything which would require the exercise of the power under subsection in his favour. The mere fact that the power to fix a minimum and a maximum term existed was not a fact which required the power to be exercised in his favour. The Court does not accept that the discretion miscarried in this regard.

For these reasons the Court was of the opinion that the appeal from Newman J should be dismissed. At the conclusion of the argument the Court indicated that the appeal should be dismissed. The reasons now given are the reasons of the Court for that dismissal.
