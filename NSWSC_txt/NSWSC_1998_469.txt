JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
Introduction 
The plaintiffs, for whom and which Mr A.P. Coleman of Counsel appeared, instituted these proceedings by a Summons issued on 14 May 1997. An Amended
Summons was filed on 8 September 1997, pursuant to leave granted by Hunter J, and, on 14 and 16 October 1997 respectively, the defendants filed a Defence to the Amended Summons and a Notice of Appearance.

Thereafter various orders were made for the further conduct of the proceedings and, on 20 February 1998, Giles CJCommD specially fixed the hearing to commence on 15 April 1998. On 7 April 1998, on the application of the defendants, his Honour vacated that date and, on 17 April 1998, he specially fixed the hearing to commence on 27 July 1998.

On 14 July 1998 the defendants sent a facsimile transmission to the Court to which I requested my Associate to reply in the terms in which she did on 16
July 1998. On 24 July 1998 the defendants caused a further facsimile transmission to be sent to the Court, copies of which I handed to Mr Coleman and their former solicitor, Mr W. Annis-Brown, at the commencement of the hearing on 27 July 1998. I have placed all this correspondence with the papers, where it is to remain. So also is the envelope containing, I assume, documents, which, pursuant to an order made by Giles CJCommD which continues in force, is not to be opened without an order of a Judge of the Court.

Most of the matters to which I have referred in the last paragraph were referred to in short oral reasons I gave prior to commencing the hearing on an ex parte basis on 27 July 1998. The matter proceeded in that way as there was no appearance by or on behalf of the defendants. They were called three times outside the Court shortly after 10 am.

Mr Annis-Brown attended as a matter of courtesy to the Court, but informed me he had no instructions. The plaintiffs wished the matter to proceed, and, as there was no application for an adjournment, the defendants having impliedly indicated in the letter of 24 July 1998 that they would accept the consequences of the matter proceeding if such offer of compromise as they may have made was rejected by the plaintiffs, I could see no reason for not deciding the matter.

The Issues 
The plaintiffs' claim was based upon misleading and/or deceptive conduct in contravention of s.52 of the Trade Practices Act and/or fraudulent conduct by the first and/or second defendants acting either on their own behalf or on behalf of the third defendant whereby, to put it shortly, two amounts of money were paid by or on behalf of the third plaintiff, which is now in liquidation, to the defendants for the acquisition of two pieces of equipment. The allegations were that the first amount, US$190,500, was paid in consequence of oral and written representations, which were made that the equipment was worth
US$391,000 of which the third plaintiff was to pay for one half and the defendants the other half, whereas it was only worth US$70,179. It is not in issue that the third plaintiff received this equipment and, accordingly, the loss is the difference between the amount paid and the value of the equipment, namely US$120,321.50 which, converted to Australian Dollars is $194,005.58.

The second claim was for Sng$200,000, which was paid on behalf of the third plaintiff to the defendants for goods to be acquired by the third plaintiff but which it never received.

The basis for the first claim was that the first and second defendants represented to the first plaintiff in about August 1993, that the cost of the first equipment would be the amount to which I have referred. Thereafter the amount was paid and, in July 1994, the first plaintiff was shown a copy of a commercial invoice verifying this price. The evidence satisfies me that the invoice was a fraud and that the representation as to the price constituted misleading and deceptive conduct in trade and commerce and was fraudulent.
There is no doubt that the representations were made initially to the first plaintiff in Australia, although she was shown the commercial invoice in
Singapore. The defendants have pleaded that the claim under s.52 of the Trade
Practices Act is statute barred and, also, that in relation to the representation in respect of the second quantity of equipment it was made outside Australia. In each of these circumstances it is pleaded that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.

The Defence also denied the making of the representations, but no evidence was put before me to support the denial.

The plaintiffs also structured a case on the basis that the first and second defendants, who were, at all material times, directors of the third plaintiff, acted in breach of their duties to it by obtaining the payment to which I have referred. The uncontradicted evidence leaves me in no doubt that the first and second defendants acted fraudulently and in the clearest breach of their fiduciary duties to the third plaintiff. I think it is better, in the circumstances of this case, to proceed on those bases. The evidence also satisfies me that the liquidator of the third plaintiff transferred all of its assets to the second plaintiff, including all choses of action it might have.

In these circumstances I am satisfied that the second plaintiff is entitled to recover against the first and second defendants the amount of $194,005.58 together with interest thereon at the rates provided by the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) from 23
July 1994, which is $86,765.66, i.e. $280,771.24.

The second claim concerns the payment of Sng$200,000, which converts to
A$186,600.00. This amount was paid on the basis of a representation that it would be used to purchase further equipment for the third plaintiff. The evidence satisfies me that it was never used for this purpose. Once again the claim is based on a breach of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s52.html), fraudulent conduct and/or, in the alternative, a breach by the first and second defendants of their fiduciary duties to the third plaintiff. The defence is raised, in relation to this claim, that the representation was made in Singapore and, accordingly, that [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s52.html) has no application. I do not think that this defence has been made out, because I am satisfied that the representations were made in late 1994 and thus, well within the limitation period provided by the Trade Practices Act, and that they were made in Australia. However, even if this be wrong, the defendants were, in my opinion, guilty of fraud and conduct which constituted a breach of their fiduciary duty to the third plaintiff and, the second plaintiff, through the assignment of the chose in action to it, is entitled to recover the amount of $186,600 together with interest thereon in the sum of $66,490, i.e. $253,090.

Conclusions 
In the result I am satisfied that the second plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the first and second defendants in the sum of $533,861.24 for which I propose to order judgment. I have considered the position of the third defendant. Because of the close relationship between it and the first and second defendants I am not satisfied that judgment should not be entered against it. This is justified by the way in which the case was pleaded and presented and it offered no separate defence.

Orders 
I order:- 
Judgment for the second plaintiff against the defendants for $533,861.24.

The defendants pay the second plaintiff's costs.

The exhibits be returned at the expiration of twenty eight (28) days unless within that time an appeal has been brought.

I will request my Associate to forward a copy of these reasons and of the reasons I gave on 27 July 1998 to the defendants.
