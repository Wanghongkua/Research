Friday 15 August 2008  /06 Westpac Banking Corporation versus Victor Warren Ollis & Ors 
JUDGMENT 
The notice of motion Westpac Banking Corporation pursues an amended notice of motion filed on 15
February 2008.
 
Background On 28 March 2008, this Court made the following orders in these proceedings: "13 The seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth respondents to serve all evidence and submissions upon which they intend to rely by 24 April 2008.
 The plaintiff to serve all evidence and submissions in reply by May 2008.
 The plaintiff's application for a judicial sale of the properties situated at: lot 300 - 302 Docos Street, Parkes having title reference Auto Consol -167; Condoblin Road, Parkes having title reference 2/811666; Cathedral Close, Parkes having title reference 6/1085775; and Woodward Street, Parkes, having title reference 3/547904, be fixed for hearing by application to the List Judge on 11 April 2008".
 After the hearing, the Bank's solicitors were contacted by the solicitors for the fourteenth respondent (Lee-Lin Weissel) and the parties agreed that order 13 would be treated as embracing the fourteenth respondent, and that there would be a 15(e) being "the property situated at 1-7 Koala Street,
Parkes having title reference 7/1078492".
 The dispute regarding the property at 2 Condoblin Road, Parkes has been resolved with the consent of the parties asserting an interest in that property: the fifteenth respondent (Michael John Ross), sixteenth respondent (Jennifer Anne Ross) and the seventeenth respondent (Secure Funding Pty Ltd).
 The dispute regarding the property at 1-7 Koala Street, Parkes has also been resolved by agreement and hence the annexed orders also have the consent of the fourteenth respondent (Lee-Lin Weissel).
 The following properties remain disputed: a) lot 300 - 302 Docos Street, Parkes having title reference Auto Consol -167 ("Docos Street"); b) 10 Cathedral Close, Parkes having title reference 6/1085775 ("Cathedral Close"); and c) 77 Woodward Street, Parkes, having title reference 3/547904 ("Woodward Street").
 The tenth respondent, Green Parkes Estate Pty Ltd ("Green Parkes") asserts an interest in all three properties.
 Submissions and evidence have been served by solicitors for the seventh respondent (Peter William Flynn), eighth respondent (Richard Maurice Hawkins), ninth respondent (Kathryn Hawkins) and eleventh respondent (Docos Estate
Parkes Pty Ltd ("Docos Estate")). These respondents assert an interest in the
Docos Street property by Docos Estate.
 The Bank relies upon the findings made in the reasons for judgment given on August 2007 and a number of affidavits.
 In summary, the Bank submits that neither Docos Estate nor Green Parkes have any interest in land with respect to the properties in which they assert an interest, and in the alternative, even if they do establish such an interest, then the interest of the Bank is entitled to priority.
 Affidavits were also read by the seventh, eighth, ninth and eleventh respondents and also by Green Parks.
 
Dealing with the respective properties seriatim 
The Woodward Street Property The title reference for this property is 3/547904 and the registered proprietor is Ms Shields.
 The evidence indicates that the property is a vacant block with an estimated value of approximately $200,000.
 On 6 September 2007, the Court ordered that this property was subject to a charge in favour of the Bank in the sum of $5,585,245.57.
 
The chronology is as follows: Oct 03 
Transferred to Ollis  Feb 04 
Alleged parol agreement between Ollis and Green Parkes to reduce purchase price of property  Feb 04 
Contract for sale of "Hillview Estate" forming part of property between
Shields and Green Parkes Estate with Green Parkes paying a deposit of $7,500  May 04 
Ollis gives unregistered mortgage to Green Parkes & IGRX3  Apr 05 
Green Parkes registers caveat AB415457  May 05 
Green Parkes and IGRX3 register mortgage AB466465  Oct 05 
Green Parkes and IGRX3 register discharge of mortgage & Ollis transfers property to Shields. Shields transfers $290,000 stolen money to Green Parkes
Estate and IGRX3  Apr 06 
Subdivision application refused  May 06 
Green Parkes registers caveat AC289663  
Asserted interest The caveat asserts that Green Parkes has an interest in the entire estate which it "purchased" under contract dated 20 February 2004. Mr Brown appears to assert that Green Parkes is entitled to a decree of specific performance if it tenders the remaining purchase price of $46,840.
 
Decision Green Parkes has not satisfied its onus of proving that it has an interest in land.
 Putting for the moment the question of a purchaser's lien to one side,
Green Parkes only has an interest in land to the extent that it is entitled to specific performance: Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd versus Cauchi  <case>; <case> per
Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne & Heydon JJ; Black versus Garnock <case>; <case> per
Gummow & Hayne JJ.
 In this case, the alleged contract presented as evidence has not been stamped and is therefore both inadmissible and a nullity in law: [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s304.html) of the [Duties Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/) .
Furthermore, the document alleged to be the contract has not had the vendor's signature witnessed.
 Even if the alleged contract was admissible and effective, completion was conditional upon the subdivision application being registered substantially in accordance with the sketch plan annexed to the document: Special Condition 3.
The subdivision application with respect to this property was refused on or about 16 April 2006. That being so, the contract would in any event no longer be specifically performable: Fitzgerald versus Masters <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 420] at 433 per Dixon CJ & Fullagar J; Brown versus Heffer <case>; [(1967) 116 CLR 344] at 351 per
Windeyer J.
 There is a further reason why Green Parkes has failed to establish that it would be entitled to specific performance. To do so it must show that it is ready, willing and able to substantially perform its obligations under the contract, most critically being ready, willing and able to pay the outstanding purchase moneys in full: see Mehmet versus Benson <case>; [(1965) 113 CLR 295] at 307 - 308 per Barwick CJ (McTiernan J agreeing) and 314 per Windeyer J; Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd versus Cauchi ( <case>; <case> per
Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne & Heydon JJ.
 Green Parkes has not adduced such evidence. It has sought to place reliance upon vague evidence of an alleged parol agreement with Mr Ollis such that it is entitled to pay less than the stipulated purchase price. Such an agreement, however, even if established by admissible evidence on the balance of probabilities, is not enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by Mr
Ollis: [section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/da199793/s54a.html) [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) .
The prohibition in that section applies equally to parol variations of existing contracts as it does to the creation of an entirely new agreement:
Phillips versus Ellinson Brothers Pty Ltd <case>; [(1941) 65 CLR 221] at 234 per Starke J and 243 - 244 per Williams J; Tallerman & Co Pty Ltd versus Nathan's Merchandise (Victoria) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1957) 98 CLR 93] at 112 - 113 per Dixon CJ & Fullagar J and 122 per
Williams J.
 It is in any event unclear how a written contract made on 20 February 2004 can be varied by a parol agreement made more than two weeks earlier on 2
February 2004.
 That leaves the question of whether Green Parkes is entitled to a purchaser's lien. To prove such an interest, however, Green Parkes must adduce evidence that the moneys paid over were paid to Mr Ollis directly (and not to an agent or to his stakeholder), that they were paid pursuant to a contract of sale and that it is entitled to the return of the deposit under the contract: see Rose versus Watson <case>; [(1864) 10 HL Cas 672]; Combe versus Lord Swaythling [[1947] Ch 625]; Hewett versus Court <case>; [(1983) 149 CLR 639.] Green
Parkes has simply failed to discharge its onus on all three of these matters.
 There being no interest in land, the issue of priorities does not arise.
 
The Cathedral Close Property The title reference for this property is 6/1085775 and the registered proprietor is Ms Shields.
 The evidence indicates that the property is a vacant block with an estimated value of approximately $50,000.
 On 6 September 2007, his Honour ordered that this property was subject to a charge in favour of the Bank in the sum of $12,718,362.64.

Ollis pays $157,000 stolen money to Peter Flynn  Dec 05 
Ollis transfers lots 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 & 14 of DP 1085775 to Shields  
Asserted interest Green Parkes has not lodged a caveat in respect of this alleged interest.
 Mr Brown appears to assert that Green Parkes is entitled to a decree of specific performance if it tenders the remaining purchase price of $32,800.
 
Decision  Green Parkes has not satisfied its onus of proving that it has an interest in land.
 As with the Woodward Street property, the alleged contract presented as evidence has not been stamped and has not had the vendor's signature witnessed.
 As with the Woodward Street property, Green Parkes has also not adduced evidence that it is ready, willing and able to pay the stipulated purchase price by relying upon an alleged parol variation which: i. even if established is unenforceable by reason of [section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/); and ii. in any event, was made on 2 February 2004, almost five months before the contract of sale was allegedly exchanged.
 Additionally, in relation to the Cathedral Close property, Green Parkes has not adduced sufficient evidence to prove that that property was the property the subject of its alleged contract: that contract concerns the sale of Lot 6 in the unregistered plan for the subdivision of Lot 1 of DP 518440. It is simply impossible to determine from the evidence whether that lot is what subsequently became Lot 6 in deposited plan 1085775, itself a subdivision of
Lot 14 in deposited plan 1078492. An equity regarding the purchase of a prospective lot in a subdivision only becomes a proprietary interest when it attaches to an identifiable lot, and Green Parkes has failed to prove that this has occurred: see Harrison versus Lidoform Pty Ltd [unreported, Federal
Court of Australia, 24 November 1998, Hely J]; Forder and Others versus Cemcorp
Pty Ltd <case>; <case> per
Barrett J; Sama Zaraah Pty Ltd versus 888 Projects Pty Ltd [[2007] NSWSC ] at [[4]](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%20NSWSC%201041#para4) - [5] per Gzell J.
 That therefore leaves the question of whether Green Parkes is entitled to a purchaser's lien. As with the Woodward Street property, however, Green Park has failed to discharge its onus on the question of who has the deposit, whether it was paid under a valid contract and whether it would be legally entitled under that contract to a return of the deposit.
 Furthermore, having failed to caveat its alleged interest, if the question of priorities arises, Green Parkes' claim would be defeated by laches as the interests of third parties have intervened: see Fitzgerald versus Masters <case>; [(1956) 95 CLR 420] at 433 per Dixon CJ & Fullagar J and Lamshed versus Lamshed <case>; [(1963) 109 CLR 440] at 453 & 455 per Kitto J (Windeyer J agreeing).
 That being so, here again the issue of priorities does not arise.
 
The Docos Street Property The registered proprietor is the first defendant, Victor Warren Ollis.
 The Bank's evidence indicates that it is a vacant development site with an estimated value of approximately $350,000.
 On 6 September 2007, the Court ordered that this property was subject to a charge in favour of the Bank in the sum of $12,718,362.64.

Jennifer & John Vallance register caveat AD763396K  
Docos Estate Parkes Pty Ltd A caveat lodged on behalf of Docos Estate states the interest as the "Whole of the estate" pursuant to a contract for sale dated 16 December 2005 "as bona fide purchaser for value without notice".
 Docos Estate appears to be a development vehicle for investors, including a number of the caveators.
 Docos Estate's submission is that the contract for sale and settlement mean that it had a dealing registrable, obtained from the registered proprietor for value and "on a bona fide basis", and hence could rely upon [section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s43a.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) such that it had "protection against notice by elevating [its] interest to one deemed to be a legal estate". It relies upon IAC (Finance) Pty Ltd v
Courtenay <case>; [(1963) 110 CLR 550] at 571 - 574, Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd versus McLaurin &
Tait (Developments) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1976) 133 CLR 671], Diemasters Pty Ltd versus Meadowcorp Pty Ltd <case>; <case>; [(2007) 230 CLR 438.] This submission is considered below. In essence, [section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s43a.html) does not assist Docos Estate and hence the matter is to be resolved in the
Bank's favour by the application of the rules relating to equitable priorities, the Bank's interest being first in time and there being no disentitling conduct.
 
Priority Docos Estate asserts that its interest under the contract has priority over the Bank's charge by reason of [section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s43a.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/).
 That section provides: "For the purpose only of protection against notice, the estate or interest in land under the provisions of this Act, taken by a person under a dealing registrable, or which when appropriately signed by or on behalf of that person would be registrable under this Act shall, before registration of that dealing, be deemed to be a legal estate".
 In Black versus Garnock <case>; <case>; citing
Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd versus McLaurin & Tait (Developments) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1976) 133 CLR 671] at 676 per
Barwick CJ, Mason & Jacobs JJ], Gummow & Hayne JJ held that upon the settled construction given this section by the authorities, it "confers upon a purchaser who has received a registrable instrument and paid the purchase money the same protection against notice of an earlier unregistered interest as that achieved by a purchaser who acquires the legal estate at common law".
 This section does not assist Docos Estate, because: i. it was not, at the time of settlement, a purchaser for value without notice of the Bank's interest; ii. the transfer was not a "dealing registrable" because it was not stamped until 27 January 2006 and at that time the property was bound by the
Restraining Order; and iii. even if the transfer was a "dealing registrable" at the time it was provided to Docos Estate, it ceased to be so at the time it was lodged for registration.
 If section 43A does not apply, then the issue of priority is determined by the rules of equity, and the Bank submits there is nothing in the present case which would displace the rule qui prior est tempore potior est iure.
 
Purchaser for value without notice Section 43A only applies where the registrable dealing is taken by the purchaser for value and without notice: Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd versus McLaurin & Tait (Developments) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1976) 133 CLR 671] per Barwick CJ, Mason & Jacobs JJ. The protection it extends prior to registration is therefore not the equivalent of the immediate indefeasibility provided upon registration by section 42, but it permits the purchaser to rely upon the common law doctrine of purchaser for value without notice which doctrine otherwise has little role to play with respect to
Torrens land: see Macquarie Bank Ltd versus Sixty-Fourth Throne Pty Ltd [[1998] 3
VR 133] at 151 per Tadgell JA, Winneke P agreeing; and Meagher, Heydon & Leeming,
Meagher, Gummow & Lehane's Equity, Doctrines & Remedies 4th edition, , at [8-295].  Docos Estate has failed to adduce sufficient admissible evidence that it has paid anything to the vendor Mr Ollis such that it could be said to be a purchaser for value. The evidence indicates that the Investors paid Ms Shields (under her trading name "Cashflow Positive Investments") $1.15 million in return for 1.15 million shares in Docos Estate.
 Although there is evidence showing payments by certain of the investors to
Ms Shields, there is no evidence of payments being made: i. by the purchaser, Docos Estate; ii. to the vendor and registered proprietor, Mr Ollis; or iii. in respect of the contract of sale.
 Indeed the evidence of Mr Pilgrim is that the payments were made by the investors to Ms Shields and in consideration for shareholdings in Docos Estate
Parkes Pty Ltd.
 That being the case the only finding available in the evidence is that
Docos Estate was a volunteer  There is no evidence to indicate what subsequently happened to those funds, and in particular no evidence that: i. the $1.15 million was being treated by Ms Shields as held on trust for Docos Estate; and ii. of this sum $400,000 was transferred to Mr Ollis as the purchase price for the sale.
 On the current evidence the Court is simply left to speculate as to the treatment of the $1.15 million.
 Docos Estate having failed to establish it was a purchaser for value, section 43A has no application.
 "Delay" Docos Estate submits that its delay in lodging the transfer for registration did not prejudice the Bank.
 As Docos Estate submissions appears to acknowledge, however, the Bank does not rely upon any defence of laches. The equitable principles to which the
High Court refers to in Fysh versus Page <case>; [(1956) 96 CLR 233] could have no bearing on what is the proper construction of section 43A.
 The Bank's propositions regarding section 43A are threefold: i. the section has no operation because Docos Estate was not a purchaser for value; ii. in the alternative, the transfer was never a "dealing registrable" because by the time it was stamped (27 January 2006), it could not be registered because: a) the Commission's restraining order (19 January 2006) was an absolute bar to registration, and b) the Commission's caveat (20 January 2006) meant that at the time
Docos Estate would otherwise have had a dealing registrable, it had notice of the prior dealing; and iii. in the further alternative, if the Court holds that Docos
Estate had a "dealing registrable" on 20 December 2005 despite the failure to stamp, then the intervention of the restraining order on 19 January 2006 and the caveat the day after deprived Docos Estate of the protection it would otherwise have had pursuant to section 43A.
 The first proposition is accepted as of substance.
 Had it been necessary to deal with the alternative proposition 2 and/or 3, each would itself be of substance.
 The question of "delay" is only germane to the third argument. In that respect, I accept that it is the intervention of the restraining order and caveat between the taking of the transfer and lodgement and not mere delay or prejudice which causes Docos Estate to lose the section's protection against notice. That being so, laches is simply irrelevant.
 
Competing Equities Docos Estate submits that even if section 43A is inapplicable it is entitled to succeed on the question of priorities.
 The finding is that as first in time, it follows that the Bank prevails.
 Docos Estate has not pointed to any disentitling conduct which would reverse the prima facie position. The Court having accepted that there is insufficient evidence to show that it was a purchaser for value, clearly Docos
Estate does not have a true equitable interest, because its interest in the land is commensurate only with payment of the purchase price: see Chief
Commissioner of Stamp Duties versus Paliflex Pty Ltd (1999) 47 NSWLR 382 at [30] - [31] per Austin J.
 Docos Estate submits that the Court did not find how much stolen money was paid to discharge the mortgages attached to the property. Although that is true, it is beside the point. The Court needed only to find the total amount of stolen money into the relevant properties.
 The amount of the Bank's interest is sufficiently established for present purposes by the evidence of John Williams, which evidence was accepted by the
Court in the findings against the defendants. Docos Estate has not adduced any evidence to the contrary.
 Lastly, Docos Estate submits that it is entitled to priority because the interest asserted by the Bank is a "mere equity": Latec Investments Ltd v
Hotel Terrigal Pty Ltd (in liq) <case>; [(1965) 113 CLR 265.] It is apparent that Docos Estate misapprehends the nature of the interests created by the Court's orders on 6 September 2007. The trusts and charges created by the wrongful taking and conversion by the defendants arose as soon as the money was taken or converted without the necessity for an order of the
Court.
 Thus, in Evans versus European Bank Ltd <case>; <case>, the Spigelman CJ (with whom Handley and Santow JJA agreed) stated that at [113] - [115]: "A case of simple theft involves a transfer of property about which the transferor was entirely unaware. The transferee holds any property into which the stolen property has been converted on trust in a manner which should be seen as automatic ... The Australian authorities indicate that a trust arises immediately upon the acquisition of the property, not when recognised by a court ...
 
As Millett J (as his Lordship was) said in a case involving fraudulent misappropriation: 'the trust which is operating in these cases is not some new model remedial constructive trust, but an old-fashioned institutional resulting trust [El Ajou versus Dollar Land Holdings plc [[1993] 3 All ER ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1993%5d%203%20All%20ER%20717 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 734; see also P J Millett, "Tracing the Proceeds of Fraud" [(1991) 107
Law Quarterly Review 71] at 81].
 
If appropriately characterised as 'constructive', the trust that arises upon receipt of stolen funds by an active participant in the theft is of an institutional rather than remedial character".
 That the trust, howsoever described, arises immediately upon the wrongful taking has been repeatedly reaffirmed by single judges of this Court:
Cashflow Finance Pty Ltd (in liq) versus Westpac Banking Corporation <case>; Commonwealth of Australia versus Official Trustee in Bankruptcy <case> at <case> per
Young CJ in Eq; Orix Australia Corporation Ltd versus Moody Kiddell & Partners
Pty Ltd  <case> at <case> per White J; Malouf versus MBF Australia Ltd <case> at <case> per
Einstein J.
 The charge over the Docos Estate property is therefore to be distinguished from the sort of "remedial" charge that was created and declared by the High
Court in Giumelli versus Giumelli <case>; [(1999) 196 CLR 101.] The exact dividing line between a proprietary interest that is a "mere equity" and a full equitable estate in land has not been settled in the authorities: see Mills versus Ruthol Pty Ltd <case> at <case> & <case>; [(1965) 113 CLR 265] attempted to give an authoritative definition of either category of interest: see Double Bay Newspapers Pty Ltd versus AW Holdings Pty
Ltd [(1996) 42 NSWLR 409] at 425 per Bryson J. In that case, Bryson J drew the following conclusion from Latec Investments: "... a mere equity, meaning a claim to have an equitable interest which can only be enforced by succeeding in some claim to a court for equitable relief (such as a claim for rectification, a claim to set aside a conveyance obtained by fraud or (as I think) a claim the enforcement of which depends on the doctrine of part performance) does not participate in competitions of priorities with equitable interests which have been acquired in good faith, for valuable consideration and in a manner which can be clearly shown without obtaining any decision of the court upholding them.
 Latec Investments] shows clearly that an equity which requires the assistance of a court if it is to be established at all does not enter into a competition of priorities with an equitable interest which was obtained for value and without notice of it.
 In Mills versus Ruthol Pty Ltd <case> at <case>,
Palmer J stated that the basic principle in the following way: "...where the holder of a prior equitable interest needs the assistance of the equity court to perfect his or her title to it, that equitable interest will be defeated if, before the title is perfected, a third party takes an equitable interest for value without notice".
 Although his Honour was reversed on appeal, the Court of Appeal assumed (without deciding) the correctness of this statement or principle: Ruthol Pty
Ltd versus Mills <case> at <case> per
Sheller JA (Meagher JA & Cripps AJA agreeing).
 The critical difference, then, is between an "equity" - an in personam right in equity - which requires the intervention of the court to flower into a full equitable estate, and an equitable interest which does not because it already consists of such estate. As the Court of Appeal has unanimously held in Evans versus European Bank Ltd at [113] - [115] (extracted above), it is clear that the charge in the present case falls into the latter category: the charge arose as soon as the stolen funds were wrongfully converted.
 The orders made by this Court on 6 September 2007 merely declared the existence of that charge, in the same manner as the court might declare a purported termination of a contract to be valid or invalid. The Bank therefore had a complete equitable estate - not just "interest" - with respect to the
Docos Street property from 7 October 2005.
 
Conclusion For those reasons it is appropriate to make orders in terms of the Short minutes of Order pursued by the Bank.
