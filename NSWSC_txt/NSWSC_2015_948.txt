JUDGMENT
This is an application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police for restraining orders pursuant to [section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth). The application is supported by an affidavit of Darren James Burtenshaw sworn on 13 July 2015. Mr Burtenshaw deposes to the fact that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of [s 338](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s338.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/).
Mr Burtenshaw swears that he suspects that the property specified in schedules 1 and 2 of the summons is wholly or partly the proceeds and/or the instrument of an indictable and serious offence within the meaning of section 19(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Act. The offence is dealing with money that is reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime and at the time of dealing the value of the money is $A100,000 or more, contrary to section 400.9(1) of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He also suspects that the property is wholly or partly the proceeds and/or instrument of an indictable and serious offence, being the offence of depositing money into bank accounts for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the money involved in the transaction was deposited in a manner and form that would not give rise to a threshold transaction that would have been required to have been reported under [section 43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s43.html) of the [Anti-money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/) (Cth), contrary to [section 142(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s142.html) of that Act.
The offences against section 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code and section 142(1) of the AML Act are both indictable offences and serious offences for the purposes of those Acts.
Mr Burtenshaw sets out the grounds for his suspicion which is based principally on a statement of facts prepared by the criminal case officer responsible for investigating two named persons. It is not necessary to detail the factual basis for Mr Burtenshaw's suspicion. I am satisfied, from a reading of the statement of facts and the other documents annexed to his affidavit, that his suspicion is held on reasonable grounds.
[Section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) requires the making of a restraining order in circumstances where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or an instrument of a serious offence and that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds.
Section 26(4) of the Act requires that the Court must consider the application without notice having been given to any person if the responsible authority, that is the Commissioner of the AFP, requests the Court to do so. The Commissioner has so requested.
For those reasons it is appropriate that I make the orders that are set out in the short minutes of order. I note the usual undertaking as to damages that has been given by the solicitor for the plaintiff.
I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 7 of the short minutes of order. The proceedings are listed for further directions before the Common Law Registrar on 14 October 2015 at 9am. Liberty is given to restore the matter on three days' notice and I direct that the orders be entered forthwith.
