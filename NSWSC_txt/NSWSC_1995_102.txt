JUDGE1
MAHONEY AP BAT Industries PLC ("BAT") owned an aircraft G-BTAB. It was being used or operated by Aravco
Limited ("Aravco"). When Aravco landed the aircraft in Sydney, Qantas Airways Limited ("Qantas") undertook the performance of certain services relating to it. Qantas parked the aircraft on the tarmac.
While it was parked there, Qantas negligently moved another aircraft so that it collided with that aircraft and damaged it.
BAT sued Qantas for damages. Qantas conceded negligence and liability to
BAT. That claim is not in issue.
Qantas, by a cross-claim, claims that Aravco is liable to indemnify Qantas for what it must pay to BAT. It is that cross-claim which is the subject of the present appeal.
The indemnity is said to arise from the contract made between Qantas and
Aravco when Qantas agreed to service the aircraft. Two questions have arisen for decision: whether what occurred fell within the terms of that agreement and accordingly brought the indemnity into operation; and (if it did) whether recovery on the indemnity is prevented by the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) and in particular by [ss 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) and [74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) of that Act.
Sheller and Powell JJA are of the opinion that the indemnity came into operation according to its terms but that recovery upon it was prevented by the [Trade Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/). I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of
Sheller JA, with which Powell JA has agreed. I agree with his Honour that the terms of the contract were satisfied so as prima facie to bring into operation the terms of the indemnity. What his Honour has said enables me to go directly to the matter upon which I feel doubt namely, the effect of the [Trade
Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/). In view of the fact that my brethren are of the opinion that the Act operates to negative the effect of the indemnity, I shall state shortly the conclusions which I have formed.
It is accepted that, in the present case, there was in the contract between Aravco and Qantas "an implied warranty that the services will be rendered with due care and skill ....". I am of opinion that they were not: the concession that qua BAT Qantas was negligent in moving the other aircraft, if it is not a concession of negligence qua Aravco, has in argument been assumed to involve a breach of that implied contractual warranty.
It might perhaps have been argued that in the circumstances, the parties to the implied warranty reasonably had in contemplation that if the warranty was breached, the conduct constituting the breach might give rise to a claim by a third party against Qantas such as would bring into operation the indemnity; the parties might have been seen to contemplate that the damages apt to flow from the breach of the warranty would include such amounts as
Aravco would have to pay by reason of the indemnity granted by it to Qantas.
That indemnity was, of course, part of the contract of which the implied warranty was part: see Wallis versus Downard-Pickford (North Queensland) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 388] at 396, 398. But the cross-claim was not placed or defended upon such a basis and it is not necessary to form a concluded view upon that matter.
The issue argued has been whether [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) renders void the provision of the contract between Qantas, and Aravco which, according to its terms, requires
Aravco to indemnify
Qantas for what it must pay to BAT. This requires consideration of the manner in which [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) operates and the effect of its operation. Relevantly [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) provides that any term of a contract "that purports to exclude, restrict or modify or has the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying ... (c) any liability of the corporation for breach of a ...
warranty implied by such a provision ... is void". (It is accepted that the warranty arising under [s 74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) is a warranty within this provision).
It is clear that the express provision in the contract between Aravco and
Qantas on which
Qantas relies does, as to part, fall within [s 68.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) That clause (I have quoted from the form of it on the front page of the Aircraft Handling
Advice Note) provides for, inter alia, two things: a release and an indemnity.
It provides that Aravco shall release Qantas from all liabilities, claims, damages, losses and expenses which may accrue against Qantas by reason of damage to property. The implied warranty that the services would be rendered with due care and skill would be broken by damage to property and accordingly
Aravco could, in the appropriate case, sue Qantas for damage to the aircraft arising from breach of that warranty. The clause on which Qantas relies provides that Aravco is to release
Qantas from that liability. Accordingly, the agreement to release is inconsistent with the existence of liability in
Qantas for breach of that warranty within [s 68(1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html)
The result of that inconsistency is that, at least to that extent that provision is "void". In other words, in some circumstances the clause would operate in a way inconsistent with the warranty implied by [s 74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) and, at least to that effect, would be void.
It has not been contended that if and to the extent that that clause is avoided in this way, the whole of the clause is avoided. If it is, that is of course the end of the matter. The argument has assumed that as far as relates to the operation of the clause to grant an indemnity, it is severable or otherwise not so avoided. It is therefore not necessary for me to pursue this aspect of the matter to a final conclusion. I shall assume that, insofar as it grants an indemnity, the clause is not so avoided.
It is therefore necessary to determine whether the indemnity, considered above according to its terms, falls within the portion of [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) relied upon, namely, [s 68(1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) Considered according to its literal terms, the clause provides that Aravco shall indemnity Qantas against the liability of Qantas to a third party. Prima facie (and subject to what I say) this does not exclude, restrict or modify the effect of the implied warranty: it does not provide that the warranty, if breached, shall not give rise to liability nor (more relevantly) does it provide that any of the damages for which Qantas would otherwise be liable to Aravco for breach of the warranty shall not be recoverable from it.
The indemnity, in the relevant sense, provides that
Aravco shall pay to Qantas moneys which Qantas is to pay to a third party, irrespective of whether those moneys are moneys which Aravco could recover as part of its damages for breach of the warranty.
Therefore the issue becomes whether [s 74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) avoids a term of a contract which does not affect the legal liability of a corporation arising from the breach of a warranty but merely, indirectly or collaterally, reduces the amount which may be recovered as damages for breach of the warranty.
In the present case, the problem is complicated by the facts. That which caused Qantas to be liable to the third party BAT was not an act which had nothing to do with Qantas's obligation in warranty to Aravco. It was an act of negligence "connected with the performance by Qantas of' the contracted services. The acts which constituted the negligence (the way in which the aircraft was moved) were acts which, if Aravco had sued Qantas for breach of the contractual warranty, would have proved and given rise to its liability in contract to Aravco. it is possible that were the facts sufficient to support the claim, the direct practical (though not legal) effect of
Aravco having to pay Qantas as on the indemnity would be to reduce the damages recoverable for breach of the implied warranty.
But that case has not arisen. The court does not know whether, if Qantas were sued by Aravco for breach of warranty, Aravco would be able to recover in contract beyond nominal damages. That would be affected by its relationship with BAT, the rights (if any) which Aravco had in respect of the aircraft and whether it could prove special damages. Accordingly, it does not appear whether
Aravco could recover other than nominal damages for breach of the warranty and therefore whether the fact that Aravco has to pay on the indemnity operates in any practical or real way to reduce the damages which it could recover for breach of the warranty. If it does not so operate, then it is difficult to see how the indemnity operates in this case to "... restrict or modify" the warranty or have that effect.
Therefore, if [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) is to apply, it must be because - though it does not do so in the instant case - the indemnity has the potential to reduce the practical benefit of the implied warranty by reducing the benefit of the damages recoverable on some kinds of breach of it. I am not satisfied that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) operates upon such a contingency.
For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the effect of the indemnity given to Qantas is in this case such as has "the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying" the relevant liability under the implied warranty.
To the extent that these views lead to the conclusion to which Giles CJ of
CommD came, I would dismiss the appeal as far as it relates to the cross-claim.
JUDGE2
INTRODUCTION SHELLER JA Aravco Limited appeals, pursuant to leave of the
Court, from parts of a decision of Giles J, as his Honour then was, of 13 and October 1994. His Honour gave judgment in the proceedings for the plaintiff, BAT
Industries PLC, against the respondent Qantas Airways Limited, the defendant and cross claimant in the proceedings, for damages to be assessed, and declared that Qantas was entitled to indemnity from the appellant Aravco, the cross defendant in the proceedings, in respect of
Qantas' liability to BAT Industries PLC, the indemnity being in the amount of such damages as might in due course be assessed. 
UNDERLYING FACTS
At about 6 or 6.15 pm on 5 April 1992 the plaintiff's BAE125-800 aircraft arrived at Sydney Kingsford
Smith Airport and was parked in an aircraft parking area at the Qantas Executive Jet Area, part of the respondent's Qantas
Jet Base.
On arrival at the Qantas Executive Jet Area the pilot, Captain
Wilkins, on behalf of Aravco, which was operating the aircraft, signed a
document headed "Aircraft Handling Advice Note". That evening the aircraft was "put to bed" in its parking spot. During 6 April
Qantas carried out necessary servicing while the aircraft remained in its parked position. Nothing remained to be done until 8 April when pre-departure steps would be carried out. On 7
April Qantas' servants, while moving another aircraft, backed it into the plaintiff's aircraft. Qantas accepted that its negligence caused the damage to the plaintiff <case>. At the trial the only issue between the plaintiff and Qantas was the quantum of damages. 
AIRCRAFT HANDLING ADVICE NOTE
On its face the Aircraft Handling Advice
Note was said to be "Subject to the Conditions of Business appearing on the reverse side hereof". In the box "Name of Operator" was
Aravco's name. The aircraft registration and type and the time of arrival and departure were set out. The document continued: "NB THIS 'RELEASE and INDEMNITY' MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY SERVICE
IS RENDERED AND SIGNED BY AN OFFICER OF THE OPERATOR
WHO IT HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED HAS AUTHORITY TO BIND THE OPERATOR CONTRACTUALLY." 
The part of the document that immediately followed was to be completed on arrival of the aircraft and bore the date 5 April 1992 and the signature of
Captain Wilkins. It provided as follows: "In consideration of QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED its servants and agents (hereinafter referred to as QANTAS) performing for ARAVCO (hereinafter referred to as the OPERATOR) the services indicated or to be indicated on the face of this Aircraft
Handling Advice Note the OPERATOR hereby agrees regardless of any negligence on the part of Qantas, its servants or agents to release and indemnify QANTAS from and against all liabilities, claims, damages, losses and expenses which may accrue against or be suffered by QANTAS by reason of injury or damage to person or property arising out of or in any way connected with the performance by QANTAS of the said services unless caused by wilful misconduct on the part of
QANTAS or any of its servants or agents acting within the scope of their employment."
Underneath this on the face of the document was a part to be completed before departure of the aircraft. Amongst other things this provided for an invoice number and date and for the insertion of the "Total Qantas Handling
Charge". Reference was made to "Third Party Charges". There was provision for the aircraft captain to certify the correctness of these entries. Otherwise there was no place on the face of the document for services to be indicated.
On the reverse side of the document were set out the Conditions of
Business. Relevantly these were as follows: "1. Where used in these Conditions 'Qantas' means Qantas Airways
Limited and 'the Operator' means the person, corporation or organisation for whom or for which Qantas performs any services (hereunder referred to as 'technical services') in respect of aircraft or equipment of any kind, whether used in connection with the operations of aircraft or not including the maintenance, repair, inspection and testing of such aircraft or equipment.
These Conditions, except so far as they may be inconsistent with the terms of a special written contract effective between Qantas and the
Operator or except as provided in Condition 3 hereof, are applicable to the performance by Qantas of technical services, irrespective of where the services are performed. These Conditions shall be construed in accordance with the laws in force in the State of New South Wales.
The Operator agrees regardless of any negligence on the part of
Qantas to release, hold harmless and indemnify Qantas from and against all liabilities, claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses of whatever nature, howsoever occurring which may accrue against or be suffered by
Qantas arising out of or in any way connected with the performance of the said services unless caused by wilful misconduct on the part of Qantas or any of its servants or agents acting within the scope of their employment.
Qantas shall on all aircraft and equipment in respect of which it has performed technical services, have a right of lien for all sums due to Qantas by the Operator.
Pursuant to s68A of the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) this clause applies in respect of any of the goods or services supplied under this contract which are not of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, provided that this clause will not apply if the customer establishes that reliance on it would not be fair and reasonable.

Liability for breach of a condition or warranty implied into this contract by the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) other than a condition implied by [s69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s69.html) is limited to - 
In the case of goods, any one of the following as determined by
Qantas: the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods; or the repair of the goods; or the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; 
In the case of services, any one of the following as determined by
Qantas: the supplying of the services again; or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again." 
THE TRIAL JUDGE'S FINDINGS
The issues at the trial were whether, on its proper construction and in the events that happened, a contract embodied in the Aircraft Handling Advice
Note provided an entitlement in Qantas to indemnity from Aravco and, if it did, whether it was in that respect rendered void by the operation of [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) of the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (the Act). Giles J held that, if Qantas was liable to the plaintiff, it was under the document entitled to indemnity from
Aravco and this contractual entitlement was not made void by [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) of the Act. 
APPEAL
Before turning to the arguments on the appeal it is convenient to say more about the circumstances surrounding the execution of the Aircraft Handling
Advice Note. At the time Captain Wilkins was asked to sign the Aircraft
Handling Advice Note there was evidence that he was told what it was and that it indemnified Qantas for the handling of the aircraft while it was in Sydney.
The aircraft was parked in the same position it had occupied on two previous visits to Sydney, the previous week and two years before.
After the aircraft was put to bed Qantas ground staff surrounded it with plastic markers.
When an aircraft arrives subject to the arrangement with which we are here concerned, Qantas Executive Air Services prepares documentation including a handling charge form which refers to various services. On departure a Qantas, aircraft handling charges document is prepared and was in this case.
That sets out charges for various matters including "customer services", "customs clearance" and "aircraft parking" and produces a total Qantas, handling charge. This amount should have been shown in the Aircraft Handling Advice
Note.
So too should total third party charges which were included in the Qantas aircraft handling charges document. 
MEANING OF THE AIRCRAFT HANDLING ADVICE
NOTE
A potent source of debate in this case derives from the expression, in the paramount clause on the face of the document, "the services indicated or to be indicated on the face of this Aircraft Handling Advice Note", when none is indicated, and from the definition, in cl 1 of the Conditions of Business, of "the Operator" as meaning the person, corporation or organisation for whom or for which "Qantas performs any services (hereunder referred to as 'technical services')". The appellant submits that there were no services to which either the paramount clause or cl 4 could apply since none was indicated. It was said that the two clauses had to be read together and referred to the same services.
On its face the note contemplated that part would be filled in on the arrival of the aircraft and part before the departure of the aircraft. The note also contemplated that services might not be indicated at the time of arrival but would later be indicated. Since there is no specific place on the face of the note for services to be indicated, it seems to me the document means that services will be performed subject to its terms and indicated later in the invoice for which there is space provided to show the number and date.
In the context of what Qantas was doing for Aravco this is a reasonable and appropriate way to construe the document as executed. I do not understand why the drafter thought it necessary to say that services
Qantas performed should, in the conditions following condition 1, be referred to as "technical services". Thereafter in cll 2 and the expression "technical services" is used. Elsewhere, notably cll 4 and 7 the word "services" ("the said services", "services supplied under this contract" and "services") is used. "Technical services" is nowhere defined. The word "technical" is imprecise and may mean no more than a service peculiar to aircraft. I would not read the expression so used as excluding any of the services provided by Qantas in the present case.
Another source of difficulty is the expression, in the indemnity from and against liabilities and so on which may accrue against or be suffered by
Qantas, "arising out of or in any way connected with the performance with the said services". Aravco submitted that the liability accrued against or suffered by Qantas to the plaintiff for damage to the aircraft did not arise out of nor was it in any way connected with the performance of services. By way of contrast Aravco said that, if Qantas, in the course of towing the subject aircraft to its parking position, had damaged it, the consequent liability would have arisen out of and been connected with the performance of a service. I have no doubt that when the aircraft was damaged Qantas was providing a service to the operator in taking care of it. That is evidenced by
Qantas' provision of delineators and other means of security. Giles J said that "in any way connected with" was a wide phrase and called for no more than a rational connection, a less proximate relationship than one of causation. To my mind, where a party, which has agreed to provide the service of taking care of goods for the owner, incurs liability to the owner by damaging the goods, the liability is connected with the provision of the service. The service has not been provided or not been properly provided. Instead the service provider has damaged the goods. It is no different that the service of taking care of the goods is not for the owner but for another party, such as an operator. If the service provider incurs liability to the owner by damaging the goods, the liability is connected with the provision of the service for the same reason.
The service has not been provided or not been properly provided. [TRADE PRACTICES ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) [Section 74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1) in [Pt V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p5), Division 2 of the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), so far as presently material, provides: "In every contract for the supply by a corporation in the course of a business of services to a consumer there is an implied warranty that the services will be rendered with due care and skill and that any materials supplied in connexion with those services will be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are supplied."
The appellant accepted that [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1) imposed on Qantas as part of its obligation in the contract to provide services to Aravco an obligation that the services would be rendered with due care and skill. [Section 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html), also in [Pt
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p5), Division 2 of the Act provides: "(1) Any term of a contract (including a term that is not set out in the contract but is incorporated in the contract by another term of the contract) that purports to exclude, restrict or modify or has the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying: the application of all or any of the provisions of this Division; the exercise of a right conferred by such a provision; any liability of the corporation for breach of a condition or warranty implied by such a provision; or the application of section 75A; is void.
A term of a contract shall not be taken to exclude, restrict or modify the application of a provision of this Division or the application of section 75A unless the term does so expressly or is inconsistent with that provision or section."
Section 68A (1) provides that a term of a contract for the supply by a corporation of goods or services other than of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption is not void under [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) by reason only that the term limits the liability of the corporation for a breach, inter alia, of warranty implied by [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html), in the case of services, to the supplying of the goods again or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again. The sub-section does not apply in relation to a term of a contract if the person to whom the services were supplied establishes that it is not fair or reasonable for the corporation to rely on that term of the contract; subs (2). Clause 7 of the Conditions of Business is intended to limit Qantas' liability in this restricted way.
[Section 74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) creates a contractual obligation accompanied by a full contractual remedy. It implies into the contract a term which contains the primary obligation to take due care and skill and a secondary obligation to provide compensation for breach; compare Wallis versus Downard-Pickford (North
Queensland) Pty Limited <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 388] at 396. But those obligations are owed to the party which has the benefit of the warranty, in this case Aravco.
It is difficult to see how [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (1) (a) would operate. [Section 74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1) imposes the obligation. How could a term of a contract exclude, restrict or modify the application of [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1) or have that effect? The drafter may have had in mind that usually a condition necessary to ground the implication of a term is that it must not contradict an express term of a contract; Codelfa Construction Pty
Limited versus State Rail Authority of New South
Wales <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 337] at 347.
As to para (b) Qantas argued that the exercise of the right conferred by the warranty, to insist upon Qantas' compliance with it and to require compensation if there was a breach, was unaffected.
As to [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (1) (c), Qantas argued that to the extent that cl 4 provided indemnity against Qantas' liability to a third party, the plaintiff, it did not exclude, restrict or modify or have the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying any liability of Qantas for breach of the implied warranty.
Qantas' liability to Aravco remained unqualified. However by cl 4 Aravco does more than agree that it will indemnify Qantas from liabilities to third parties. The clause also operates in a way which would undoubtedly modify the implied warranty imposed by [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1). But for [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) any claim by Aravco for breach of the obligation to render the service with due care and skill would be met by a defence of set off or by a cross claim based on cl 4. In consequence cl 4, at least to the extent that it purports so to exclude or modify Qantas' liability or has that effect, "is void". Giles J said that cl 4 could operate in three ways: "..... release of the defendant, indemnity of the defendant against liability to the cross defendant, and indemnity of the defendant against liability to third parties.
By [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (2) the 'term' must be inconsistent with (here) [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1), and there are three possible terms. The form of words and their collection in one clause do not mean that there is only one term. The term that the cross defendant will indemnify the defendant against liability to third parties is not inconsistent with [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1). The cross defendant can still bring proceedings against the defendant for breach of the warranty implied pursuant to [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1), its loss being the amount of any liability to the plaintiff or possibly any liability which it otherwise incurs in relation to the repair of damage to the aircraft.
That can stand with the defendant's entitlement to indemnity from the cross defendant for its, the defendant's, liability to the Plaintiff.
The indemnity does not exclude, restrict or modify, or have the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying, the application of [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1) in relation to the contract embodied in the Note, the exercise of a right conferred by [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1) (assuming that [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (1) (b) refers to rights flowing from the implied warranty, but see Australian Guarantee Corporation
Limited versus Jennings [(1981) 53 FLR 17] at 24-5), or any liability of the defendant for breach of that warranty."
Implied in this reasoning is the premise that [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (1) avoids cl 4 only to the extent that it offends the sub-section and that if to some it extent can operate without offending the sub-section, it is enforceable. A promise which is not wholly void and not illegal can be enforced to the extent to which it is severable and valid.
In Kearney versus Whitehaven Colliery Company [(1893) 1 QB 700] at 713 Lopes LJ said: "The law is clear that where the consideration for a promise or promises contained in the contract is unlawful, the whole agreement is void. The reason is that it is impossible to discriminate between the weight to be given to different parts of a consideration, and therefore you cannot sever the legal from the illegal part. But where there is no illegality in the consideration, and some of the provisions are legal and others illegal, the illegality of those which are bad does not communicate itself to, or contaminate, those which are good, unless they are inseparable from and dependent upon one another."
In McFarlane versus Daniell <case>; [(1938) 38 SR 337] at 345 Jordan CJ said: "When valid promises supported by legal consideration are associated with, but separate in form from invalid promises, the test of whether they are severable is whether they are in substance so connected with the others as to form an indivisible whole which cannot be taken to pieces without altering its nature: Horwood versus Millar's Timber and
Trading
Co Limited [(1917) 1 KB 305] at 315. If the elimination of the invalid promises changes the extent only but not the kind of the contract, the valid promises are severable: Putsman versus Taylor [(1927) 1
KB 637] at 640-1."
At 347 his Honour said: "Where a promise is void but not illegal, somewhat different considerations arise.
A valid promise is none the worse for being associated with a void promise from which is it severable; and although a promise which is wholly void cannot be enforced, a promise partly void but not illegal is capable of being enforced to the extent to which it is severable and valid."
In Humphries versus Proprietors 'Surfers Palms North' Group Titles Plan 1955 <case>; [(1994) 179 CLR 597] at 604-5 Brennan and Toohey JJ quoted from this part of
Jordan CJ's judgment and at 605 said: "In McFarlane versus Daniell, the invalidity of a promise in unreasonable restraint of trade arose because the law would not enforce such a promise against the promisor; but, as the promisor's promise was not illegal, there was no legal inhibition against the enforcement of the promisee's promise to pay the stipulated remuneration."
In Brooks versus Burns Philp Trustee Company Limited <case>; [(1969) 121 CLR 432] at 438
Kitto J said that questions of severability are often difficult and tests that have been formulated as useful in particular classes of cases are not always satisfactory for cases of other kinds.
[Section 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (1) of the [Trade Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) denies to any term of a contract, that purports to do or has the effect of doing the things mentioned, any legal effect. To apply the dictum of Jordan CJ, the question is whether giving full force to [s68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s68.html) (1) there remains any part of cl 4 capable of having legal effect. Giles J thought that there did. Put another way, if by cl 4 the operator agreed, regardless of any negligence on the part of Qantas, to release, hold harmless and indemnify Qantas from and against all liabilities to any party other than the operator, howsoever occurring, which may accrue against or be suffered by Qantas arising out of or in any way connected with the performance of the said services, would the clause have the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying the application of [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1); the exercise of a right conferred by [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) (1); or any liability of Qantas for breach of the warranty implied by [s74](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s74.html) ?
In the present case the implied warranty is that Qantas would render the service of taking care of the aircraft with due care and skill. As it happened the aircraft to which this service was to be rendered was not the operator's but a third party's. Qantas was in breach of the warranty by negligently damaging the very subject matter of it. The intention of the statutory warranty was that Qantas, the supplier, should be liable for that breach to
Aravco, the consumer. If Qantas failed to care for the aircraft with due care and skill it was under an obligation to compensate Aravco for its failure.
However Qantas, upon its breach of the warranty, relied upon cl 4, read down in the way I have suggested, to make Aravco liable to Qantas. Clause 4 applied to require
Aravco to compensate Qantas for Qantas' breach. So understood it seems to me plain that the term has the effect of modifying the liability of
Qantas for breach of the warranty. Accordingly, in my opinion, cl 4 even so read is void, that is to say devoid of legal effect. Accordingly the cross claim should have been dismissed and the appeal should be upheld. 
ORDERS
I propose the following orders: 
Appeal allowed:
Set aside the declaration in order 4; and order 5 insofar as it ordered the cross defendant to pay the cross claimant's costs of the cross claim and in lieu thereof order: 
That the cross claim be dismissed
That the cross claimant pay the cross defendant's costs of the cross claim; . The respondent to pay the appellant's costs of the appeal.
JUDGE3
POWELL JA I agree with Sheller JA.
