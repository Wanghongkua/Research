JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
HIS HONOUR: These proceedings are quite complicated, though at the moment they only seem to involve about $38,000, which is a great tragedy, because the legal costs in actions in the Supreme Court are usually more than that, even for a one-day hearing.
The case has been going since 2010 and there have been 35 notices of motion filed. Now listed before me today, are four motions (proceedings 25, 35, 36 and 37). As we have gone through those, the existence of two motions (proceedings 26 and 32), which seem to have got lost in ancillary hearings, have also become apparent. I will refer to each of these motions by their proceeding number.
I have been able to make orders on motion 35 and dismiss 36, and 37 has become otiose. However, I will formally dismiss it, because costs are saved if we get out of the way motions which are not currently relevant.
The vital motion is motion 26, which is a motion that seems to have been filed on 26 June 2014 for leave to amend further the statement of claim.
It would seem to me that Dr Gibson, and those with the same interest, will need to consider whether further amendments should be made to the present further amended statement of claim in the light of possible settlement between Mr Drumm and Mr McIntosh, and other matters raised in the transcript this morning.
Accordingly, there should be time, say fourteen days, for them to consider whether further to amend the draft. That takes us to 10 April. There should be then time for the opposing parties to make their attitude known about the document, which brings us to 1 May. I will then list it before me at 10 o'clock on 26 May to consider what orders should be made on motion 26.
So far as motion 25 is concerned, there are two aspects. The first is as to whether parts of the existing statement of claim should be struck out. That now has become otiose. There is going to be a new document to replace the existing proceedings, but it may be a matter that should be kept alive in case no leave is given to amend. The second aspect is whether there should be security for costs granted in respect of the third plaintiff in that I have virtually been requested to stand it over. So that motion 25, or what is left of it, should also stand over to my list on 26 May 2015.
Motion 32 is to transfer the whole proceedings to the District Court. It would seem, probably by some mischance, that when that was returnable in October, there was no appearance. It should be struck back in the list and also adjourned to 26 May 2015, because it would seem to me that once the procedural problems are solved, and there is a statement of claim in defence which give rise to issues to trial, a case involving only $38,000 should go to the District Court, but I will make up my mind in relation to that matter on 26 May.
Mr Darams seeks costs of the six motions that I have reviewed today and that can wait until 26 May 2015.
Adjourned to Tuesday 26 May 2015 at 10.00 am.
