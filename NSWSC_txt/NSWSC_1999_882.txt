JUDGMENT-- ex tempore  August 1999 What follows are my reasons for making the orders by way of judicial advice under [s63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) .
 Attached to this judgment is a chronology of the relevant events.
Essentially what has happened is that back in October 1984, a scheme of arrangement contemplated that certain monies be paid to the relevant overseas shareholder beneficiaries of the scheme and indeed that is what so far as possible occurred. However, a number of such beneficiaries have failed to present their cheques and some cannot be located. The amounts individually are small. But in overall terms, out of approximately $300,000 realised for overseas shareholders from sale of their shares, $106,000 only was able to be distributed of their entitlement for the reasons mentioned, leaving approximately $190,000 still in the relevant trust fund held by the two applicants as trustee.
 The trustees of these funds are accountants who wish to be indemnified for their costs and are entitled to be. This is in circumstances where the company is now insolvent. Under the terms of clause 2.7 of the scheme, the company bears the cost of meeting the trustee's costs. The Applicant's submissions note that there is however no provision under clause 2.7 precluding the trustee's right of indemnity at general law from the relevant trust fund. In all the circumstances, including that the trustees forego any profit on their costs, calculated at a 10 per cent margin, and the long passage of time (nearly 15 years) in which the residue of the fund has been left unclaimed, and the fact that about $140,000 will still remain, I am satisfied that the monies standing in the relevant account may be applied as to $48,150.90 to pay all outstanding costs and a further amount be paid for the costs of the present application.
 The detailed submissions are in the file and are initialled by me for identification and I consider they correctly state the position to the extent necessary to underpin the basis of the orders I have made.
