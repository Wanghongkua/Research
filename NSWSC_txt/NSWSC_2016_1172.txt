Catchwords: 
CORPORATIONS - dissolution - striking off of defunct company - reinstatement - where company struck off under [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) - where application previously dismissed on basis that jurisdiction under 1961 Act no longer available following its repeal in 2008 - application to set aside dismissal on ground that right to make application under 1961 Act was accrued right - held, right to apply for favourable exercise of discretion is not an accrued right  
STATUTES - acts of parliament - repeal - preservation of accrued rights - right to apply under [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) for declaration that dissolution of company void - whether accrued right - held, right to apply for favourable exercise of discretion is not an accrued right  
JUDGMENT
In a judgment delivered on 29 June 2016 ("the earlier judgment"), with which this judgment should be read, I ordered that the application of the plaintiff Romesh Amar for a declaration (under <case> of the [Companies Act 1961](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/)) that the dissolution of the company Rocha Pty Ltd is void, and an order (under <case> of that Act) enlarging the time for bringing the application, be dismissed, but - as the application was unopposed and not unmeritorious, and the issues upon which it foundered were not fully exposed in argument - reserved liberty to the plaintiff to apply within one month to set aside that order and for other orders, in case some alternative basis for relief could be formulated.[1] That liberty was exercised on 26 July 2016. Essentially, the plaintiff now contends that when the 1961 Act was repealed on 1 July 2008,[2] the plaintiff had an "accrued right" within the meaning of [Interpretation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s 30(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html), to make an application under <case>, and that the Court retains jurisdiction to make an order under <case>, notwithstanding the repeal of the 1961 Act before the commencement of these proceedings. This contention was thoughtfully, carefully and comprehensively elaborated in the able written submissions of Mr Dooley, dated 4 August 2016.
[Section 30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html) of the [Interpretation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) relevantly provides as follows: Effect of amendment or repeal of Acts and statutory rules 
The amendment or repeal of an Act or statutory rule does not:  revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the amendment or repeal takes effect, or  affect the previous operation of the Act or statutory rule or anything duly suffered, done or commenced under the Act or statutory rule, or  affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the Act or statutory rule, or  affect any penalty incurred in respect of any offence arising under the
Act or statutory rule, or  affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability or penalty,  and any such penalty may be imposed and enforced, and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, as if the Act or statutory rule had not been amended or repealed. 
Without limiting the effect of subsection (1), the amendment or repeal of an Act or statutory rule does not affect:  the proof of any past act or thing, or  any right, privilege, obligation or liability saved by the operation of the Act or statutory rule, or  any amendment or validation made by the Act or statutory rule, or  the operation of any savings or transitional provision contained in the
Act or statutory rule. 
This section applies to the amendment or repeal of an Act or statutory rule in addition to, and without limiting the effect of, any provision of the
Act or statutory rule by which the amendment or repeal is effected.
It is worth observing at this point that <case>(c) preserves any right which is acquired or accrued under a repealed Act before its repeal, and the concluding paragraph of <case> preserves the ability to institute legal proceedings in respect of such an accrued right, after the repeal of the relevant Act. Section 30(1)(c) is concerned with the substantive right, and the concluding paragraph with the proceeding to enforce it.
Section 307 of the 1961 Act provided that where a company has been dissolved, the Court may, within two years after the date of dissolution, on application of the liquidator of the company or of any other person who appears to the Court to be interested, make an order upon such terms as the Court thinks fit declaring the dissolution to have been void, whereupon proceedings may be taken as if the company had not been dissolved. Section 307 thus created a discretion to declare a dissolution void. A person with standing to apply under <case> had no right to an order, but no more than the right to apply for an order; legal rights and status were affected only if the court exercised its discretion in favour of the applicant.[3]
Recognising this, the plaintiff submitted that the (mere) right to apply for an order under <case> in respect of a company that had been dissolved was an acquired or accrued right within [Interpretation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s 30(1)(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html) For that proposition, reliance was placed chiefly on Colley versus Futurebrand FHA Pty Ltd.[4] That case concerned [Industrial Relations Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/), [s 106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html), which gave the Industrial Relations Commission a discretion to make orders in respect of a contract, if it found that the contract was an unfair contract. Handley JA, with whom Giles JA agreed, said: [30] Given that the only right expressly conferred by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) is a right to apply to the Commission for specific relief, a would be applicant, as Meagher JA said [para 12] "has the right to apply for an order, nothing more". Even if the contract is unfair and an experienced practitioner could give some estimate of the likely order, there is, as Meagher JA said [para 12], no "right to a quantifiable order". The claimant had no ascertainable right or entitlement defined by reference to past facts similar to the rights to compensation in Hamilton-Gell versus White [para 22] and Resort
Management [para 20 & foll], the right to the hardship allowance in
Chief Adjudication Officer versus Maguire [para 24 & foll], or the land rights claim in New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council versus Minister [(1988) NSWLR 685.]  [31] The filing of an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) causes a right to accrue because the applicant acquires (Esber [para 13],
Gerrard [para 14]) a legally enforceable right to have the Commission hear and determine the application according to law. This is a new right, different from a mere right to take advantage of the section.  [32] There is no other act or event which can convert the general right to take advantage of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) into an accrued or acquired right. This is not a case where a right or entitlement automatically accrues or is acquired on an event such as an unfair dismissal, the injurious affection of land (Resort Management), the giving of a notice to quit (Hamilton Gell versus White), or an illness causing a special disability (Maguire).  [33] Until an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) is made the right under that section can fairly be characterised as a mere right to take advantage of the section, to use the language of Lord Herschell
LC [para 17], and an abstract rather than a specific right to use the language of Atkin LJ [para 22].  [34] In my judgment the claimant was not protected by [s (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s30.html) or the common law presumption from the limitation of the Commission's jurisdiction brought about by [s
A(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s108a.html)
Thus, the Court of Appeal held that the mere right to make an application for discretionary relief under [s 106](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html) was not an "accrued right"; there was no accrued right until an application was filed, whereupon a right to have it considered and determined accrued.
Here, the plaintiff invoked the distinction, adverted to in [32] of the judgment in Colley, of cases in which a right or entitlement "automatically accrues or is acquired on an event".[5] It is instructive to identify the nature of the rights that were involved in the cases mentioned by Handley JA.
In Hamilton Gell versus White,[6] (UK) Agricultural Holdings Act 1908, <case>, provided that where, in view of a sale, the landlord of a holding terminated a tenancy by notice to quit, the tenant would be entitled to compensation for the loss or expense directly attributable to his quitting the holding, and in order to be entitled to compensation, had to give notice of intention to claim within two months after receiving the notice, and make the claim within three months after quitting the holding. Bankes LJ said:[7] 
This is not like the case which was cited to us in argument [Abbott v
Minister for Lands [[1895] AC 425]] where the tenant's right depended upon some act of his own. Here it depends on the act of the landlord - namely the giving of a notice to quit in view of a sale - in which event the section itself confers a right to compensation subject to the tenant complying with the conditions therein specified ...
Scrutton LJ said:[8] 
But it is not suggested by the appellant that his right to claim compensation was acquired by his giving notice of intention to claim it; what gave him the right was the fact of the landlord having given a notice to quit in view of a sale. The conditions imposed by s. 11 were conditions, not of the acquisition of the right, but of its enforcement.
Atkin LJ said:[9] 
It is obvious that that provision [the equivalent of [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/), [s (1)(c)]](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s30.html) was not intended to preserve the abstract rights conferred by the repealed
Act, such for instance as the right of compensation for disturbance conferred upon tenants generally under the Act of 1908, for if it were the repealing Act would be altogether inoperative. It only applies to the specific rights given to an individual upon the happening of one or other of the events specified in the statute. Here the necessary event has happened, because the landlord has, in view of a sale of the property, given the tenant notice to quit. Under those circumstances the tenant has "acquired a right", which would "accrue" when he has quitted his holding, to receive compensation.
Thus the right given to the tenant, which accrued upon the giving of the notice to quit, was a substantive right to compensation, not merely standing to make an application for the favourable exercise of a discretion; and the conditions were conditions of enforcement, not of acquisition, of that right.
In Resort Management Services Ltd versus Noosa Shire Council,[10] (QLD) [Local Government Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/lga1936182/), <case>(10)(a) conferred an entitlement to obtain compensation from a local authority in the event that a planning scheme was changed. That entitlement was held to accrue upon the repeal of the town planning scheme in question - not upon a claimant lodging a claim for compensation. McPherson JA said:[11] 
No doubt it is true that, unless a claim for compensation is made, no compensation will be paid; but it does not follow that, until such a claim is made, the entitlement has no existence, or that it is of such an inchoate or contingent character as to be beyond the scope or protection of s. 20(1)(c).
By way of analogy, a common law right to recover damages is viewed as a chose in action before any judgment for damages is given, and even before any writ or claim to recover it has been issued or made ...
Again, the right given was not merely one to make an application to have a discretion exercised, but a substantive right to compensation, albeit that it had to be claimed if the right were to be enforced.
In New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council versus Minister,[12] the relevant Act entitled an Aboriginal Land Council to claim "claimable lands", and the Minister if satisfied that the lands were "claimable Crown lands" was required to grant the claim; there was no discretion. Hope JA referred to the non-discretionary nature of the decision amongst the features which preserved the claim (emphasis added):[13] 
These decisions satisfy me that a statutory right will be preserved notwithstanding the repeal or amendment of the statute even though the right can only be implemented by a non-discretionary decision of an official or a court, provided that the statutory machinery for obtaining that decision has been set in train before the repeal or amendment.
Indeed, it may well be that satisfaction of the proviso - that the requisite statutory machinery has been set in train - is unnecessary. But the right in question was a substantive right, not a mere right to apply for the favourable exercise of a discretion.
In Chief Adjudication Officer versus Maguire,[14] the respondent suffered from a disabling condition which entitled him to claim serious hardship allowance under the (UK) Social Security Act 1975, <case>, but had made no such claim before the repeal of that section in October 1986. Subsequently, he made a claim for allowance, from April 1985 until the repeal. The issue arose as to whether his failure to claim before the repeal of <case> precluded him from receiving allowance in respect of the pre-repeal period. Section [16(1)(c)](http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.6600713375977778&service=citation&langcountry=GB&backKey=20T24550677443&linkInfo=F%23GB%23UKACTS%23num%25197830a%25sect%2516%25section%2516%25&ersKey=23T24550677437)[](http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.6600713375977778&service=citation&langcountry=GB&backKey=20T24550677443&linkInfo=F%23GB%23UKACTS%23num%25197830a%25sect%2516%25section%2516%25&ersKey=23T24550677437) of the (UK) Interpretation Act 1978 provided that the repeal of an enactment did not affect any right acquired or accrued under that enactment, unless the contrary intention appeared. The Court of Appeal held that a right could be acquired under an enactment before its repeal, even though it was contingent on an event which occurred only after repeal, and that where a person had an entitlement to money or other certain benefit at the time of repeal, the fact that it might be necessary to take further steps to prove the existence or true extent of that entitlement did not preclude it from being regarded as a right. A person acquired a right under <case> of the 1975 Act when its substantive criteria were satisfied, not when the claim was made, and thus the respondent had acquired a right under <case> at the time of its repeal, and it was immaterial that he had sought to enforce it only after repeal.
The right or entitlement in question in Maguire was thus a substantive non-discretionary right to a benefit, which accrued when the criteria for eligibility were satisfied - not a mere right to apply for a discretionary benefit.
Accordingly, in every one of those cases, there was - in the words of Handley JA - an ascertainable substantive right or entitlement, defined by reference to past facts.[15] None involved a mere right to apply for a favourable exercise of a discretion.
His Honour also referred to cases in which what was involved was an application for the favourable exercise of a discretion: Esber versus The Commonwealth,[16] Gerrard versus Mayne Nickless Ltd,[17] and Director of Public Works versus Ho Po Sang.[18]
In Director of Public Works versus Ho Po Sang,[19] steps had been taken to obtain a certificate from the Governor of Hong Kong in Council, but the proceedings were not saved by the Interpretation Ordinance, because the appellant had no more than a hope or expectation - not an enforceable right. The Privy Council drew a distinction between an investigation in respect of a right, and one to decide whether a right should be created; while the former recognises an existing - "accrued" - right, the latter involves a discretionary decision as to whether legal rights or status are to be affected. Because of the nature of the broad unfettered executive discretion given to the Governor in Council, not even the commencement of an application created an accrued right; but in that respect, as Handley JA pointed out, such an unfettered executive discretion is different from a judicial discretion such as that conferred by [Industrial Relations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/), [s 106.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html)
In Esber versus The Commonwealth,[20] Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ explained the significance of commencing proceedings, where the claim is for discretionary relief (emphasis added):[21] 
If it be assumed that the appellant did not have a right to redemption ...
he had a right to have his claim to redemption determined in his favour if the delegate had wrongly refused his claim ... Once the appellant lodged an application to the tribunal to review the delegate's decision, he had a right to have the decision of the delegate reconsidered and determined by the tribunal. It was not merely 'a power to take advantage of an enactment'. Nor was it a mere matter of procedure; it was a substantive right. Section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act protects anything that may truly be described as a right 'although that right might fairly be called inchoate or contingent'.
This was such a right. It was a right in existence at the time the 1971 Act was repealed. That being so, and in the absence of a contrary intention, the right was protected by <case> of the Acts Interpretation Act ...
Similarly, in Gerrard versus Mayne Nickless Ltd[22] (which concerned applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under sections, later repealed, which broadly corresponded with [Industrial Relations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/), [s 106)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s106.html), the Industrial Relations Court said:[23] ... once the various owner-drivers had made application to the Commission, they acquired a right to have their applications heard and determined. If they made out a ground specified in <case>, they had a right to a decision recording the Commission's opinion to that effect and a right to have the
Commission determine whether or not to grant discretionary relief under s
B(1).
As Handley JA pointed out,[24] while neither case affirmatively decides that no right had accrued or been acquired before an application was made under the repealed legislation, both decisions were based on the effect of the pending application, rather than on any suggestion that there was an accrued right before an application was made.
The view that a mere right to apply for a favourable exercise of discretion is not an accrued right is confirmed by the judgment of Kitto J in Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd versus G F Heublein and Bro Incorporated,[25] in respect of a claim by a "person aggrieved" for discretionary relief under (CTH) Trade Marks Act 1905, <case>, which provided that the Court may, on the application of any person aggrieved, in certain circumstances, order the removal of a trade mark from the register. His Honour said that had the application not been pending when the legislation was amended, the applicant's locus standi to apply as a person aggrieved was not a "right accrued"; although the filing of an application invoked and acquired a right to have the court decide whether it ought exercise its jurisdiction: 
If the application had not been pending in the Court when the new Act came into force, I should have agreed that the applicant company had not a right to relief under s. 72 which it could therefore enforce. Even though it had a locus standi to apply under the section as a "person aggrieved", s. 8 of the
Acts Interpretation Act could have no application in its favour: see Abbott v Minister for Lands; and cf. Brandon's Patent, Ex Parte Doty. But in my opinion the applicant, by instituting its application in the Court, that is to say by filing its notice of motion, acquired a right to have the Court decide whether it ought to exercise its jurisdiction under s. 72 in that application, and that right was within the protection of s. 8(c) of the Acts
Interpretation Act...
This is closely analogous to the present case, in which prior to the repeal of the 1961 Act the plaintiff had no more than locus standi, as a person interested, to make an application to have the dissolution declared void. An instructive contrast - both to Continental Liqueurs and to the present case - is provided by Convex Ltd's Patent.[26] A patent had lapsed on 27 April 1978, just a few weeks before 1 June 1978 when the (UK) [Patents Act ](http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.0750895167208453&service=citation&langcountry=GB&backKey=20T24550677443&linkInfo=F%23GB%23UKACTS%23num%25197737aTitle%25&ersKey=23T24550677437)[](http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.0750895167208453&service=citation&langcountry=GB&backKey=20T24550677443&linkInfo=F%23GB%23UKACTS%23num%25197737aTitle%25&ersKey=23T24550677437) came into force in place of the [Patents Act ](http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.5991110599057597&service=citation&langcountry=GB&backKey=20T24550677443&linkInfo=F%23GB%23UKACTS%23num%25194987aTitle%25&ersKey=23T24550677437)[](http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/au/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?A=0.5991110599057597&service=citation&langcountry=GB&backKey=20T24550677443&linkInfo=F%23GB%23UKACTS%23num%25194987aTitle%25&ersKey=23T24550677437). Restoration of a 1949 Act patent could only be ordered under that Act, but the application was not made until after its repeal. In rejecting an argument that there was no accrued right and thus no power to restore, Buckley LJ said:[27] ... it seems to me that the right of the applicants to require their patent to be restored, provided that they made their application within the three years limited by the 1949 Act, and established that the failure to make the payment of the renewal fee had been unintentional and that there had been no undue delay in their making their application, was a right which should be recognised as a right which had accrued to them in law before the commencement of the 1977 Act. Accordingly it seems to me that this is a case to which section 16 of the Interpretation Act of 1978 applies ...
Critically, the Act in question gave the applicant a right to require its patent to be restored if the relevant circumstances were satisfied, which did not depend on an exercise of discretion. In contrast, <case> of the 1961 [Companies Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) does not give a person interested a right to have a dissolution declared void, but only standing to apply for the favourable exercise of the Court's discretion to make such an order.
The distinction in this context between substantive rights which are preserved, and procedural "rights" to make an application which are not, was recognised by the Court of Appeal in Torrac Nominees Pty Ltd versus Karabay; UWS Macarthur Sports & Recreation Association versus Karabay,[28] in which Young CJ in Eq, with whom Ipp JA and Handley AJA agreed, said (emphasis added): [41] That was the situation in Dib by her tutor Habib Dib versus Regtop, where this Court held that cl 10(a) enabled the application in question to be continued as if the Civil Procedure Act had not been enacted. However, the fact that that motion was filed before the repeal was a vital fact in that decision. As the Lord 
Chancellor said in Abbott versus Minister for Lands [[1895] AC 425] at 431: "... the mere right (assuming it to be properly so called) existing in the members of the community or any class of them to take advantage of an enactment, without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right, cannot properly be deemed a 'right accrued' ... ." [42] The importance of acts done under enabling legislation prior to its repeal in creating rights which are preserved by savings provisions is illustrated by Free Lanka Insurance Co Ltd versus A.E. Ranasinghe [[1964] AC ] at 552;
Esber versus Commonwealth <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 430] at 440; Gerrard versus Mayne Nickless Ltd [(1996) 135 ALR ]
at 512-513; Dossett versus TKJ Nominees Pty Ltd (2003) 218 
CLR 1 at 14 [45]; Colley versus Futurebrand FHA Pty Ltd <case>; [(2005) 63 NSWLR 291] at 298.  [43] An individual substantive right which came into existence before the repeal of the statute which created it will be saved by the Interpretation Act provisions even if nothing had been done to enforce or claim that right before  the repeal: Re Brandon's Patent; Ex parte Doty [(1884) 9 App Cas ];
Convex Ltd's Patent [[1980] RPC 423 (CA)]; Carr versus Finance
Corporation of Australia Ltd <case>; [(1982) 150 CLR 139]; Chief Adjudication Officer versus Maguire  <case>; [[1999] 1 WLR 1778] at 1788, 1790; <case>; [[1999] 2 All ER 859] at 869, 870-871 (CA); Colley versus Futurebrand FHA Pty
Ltd (at 297-298).  [44] There is no relevant substantive right in this case. The opponent's only so-called "rights" were procedural, the right to apply for an extension of the time fixed by Pt 1, r 7A(3) of the District Court Rules and, as Duck
DCJ found, the "right" to continue the proceedings begun by the filing of the statement of claim on 26 June 2002. The first so-called right was not exercised before 15 August 2005. In that respect nothing was "begun" which could be "continued and completed".
The view that <case>(c) is concerned with substantive and not procedural "rights" is also supported by the judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Australand Corp (Qld) Pty Ltd versus Johnson,[29] holding that that an acquired or accrued right, in the relevant sense, is not a mere right conferred by an Act of which a person might take advantage, should he or she choose to do so, but a right which might be enforced by the person who propounded it against a person said to be under a liability which corresponded to it.
Thus, although the authorities have sometimes expressed the distinction as one between cases in which a right automatically accrues or is acquired upon the happening of an event specified by the statute which is independent of the act of the individual concerned, and cases in which statutory rights are generally available without the happening of a specific event and do not accrue until some step is taken by a plaintiff,[30] that is really no more than a way of expressing the difference between an extant substantive right on the one hand, and standing to apply for a favourable exercise of discretion on the other. In each of the cases distinguished by Handley JA, a substantive right had arisen, albeit that its enforcement required further steps. In Colley, there was no substantive right - only the procedural "right" to make an application, which was held insufficient. Mere locus standi is equivalent to what Lord Herschell LC described in Abbott versus Minister for Lands[31] as "the mere right (assuming it to be properly so called) existing in the members of the community or any class of them to take advantage of an enactment". The mere right to make an application for a favourable exercise of discretion is not an "acquired or accrued right" for the purposes of <case> - at least until the application has been made, when a right to have it considered and determined may accrue.
In this case, Mr Amar at the time of the repeal of the 1961 Act had, to borrow the words of Handley JA, no substantive right or entitlement defined by reference to past facts, similar to the rights to compensation in Hamilton-Gell versus White and Resort Management, the right to the hardship allowance in Chief Adjudication Officer versus Maguire, or the land rights claim in New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council versus Minister.[32] He had only the procedural right to make an application - a "right" which was not specific to him, but one that he shared with the liquidator and all members of the class of "any other person who appears to the Court to be interested". This was mere locus standi, not an accrued right. 
As the plaintiff did not have an accrued right under <case> of the 1961 [Companies Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) at the time of its repeal, Interpretation Act, <case>(c), does not preserve any right to make an application under <case>.
It follows that, for the foregoing reasons, I must decline to set aside the order of 29 June 2016 dismissing the plaintiff's application.
