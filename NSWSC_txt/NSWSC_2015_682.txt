JUDGMENT
A restraining order was made in this matter in April 2012 in relation to the Defendant's involvement in the supply of drugs. An order was subsequently made that he be examined and on 24 May 2014, an order was made in relation to another person who might have knowledge about the nature and location of any property in which the Defendant had an interest.
The Plaintiff now applies by motion that Nelson Douglas Hill be examined before a Registrar of the Court concerning the Defendant's affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which the Defendant has an interest. The application is made pursuant to [Section 12(1)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . The affidavit of Sandra Joy Davys sworn 14 May 2015 identifies a sufficient basis for the knowledge of the proposed respondent. Mr Quartermain, who appears for Defendant, does not oppose the order being made.
I consider it is appropriate that the order for the examination of Mr Hill should be made. I therefore make Order 1 contained in the draft order provided to me, grant leave in accordance with paragraph 2 and grant liberty in relation to paragraph 3.
