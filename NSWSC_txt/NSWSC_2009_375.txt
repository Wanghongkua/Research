Revised 11 May 2009  /09 The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust versus David
Grant Vincent & Anor 
JUDGMENT In proceedings number 50019 of 2009 by notice of motion filed on 3 April the second defendant, Mrs Vincent, seeks an order permitting the sale of a property at 27 Gungah Bay Road, Oatley (the Oatley property). The sale of that property is presently prevented by freezing orders made by this court on February 2009.
 The plaintiff consents to the variation of the freezing orders to permit the sale on certain conditions set out in the short minutes of order which have been passed to the court. So as to facilitate the sale, the plaintiff and Mrs
Vincent are desirous of the Court making a declaration as to the plaintiff's charge over the property. Although the first defendant, Mr Vincent, will be affected by the charge he filed a submitting appearance in these proceedings on 15 April 2009 and is not present today.
 On 7 April 2009 Mr Vincent consented to a judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the first defendant in the sum of $1,430,839.03 in respect of the plaintiff's claim set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the amended summons filed on 7 April 2009. In so doing Mr Vincent admitted to fraudulently receiving payments from the plaintiff in the sum of $1,142,841.79. A list of those payments is annexed to the amended Commercial List statement filed on 8
April 2009.
 From that money fraudulently received Mr Vincent: made loan repayments in respect of a loan secured over the Oatley property totalling $80,245.77 (see the annexure B to the further amended
Commercial List statement), made various payments for the improvement of the Oatley property totalling $122,441.
 
The total of those payments is $202,686.77.
 With the addition of interest the plaintiff seeks a charge over the Oatley property in the sum of $257,411.00.
 As against Mr Vincent, the foundation for the charge is that he fraudulently received money from the plaintiff. A thief holds stolen funds or property under a presumed or resulting trust for the benefit of the rightful owner.
Such a trust arises immediately upon acquisition of the property and is equivalent to an express trust for the purpose of the duty to get in the trust estate, Robb Evans versus European Bank Ltd <case>; <case>-[116],
Orix Australia Corporation Ltd versus Moody Kiddell & Partners Pty Ltd <case> at <case>- <case>.
The property is trust property in the hands of the thief because the thief is bound in conscience to hold the property on behalf of its true owner. The trust may also be characterised as a constructive trust, Westdeutsche
Landesbank versus Islington London Borough Council <case>; [[1996] AC ] per
Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 716.
 Where a trustee mixes his own money with trust money in a bank account the money remains subject to the trust, Stephens Travel Service International Pty
Ltd versus Qantas Airways Ltd [(1988) 13 NSWLR 331] at
F-348A.
 Mr Vincent deposited the fraudulently obtained monies into his Commonwealth
Bank account. Where a trustee acquires property using exclusively trust money, the beneficiary has a proprietary interest in the property acquired, however, where a trustee acquires property using trust money mixed with his own the beneficial owner does not have a proprietary interest in the property because it was not acquired only with trust property. Instead the beneficiary is entitled to a charge over the property to secure the amount of the fiduciary's liability, Re Hallett's Estate [(1880) 13 Ch D 696] at -709. The charge gives rise to an entitlement to have the property restored to the beneficiary by restitution and arises as soon as the wrongful conversion or mixing occurs, Re French Caledonia Travel Service Pty Ltd (in liq) <case>; <case>.  Where a fund mixed with trust money is used to acquire other property, the beneficiary is entitled to charge both the fund and any property acquired from that fund, Re Oatway [[1903] 2 Ch 356] at 361; Re
French Caledonia Travel Service Pty Ltd (in liq) <case>; <case> - [84]. The charge may be asserted over both the fund and the property to its full value in the sense that the beneficiary must exhaust either first before recouping the full balance out of the other, see Jacob's Law of Trusts in
Australia (7th ed) at [2707] p675, 677. The rationale for this is that until the trustee has fulfilled his fiduciary duty to restore the trust property he will not be heard to claim his own interest in the acquired property, Westpac
Banking Corporation versus Ollis <case> at <case>,
Einstein J.
 Where trust property has been used to effect the value of the property, such as by the repayment of loans secured over the property it can be traced into the property, Boscawen versus Baiwa <case>; [[1996] 1 WLR 328.] As against Mrs Vincent, the foundation for the charge is her receipt of the benefit of the funds for no consideration. Volunteers without notice receive trust property subject to the trust, Strang versus Owens [(1925) 42 WN ]; Addstead Pty Ltd (in liq) versus Liddan Pty Ltd <case>; [(1997) 70 SASR 21]; [25 ACSR 175].
 In all of the circumstances and bearing in mind the materials that are now before the court, the principled exercise of the relevant discretion is to make a judgment/order in the form of the document which the parties have provided which the plaintiff and the second defendant have provided to the court.
 The court makes orders in terms of the document entitled "Judgment/Order" which I have initialled and dated 8 May 2009. Each of the orders provided for in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 inclusive are now made, and I order that the orders be entered forthwith on Monday next.
 The court further notes the undertaking of Michael Jokovic to the court and to the plaintiff that he will do all things reasonably necessary to give effect to paragraph 2(i) of the orders.
