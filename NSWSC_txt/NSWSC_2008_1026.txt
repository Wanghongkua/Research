JUDGMENT  
The applicant is the liquidator of Auskor Cultural Exchange Pty Limited in respect of which a winding up order has been made by the court. The applicant seeks an order under [s
B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s436b.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) granting him leave to appoint himself as administrator of the company.
 
On the materials before me, that order should be made. I say this in light of the fact that the applicant has given evidence that he is not aware of any conflict of duty or interest that would preclude him from taking up the position as voluntary administrator. That - and the more general issue of suitability to be administrator - is really the only question that arises on this kind of application: see Re Cobar Mines Pty Ltd [(1998) 30 ACSR ]
and the later cases in which it has been applied.
 
There is also sought, however, an order pursuant to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) that the operation of [Part .3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a), as it applies in this case, be altered to abolish the requirement for a first meeting of creditors in the voluntary administration and to change the period for the convening of what would normally be the second meeting of creditors in that administration.
 
That order is commonly made in cases where the liquidator seeking leave to appoint himself or herself as administrator is liquidator under the form of creditors' voluntary winding up that follows on from voluntary administration.
In such a case a first meeting of creditors has already been held in the prior administration and it is, in the absence of indications to the contrary, reasonable to think that to have another such meeting will entail unnecessary duplication.
 
In this case, however, where the winding up is a winding up ordered by the court, there has been no first meeting and therefore no forum within which creditors have had an opportunity to pronounce upon the question whether the initially appointed administrator should or should not continue as administrator. I do not think that that opportunity should be abolished in a case such as the present, unless the court has material before it upon which it is satisfied that the creditors are content that, in the voluntary administration, the person who was liquidator should continue as administrator.
 
Because there are only a few creditors in this case, the most efficient course is probably for the applicant to obtain positive indications from them to that effect, assuming that they are willing to give them.
 
On that basis I will stand the matter over so that this can be attended to.
 
The interlocutory process is stood over to 9.30am on 1 October 2008 before me.
In the absence of any indication to the contrary at that point, I will make the orders sought.
