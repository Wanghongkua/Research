Last Updated: 27 November 1998 `RE RGC LIMITED` `4081/98` `2 November 1998` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT `HIS HONOUR: This is a summons to convene a meeting so that shareholders in the plaintiff can consider a proposed scheme of arrangement.` ` The proposed scheme of arrangement essentially is that there will be a merger between the plaintiff company and another company. The evidence suggests that there could be considerable benefit to both companies through this merger and it is the sort of proposal that should be placed before the shareholders so that they can form their business judgment on the issues and vote accordingly.` ` The problems that have been caused, which has meant that counsel and I have spent about a day and a half on the matter, have come about for three main reasons. One, the rather peculiar nature of this scheme of arrangement; two, the many little, but significant, alterations that were made to the
Corporations Law by virtue of the amending legislation which came into force on 1 July 1998; and three, the fact that although the summons had been filed for some time the papers were only available to be looked at by a judge at the first day of hearing.` ` As to this third matter the court knows that very often there has to be, as there was in this case, negotiations with the regulatory authority as to the form of the explanatory memorandum and those negotiations can take some time.
However, the court does have a very real role to play and unless judges do have adequate time to digest the documents they will not be able to meet the time requirements that the proponents often would like to impose. Ordinarily the court should not be expected to digest 600 pages of paper in a day merely because the negotiations with the regulatory authority has left little time to convene a meeting. Judges of this court try to do their best, but when, like last Friday, there are four schemes of arrangement in the list, and there were no documents in any of them prior to the night before the hearing, running this list is very difficult. Ordinarily the judge running the Company List would expect to see for the first time full documentation at least two days before the return day.` ` The problems caused by the recent amendments to the Corporations Law have been thoroughly discussed, I merely wish to indicate, in case the second stage of this matter goes before a judge other than myself, what has occurred.` ` There are very significant, though seemingly minor, changes made in the provisions as to proxies in ss 250A, 250B, 250BA and 250C of the Corporations
Law which need to be closely watched. The freedom to have proxies returnable later than 48 hours before the meeting is restricted. The effect of these has been thoroughly considered by counsel and myself and the necessary alterations made to the documentation.` ` Secondly, attention has been given again to <case> and who should convene the meeting, and I affirm what I said in Re Bidvest Australia Ltd [(1998) ACLC 1553], that it is not the court that convenes the meeting, the court merely orders the company to convene the meeting.` ` Next, this scheme involves a reduction of capital. Bearing in mind what was said in Re Hunter Resources Ltd <case>; [(1992) 10 ACLC 538] and in Re Bidvest (supra), the reduction of capital will take place at a separate extraordinary general meeting convened by the directors.` ` However, in this case the members are not to receive the 95 cents that is to be returned on each share, rather they are to be compelled to pay that money back to the company in the form of an unsecured note.` ` One of the purposes of <case> of the Corporations Law is to bind minorities.
This means that the significant majority required under the section will bind minorities, and so the court must be careful to make sure that it is only within the proposed scheme that the minorities' rights are expunged.` ` I had some doubt as to how far the requirement of the shareholders to recontribute their 95 cents to an unsecured note is something that fell within the proposed scheme between the company and its members. This problem was exacerbated by the way the scheme was originally drawn, which did not focus on what the scheme was, but more on how it could be implemented. However, the amended scheme, I think, does indicate that although the requirement to subscribe to an unsecured note is connected with a reduction of the capital, it is part and parcel of the proposed scheme of arrangement so the minority will be bound.` ` The next question is whether the reduction of capital need be dealt with by a special resolution as the company's Articles of Association prescribe, or whether because of the provisions in ss 256B and 256C an ordinary resolution is sufficient. I favour the argument that a special resolution is still required and that, indeed, is how the scheme has been proposed.` ` I have also considered the form of deed poll. It is important in this sort of case that the deed poll be able to be enforced by each shareholder against the third party. Although it is not completely true that a deed poll can be enforced by anybody, in the present case I have looked at the wording and it seems to me that it can be enforced by any person who is a shareholder of the plaintiff at the relevant time; see Sunderland Marine Insurance Co versus Kearney <case>; [(1851) 16 QB 925], 938; <case>; [117
ER 1136], 1141.` ` Finally the question arises as to whether articles such as those deeming notices to have been given on certain dates apply. A reading of the headnote in Re Hector Whaling Ltd [[1936] Ch 108] would make one think they did, but that view was based on <case> of the 1929 English Act which no longer is in force.` ` Arguments as to whether the Articles are a replaceable rule under <case> of the Corporations Law would seem to be irrelevant as, with a reduction of capital by special resolution one must give 28 days' notice under <case>.
To my mind this means 28 days' notice as computed under ` `s 249J(4).` ` There has otherwise been a fairly full consideration of the documentation.
Much of it has been amended as the discussion has progressed, a task made simpler by the use of computerised word processors, and I am now satisfied that the ordinary man, woman or company who sees the explanatory memorandum would be able to work out what the scheme is all about in such a way as to be able to exercise an informed vote.` ` I should note that the regulatory authority appeared by senior counsel and made submissions, but later was satisfied with amendments made to the documentation.` 
Senior and junior counsel also sought leave to appear for Westralian Sands
Ltd, the company with whom the plaintiff seeks to merge. I did not give leave, but read written submissions presented by counsel which I will leave on the file. Counsel for that Company then remained in court as on a watching brief.

Accordingly I make orders for the meeting in accordance with the short minutes.
