EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
In this matter, the proceedings were commenced by summons filed in Court on 18 May 2012 by which the plaintiff sought various orders including an order pursuant to [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). For reasons published by Adamson J that day, orders were made pursuant to the Act.
Today, the parties have approached the Court seeking further orders pursuant to [s 12(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) of the Act, varying the existing orders so that they do not apply to interests in property of the defendant identified in schedule 1 of the order. Additionally, that pursuant to [s 27(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the Act the defendant pay to the treasurer the sum of $40,000. Nextly, that pursuant to [section 10B(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html) of the Act, the interest of the defendant in the property specified in schedule 2 to the order may be sold at a price agreed to in writing by the plaintiff or that it be refinanced to enable the proceeds assessment order to be satisfied. Nextly, an order that pursuant to [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) as to interest in proceeds.
The proposed order notes, amongst other things, that in consideration of the orders being made the defendant releases the Crown and the plaintiff, from any claim to damages in consequence of the making of restraining orders or otherwise; agrees not to make any further applications under <case> of the Act; and agrees not to appeal from or seek leave to appeal from any order made in these proceedings.
Having considered the terms of the proposed consent orders, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms that the parties have agreed and, accordingly, make orders in terms of the consent orders filed today.
