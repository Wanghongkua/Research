The plaintiff was a member of the Royal Australian Navy in 1990 when he suffered a work-related injury. He sued the Commonwealth of Australia in negligence claiming damages for economic and non-economic loss. Pursuant to [s45(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html), the plaintiff made an election to pursue common law rights some days before the proceedings commenced. On the application of the Commonwealth and by consent Master Malpass ordered that the following question be decided separately before trial: "Whether a determination by Comcare that compensation is payable under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or [27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) of the Act is an essential pre-condition of a valid election for the purposes of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the Act?"

(By Sheppard AJA) The preferable interpretation of [s45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) is that Comcare is required to determine whether there has been a permanent impairment as a precondition of a valid election. It must also determine the percentage impairment which has been suffered at least to the extent of determining whether the degree of it is 10 per cent or more. However, the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Janssen versus Commonwealth of
Australia should be followed in the interests of uniformity and comity.

JUDGMENT 
MASON P: The plaintiff was a member of the Royal Australian Navy in 1990 when he suffered a work-related injury. He has sued the Commonwealth in negligence claiming damages for economic and non-economic loss. The Commonwealth asserts that the action is barred unless and until the plaintiff's right to compensation for permanent impairment is determined administratively under the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (Cth) ("the Act"). 
The Act provides a comprehensive scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for persons who are injured in the course of their employment by the Commonwealth.
It treats members of the Defence Force as employees of the Commonwealth (s5).
It establishes a body called Comcare with the function of making determinations in relation to claims for compensation.

Part II (ss14-33) deals with compensation. Section 14(1) provides that: "Subject to this Part, Comcare is liable to pay compensation in accordance with the Act in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work, or impairment".

Divisions 2, 3 and 4 of Part II deal respectively with injuries resulting in death, incapacity for work and impairment. Division 4 (injuries resulting in impairment) contains ss24-28. So far as relevant these sections provide: 
Compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment (1) Where an injury to an employee results in a permanent impairment,
Comcare is liable to pay compensation to the employee in respect of the injury .

For the purpose of determining whether an impairment is permanent ,
Comcare shall have regard to: the duration of the impairment ; the likelihood of improvement in the employee's condition; whether the employee has undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment ; and any other relevant matters.

Subject to this section, the amount of compensation payable to the employee is such amount, as is assessed by Comcare under subsection (4), being an amount not exceeding the maximum amount at the date of the assessment.

The amount assessed by Comcare shall be an amount that is the same percentage of the maximum amount as the percentage determined by Comcare under subsection (5).

Comcare shall determine the degree of permanent impairment of the employee resulting from an injury under the provisions of the approved Guide.

The degree of permanent impairment shall be expressed as a percentage.

Subject to section 25, where Comcare determines that the degree of permanent impairment of the employee is less than 10%, an amount of compensation is not payable to the employee under this section.

Subsection (7) does not apply to any one or more of the following: the impairment constituted by the loss, or the loss of the use, of a finger; the impairment constituted by the loss, or the loss of the use, of a toe; the impairment constituted by the loss of the sense of taste; the impairment constituted by the loss of the sense of smell.

For the purposes of this section, the maximum amount is $80,000.

Interim payment of compensation (1) Where Comcare : makes a determination that an employee is suffering from a permanent impairment as a result of an injury ; and is satisfied that the degree of the impairment is equal to or more than % but has not made a final determination of the degree of impairment ; 
Comcare shall, on the written request of the employee made at any time before the final determination is made, make an interim determination of the degree of permanent impairment under section 24 and assess an amount of compensation payable to the employee. ...

Compensation for non-economic loss (1) Where an injury to an employee results in a permanent impairment and compensation is payable in respect of the injury under section 24, Comcare is liable to pay additional compensation in accordance with this section to the employee in respect of that injury for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee as a result of that injury or impairment.

The amount of compensation is an amount assessed by Comcare under the formula: [A formula is set out] 
Approved Guide (1) Comcare may, from time to time, prepare a written document, to be called the "Guide to the Assessment of the Degree of Permanent Impairment ", setting out: criteria by reference to which the degree of the permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury shall be determined; criteria by reference to which the degree of non-economic loss suffered by an employee as a result of an injury or impairment shall be determined; and methods by which the degree of permanent impairment and the degree of non-economic loss , as determined under those criteria, shall be expressed as a percentage.
 ... 
A document prepared by Comcare under subsection (1), and an instrument under subsection (2), have no force or effect unless and until approved by the Minister.

Where Comcare, a licensed authority, a licensed corporation or the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal is required to assess or re-assess, or review the assessment or re-assessment of, the degree of permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury, or the degree of non-economic loss suffered by an employee, the provisions of the approved Guide are binding on Comcare, the licensed authority, the licensed corporation or the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal, as the case may be, in the carrying out of that assessment, re- assessment or review, and the assessment, re-assessment or review shall be made under the relevant provisions of the approved Guide.

Part IV (ss42-52) deals with liabilities arising apart from the Act. Sections and 45 relevantly provide: 
Action for damages not to lie against the Commonwealth etc in certain cases (1) Subject to section 45, an action or other proceeding for damages does not lie against the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a licensed corporation or an employee in respect of: an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment, being an injury in respect of which the Commonwealth, Commonwealth authority or licensed corporation would, but for this sub-section, be liable (whether vicariously or otherwise) for damages....

Actions for damages - election by employees (1) Where: compensation is payable under section 24, 25 or 27 in respect of an injury to an employee; and the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a licensed corporation or another employee would, but for subsection 44(1), be liable for damages for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee as a result of the injury; the employee may, at any time before an amount of compensation is paid to the employee under section 24, 25 or 27 in respect of that injury, elect in writing to institute an action or proceeding against the Commonwealth, the
Commonwealth authority, the licensed corporation or another employee for damages for that non-economic loss.

Where an employee makes an election: subsection 44(1) does not apply in relation to an action or other proceeding subsequently instituted by the employee against the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth authority, the licensed corporation or the other employee for damages for the non-economic loss to which the election relates; and compensation is not payable after the date of the election under section , 25 or 27 in respect of the injury.

An election is irrecoverable.

In any action or proceeding instituted as a result of an election made by an employee, the Court shall not award the employee damages of an amount exceeding $110,000 for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee.

Part V (ss53-59) deals with claims for compensation. Section 53(1) provides relevantly that the Act does not apply in relation to an injury to an employee unless notice in writing of the injury is given to Comcare as soon as practicable after the employee becomes aware of the injury.

Section 54 stipulates that compensation is not payable to a person under the
Act unless a claim for compensation is made by or on behalf of the person under that section. The section then specified requirements and procedures for a claim, including the requirement that it be made in writing in accordance with an approved form.

Part VI (ss60-67) deals with reconsideration and review of determinations. A determining authority is required to give written notice of a determination, setting out reasons (s61). The authority may reconsider its determination on its own motion or pursuant to a request to that effect (s62). The decision consequent upon a reconsideration is referred to as a "reviewable decision". A reviewable decision may in turn be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal ("AAT") in accordance with procedures set out in ss64-67.

Comcare's functions include that of making determinations in relation to claims and requests under the Act (s69). In performing this function Comcare shall be guided by equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities. However, it is not required to conduct a hearing and is not bound by the rules of evidence (s72). Comcare is subject to the direction of the Minister, except in relation to a particular case .

THE COMMONWEALTH'S SUBMISSIONS AND THEIR EFFECT 
In Commonwealth of Australia versus Flaviano <case>; [(1996) 40 NSWLR 199] this Court held that, unless and until an employee makes an election in writing pursuant to s45(1), s44(1) ensures that no action lies against the Commonwealth. An appropriate election to pursue common law rights was made some days before these proceedings commenced. However, the defendant submits that more is required by s45. In particular, it is contended that an administrative determination that compensation is payable under ss24, 25 or 27 of the Act is an essential pre-condition to a valid election for the purposes of s45. Such determination is to be made by Comcare or the AAT.

On the application of the Commonwealth and by consent, Master Malpass ordered that the following question be decided separately before trial: "Whether a determination by Comcare that compensation is payable under section 24, 25 or 27 of the Act is an essential pre-condition of a valid election for the purposes of section 45 of the Act?" 
The Master then removed the proceedings into the Court of Appeal.

The point in question has been determined adversely to the Commonwealth by the
Queensland Court of Appeal in Janssen versus Commonwealth of Australia [[1994] 2 Qd R 596.] To understand the way in which the Commonwealth puts its case and how it seeks to challenge Janssen, it is necessary to appreciate the statutory scheme as expounded in the Commonwealth's submissions. Most of what follows is uncontentious.

Compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment 
An employee who suffers "injury" (as defined in s4) is entitled to be paid compensation by Comcare (ss14(1), 24(1)). But there are statutory procedures which must be complied with. A written claim must be lodged in accordance with s53 and determined by Comcare (s69). Written notice of the determination must be given (s61) and is subject to the internal and external (AAT) review procedures already mentioned.

Where compensation is claimed for injuries resulting in permanent impairment,
Comcare is first required to determine whether the impairment is permanent, and for that purpose it shall have regard to the factors stipulated in s24(2).

The amount of compensation must be assessed by Comcare in accordance with s24(3)-(9). Comcare is to determine the degree of permanent impairment, expressed as a percentage, and in doing so it is to be bound by the "Guide to the Assessment of the Degree of Permanent Impairment" (ss 24(4) - (5), 25(4)).
Section 24(3) provides that the amount payable is the determined percentage of the maximum amount at the date of the assessment, a sum originally capped at $80,000 (s24(9)) but indexed annually (s13). (The maximum amount is currently $112,655.29.) 
A Comcare determination of permanent impairment equal to or more than 10% is a prerequisite to compensation becoming payable under ss24, 25 or 27 (except as qualified by s24(8)). Thus, except in relation to the types of impairment listed in s24(8), "an amount of compensation [for permanent impairment] is not payable" where Comcare determines that the degree of permanent impairment is less than 10% (s24(7)). Similarly, Comcare must be satisfied that the degree of impairment is equal to or more than 10% before an interim payment of compensation can be made pursuant to s25: see s25(1)(b). Where an injury results in a permanent impairment and compensation is payable under s24,
Comcare is liable to pay additional compensation for non-economic loss (s27).

Although the right to compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment is statutory, payment is dependent upon determinations by Comcare, subject to internal and external (AAT) review mechanisms. In this sense, it is clear that, subject to review, compensation for impairments other than those stipulated in s24(8) is not "payable" until it has been assessed by Comcare, such assessment resulting in a determination that the injured employee's degree of permanent impairment (assessed in accordance with the Guide) is at least 10%. Indeed, s26(1) stipulates expressly that, subject to the section, an amount of compensation payable to an employee under section 24 or 25, "shall be paid to the employee within 30 days after the date of the assessment of the amount".

Common law claims 
Section 45(1) preserves an employee's right to institute proceedings in a court for damages for "non-economic loss", which (according to s4): "... in relation to an employee who has suffered an injury resulting in a permanent impairment, means loss or damage of a non-economic kind suffered by the employee (including pain and suffering, a loss of expectation of life or a loss of the amenities or enjoyment of life) as a result of that injury or impairment and of which the employee is aware." 
Section 45 offers a narrow, conditional gateway through which an injured employee must pass in order to avoid s44's barring of actions for damages in respect of injury. The right to bring an action at common law for damages for non-economic loss is subject to the plaintiff's prior written election (s45(1), Flaviano). The election must be made before an amount of compensation is paid to the employee under ss24, 25 or 27 in respect of the injury (s45(1)) and it is irrevocable (s45(3)). Where an election is made, compensation under the sections is not payable after the date of the election (s45(2)(b)). (I read this provision as a countermand of s26(1)'s stipulation that compensation payable under ss24 or 25 shall be paid within 30 days after the date of the assessment of the amount.) And the damages are capped at $110,000 "for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee" (s45(4)). This figure is not indexed under the Act.

The Parliamentary history reveals that s45's gateway was not part of the original Bill: see also Schlenert versus Australian and Overseas
Telecommunications Corporation <case>; [(1994) 49 FCR 139] at 149-50. When the Bill for the Act was introduced into federal Parliament in 1988, s44 was not qualified by the reference to s45 and s45 did not appear in the Bill. Subsequently a clause which became s45 was added and s44 was made subject to it: see Australia, Senate Parliamentary
Debates (Hansard) 2 June, 1988 at 3477-8. A supplementary explanatory memorandum accompanied these amendments. The objective of the clause that became s45 was stated to be: "to provide employees with an election to take either compensation for permanent impairment and non-economic loss under the Bill or to take a common law action for non-economic loss only, subject to an impairment threshold of % of the whole person and a monetary limit of $110,000".

That clause was further explained as follows: "Where the employee elects to sue at common law, no amount will be paid out under the Bill for permanent impairment or non-economic loss and the common law action will be subject to an impairment threshold of 10% of the whole person and a monetary limit of $110,000. Where an employee elects to receive compensation under clauses 24, 25 or 17, the employee will forfeit rights to sue at common law for non-economic loss. Once an election is made either way, it is irrevocable." 
Mr Robertson SC relied upon this material to support his argument that the legislative scheme contemplates that the common law action was intended to be "subject to an impairment threshold of 10% of the whole person". I agree that this intent is disclosed in the legislation. However, the real issue is whether the Act reveals that a Comcare/AAT determination to that effect is the sine qua non.

ANALYSIS 
The opening portion of s45(1) stipulates two pre-conditions to an election, the first of which is central to this case. It is the requirement that "compensation is payable under sections 24, 25 or 27 in respect of an injury to an employee".

The Commonwealth submits that it can never be shown that compensation is payable under the sections identified unless and until a determination to that effect has been made. Such determination must follow the procedures indicated above. The claimant must make application in writing (s54). And Comcare (or the AAT, on review) must determine the degree of permanent impairment (according to the Guide) in a percentage of 10% or more. This submission frankly acknowledges that the procedures leading to such determination may be lengthy, and that the employee who thereafter elects to pursue common law rights will in effect be rejecting the fruits of that determination.
Nevertheless the need to go through such steps is advanced on (i) textual and policy grounds.

As to (i) (textual arguments), the Commonwealth's case is that compensation only becomes "payable" in consequence of a Comcare/AAT determination made in accordance with the procedures that are essential prerequisites to the payment of compensation: see part (a) of the preceding section of this judgment. In other words, an application for such compensation must be successfully prosecuted to the stage of a favourable determination - but short of receipt of payment (cf s45(1)).

As to (ii) (policy arguments), the Commonwealth argues that an injured employee is entitled to know the level of compensation which he or she will be foregoing if an election is made to pursue damages at common law for non- economic loss.

In his oral submissions, Mr Robertson SC placed great emphasis upon s24(7). He argued that the main purpose of s45(1)(a) is to ensure that damages actions cannot be commenced unless and until an injured employee has got over the 10% impairment threshold in the sense that he or she has become entitled to receive payment of compensation. I have already acknowledged that Parliament intended that the impairment threshold of 10% would apply to the common law action as well as to the claim for compensation. That is stated in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. More importantly, it is the clear effect of s45(1)(a). But in one sense this only brings one to the question to be decided. That question is whether Parliament expressed an intention that
Comcare (or the AAT, on review) should be the body that determines that matter (pre-election) or whether the court hearing the damages claim is to decide what the determining authority would have done in the particular case if it is asserted that compensation would not have been payable under ss24, 25 or 27.

There is nothing unusual in a statute conferring a conditional right to institute an action, where the court deciding the action must determine if the conditions were fulfilled. And the idea of a court deciding what another body, judicial or administrative, would have done in a particular situation is a common occurrence. Cf, for example [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), [s151](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151.html)
Z and cases involving the assessment of damages flowing from a lawyer's negligence in allowing other proceedings to become statute-barred. It is to be remembered that the Act provides a scheme of employee's entitlements, and is not the framework for a scheme of ex gratia payments.

It is convenient at this stage to examine the reasoning in Janssen and the criticism of it offered in the Commonwealth's submissions. Janssen was decided by the Queensland Court of Appeal in a reserved decision and without dissent. The leading judgment is given by Fitzgerald P and Pincus JA.
McPherson JA concurred, giving some additional reasons which the other judges also adopted.

Fitzgerald P and Pincus JA considered the Commonwealth's argument that the words "compensation is payable" in [s45(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) bear the strict meaning of "immediately recoverable under a determination pursuant to the Act". They also addressed the argument that the Act draws a deliberate distinction between creating liability (eg [s14(1))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s14.html) and making compensation "payable". Fitzgerald P and Pincus JA demonstrate that the Act is not uniform in the meaning it assigns to the word "payable" in its different parts. There are provisions where the word is used in the looser sense of a liability whose crystallisation depends on compliance with procedures stipulated elsewhere: see eg [ss14(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s14.html), ,
[15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s15.html)(3).
Conversely, there are provisions where "liable" and "liability" is used to refer to a crystallised obligation: see [ss17(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) and [30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s30.html)(1)(a).
Concluding this part of the joint judgment, their Honours suggested (at 600) that: "It appears unlikely that there is any particular significance in the fact that [s45(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) says `compensation is payable' rather than `there is a liability to pay compensation' or some such expression." 
I respectfully agree.

Their Honours then addressed the three sections mentioned in [s45(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) (ie ss[24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s24.html), [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s25.html) and 27). I shall not set out the passage (at 600-1). See also McPherson JA at -4. I agree with the conclusion that there are indications even in those provisions that compensation is "payable" although no determination has yet been made. The conclusion in the joint judgment (at 601) was that: "There appears, then, to be ground for thinking that `payable' in the statute is not necessarily and always used as meaning `immediately payable under a determination'. Sometimes it has that meaning and sometimes not." 
Once again I find myself in agreement. (I would add one point, referable to [s24(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s24.html) upon which much weight is placed by the Commonwealth. That subsection states that compensation is "not payable" where Comcare determines permanent impairment at less than 10%. It strikes me as an inversion of logic to rely on that provision to support the argument that compensation is not payable in the time that precedes such determination.) 
Having thus demonstrated the potential ambiguity of the words "where compensation is payable" in [s45(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html), their Honours turned to arguments based on the purpose of the legislation and the well-established presumptions against construing statutes in such a way as to deprive access to the courts or interfere with common law rights (see at ). The Commonwealth's approach to [s45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) was shown to lie uneasily with the beneficial objective of the statutory scheme as well as being productive of highly unreasonable results which border upon absurdity. In particular, the argument was exposed as having the consequence that an employee wishing from the outset to pursue common law rights would be required to embark upon the uncertainties and delays of processing an application for compensation which would never be pursued even if determined favourably by Comcare. This would tend to clutter up the administrative system with spurious claims by employees who have no real interest in the relief the Act provides for, but who desire that their claims for compensation be determined simply so that they can be abandoned in favour of a right to sue (see at 601-2). Once again I find this reasoning highly persuasive.

Additional reasons based upon the unreasonable consequences of the defendant's position were advanced in Janssen. It was pointed out (at 602) that the defendant's interpretation puts an injured plaintiff at peril of becoming statute-barred while awaiting a Comcare determination. A corollary is that a plaintiff could find himself or herself barred from commencing a common law claim by a perverse determination by Comcare which would have to be reviewed by the AAT or perhaps even challenged in judicial review proceedings before a common law claim could be commenced.

I have already indicated that McPherson JA agreed with the joint judgment. He added a persuasive reference to the statutory history of key provisions in the
Act.

The defendant did not suggest that Janssen was distinguishable. Rather, it was submitted that it was wrongly decided. Mr Robertson SC offered eight submissions, some of which I have addressed earlier in this judgment. The first three can be taken together. It was submitted that Janssen did not identify the purpose of [s45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) as being that of allowing a very limited exception to [s44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s44.html); that the Queensland Court of Appeal was not taken to the supplementary explanatory memorandum extracted above; and that the Court consequently failed to appreciate that the 10% threshold question was relevant to the common law claim as well as to the right to compensation. I do not think that there is much weight in these three points. I do not read Janssen as suggesting in any way that [s45(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) is to be ignored by the court determining the common law claim. The Queensland
Court of Appeal was addressing a claim by the Commonwealth to have a plaint in the District Court struck out summarily by reason of the conceded absence of a
Comcare determination to pay compensation. It is clear that the Court intended that the issue of the Commonwealth's liability (in the broader sense) to pay compensation under one or more of the sections would have to be determined in the common law action that was permitted to go forward. (Indeed this was Mr
Robertson's sixth point of criticism.) To my mind this is perfectly consonant with the scheme of [s45.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) 
Mr Robertson's fourth point was that the Queensland Court did not address the argument that the injured employee should have the benefit of an "informed choice" based upon knowing what was offered by Comcare by way of compensation before having to make an irrevocable election in favour of pursuing rights at common law. This is true, but I do not see the loss of such information as having the seriousness contended for. Nor am I persuaded by the related seventh argument which challenged the Court's reasoning based on concern about cluttering up Comcare's administrative process because it was said to overlook the "informed choice" rationale. The somewhat paternalistic object of [s45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) implicit in these submissions is not disclosed in the explanatory memorandum.
I fail to see why a plaintiff cannot make an informed assessment of his or her prospects of success under the Act without the aid of a Comcare/AAT determination. An injured worker could ask a lawyer or trade union official: "Is compensation payable under [s24?"](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s24.html)
Such a question can be readily answered by someone knowledgeable of the Act, the Guide and the practices of Comcare and of the AAT. The answer will not be determinative, but in many cases it will be easy having regard to the extent of injury. A further riposte to the argument that the Act evinces the intention that the injured employee have the opportunity of the "informed choice" asserted lies in [s26(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s26.html), which has already been mentioned. That section would enable the Commonwealth to pay compensation forthwith upon assessing that it was due. The injured employee who did not have the presence of mind to reject it would find himself or herself barred from making an election because of [s45's](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s45.html) requirement that such election must be made before an amount of compensation is paid.

The fifth point was that Janssen treated the substantive provisions of the Act as if they were merely procedural. No reference was made to [s11](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s11.html) which stipulates that: 
The liability of a relevant authority to pay compensation to a person under this Act is the liability of that authority to pay to the person such amount or amounts as are determined by that authority to be payable to the person under this Act.

In my view this is merely an alternative way of advancing the earlier submissions. No one doubts that the liability to pay compensation depends on an administrative determination. But the real point is the relevance of this to the matter of common law liability to pay damages.

The sixth and seventh arguments have already been addressed. Mr Robertson's eighth point was to reiterate his argument based on [s24(7).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s24.html)
I have already addressed it.

The judgments in Janssen demonstrate that the textual arguments in favour of the Commonwealth have a slender and uncertain toehold in the vagaries of legislative expression. They also show that the statutory ambiguities must be weighed in the face of the statutory presumption against derogation from common law rights, especially of access to the courts. I do not suggest that the indications are all one way, but to my mind the tide flows strongly in favour of the plaintiff's submissions.

In Australian Securities Commission versus Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 485] at 492 the High Court said that: "Uniformity of decision in the interpretation of uniform national legislation such as the [Corporations] Law is a sufficiently important consideration to require that an intermediate appellate court - and all the more so a single judge - should not depart from an interpretation placed on such legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that the interpretation is plainly wrong." 
The same principles apply to the construction of a Commonwealth statute itself: see Fernando versus Commissioner of Police [(1995) 36 NSWLR ]
at 587-90 and 593, Gye versus Davies <case>; [(1996) 69 FCR 99] at 102-3. Mr Robertson SC accepted this. Applying that test to the reasoning of Janssen which I have summarised, I am comfortably satisfied that it cannot be said that it is plainly wrong. Indeed, I would respectfully agree with it.

The defendant referred us to dicta and decisions contrary to the position taken in Janssen. I shall not list them. I mean no disrespect when I point out that all of these decisions precede Janssen; none of them addresses the issue in anything like the detail of Janssen; and the only decision directly in point of a judge of a superior court is that of Zeeman J in Gaffney versus Australian Postal Corporation (Supreme Court of Tasmania, 7
November 1991 noted but not fully reported at [(1991) Tas R 379).]
Gaffney was considered in Janssen: its reasoning was addressed, but the decision was not followed.

The only post-Janssen decision in point to which we were taken is
Partridge versus Commonwealth (District Court of New South Wales, Goldring
ADCJ, 18 December 1996). Consistent with the doctrine of precedent laid down in Australian Securities Commission versus Marlborough Goldmines Ltd,
Goldring ADCJ followed Janssen. His Honour was correct to do so.

In my view the following orders should be made:
Answer the separate question in the negative.
Remit the balance of the proceedings to the Common Law Division.

We were informed that no order as to costs is sought, the matter being subject to an agreement between the parties.

BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Mason P. 
SHEPPARD AJA: The question in this appeal is whether it is a condition of an effective election under [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) (Cwth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/)") that there first be a determination by Comcare that compensation is payable under [ss.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or [27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/). [Section 24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) deals with compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment, [s.25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) with the interim payment of compensation, and [s.27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) with compensation for non-economic loss. 
The condition, if it applies, arises under [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) which provides that, where compensation is payable under [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), s.[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) in respect of an injury to an employee and the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a licensed corporation or another employee would, but for subs.44(1) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) be liable for damages for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee as a result of the injury, the employee may, at any time before an amount of compensation is paid to the employee under [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), s.[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) in respect of that injury, elect in writing to institute an action or proceeding against the Commonwealth, or other bodies or persons mentioned in the section, for damages for that non-economic loss. Hereafter I shall use the phrase "the Commonwealth" to include those other bodies or persons.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) provides that, subject to [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html), an action or other proceeding for damages does not lie against the
Commonwealth in respect of injuries sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment, or the loss of, or damage to, property used by an employee resulting from such an injury whether that injury, loss or damage occurred before or after the commencement of the section.

On the face of the section, the right to sue independently of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) does not arise until there has been an election under [s.45.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html)
That view of the meaning of the section was confirmed by the decision of this
Court in Commonwealth of Australia versus Flaviano <case>; [(1996) 40 NSWLR 199.] Furthermore, no such election can be made unless compensation is payable to the employee under one or other of the sections.
The determining authority for the purpose of payment of compensation is
Comcare, the body established by [s.68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s68.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/).
[Section (a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s69.html) provides that, subject to the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/),
Comcare has the function of making determinations in relation to claims and requests made to Comcare under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/); see also [s.74.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s74.html) [Part
VI](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/index.html#p6) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) provides for the reconsideration and review of determinations. Determinations by Comcare under [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), s.[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) are reviewable decisions; see the definitions in [s.60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s60.html) and the provisions of [ss.62](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s62.html), [63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s63.html), [64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s64.html) and [65](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s65.html).
In some circumstances review may be by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The question between the parties is whether [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) requires a determination by Comcare whether compensation under any of the sections is payable in respect of an injury to an employee before an election can be made by the employee and the action commenced. It is the Commonwealth's submission that that is what the section requires.

There are some matters to be noticed about the provisions of the various sections. Firstly, there can be no recovery under [s.25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) unless there is a right to recover under [s.24.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html)
It provides for compensation for injuries resulting in permanent impairment.
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) deals with interim payments of compensation for impairment. No amount is payable pursuant to the section unless Comcare makes a determination that the employee is suffering from a permanent impairment and is satisfied that the degree of impairment is equal to or more than 10 per cent; cf [s.24(7).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) is in a similar category. No compensation is payable for non-economic loss unless the loss is suffered by the employee as a result of the impairment. It ought to be emphasised that each of the sections, [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), s.[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) and s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html), is dealing with non-economic loss. None is dealing with economic loss, compensation for which is provided for elsewhere in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/).
 [Section (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) provides that, subject to [s.25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html), where Comcare determines that the degree of permanent impairment of the employee is less than 10 per cent, no amount of compensation for permanent impairment is payable. So nothing is recoverable under the section unless
Comcare determines that the degree of impairment is not less than 10 per cent.
Furthermore, it is Comcare which determines the degree of permanent impairment; [s.24(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html)
It is to make that determination under the provisions of "the approved Guide".
The approved guide is provided for in [s.28.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) provides that Comcare may, from time to time, prepare a written document to be called the "Guide to the Assessment of the Degree of Permanent Impairment", setting out criteria by reference to which the degree of the permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury shall be determined; criteria by reference to which the degree of non-economic loss suffered by an employee as the result of an injury or impairment shall be determined; and methods by which the degree of permanent impairment and the degree of non- economic loss, as determined under those criteria, shall be expressed as a percentage. Comcare is empowered to vary or revoke the approved guide from time to time. A document prepared by Comcare pursuant to [s.28(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) has no force or effect unless and until approved by the Minister. [Section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) provides that, where Comcare or other bodies including the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal, is required to assess or re-assess or review the assessment or re-assessment of, the degree of permanent impairment of an employee resulting from an injury or the degree of non-economic loss suffered by an employee, the provisions of the approved guide are to be binding on Comcare and the other bodies including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the carrying out of the assessment, re-assessment or review.

The assessment, re-assessment or review is to be made under the relevant provisions of the approved guide. [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) provides that the percentage of permanent impairment or non-economic loss suffered by an employee as the result of an injury ascertained under the methods referred to in [s.28(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) as the methods by which the degree of permanent impairment and the degree of non-economic loss is expressed as a percentage, may be 0 per cent. In such a case, of course, no compensation would be payable because the percentage would be less than 10 per cent.

We were furnished with a copy of the current guide. I have looked at this. I do not find it useful to refer to the detail of it. It is sufficient to say that it deals with the matters specified in [s.28(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) and gives guidance as to percentages of impairment in respect of various types of injuries or collections or injuries.

Despite the facultative way in which [s.28(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s28.html) commences, a guide, if one be prepared and approved by the Minister, is of binding force in relation to the determination of percentage impairments not only on Comcare but also on reviewing bodies including the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal.

When the Bill for the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) was introduced into the House of Representatives, it did not contain [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) or any similar provision. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html) operated, and was intended to operate, to bar absolutely common law actions by employees injured in the course of their employment with the Commonwealth. The intention of the government of the day was made clear in the Minister's second reading speech when he said (Hansard, House of Representatives, 27 April 1988 at 2194) that perhaps the most controversial aspect of the new legislation was that common law actions against the Commonwealth would be replaced by the comprehensive benefits provided for in the Bill. He said that it was clear to the Government that the common law negligence action which based its entitlement on proof of fault was a costly, inefficient and inappropriate mechanism for compensating injured workers. Delays in settling those actions acted as a positive disincentive for employees to return to work and encouraged them to maximise the extent and duration of their injuries. The provision of an adequate level of weekly income, substantially increased lump sum payments on death or impairment, payments for additional expenses for medical costs, aids and appliances and household help combined with a commitment to rehabilitation and the return to suitable employment made redundant any need for redress to the courts. Accordingly, the intention was that it would no longer be possible for an employee to sue the Commonwealth or a fellow employee. Earlier the Minister had said (at 2193), after referring to lump sum compensation for permanent impairment and non-economic loss, that those payments would replace awards of damages at common law for losses of a non-economic nature. A maximum of $80,000 would be payable for injuries which resulted in a permanent impairment and up to $30,000 for non-economic loss.

The Government's mind about abolishing common law rights completely was changed by the debate on the Bill in the Senate. Eventually, a supplementary explanatory memorandum was circulated. It referred to a number of proposed amendments but, importantly for present purposes, it said that the Bill would be amended to provide employees with an election to take either compensation for permanent impairment and non-economic loss under the Bill or to take a common law action for non-economic loss only, subject to an impairment threshold of 10 per cent of the whole person and a monetary limit of $110,000.
The explanatory memorandum said that the amendment provided for the addition of a new section which would allow employees to elect whether to take compensation for permanent impairment (clauses 24 and 25) and non-economic loss (clause 27) or to sue the Commonwealth at common law for non-economic loss only. The word "only" emphasised the fact that there was to be no common law action for economic loss. The explanatory memorandum also said that, where an employee elected to receive compensation under clauses 24, 25 or 27, the employee would forfeit rights to sue at common law for non-economic loss. Once an election was made either way, it was irrevocable. Thus the intention was that, if the common law action failed, the employee would have no right to damages and no right to compensation for impairment or other non-economic loss under the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/).
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) was introduced into the Bill as clause 44A. Reference may be made to Hansard, the Senate, 2 June 1988 at 3477. Clause 44A introduced into the Bill is in terms identical with [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/).
It was intended to give effect to the amendments foreshadowed in the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

It is now appropriate to come directly to [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) and the question which is in issue in this appeal. There are two conditions of an effective election. Firstly, compensation must be payable under [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), s.[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html) in respect of an injury to an employee; secondly, the Commonwealth "would, but for [subsection (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html), be liable for damages for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee as a result of the injury". The election is an election in writing to institute an action or proceeding against the Commonwealth or other specified person or body.

My problem with the plaintiff's approach to the problem is that, on the face of the language of the section, there can be no action until there is an effective election and there can be no effective election unless the conditions provided for in the earlier part of the section are fulfilled. The language of [s.45(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) is such that it will not permit an effective election unless compensation is payable under [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html), s.[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html).
In order to determine whether it is payable under one or other of those sections one has to have regard to them. In my opinion, the stumbling block for the plaintiff's submission is [s.24(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) which provides that, where Comcare determines that the degree of permanent impairment of the employee is less than 10 per cent, an amount of compensation is not payable to the employee under the section. So it is Comcare, subject to the review provided for in the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/), which must determine whether the amount of permanent impairment of the employee is less than 10 per cent. If it does make that determination, no compensation is payable. In that event there can be no compensation under [s.25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s25.html) or s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html).
It follows that [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) cannot, in that event, apply because compensation will not be payable and one of the conditions of an effective election will not be made out. I emphasise that it is necessary for Comcare, not only to determine whether or not there has been a permanent impairment. It must also determine the percentage impairment which has been suffered at least to the extent of determining whether the degree of it is 10 per cent or more. That is not a task which is entrusted to the Court. [Section (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) makes it clear that it is Comcare which has to make the determination.

A second condition of an effective election is provided for in [s.45(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/).
It requires that the Commonwealth would, but for [s.44(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html), be liable for damages for any non-economic loss suffered by the employee as a result of the injury. That is a question which a court in which an action is brought can be determined unless there be some reason why that should not be the case. It is a question which courts are used to dealing with. It would arise in cases where liability was in dispute on the basis that a plaintiff's injuries were not caused by any negligence for which the Commonwealth was responsible. But the position must be one under which the Commonwealth must, but for [s.44(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s44.html), be liable for damages for non-economic loss before a valid election can be made. The election is an election in writing to institute an action. What concerns me is whether the section envisages that a prospective plaintiff who has obtained an appropriate determination by Comcare under paragraph (1)(a) of the section may sue and establish negligence in the action even though a condition of his or her election is that the Commonwealth be liable for damages for non-economic loss.

I think the better view must be that the Court is empowered to determine the matter provided for in paragraph (1)(b) even though it will do so after an employee has made an election. I do not think that there is any other way of making sense of the provision. Comcare is not empowered to make the determination. It must have been envisaged that the Court would make it. As I understand the submissions made by the Commonwealth, that proposition is not in contest, no doubt on the basis that, if an employee claiming damages failed to establish negligence, his or her action would fail. The election would operate, however, so as to prevent the employee from recovering compensation.
Nevertheless, I have asked myself why, if that approach be correct, one ought not one take the further step of concluding that the Court may determine whether compensation is payable under any of the sections in respect of the injury which is in question. My problem about adopting this course is that the clear words of [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) do not permit it.

I am conscious that this is beneficial legislation designed to benefit employees who are injured in the course of their employment. But I am also conscious of the fact that the Minister, speaking to Parliament on behalf of the government of the day, made it clear that the Government was less than enthusiastic about common law actions being brought against the Commonwealth for injuries caused employees in the course of their employment. At first it was decided to bar them altogether. When a limited form of common law action was allowed, it was restricted to actions for non-economic loss; no action for economic loss was to be brought. A limitation of $110,000 was placed upon the amount which could be recovered; [s.45(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html)
That amount was not indexed and remains the same today as it was 10 years ago when the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) came into force. The ceilings imposed by [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s24.html) and s.[27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s27.html), on the other hand, then respectively $80,000 and $30,000, were indexed and have increased periodically since the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) was passed. There is obviously a policy reflected in all this, if not to bar common law actions altogether, then substantially to discourage them. That was
Parliament's intention and the Court should give effect to it. To do so is not to construe beneficial legislation narrowly or in some restricted fashion; rather, it is to give effect to the intention of the government of the day which was adopted by Parliament.

Notwithstanding that that is my view, I must now take into account the effect of the decision of the High Court in Australian Securities Commission v
Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 485] where the Court said (at 492) that, although the considerations applying were somewhat different from those applying in the case of Commonwealth legislation (as to which see Fernando versus Commissioner of
Police [(1995) 36 NSWLR 567)], uniformity of decision in the interpretation of uniform national legislation such as the Corporations Law was a sufficiently important consideration to require that an intermediate appellate court should not depart from an interpretation placed on such legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that that interpretation was plainly wrong.
This of course is Commonwealth legislation which has been interpreted in a number of other cases. The most significant of these for present purposes is the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Janssen versus Commonwealth of
Australia [[1994] 2 Qd R 596.] That case was also concerned with the construction of [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) here. The Queensland Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the word "payable" in paragraph 45(1)(a) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/) did not mean "immediately payable" but referred to liability to pay, subject to compliance with the procedural requirements, including making a claim. That was the essential point relied upon by the appellant in that case. In the way that the matter was approached by counsel for the Commonwealth, that point was not of consequence. The argument put by the Commonwealth, which, subject to what follows, I am disposed to accept, looks rather at the operation of the various sections in the context of an employee wishing to bring a common law claim to recover non-economic loss. In that sense, Janssen does not bear on the matter. The approach I have taken was not considered by the Queensland
Court because it was not relied on. In those circumstances, it would be permissible to depart from Janssen and decide the matter in accordance with the way I would prefer. But Janssen has stood for over 5 years and has no doubt been followed and applied in a number of situations since. For that reason, I am of opinion that Janssen should be followed in the interests of uniformity and comity.

In the result, however, the question of the application of principles such as were propounded in Marlborough is academic. That is because the other members of the Court, whose judgments I have had the opportunity of reading, have concluded that the Commonwealth's submissions should be rejected. I should indicate, however, that, had that not been the case, I would nevertheless have reached the conclusion that the appropriate course to take was that taken by the Queensland Court of Appeal.

Before I conclude I wish to say a word about the problem of the operation of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) which may arise in some cases. The period of limitation is 3 years from the date on which the cause of action first accrues to the plaintiff; [s.18A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s18a.html) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). That is not a particularly long period. It is not difficult to imagine cases in which a prospective plaintiff takes a little time after an injury to decide what course to pursue. On the view I take of the matter, an application must then be made to Comcare for a determination under [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s24.html) and perhaps [s.27.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s27.html)
There is a question how long that process may take. If the applicant is dissatisfied with Comcare's decision, there will then be the question of review which might go as far as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or even the Federal Court, if either party to proceedings in the Tribunal wished to appeal to that Court on a question of law. All that, I confess, makes a prospective plaintiff's course somewhat uncertain and would provide a reason why a construction of the statute should be adopted which would avoid complications arising because of possible problems with the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/). A party out of time may, of course, always approach the Court for an extension of time within which to sue. It may be that this would be the sort of case in which an extension would readily be granted. Nevertheless, a plaintiff able to sue within the limitation period and willing to sue ought not to be troubled about being placed out of time by events which will, at least to a degree, be outside his or her control.

I think one of the problems with this legislation is that, when the Bill went to the House of Representatives, it was the firm intention of those responsible for it that common law actions should be barred. Debate in the
Senate resulted in there being reserved to injured employees a very limited right to sue in certain circumstances. With no disrespect to those responsible for the draft, it seems not unlikely to me that, in the course of the parliamentary process, the ramifications of what was being done were not properly thought through with the consequence that the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/), particularly in [s.45](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/sraca1988368/s45.html), has the problems which both Janssen and this case reveal. The considerations
I have lastly mentioned reinforce me in my view that, despite my approach to the construction of the section, I ought not take a different view from that which was adopted in Janssen.

Accordingly, I would agree with the President that the question should be answered in the negative. I agree in the orders which he proposes.
