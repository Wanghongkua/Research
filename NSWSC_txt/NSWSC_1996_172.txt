Cape Cod Australia P/L versus Palcan P/L [1996] NSWSC 172 (4 June 1996) 
CAPE COD AUSTRALIA PTY LIMITED (ACN: 000 605 407) versus PALCAN PTY LIMITED (ACN: 326 519) /96 
Wednesday 15 May 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
Brownie J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The defendant seeks an adjournment upon the basis that the principal director of the defendant has gone to Italy. The plaintiff objects to that course on the basis that when the matter was last before the Court on 24 April it was known that the principal director of the defendant was about to leave the country the next day. That seems to be true, but the matter was adjourned with a time table that was inappropriate because of an error on the part of the defendant's solicitor.

I understand that the principal director of the defendant is living in the development property although, at the moment, he is overseas.

In all the circumstances it seems to me that I should grant an adjournment and
I adjourn the proceedings until 4 June 1996 before the duty judge.

The plaintiff seeks an order for costs of today. That cannot be resisted. The plaintiff seeks those costs on an indemnity basis. I do not think that is appropriate because the mistake is shown to have arisen through the error of the defendant's solicitor. The costs will be on an ordinary basis.

The defendant seeks to have the plaintiff renew the undertaking as to damages.
The plaintiff resists that. In all the circumstances I do not see how I can properly impose that condition on the plaintiff at this stage. I simply note that the undertaking as to damages lapses today. It will be a matter for the
Duty Judge on 4 June what to do then.

At the moment I order that the proceedings be adjourned until 4 June before the Duty Judge. I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of today. I extend the caveat until and including 4 June 1996.
