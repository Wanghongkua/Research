REGINA v. Desire Patrick PEPIN 
CCA 60298/95 August 1996 
COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
HUNT CJ AT CL, SMART, BADGERY-PARKER JJ 
CATCHWORDS:CONSTRUCTION OF SS.24 & 25 OF [CONFISCATION OF PROCEEDS OF
CRIME ACT ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/) -
AMBIT OF COURT'S DISCRETION 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Dismissed 
HEADNOTE 
Pepin defrauded the victims of about $82,482.16, none of which had been recovered. A pecuniary penalty order was made in that sum under the [Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/).
 
HELD: (1) The court does have a discretion under [s.24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s24.html) whether to make a pecuniary penalty order; 
Normally an order will be made where there has been a conviction of a serious offence, the Crown has made application for a pecuniary penalty and the accused has derived other than a nominal or minimal benefit. Some of circumstances in which an order may not be made outlined; 
Question whether hardship (or substantial hardship) could ever be a relevant consideration under [s.25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) reserved; Hunt CJ at CL being of the opinion that it could not be. In any event, there was no hardship in the present case which would lead to an order not being made; 
As the assets available to meet a pecuniary penalty are often small the parties involved should endeavour to arrive at practical arrangements which would ensure that the assets are not dissipated in costs.

ORDERS
Leave to appeal granted.
Vary the judge's order by deleting the words and figures "[section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) of"; otherwise appeal dismissed.
 
JUDGMENT 
HUNT CJ AT CL: I agree with the orders proposed by Smart J. Except in relation to one matter I agree also with the reasons which he has given for those orders.

I do, however, maintain the view which I expressed in Regina v. Fargher [(1989) 16 NSWLR 67], at 78, that hardship is an irrelevant consideration in deciding whether to impose a pecuniary penalty. But, as Smart J has pointed out, that issue does not arise in this case. It remains yet to be determined.
 
SMART J: Desire Patrick Pepin seeks leave to appeal against an order made by Judge Ducker on 9 May 1995 in these terms: "Pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) of the [Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/) I order the prisoner to pay a pecuniary penalty in the sum of $82,482.16." 
Mr Pepin contends that the judge misdirected himself in law, failed to proceed under the applicable section of the Act and reached a result which was demonstrably wrong.

Application for an order for a pecuniary penalty was made during the sentence proceedings when it was made clear that the amount appeared to be in the order of $80,000. The order was made at the time the judge imposed a custodial sentence.

On the third day of his trial the applicant had pleaded guilty to 20 counts under s.158 of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) of while being a clerk making false entries in a book of his employer, namely, a cheque book.

Between 1989 and 1992 the applicant was employed as financial controller and then general manager of a small family company. He was responsible for the day to day management of the financial affairs of the company, the payment of wages to employees, the payment of the various invoices received by the company and other incidental duties. The charges extended over the period
December 1989 to December 1991.

As to ten counts the judge found that there was direct evidence that the funds of various cheques were paid into one of the applicant's bank accounts or used to pay his credit card commitments. The judge held as to a further five counts that there was no direct evidence as to what happened to the proceeds.

At a later stage the judge observed: "Precisely what he may have done with some of the moneys that were not deposited in his bank accounts I am unable to say." 
As to one count (count 2) the judge did not believe that the evidence supported the guilt of the applicant. The applicant had claimed that the cash proceeds of this cheque had been paid to a nominated man and the judge thought that there may be some substance in this claim. If he had been able to the judge would have allowed the applicant to withdraw his plea. On that count the judge sentenced the applicant to the rising of the court.

The judge concluded that the applicant had perpetrated a systematic course of fraud. The applicant was described as highly manipulative and dishonest. The judge stated: "...over a period of something like two years, the prisoner, in gross breach of trust engaged in a premeditated course of continuing dishonesty against his employer, for which he now shows some signs of self concern but none of contrition." 
The applicant received a relatively lenient sentence comprising of minimum term of 15 months and an additional term of 15 months.

The judge found that the applicant had engaged in dishonest self enrichment of over $80,000. After reviewing the facts at length, assessing the applicant's criminality and imposing the sentence the judge continued: 
There remains the question of the order sought under the [Confiscation of
Proceeds of Crime Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/). I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make such an order. I make all the required findings in accordance with [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) of that Act. The amount involved is $82,485.16" 
There was ample evidence to support the judge's assessment of $82,485.16 as the value of the benefit which the applicant had received. This was not a case where there appeared to be a difference between the amount and the value of the benefit received. I turn now to the challenges to the order.

Erroneous Reference to [s.18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) 
The judge erred in referring to [s18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) of the Act. That section relates to forfeiture orders. The matters considered and findings made under [s18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) of the Act differ from those under [ss24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s24.html) &
[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) which deal with pecuniary penalty orders.

From p4 of the transcript of 11 April 1995 it appears that both counsel and the judge understood that a pecuniary penalty order was being sought and that the amount was about $80,000. During his lengthy evidence on sentence the applicant endeavoured to minimise his misconduct and the amounts he had received. Generally he was unsuccessful. This went to the length of the sentence and the benefits which the applicant had received. Under [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s24.html) &
[25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) of the Act, the value of the benefit derived is a matter of first importance and forms the basis on which an order is made.

What the judge appears to have done is to make an assessment of the amount or value of the benefits received by the applicant by reference to [s25(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) and ordered him to pay that sum. He could not have had regard to the other provisions of [s25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) because there was no relevant evidence or they were inapplicable.
[S.25(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) deals with the case where the defendant received money.

The judge took the steps envisaged in [ss24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s24.html) and [25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) of the Act but mistakenly referred to [s18.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html)
While the judge's remarks on the pecuniary penalty order are very brief it is possible to work out his reasons for making the order.

Upon analysis, the erroneous reference by the judge to [s18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s18.html) is of no consequence.
 
The Nature of the Court's Discretion and its Exercise 
The applicant contended that the court had a general discretion under [s24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s24.html) to make or refuse to make a pecuniary penalty order and that it should have been exercised against the Crown.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s24.html) provides: "(1) If a person has been convicted of a serious offence ... and an application is made under [section (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s13.html) for an order in respect of the offence, the court may: assess, in accordance with [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html), the value of the benefits derived by the person because of having committed the offence; and order the person to pay to the State a pecuniary penalty equal to the value so assessed.

If: property that is the proceeds of the offence has been forfeited under this
Act or a law of the Commonwealth, a Territory or another State; or a forfeiture order is proposed to be made against property that is proceeds of the offence, the pecuniary penalty to be paid shall be taken to be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the property as at the time of the making of the order under this section.

If: a court makes an order under this section in relation to an offence; in calculating the penalty amount, the court took into account a proposed forfeiture order in respect of property; and an appeal against the forfeiture order is allowed or the proceedings for the proposed forfeiture order terminate without the proposed forfeiture order being made, an appropriate officer may apply to the court for a variation of the order to increase the penalty amount by the value of the property and the court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, vary the order accordingly.

An amount payable by a person to the State in accordance with an order made under this section shall, for all purposes, be taken to be a civil debt due by the person to the State.

An order made by a court under this section may be enforced as if it were an order made by the court in civil proceedings instituted by the State against the person to recover a debt due by the person to the State." 
This section recognises that after having made an assessment of the value of the benefits derived in accordance with [s25](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) allowance should be made for the value of any property forfeited and that if an allowance has been made but no order is ultimately made either on appeal or at first instance, the amount of the pecuniary penalty may have to be increased. It is not unimportant that the amount payable under a penalty order is taken to be a civil debt. For example, if the person against whom the order was made became bankrupt, the bankruptcy rules as to payment would apply.
 [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/copoca1989295/s25.html) provides that the value of the benefits derived by the defendant because of having committed a serious offence or serious offences shall be assessed by a court having regard to information before the court concerning all or any of the following: the money or value of property that came into the possession or under the control of the defendant or another person under the direction of the defendant as a result of the commission of the offence; the value of any other benefit that was provided for the defendant or another person under the direction of the defendant, as a result of the commission of the offence; if the offence came under the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), the market value of the substances; the value of the defendant's property before, after and if 2 or more serious offences during the offence period; the defendant's income before, after and, if involving 2 or more serious offences, during the offence period.

This provision enables the court to take a broad approach to assessing the value of the benefits. It may not always be possible to isolate a benefit which may take many forms. Sometimes a benefit may be applied in such a way as to increase the value of existing property such as to procure development consent or cause buildings to be erected. [S.
(2)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) is perhaps no more than the betterment approach used by the Taxation
Department.

In the present case [s25(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) was applicable. There was no evidence which would make the other paragraphs of [s25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) applicable. That will often be the case.
[S.25(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) deals with the more common and straightforward situations.

There is no substance in the complaint that the judge should have directed the applicant's attention to [s25(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html)-(e).
They appeared to have no relevance. A judge is not required to go through a statute and point out to counsel what matters may be of assistance to his client and what evidence might be advantageous.
 [Section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) provides that in calculating the value of benefits any expenses or outgoings of the defendant in connection with the commission of the offences shall not be deducted.

The principal objects of the Act as stated in [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s3.html) include depriving persons of the proceeds and benefits derived from the commission of offences against certain laws of the State.

The Crown, while not contending that the court had no discretion under [s24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s24.html), submitted that there was a very limited discretion to refuse to make an order once a person had been convicted of a serious offence and an application for a pecuniary penalty order had been made.

In discussion with members of the bench during argument, it was appreciated by the Crown that an order may well not be made by a court in the following circumstances: judgment had been obtained by the victim in civil proceedings whether by consent or by default or by a settlement or after a hearing. Doubling up should be avoided; or the accused had restored the property taken or its value to the victim.
Included in this category would be restitution or payment made on behalf of the accused by his relatives; or the property taken was of little or no value, even though there had been an armed robbery or the offence of break, enter and steal; or the accused was destitute or seriously disabled so that any order would be useless. There was also the case where the accused was bankrupt with no assets, large liabilities and no prospect of being able to meet even a part of an order. If there was a suggestion of substance that the accused had not disclosed all his assets or income or that an investigation into the accused's financial position should take place later an order would probably be made.

If an accused (or relatives on his behalf) had made partial restitution that would affect the amount of any order.

There could also be cases where the value of any property forfeited was so substantial and so covered any benefit derived that it would be unjust to make a pecuniary penalty order.

One of the benefits of the procedure under the Act is that it avoids separate civil proceedings when the issues (or most of them) have already been canvassed in the criminal proceedings.

In R versus Ashworth [(1991) 56 A Crim R 122]
Macrossan CJ considered ss13 & 14 of the Queensland Crimes (Confiscation of Profits) Act 1989. It was a drug trafficking case. After a helpful review the Chief Justice said at 128: 
It may be accepted that s13(1) gives the court a discretion to decide whether it will make the assessment when an order is sought "in respect of the benefits derived by the person as the result of committing the offence." The word "may" which is used in the subsection can be understood as a true permissive "may". However, once the value of the benefits has been assessed and the decision made to order payment of a pecuniary penalty then it is the assessed value (with two exceptions not relevant in the present case) which must be ordered to be paid. There is no further discretion after the assessment has been made to order that part only of the assessed value shall be paid by way of penalty.

Section 13 of the Queensland Act is cast in somewhat different terms from s24 of the NSW Act. S. 13, for example, provides that the court order the person to pay to the Crown a pecuniary penalty equal to the value assessed less the value of any property forfeited and any amounts payable by way of restitution or compensation.

Having regard to the terms and structure of ss24 and 25 I would be inclined to regard s24(1) as involving two processes which are closely linked. If no benefits were derived no order would be made. I would prefer to avoid fine distinctions. If full restitution has been made should that, for example, be deducted from the value of the benefit derived so as to result in a nil benefit or by the court declining to make an order? What would be the position with partial restitution? There is no point in pursuing these matters too far.
With the composite approach required the ultimate result is what is important.

I am of the opinion that while the court does have a discretion under s24(1) of the Act it will normally be exercised in favour of making an order where there has been a conviction of a serious offence, the Crown has made application for a pecuniary penalty order and the accused has derived other than a nominal or minimal benefit. Some of the circumstances in which an order may not be made have been already outlined. They include where the benefit derived has been returned, a civil judgment has already been obtained and there is no point in entering a second order for the same amount under s24 which has a civil operation. In none of the cases mentioned is the object of the Act being thwarted or defeated - the benefits of crime are not being retained. There may be other cases where the discretion would be exercised not to make an order. I do not pretend to be able to envisage all the various possibilities. However, they are likely to be cases where the accused has not retained or will not be retaining the proceeds of crime or the value of the property forfeited far exceeds the extent of any benefit derived.

The applicant submitted that this court should take into consideration the hardship suffered by the applicant and his family. The essence of that claim was that the applicant and his family would lose their home and it would be difficult to provide another. The applicant and his wife purchased a property at St Clair for $157,000. They used the proceeds of sale of a block of land at
Greystones as a deposit and borrowed the remainder, executing a mortgage over their home. They had a girl and a boy.

Repayments were said to be $1544 to $1584 per month. The repayments came out of a joint account into which his salary and her salary were paid. Once the applicant lost his job the wife was struggling to make ends meet. The information placed before the judge as to the financial situation of Mr and
Mrs Pepin was meagre. That may have been because counsel for Pepin thought, and correctly so, that it would not enable Mr Pepin to avoid a pecuniary penalty order.

Before this court the applicant sought to rely on his affidavit of 3 October annexing statements of his assets and liabilities as at 25 July 1995. The material in this affidavit was not placed before the judge. No explanation was offered for this failure. It is hard to see how the evidence was admissible on the application before this court when it had not but could have been adduced at the trial. I do not know if the statements as to value and mortgage indebtedness were correct. These are not matters to be litigated for the first time on appeal. The affidavit makes no difference anyhow to the result of this appeal.

However, I propose to refer to it briefly as part of the basis of a number of observations.

The affidavit asserted that the house was estimated to be worth $165,000 and that there was a mortgage of $145,000. On these figures the applicant and his wife had an interest of small economic value in the house. If sales and associated costs are deducted that value is even less. As their home the house has considerable value to the family.

Even if hardship were a legitimate consideration (a matter to which I will return) it could not be successfully relied upon to resist a pecuniary penalty order in the present case. The applicant, having received benefits exceeding $82,000, of which nothing has been re-paid, can hardly complain if a pecuniary penalty order is made as a result of which he loses his home and his other assets required to satisfy that order. The applicant has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation of what happened to the moneys he took.

In R versus Fargher [16 NSWLR 67] the Court of Criminal Appeal was divided on the relevance of hardship. Roden J thought that hardship could be a relevant consideration.
Hunt J was unable to see how hardship could be a relevant consideration in deciding whether to impose a pecuniary penalty. He was much influenced by hardship having to be considered under s18 and no mention of it in s24. Allen
J thought that no question of substantial hardship arose and that the question of whether such substantial hardship was relevant was better left to be determined when, if ever, a case occurs in which such hardship is demonstrated.

I can envisage cases of exceptional hardship where a court might pause. Assume a father who was on an invalid pension with no assets (apart from a little cheap furniture) living in a Housing Commission flat stole $5,000 and used it to buy medicines and special food for a very sick child. Would a court make a pecuniary penalty order in those circumstances? As earlier indicated the question of hardship in the present case would not lead to an order not being made.

For the future I hope that the parties in this and other cases will take a practical approach. The applicant will probably be made bankrupt in due course and the Trustee will seek to have the house sold and to recover any monies payable to the applicant. The equity is small and it is not unlikely, if that happens, that costs of various kinds will consume most if not all of that equity. This may be avoided if the wife and her relatives are able to buy out the share of the husband which will probably not be worth very much. I do not overlook that the Federal Court in exercising its bankruptcy jurisdiction may make an order for payment by instalments for a period. With a man just released from prison his ability to make payments may be limited. His first and difficult task will be to obtain employment.

It is desirable that the parties agree on some practical and realistic arrangement. The appeal to this court has helped no one.

The application for leave to appeal should be granted and the words and figures "section 18 of" should be deleted from the judge's order. Otherwise the appeal should be dismissed.
 
BADGERY-PARKER, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Smart J. and in general, with the reasons which he has given for those orders. I would wish to reserve until a case where a decision upon it is necessary the question whether or not hardship is a relevant consideration in deciding whether to impose a pecuniary penalty.
