WEDNESDAY, 1 DECEMBER 2010  /305598 DAPHNE LOWE & ORS versus AUSTRALIAN CHINESE COMMUNITY
ASSOCIATION OF NSW INC. (NO. 2) 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: This is my second judgment involving the internal affairs of the Australian Chinese Community Association of NSW Inc ("the Association"). The three plaintiffs, who are all members of the defendant Association, applied on 10 September 2010 for interlocutory relief to restrain the holding of a Special General Meeting of the Association scheduled for the following Sunday, 12 September 2010 and for other associated relief. I granted an interlocutory injunction on 10 September restraining the defendant Association from acting on certain resolutions of its Executive Committee made on 11 August 2010 (1) that the plaintiffs be expelled as members of the defendant, and (2) to hold a Special General Meeting to ratify or revoke the Executive Committee resolution to expel the plaintiffs from membership: Daphne Lowe versus Australian Chinese Community Association of NSW  <case> The 10 September hearing only dealt with issues relating to the taking of steps to expel the plaintiffs from membership. Those issues were only dealt with on an interlocutory basis. I asked the parties on that occasion whether they wished for the matter to be dealt with as a final hearing. Both parties pressed upon the Court their desire to have the matter heard on an interlocutory basis. That is the basis on which the matter was argued and decided on 10 September 2010. After my interlocutory judgment the parties agreed that I should continue to hear the evidence on a final hearing.  The issues for final hearing overlap with the issues at the interlocutory hearing to the extent they concern the validity of steps to expel the plaintiffs from membership of the Association. Principally these steps relate to an Executive Committee meeting of the Association of 11 August 2010. There are two other issues for final hearing. The first concerns a resolution of the
Executive Committee on 3 July 2010 suspending two of the plaintiffs, the first and third plaintiffs, from their positions on the Executive Committee of the
Association. The second concerns the question of damages.  In this final judgment I grant final relief restraining the defendant
Association from acting on the Executive Committee resolutions of 11 August to expel the plaintiffs from membership. I further grant relief restraining the defendant Association from acting on the Executive Committee resolutions of 3 July 2010 suspending the first and third plaintiffs from their positions on the Executive Committee. I decline to award damages to the plaintiffs against the Association.
 
The Plaintiffs, the Association and a Petition Some background about the relationships between the various parties to these proceedings is useful. This background is taken in large part from the account given in my first judgment.
 The first plaintiff, Ms Daphne Lowe, is a life member of the defendant
Association and has been a member for some 27 years. She is presently its honorary secretary but the Executive Committee passed a resolution suspending her from the duties of this position on 3 July 2010. This is one of the resolutions that the plaintiffs challenge at this final hearing.  The second plaintiff, Dr Anthony Pun is a former President of the
Association. He held office as President during the years 1989 to 1992. The third plaintiff, Ms Maggie Wu is a member of the Executive Committee of the defendant Association. She was elected to that position on 9 August 2009. She too has been suspended from the duties of that position pending the outcome of this dispute.
 The defendant was formed in 1974 to serve and promote the interests of the
Chinese community in Australia and to foster the other related objectives set out in its [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
These objectives include the promotion of understanding between Australians of
Chinese descent and other Australians. The Association has approximately 1,000 financial members including life members.
 The wider events that led to the plaintiffs seeking to restrain the holding of the Special General Meeting on Sunday, 12 September 2010 first arose in
February this year. But the specific events relating to the proposed meeting commence in early July 2010 when a petition came to the attention of the defendant.  The petition is written partly in English and partly in Chinese characters.
The English version of the petition in evidence is a complete translation of the Chinese characters that also appear in the document, apart from the characters constituting petitioners' names and signatures. The petition relates to the three plaintiffs. It is short and is reproduced below exactly as it is printed: "We the undersigned members of ACCA, observe Mr Anthony Pun, Ms Daphne
Lowe, and Ms Maggie Wu, have created confusions, attempted to usurper the legal position of ACCA and damaged and harmonious of ACCA undermined ACCA's reputation. Their misdemeanours critically impacted and affected ACCA normal activities and services. Then, they do not listen to the advices, are obdurate and hell bent on it." The petition gives no more detail of the conduct against which it is directed than is set out in the words immediately above. The petition goes on to request a Special General Meeting of the defendant Association to be convened to consider, and if thought fit, to pass resolutions that: "(1) in accordance with clause 18.2 of the ACCA [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) that Ms Daphne Lowe be removed as the secretary of the ACCA, and in accordance with clause 18.2 of the ACCA [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) Ms
Maggie Wu be removed as a member of the Executive Committee." The petition bears many of the usual characteristics of a petition. It is actually a collection of separate documents, bundled together, each of which was likely to have been presented individually to potential signatories for signature. Some of the signatories have signed, placed their Association membership numbers and their signatures on the document. Others have merely signed the document and not spelled out their name in addition to placing their signature on the document.
 Ms Lowe says that on 22 July 2010 she attended the offices of the defendant and checked the names on the petition against the names of the members on the members' register. Her evidence now at final hearing is that of all the names on the petition fewer than 50 are financial members of the Association. That evidence was advanced at the interlocutory hearing. It remains unanswered by the defendant at the final hearing and I find that 50 financial members of the
Association did not sign the petition.
 In response to the petition the Executive Committee of the defendant held a meeting on 3 July 2010 in Surry Hills. A number of matters were dealt with at that 3 July meeting. In form the petition sought action under Rule 18.2 of the
Association Rules, which empowers a general meeting to remove a member of the
Executive Committee before the expiration of the member's term of office. The
Executive Committee also regarded the petition as a basis to activate Rule 8 of the Association's Rules relating to the Disciplining of Members. The
Executive Committee resolved to allow the plaintiffs each to make submissions under [Rule .2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.2.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), a rule relating to the Discipline of Members. The resolution for example for Ms
Lowe was in the following terms: "Resolved that Daphne Lowe be given 14 days to make a submission to EXCO regarding the petition in accordance with clause .2 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Moved by Raymond Cheung, seconded by Rong Mu Dong". The resolutions allowing the other plaintiffs to make submissions in response to the petition were in similar terms.
 The 3 July Executive Committee meeting also resolved to suspend Ms Lowe from her position as honorary secretary and from all other positions within the defendant Association, pending her response to the petition. The resolution was, "Resolved that with immediate effect that Daphne Lowe be suspended from her position as the Hon. Secretary as well as all other positions within ACA pending her response to the petition." Moved by Raymond
Cheung, seconded by Rong Mu Dong." A similar resolution was passed suspending
Ms Wu from her position as an Executive Committee member pending her response to the petition.
 The effect of the 3 July Executive Committee meeting, therefore, was that
Ms Lowe and the other plaintiffs were given 14 days to make a submission to the Executive Committee in relation to the petition. In the meantime Ms Lowe and Ms Wu were suspended from their executive roles. The document upon which the Executive Committee acted is described throughout these minutes as a "petition". It is mostly described this way in the subsequent correspondence that the Association sent to the plaintiffs.
 The Executive Committee acted on this resolution. On 6 July 2010 the
Association sent a letter to Ms Lowe referring to the Executive Committee's resolution of 3 July and asking for submissions in the following terms: "Please be advised that at the Executive Committee meeting held on 3 July the following resolution was adopted- 'That, in accordance with clause 8.2 (b) pf the Objects and Rules of ACCA,
Ms. Daphne Lowe is asked to make submission to the Executive Committee in connection with the complaints from members of the Jung Sing Association and a petition received from ACCA members'.

An Executive Committee meeting is scheduled to be held on 24 July 3020 to consider any submission made by you in accordance with clause 8.2 (c)of the
Objects and Rules of ACCA. Under clause 8.3 of same if the Executive Committee is satisfied the facts alleged in the complaint have been proven it could consider calling a SGM for the purpose of removing you as a life member of
ACCA.

Accordingly, your submissions addressing the allegations raised in the petition, should reach ACCA office no later than 22 July 2010." Ms Lowe responded to the 3 July 2010 letter enclosing the petitions. She took many points in her response. As was the situation at the interlocutory hearing it is not necessary for me to set all her points out. The plaintiffs' counsel have relied in argument on the more significant of them. After setting out the terms of the petition Ms Lowe said: "4 (iii) In addition, there is no evidence to support the alleged complaints.

Both petitions make the following allegations: ...
 
No supporting evidence or facts are stated for any of the allegations made: * have created confusion (what confusion have I created?) * attempted to usurper the legal position of ACCA (how, when and what legal position am I attempting to 'usurper'?) * damaged the stability and harmonious of ACCA (how and when was this damage done to the stability and 'harmonious ; if ACCA?) * undermined ACCA's reputation (how? In fact I believe these petitions and other unconstitutional actions is what is undermining ACCA's reputation) * their misdemeanours critically impacted and affected ACCA normal activities and services (what are these misdemeanours and how did they affect
ACCA's normal activities and services?) * they do not listen to the advices (what advices and from whom?) * are obdurate and hell-bent on it. (on what?)" Dr Pun, the second plaintiff, supported Ms Lowe in her response to the petition. Doctor Pun made similar points to those argued by Ms Lowe.  These letters did not result in the Association providing to the plaintiffs more detailed particulars of any complaint about the plaintiffs. Instead, an
Executive Committee meeting was held on 11 August 2010 to consider the petitions under an agenda item "SGM petitions and related matters". The
Executive Committee resolved at this meeting that the replies of each of the plaintiffs "be considered as unsatisfactory". The 11 August 2010 Executive
Committee meeting then resolved to expel the plaintiffs from the defendant
Association in the following terms: "Resolved that Anthony Pun, Daphne Lowe and Maggie Wu be expelled from
ACCA and a Special General Meeting be called to either ratify or revoke the resolution of the Executive Committee to expel them.
 
Moved by Raymond Cheung, seconded by Rong Mu Dong, Mimi Kwok voted against the resolution." The same meeting further resolved to suspend Ms Lowe and Ms Wu from their participation in the affairs of the Association pursuant to Rule 8.3(c), pending the holding of the Special General Meeting. That resolution was in the following terms, "Resolved that the duties of Anthony Pun, Daphne Lowe and
Maggie Wu within ACCA be suspended in accordance with clause 8.3c of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Moved by Rong Mu Dong, seconded by Yong Quan Cong." A supplementary resolution was passed at this same meeting that made it clear just what suspension of their duties meant in the circumstances, "Resolved that the
General Manager be instructed to write to Anthony Pun, Daphne Lowe and Maggie
Wu to request for the return of ACCA properties and to ask them to refrain from making representations on behalf of ACCA. Moved by Rong Mu Dong, seconded by Yong Quan Cong." Suspension meant that they were not to do anything that would involve the handling of the documents of the Association or acting on its behalf in any way.  A Special General Meeting was planned to ratify the resolutions to expel the plaintiffs. A few days later on 16 August 2010 a formal notification of the meeting to be held on Sunday 12 September 2010 was sent to the plaintiffs.
The notice of that meeting identified the proposed resolutions to remove
Executive Committee members and to expel the plaintiffs as members. The form of these resolutions, so far as they concerned the plaintiff and Ms Wu, were: "Resolution 1: 
That in accordance with clause 18.2 of the ACCA constitution Ms. Daphne
Lowe be removed as the Honorary Secretary of ACCA.
 
Resolution 2 
That in accordance with clause 18.2 of the ACCA constitution Ms Maggie Wu be removed as a member of the Executive Committee.

Resolution 4: 
That in accordance with the ACCA constitution Ms. Daphne Lowe be expelled as a life member of ACCA.
 
Resolution 5 
That in accordance with the ACCA [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) Ms
Maggie Wu be expelled as a member of the ACCA." A similar resolution was proposed for the expulsion of Dr Pun as a life member of the defendant Association.  This sufficiently sets out the history leading to both the interlocutory hearing on 10 September and the final hearing. Mr J.D. Smith appeared for the plaintiffs at the interlocutory hearing. Mr G.E.S. Ng appeared for the plaintiffs for the final argument. Mr Stomo appeared for the defendant throughout.
 After the grant of the interlocutory relief the parties again appeared before the Court on 16 September 2010. I directed the defendant on that occasion to notify the plaintiffs and the Court by 24 September whether the defendant had any objection to my hearing the balance of the proceedings in light of the publication of the reasons for decision in the interlocutory hearing: Daphne Lowe versus Australian Chinese Community Association of NSW Inc.  <case> No objection was taken my continuing to deal with the matter at a final hearing. The plaintiffs filed written submissions for the final determination of the matter on 1 October 2010. The defendant filed its written submissions for the final hearing on 12 October 2010. On 15 October 2010 the parties indicated that they did not wish to have a further oral hearing but were content for the matter to be dealt with on the existing evidence and the further written submissions filed. I reserved judgment on 15 October 2010.
 
The Issues and the Rules of the Association The issues presented for consideration for final hearing have already been identified: (1) issues concerning the validity of the resolution passed on 11
August to convene a Special General Meeting and to expel the plaintiffs as members; (2) issues relating to the suspension of Ms Lowe and Ms Wu from their positions on the Executive Committee of the Association; and, (3) damages issues. The plaintiffs put these issues in several ways. It is not necessary to consider all of them. I will generally deal with these issues under these headings. But first it is necessary to examine the rules of the Association relating to the disciplining of members.
 [Rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.html) of the defendant's constitution entitled "Disciplining of Members" relevantly provides:  .0 Disciplining of Members .1 A complaint may be made to the Executive Committee by any member of the 
Association that some other member (referred to in this Rule as the "member concerned"):- has persistently refused or neglected to comply with a provision or provisions of the Act of these rules; or has persistently and willfully acted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the Association.
 .2 On receiving such a complaint, the Executive Committee:- shall cause notice of the complaint to be served on the member concerned; and shall give the member concerned at least fourteen (14) days from the time the notice is served within which to make submissions to the Executive
Committee in connection with the complaint; and shall take into consideration any submissions made by the member in connection with the complaint.
 .3 If the Executive Committee is satisfied the facts alleged in the complaint have been proved and proposes to expel the member concerned by resolution, then the Executive Committee: shall call a Special General Meeting which must be convened within twenty-eight (28) days of the notice referred to in sub-rule (b) to either ratify or revoke the resolution of the Executive Committee to expel the member concerned; shall notify the member concerned of the proposed resolution to expel him, her or it, and of the date, place and time of the Special General
Meeting to be called pursuant to sub-rule (a); may suspend the member concerned from participation in the affairs of the Association pending the Special General Meeting to be called pursuant to sub- rule (a).
 .4 At the Special General Meeting called pursuant to rule 8.3: no business other than the proposed expulsion of the member concerned shall be transacted; the member who made the complaint, the Executive Committee and the member concerned must be given the opportunity to state their respective cases both orally or in writing, or both; if the member who made the complaint or the member concerned wish to distribute prior to or at the Special General Meeting written representations then they shall prepare and distribute such written representations at his, her or its own cost; member entitled to vote at the Special General Meeting shall vote by secret ballot; the expulsion of the member concerned shall be only take effect if the
Special General Meeting ratifies by Special Resolution, the resolution of the
Executive Committee to expel the member concerned.
 The constitution of the defendant Association including its rules operates as a contract as between the parties. Associations Incorporations Act <case> and Goodwin versus Vietnam Veteran Motor Cycle Club Australia [(2008) 74 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282008%29%2074%20NSWLR%20224 "View LawCiteRecord" ), at 232 paragraph [38]. The plaintiffs rely in these proceedings upon that contractual relationship as the foundation of their claim for equitable relief and the Court's intervention: Hawick versus Flegg [(1958) 75 WN 255.]
Rules concerning the procedures for dismissal of a person from membership should be strictly complied with: Goodwin versus Vietnam Veteran Motor Cycle Club
Australia [(2008) 74 NSWLR 224], at 232 paragraph [43].
 
Rule 8 and the 11 August 2010 Executive Committee meeting The plaintiffs' submit that the petition does not qualify as a "complaint" within clause 8.1 of the rules. The complaint as conveyed in the form of the petition is said to be so vague and uncertain that it simply does not qualify on that ground to be described as a "complaint". It is impossible to determine whether or not Rule 8.1(a) and (b) have been complied with and the petition also cannot be a "complaint" within Rule 8.  The petition does not define with any precision the alleged conduct which might show a contravention of Rule 8.1 that the plaintiffs' have "persistently refused or neglected to comply with a provision or provisions of the Act or of these rules (Rule 8.1(a))" or "wilfully acted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the Association (Rule 8.1(b))" such that the petition will be a "complaint" within Rule 8.1.
 The petition does not in my view qualify as a Rule 8.1 "complaint". Looking at the first paragraph of the petition, it is impossible to discern: to what specific conduct it relates; on what occasions that conduct is said to have occurred such that it might be said the member "persistently refused and neglected" to comply with the Associations Incorporations Act or the Rules (see for example Randazzo versus New South Wales Sport Aircraft Club <case> [23] - <case>; and, what particular aspects of that conduct are alleged to be "prejudicial to the interests of the Association". Any person receiving such a document would be unlikely to understand exactly what he or she was alleged to have done to attract action under Rule 8.1. It would be difficult for a member to organise any reasoned defence against expulsion faced with such limited material.
 The Executive Committee describes the document as "a petition". It appears that that is exactly the way that it has been framed, rather than as a "complaint" warranting action under Rule 8. Indeed when the petition was sent on by the Executive Committee to the plaintiffs it was sent not with further particulars, but with the exact covering words: "Please find enclosed the petition received in relation to complaint about your conduct and a request for a Special General Meeting for your removal as a life member of the ACCA".
 No attempt appears to have been made to turn the vague expressions in the petition into defined particulars of the allegations of relevant misconduct.
The letters in response from Dr Pun and Ms Lowe asked the very questions that any reasonable reader of the petition sent by the letter of 6 July would ask.
Ms Lowe's response has already been set out. These petition documents in my view give no relevant information about alleged misconduct of the plaintiffs, do not qualify as a "complaint" within Rule 8 and cannot be acted on by the
Executive Committee. I accept the plaintiffs' submission that the petition does not disclose a persistent or wilful course of conduct on the part of the plaintiffs.
 A resolution was passed on 11 August 2010 to convene the meeting on Sunday, September 2010. Ms Lowe was in no position to prepare for that meeting on the material that she had. Ms Lowe says that she has been denied procedural fairness and that the defendant was acting in contravention of its own Rule 8.
Both of these Ms Lowe submits may be restrained by injunctive relief. The defendant sought to answer that by relying upon [Associations Incorporation
Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s20.html) which provides: "(1) An association's constitution may contain an express restriction on, or a prohibition of, the association's exercise of any of its powers, but the exercise of a power by the association is not invalid merely because it is contrary to such a restriction or prohibition.
 
An act of an association is not invalid merely because it is contrary to or beyond the association's objects." The defendant submits that [Associations Incorporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s20.html) means that the defendant's relevant exercise of its power to expel a member is not invalidated, merely because the defendant does not comply with particular prohibitions or restrictions in [Rule .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.html) But as I also explained in my interlocutory judgment in my view, [Associations Incorporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s20.html) is not an answer to the plaintiffs' first contention for two reasons. First, it does not take account of cases such as Goodwin versus Vietnam Veteran Motor Cycle
Club Australia <case>; [(2008) 72 NSWLR 224], at 232 paragraph [43], which require strict compliance with the rules of expulsion of members of such Associations, rules that may not readily be classified as containing a "restriction or prohibition". Secondly, the defendant's claimed use of [Associations Incorporation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s20.html) does not give adequate emphasis to the word "merely" in the section, which shows that the provision is not designed to address all the possible circumstances that may produce invalidity. The defendant's submissions on final hearing has not displaced this view.
 Mr Stomo at final hearing has again referred the Court to the decision of
Young J (as his Honour then was) in the The Bodalla Company Pty Limited v
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Supreme Court of NSW, 6 December 1988,
BC8801258. He submits that I should follow the approach taken by Young J in Bodalla and allow this meeting to proceed, even though there may have been breaches of the rules of the association in the calling of the meeting. He says "the question should be left to the general members who after all controlled the Association".
 In my view, as I said in my interlocutory judgment, in Bodalla Company
Young J was not dealing with the situation, which obtains here with the particular rule that apply here. A deliberate structure appears to have been created in the defendant Association's rules in [Rule .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.1.html) to [8.3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.3.html) to require its Executive Committee to take preliminary steps before calling any general public meeting. Those preliminary steps involve considering the content of the complaint made, and measuring it against the Rules and the interests of the Association. Then the structure requires the person complained about to be put in a position to exercise the right to respond to that complaint to the Executive Committee before having to deal with it in a public forum. Finally, before acting publicly the Executive Committee should be "satisfied that the facts alleged in the complaint have been proved": [Rule .3.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.3.html)
The rules in issue in Bodalla's case did not require any such preliminary consideration of a complaint by the Executive. In my view, the Bodalla case is not an answer to the plaintiffs' claim that it has an arguable case to require the defendant's Executive Committee to do its duty according to the
Association's Rules before exposing the plaintiff's to an Executive Committee sanctioned public meeting.
 There is another defect in the Executive Committee resolution of 11 August
A decision to deal with the plaintiffs' expulsion as a group was taken in the Executive Committee resolution on 11 August 2010. Ms Lowe and the other plaintiffs say that the proposal to consider all those resolutions at the same meeting is a contravention of [Rule .4(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.4.html) of the Rules. In my view, as I said in my interlocutory judgment, it is such a contravention. [Rule .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.4.html) achieves some important purposes in the management of expulsions from incorporated associations. Where such a Rule is adopted it ensures that expulsion from clubs cannot occur en masse. It arguably ensures that the position of individual members facing expulsion is not too simply identified with the position of other members also facing expulsion. The Rule means that the circumstances of each member are separately and seriously considered at a meeting considering expulsion. [Rule .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.4.html) also has the advantage of ensuring that members who wish to speak in favour of other members being proposed for expulsion can do so without being tainted at the same time by defending their own proposed expulsion. In my view, [Rule .4(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.4.html) serves those objectives, which are important rights of members. None of the defendants submissions at final hearing present a compelling view to the contrary.
 The resolutions proposed on 11 August for the 12 September meeting would have contravened [Rule .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.4.html) in several ways. Resolutions 3, 4 and 5 propose the expulsion of three persons, Ms Lowe, Dr Pun and Ms Wu, at the one meeting. Resolutions 1 and 2 proposed the removal of Ms Lowe as the honorary secretary and Ms Wu as a member of the Executive Committee at the same meeting as the proposed expulsions. In my view, as I said in my interlocutory judgment, both the proposal of multiple expulsion resolutions and the proposal of business relating to the Executive Committee and the secretaryship are other "business" that if conducted, in addition to a single expulsion, would contravene [Rule .4(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.4.html) 
Validity of the Suspension Resolution The plaintiffs also challenge the Executive Committee Resolutions of 3 July suspending Ms Lowe and Ms Wu from their positions either as officer bearers in the Association or member of its Executive Committee pending their response to the petition. The plaintiffs' contention is that there is no power in the Executive Committee to suspend it own members from holding office. The plaintiffs' contention is that this lack of power is reinforced by the content of [rule .3(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.3.html) which creates a limited power of suspension within the context of the decision making process contemplated by [rule .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s8.html) The plaintiffs' argument for the invalidity of the suspension resolution proceeds from a consideration of [rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s12.html), [13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s13.html), [15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s15.html) and [18](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aia2009307/s18.html).
Officer bearers of the Association including a President, the Honorary
Treasurer, the Honorary Secretary and three Vice Presidents are provided for by rule 15.1 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
Rule 15.2 provides that the Executive Committee shall elect among themselves the positions of the three Vice Presidents, Honorary Assistant Treasurer and
Honorary Assistant Secretary.  [Rule .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s12.1.html) provides that "The management of the Association shall be vested in the
Executive Committee" which "shall be elected at the Annual General Meeting and shall consist of (a) the office bearers of the Association; and (b) fourteen other committee members." A combined reading of [rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s15.html) and [12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s12.html) makes clear that the positions of President, Honorary Treasurer and Honorary
Secretary are all directly elected by the Association in General Meeting and not elected by the Executive Committee itself.
 Rule 13.1 provides for the term of office of all Executive Committtee members including these officer bearers. Rule 13.1 provides:- "Each member of the Executive Committee shall, subject to these rules, hold office until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting following the date of the members' election or appointment, but shall be eligible for re- election." But the Executive Committee members' term of office may be terminated prior to the next Annual General Meeting. Rule 13.1 must be read subject to rule .2 which provides for removal of a member of the Executive Committee before the expiration of the members' term of office:- "The Association in General Meeting may by Ordinary Resolution remove any member of the Executive Committee before the expiration of the member's term of office and may by resolution appoint another eligible member to hold office until the expiration of the term of office so removed." The plaintiffs' submission is that the cumulative effect of these provisions is that members of the Executive Committee are to hold office for a period between Annual General Meetings of the Association subject only to the possibility of removal by the Association in General Meeting.
 I agree with the plaintiffs' submission. There are two reasons why it should be inferred that the Executive Committee does not have the power of suspension of a member from the Executive Committee, a power which the
Executive Committee is assuming here.
 First, it is inconsistent with the structure of the rules of the
Association, which make Executive Committee members accountable to a General
Meeting. The structure of the rules means that all Association members know who will be leading and managing the organisation between General Meetings.
Committee Members in my view cannot be unseated (or the practical equivalent by wholly suspending them from their duties) by actions within the Committee contrary to the wishes that were last expressed in General Meeting. The setting of the term of office by rule 13.1 and the precise regime for removal of a Committee member by rule 18.2 all point to the continuation of Executive
Committee members in office and the maintenance of the integrity of their positions subject only to their submission to the will of the General Meeting.
 Second, the express conferral of a power of suspension within the [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.html) decision making process by [rule .3(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.3.html) contemplates that where a power of suspension exists in the Executive
Committee that it will be expressly identified in the rules as it is in [rule .3(c).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.3.html)
The limited power of suspension from the privileges of membership is conditioned by [rule .3(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.3.html) upon the Executive Committee being satisfied that the facts alleged within (in that case a complaint) are proved. Suspension from office to which a General
Meeting elects a person is a serious act that may have consequences for the individual that are comparable to suspension from membership. It should be inferred that the rules' failure to provide for a mechanism for suspension from membership of the Executive Committee equivalent to [rule .3(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.3.html) for expelling a member indicates that there is no such power of suspension invested in the Executive Committee.
 I agree with the plaintiff's submission that the suspension resolution was accordingly invalid. The defendant's arguments in response that the Executive
Committee is merely exercising a discretion entrusted to it and conducting its affairs as it sees fit fails in my view to address the effect of the rules to deprive the Executive committee of the power to do this particular act which is expressly entrusted to the Association in General Meeting.
 The plaintiffs put an alternative argument that even if the Executive
Committee did possess a power to suspend its own members that it did not exercise that power in accordance with its own procedures on this occasion.
 On its face the suspension resolution is based upon the Executive
Committee's consideration of the petition. The plaintiffs' point is that the petition could not have been received and considered by the Executive
Committee by any process recognised by the rules. The 3 July suspension resolution was consequently the culmination of a course of enquiry upon which the Executive Committee had no power to embark. And the plaintiffs say the invalidity of that course of enquiry taints the validity of the suspension resolution.
 The procedural steps that were not followed were said to be the following.
The petition was said to have been lodged pursuant to rule 21.1 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) which provides as follows:- "Special General Meetings shall be called by the Honorary Secretary at the written request of at least four (4) members of the Executive Committee or at the written request of not less than fifty (50) members entitled to vote, within fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt of the request, except where the Executive Committee resolves that the businesses scandalous, frivolous or vexatious." The petition did not comply with rule 21.1 in several ways. It was not a written request of 50 members entitled to vote. The petition did not go through the Honorary Secretary, Ms Lowe herself; rather it was tabled at the
Meeting of the Executive Committee on 3 July 2010. I accept the plaintiffs' submission that the petition could not validly have been received and considered by the Executive Committee as a prelude to suspension of one of its members otherwise than by [rule .3(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.3.html) because of its non compliance with rule 21.1.
 The defendant says in response that it was not necessary for the Executive
Committee to consider the petition before passing the suspension resolution.
But it has not been demonstrated what material the suspension resolution was based other than the petition.  
Denial of Procedural Fairness The plaintiffs also contend that they had been denied procedural fairness.
They put this contention two ways. They first submit they have not been given an adequate opportunity to present their cases to the Executive committee before the Special General Meeting was called. The plaintiffs relied in support of this argument on much of the same material that was advanced under their earlier contention.
 Depending on the precise form of the rules of an association, if a Special
General Meeting is characterised as an appeal from the decision of the
Executive Committee, then such a Special General Meeting can cure prior defects in providing procedural fairness: McClelland versus Burning Palms Surf
Lifesaving Club [(2002) 191 ALR 759]; <case>, per McClelland J. But in my view the Special General Meeting here proposed will not be able to cure the prior denial of procedural fairness.
 A basic element of procedural fairness is that a person who may be affected by a decision should have the benefit of knowing the material upon which and the basis on which an adverse decision may be made, at least to the extent necessary for that person to have a meaningful opportunity to be heard in relation to the making of the decision: R versus Solicitors' Disciplinary tribunal; Ex parte L (a solicitor) <case>; [[1988] VR 757] at 768-770.
 The defendant's Rules provide for the plaintiffs' to obtain an understanding what might be said against them before a Special General
Meeting. The process of the Executive Committee considering something that answers the description of a "complaint" before acting to call a General meeting is designed to ensure this. The material preferred so far against these plaintiffs does not allow them to know what case they are to meet at a
General Meeting. It merely invites the question "What is this really all about?" The plaintiffs would have to defend themselves at a General meeting against an established position by the Executive Committee who would be seen as being "satisfied that the facts alleged in the complaint have been proved" - [(Rule .3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s8.3.html) that there was a case to answer. But they would have to do so in my view without knowing what that case actually was. This in my view is an independent basis for restraining the holding of the proposed General Meeting.
 The defendant Association says that it is for the Executive Committee to struggle with the "vagueness" of the petition and to determine the facts and that the Executive Committee's position was not assisted by the plaintiffs' failure to respond to correspondence. But in my view these submissions fail to recognise just how deficient of all factual content the petition really is; and it is not up to the plaintiffs to suggest what the allegations against them should be.
 
Apprehended Bias The plaintiffs' further case is that the members of the Executive Committee who voted on the resolutions on 3 July and 11 August 2010 were not impartial.
The plaintiff relies upon the doctrine of apprehended bias. If a fair minded lay observer may reasonably apprehend that the decision maker might not have brought an impartial mind to the resolution of the question he or she is required to decide then doctrines of apprehended bias are engaged: Ebner v
Official Trustee in Bankruptcy <case>; [(2000) 176 ALR 644]; [(2000) 205 CLR 337] at 334 . Here the plaintiffs submit that the evidence strongly supports an apprehension of pre-judgment. I do not have to decide this question as I have already found the resolutions invalid on other grounds.  
Damages The plaintiffs claim damages. They do so on the basis that the contract between members in this case was one to provide pleasure, enjoyment, personal protection or relaxation or to avoid vexation - in such circumstances damages are recoverable for inconvenience, vexation and distress: Baltic Shipping
Company versus Dillon <case>; [(1992) 176 CLR 344] at 363 per Mason CJ, 382-383 per Deane and Dawson JJ.
 Such damages are available in cases involving unincorporated associations:
Rose versus Boxing NSW Inc <case> at <case> and
Goodwin versus Vietnam Veterans' Motorcycle Club Australia NSW Chapter Inc <case>; <case>.
 The plaintiffs' case is that the objects of the Association are antithetical to the causing of vexation, distress or disappointment within membership of the Association and that these principles apply. Clause 2.1 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) defines the objects of the Association as including "to encourage and assist the integration of Chinese immigrants into the Australian community" and "to stimulate interest amongst Australians of Chinese descent in economic, cultural and political matters" and can in my view be taken as a basis for inferring that pleasure and relaxation and personal enjoyment are a purpose of the contract between member of the Association. However the evidence in this case does not in respect of any of the plaintiffs make out a case of proven personal distress or depression which had provided the basis for an award of damages in cases such as Rose and Goodwin. This is not an appropriate case for the award of nominal damages in my view. The plaintiffs have been successful with a full award of equitable relief. I decline to award any damages in the plaintiff's favour.
 
Conclusions and Orders I have found that the 3 July 2010 Executive Committee resolution suspending
Ms Lowe and Ms Wu from their positions on the Executive Committee are invalid.
I have also found that the 11 August 2010 Executive Committee resolutions expelling the plaintiffs from the Association are also invalid. The plaintiffs should be recognised in those positions by the Association immediately for all purposes. I will grant the final relief sought in the summons. This relief may have to be adjusted to precisely accommodate the current affairs of the
Association. I will therefore direct that the parties bring in short minutes of order to give effect to these reasons.
 Accordingly the orders of the Court will be:
Direct the parties to bring in short minutes of order to give effect to these reasons; and
Grant liberty to apply.
