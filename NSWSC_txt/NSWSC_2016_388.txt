EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
On 22 September 2015, I overruled a demurrer raised by the accused, Edward Moses Obeid, to the amended indictment and otherwise dismissed his application to quash the indictment or permanently stay the proceedings: R versus Obeid (No 2) <case> ("Obeid No 2"). On 8 December 2015 the Court of Criminal Appeal granted leave to appeal that judgment, but dismissed the appeal: Obeid versus The Queen <case> At that time Mr Obeid's trial was fixed to commence on 10 February 2016. An earlier trial date had been vacated to facilitate Mr Obeid's application for leave to appeal from Obeid No 2.
Following the dismissal of his appeal, Mr Obeid filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision. On 17 December 2015 I refused an application to stay Mr Obeid's trial pending the hearing of his application for special leave to appeal: R versus Obeid (No 5) <case> ("Obeid No 5").
Each of the judgments in Obeid No 2 and Obeid No 5 was the subject of a non-publication order made under [s 8(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s8.html) of the [Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/) . The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was also the subject of such an order, although that Court remitted to me as trial judge the question of whether that order should be continued, varied or discharged. I did not vary or discharge the order such that it continues, however I retain power to vary or discharge it. In each case the basis for the non-publication order was that which had previously been identified by Johnson J in R versus Obeid [[2015] NSWSC 897], which set out the reasons for the making of that publication order. The form of the order was as follows: "1. Pursuant to <case>(a) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth), it being necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, until 11 March 2016, there be no publication of information tending to reveal the identity of the applicant in relation to:  the application for special leave to appeal;  the application to stay the trial proceedings; and  the application for non-publication orders.  . On or before 11 March 2016, either party or any person listed in s
RG(2) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) have liberty to apply by summons and supporting affidavit for an order varying order 1."
The rationale for the date 11 March 2016 in these orders was that his Honour "considered it appropriate to make a non-publication order substantially in the form sought by the prosecutor but to limit the duration of the order to a fixed date shortly after the trial was expected to be concluded" (at [25]).
At the time Gageler J's non-publication order was made it was anticipated that Mr Obeid's trial would commence on 10 February 2016 and conclude within 2 to 4 weeks. Mr Obeid's trial commenced on 10 February 2016 but the jury was discharged on the tenth day of the trial, being 24 February 2016. A new trial has been fixed to commence on 6 June 2016.
Despite the fact that the trial did not conclude within the period that appears to have been contemplated at the time Gageler J's order was made no application to vary that order was made to his Honour as contemplated by order 2 noted in [4]. Hence, his Honour published the two judgments that I have referred to. The combination of the reporting of the aborted trial in February 2016 and the publication of Obeid versus The Queen <case> means that sufficient details of Obeid No 2, Obeid No 5 and the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment have been published so as to remove any remaining basis for those judgments to be the subject of a non-publication order. Accordingly, I will discharge the non-publication orders that subsist in relation to those judgments and the related judgment in R versus Obeid (No 3) <case> ("Obeid No 3").
The lifting of the non-publication orders means that the judgments in Obeid No 2, Obeid No 3, Obeid No 5 and the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment will be made available to those who seek copies. However, the lifting of the orders does not necessarily mean they will be published on www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au ("Caselaw"). The position was explained in Matthews versus R (No 2) <case> as follows (at [3]): "Administratively at least it is not unusual for judgments of this Court to be handed down and in that sense 'published', but not 'published' in the sense of being uploaded immediately onto Caselaw. The most common circumstance in which that occurs is when the judgment has the potential to affect outstanding criminal proceedings. By not placing the judgment immediately on the website the potential contamination of a jury pool by the wide dissemination of material adverse to an accused is minimised. However this type of (in)action does not constitute any form of non-publication order or the making of such an order under the [[Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/)].
Thus in such cases there is no immediate impediment to the parties and others reproducing the judgment, including on a website, although they do so subject to the law of contempt."
Nevertheless, I consider that this judgment and the judgments in Obeid No 2, Obeid No 3 and Obeid No 5 should be "published" on Caselaw but only until 17 May 2016. Consistent with the approach stated in Matthews No 2 they will then be removed, especially as Obeid No 2 canvasses factual details of the Crown case. Whether the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment will be "published" on Caselaw will be a matter for the members of that Court to determine.
Accordingly, the Court orders that: * (1) The non-publication orders made under [s 8(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/s8.html) of the [Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/csanoa2010493/) in respect of the following judgments be set aside: 
R versus Obeid (No 2) <case>; 
Obeid versus The Queen <case>; 
R versus Obeid (No 5) <case>; and 
R versus Obeid (No 3) <case> * * *
