HIGH RISK OFFENDER - application for extension of interim supervision order  
JUDGMENT
On 15 October 2015 Hamill J in State of New South Wales versus Anderson  <case> made orders in relation to the defendant under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 , amongst others, that he be subject to an interim supervision order pending the final hearing of the proceedings commenced by the plaintiff under that Act. The matter has come before me today because of the timetable prescribed by the Act.
The State proposes a continuation of the interim supervision order. I take it that no adverse report has been made in respect of the defendant's conduct. Furthermore, the proposed orders are by consent.
In those circumstances I make the following orders as set out in the short minutes of order signed by me, dated 11 November 2015 and placed with the papers - * (1) Pursuant to <case> of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 ("the Act") the interim supervision order made on 15 October 2015 be renewed and take effect from 6.00pm on 13 November 2015 and to expire at 6.00pm on 10 December 2015.
* (2) Pursuant to <case> of the Act, for the period of the interim supervision order as renewed, the defendant is to comply with the conditions in the Schedule to the Orders made by his Honour Justice Hamill on 15 October 2015.
