EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
On 15 October 2015, Hamill J made orders under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 subjecting the defendant to an interim supervision order, pending final hearing of these proceedings (see State of New South Wales versus Anderson <case>
On 11 November, further orders were made by Adams J continuing the interim supervision orders. Those orders are due to expire at 6pm on 10 December (see State of New South Wales versus Anderson (No 2)  <case>
Today the parties appear asking the Court to make further orders by consent, again continuing the interim orders pending the final hearing, which has been fixed for 14 and 15 December 2015.
In the circumstances now before the Court, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised to give effect to the agreement which the parties have reached, so that the pending hearing can proceed in an orderly way. Accordingly, I make the orders agreed in terms which I will now mark MFI 1: "1. Pursuant to s.10C(2) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 ("the Act") the interim supervision order made on 15 October 2015, and renewed by order made on 11 November 2015, be further renewed to take effect from .00pm on 10 December 2015 and to expire at 6.00pm on 6 January 2016,  .
