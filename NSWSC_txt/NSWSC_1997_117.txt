April 1997) `DIAMOND HILL INTERNATIONAL PTY LTD versus HUMPHREY JIAN XU ` `1976/97` ``WEDNESDAY 9 APRIL 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application under [section 74MA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74ma.html) of the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) by the registered proprietor of land at Dee Why and Manly that the caveats lodged by the defendant be removed. The caveats in question are 2937323W in respect of the Dee Why land and 2937324U in respect of the Manly land. In each caveat, in the schedule denoting the estate or interest claimed, the caveator has merely said: "Nature of the estate or interest in the land as one of the majority share holder." This is not, of course, a statement of an estate or interest explicitly or implicitly.

The facts show that the defendant is a thirty-eight per cent shareholder in the plaintiff and there have been some internal ructions in the plaintiff company. The plaintiff has contracted to sell both pieces of land and settlement has been arranged for this week. The plaintiff company is currently incurring interest at a daily rate of $2400 and wishes to settle the sales as soon as possible.

The defendant's caveats were placed on the titles on 27 March 1997. Both caveats indicated that the full name and address of the caveator was Humphrey
Jian Xu of 41 Llandaff Street, Bondi Junction.

Yesterday, an application was made to me to remove the caveats ex parte and dispense with service. I thought it appropriate to order instead that the summons be served on the caveator last night and I placed the matter in my list at 9.50 this morning. The process server attended at 41 Llandaff Street,
Bondi Junction at 5.15pm and had a conversation with a Mr Leege. Mr Leege informed the process server that Mr Xu did not live at that address but only used it as a postal address, coming there from time to time to collect his mail. Shortly afterwards the process server left the summons and affidavits under a door of the premises.

The defendant was called outside this Court at 9.50 this morning but did not appear. As I do not sit in the normal court hours, I thought it safer to leave the matter in the list for a little while in case he should appear. It is now twenty past twelve and he has still not appeared.
 [Section
N](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74n.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) provides that notices may be served on a caveator by being left at the address specified in the caveat. [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/index.html#p9) rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules has been interpreted as justifying a summons to remove a caveat being served at that address (see Re Drinkwater [(1929) 46 WN 202).]
The summons, having been left at that address, was properly served.
 [Section
MA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74ma.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) provides in subsection (2): "After being satisfied that a copy of the application has been served on the person who would be required to withdraw the caveat if the order sought were made or after having made an order dispensing with service the Supreme Court may: ... ...
 order the caveator ... to withdraw the caveat within a specified time ...
" 
Subsection (3) provides that if the caveat is not withdrawn within that specified time it lapses when an office copy of the order is lodged with the
Registrar General after that time expires.

The summons having been served, and it being as clear as clear can be that the caveator has no interest in the land, the order must be made. In view of the urgency of the matter I will order that the caveats be removed at or before 4 pm today. The order may be taken out forthwith so that means if the caveats are not withdrawn an office copy of the order can be lodged with the Registrar
General last thing tonight or first thing in the morning.

I should, however, say something about the provision in subsection (2) about dispensing with service. Service of process is not only fundamental to the jurisdiction of the Court, it is also an essential requirement of natural justice. A person must ordinarily be given notice that his or her rights are to be affected by a decision of the Court before the Court can make that decision. There is nothing in the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) or Rules and, indeed, there is nothing in equitable practice as shown in books such as
Daniell's Chancery Practice to authorise the Court to dispense with service as opposed to ordering substituted service, yet the words used in the
Act are "dispense with service". What do they mean? 
Section 74MA replaced the former section 97 which provided that the Judge may make an order "either ex parte or otherwise, as to such judge may seem fit". I thought for a while that the reference in the current section dispensing with service may merely have been some attempt by a modern parliamentary draftsman to mistranslate the Latin "ex parte" into English.

However, the point was decided by Handley JA in Hastie versus National Australia
Bank Limited, 24 May 1994 unreported. There his Honour said: "However, [section
MA(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74ma.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) confers on the Supreme Court a power which enables it, in a proper case, to deal decisively and effectively with vexatious and frivolous caveats, such as the one now in question. This provision enables the Court to make an order for the removal of a caveat without notice to or service on the caveator. It is clear that a power such as this could only ever be properly exercised in an extreme case." 
The case before Handley JA was one where two persons were alternately lodging caveats apparently to frustrate the rights of the bank and attention was directed to the power of the Court to make an order without service and, indeed, Handley JA said that the case before him was "a most exceptional case which justifies the use of the exceptional powers of the Court under [section
MA(2)."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s74ma.html) 
The mere fact that there is a power does not mean the Court must exercise the power. The power to dispense with service has traditionally been found in
Family Law Acts, vide section 65 of the Matrimonial Causes Act and Order 18 rule 11 of the current Family Court Rules. The earlier section was referred to by Bonney J in Grimaldi versus Grimaldi [(1941) 58 WN 91.]
The section permitted dispensing with service when it was necessary or expedient. His Honour said at page 92: "Dispensing with service is open to two serious objections which should not be lightly incurred. The first objection is that it deprives the respondent of the opportunity of being heard in defence of his status, his rights and his conduct. The second objection is that it affords a dishonest and untruthful petitioner, who is bold enough to make out a false case of expediency, a good chance of success against a respondent whose whereabouts he knows and conceals and who would be likely to resist if served. Therefore a Court should not readily or lightly hold that a case of expediency has been made out.

It may be 'expedient' to dispense with service where refusal would make it substantially impossible for the petitioner to prosecute his or her claim, while the granting of the order would be most unlikely to work any real injustice to the respondent." 
Mr Sanderson for the plaintiff put yesterday that the form of the caveats in the instant case were so defective and the caveator was an "insider" that the
Court should exercise its power to dispense with service. I declined to do this because, although there was a lot of merit in what Mr Sanderson put, it did not seem to me that the case was so exceptional as to make the Court exercise its exceptional power. There was time to shorten the service and to give Mr Xu the opportunity to attend and there was an outside possibility that even if the caveats were defective in their present form, they may be able to be amended or replaced.

I should add that this case further illustrates the point often made that it is essential that the address for service noted in the caveat be one where the caveator can be quickly contacted. Merely noting some accommodation address or any address which is not the caveator's residence nor an office that is constantly staffed, may mean that the exigency of the situation operates so that the Court deals with the caveat without the caveator's involvement. If this happens, it is the fault of the caveator in not providing a proper address for service.

It is not of any utility to spell out the cases which would induce the Court to dispense with service. The caveator, having been properly served and not appearing, I order that the caveats be removed by 4 pm this afternoon. The defendant must pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
