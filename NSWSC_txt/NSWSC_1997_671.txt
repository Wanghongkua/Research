JUDGMENT 
These are two stated cases brought by a prosecutor in respect of determinations by a magistrate to dismiss what purported to be two complaints in respect of contraventions of a provision of the Strata Titles Act 1973. The determination set out in each of the stated cases is that the magistrate "dismissed a Complaint made under section 53 of the Justices act 1902 and section 142 of the Strata Titles Act 1973". The two stated cases are identical apart from the name of the defendant and raise the very same issue for determination. The parties accepted that I should hear and determine the cases together.

The matter before the magistrate in each case was an allegation of a contravention of an order made by the Strata Titles Commissioner under <case> of the Act. The order in each case was directed to the defendant and was as follows: 
Comply with by-law 13 of Schedule 1 of the Act and cease parking or standing any motor or other vehicle upon the common property including the visitors carspaces except with the written approval of the body corporate. It is noted that local council requirements may preclude such approval being given in area designated for visitors parking. Compliance with this order is to be immediate.

By-law 13, referred to in the order, was a prohibition upon a proprietor or occupier parking or standing any motor vehicle upon common property except with written approval of the body corporate. Both defendants were proprietors.

The stated cases are identical apart from the name of the defendant. Each records that a complaint was laid on behalf of the owners corporation and at the hearing of the complaint each defendant pleaded guilty. Each of the defendants made identical submissions to the magistrate on sentence, the effect of which is recorded in the stated case as follows: the household within which the defendant was a member used two cars; and that they had only one car space allocated to the lot for their use; and he(she) had no other option but to part (sic) the second vehicle on common property allocated to the visitor parking.

The magistrate determined that he would not convict either of the defendants or impose any penalty. The stated cases record that the magistrate found that the defendants' actions were reasonable in that: he (she) parked his (her) vehicle in a convenient place the owners corporation should ensure that tenants of the home unit building are reasonably catered to in the provision of parking 
The magistrate for these reasons found that "it was inexpedient to impose a penalty" and as a result he dismissed each of the complaints.

The magistrate did not indicate at the hearing the source of the power which authorised him to dismiss the complaints. One of the contentions for the plaintiff set out in the stated cases is that the magistrate failed to indicate the source of the power which he used. But such a failure would not of itself be an error of law justifying the setting aside of the magistrate's order if indeed the magistrate did have power to do what he did and if it could reasonably be inferred from the reasons he gave that he purported to exercise that power and did so for a legitimate reason. The words used when reciting the facts in the stated case tend to suggest that the magistrate applied <case> of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). That section refers to the situation where a court is of the opinion that "it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment" and empowers the court, without proceeding to conviction, to make an order dismissing the charge.

Further in each of the stated cases the following statement is made: "I dismissed the matter under <case> of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/)". That statement is found under the heading "The appellant contends that:" and it is not clear to me whether this is a statement made by the magistrate or a contention made by the plaintiff. Nowhere in the facts or the determination set out in the stated cases does the magistrate indicate upon what statutory provision he relied to make the orders he did. However, I think that it is reasonably clear that it was the provisions of <case> which the magistrate was purporting to apply in reaching the decision that he did to dismiss the complaints. The defendants having pleaded guilty, and those pleas having been accepted by the court, it is hardly likely that the magistrate found that the complaints had not been proved. The effect of a plea of guilty which is accepted by a court is that the essential elements of the charge before the court have been established and no further proof is required: Meissner versus The
Queen <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 132.] There is no conceivable reason why the magistrate would have dismissed the complaint because it had not been made out.

The first issue that arises then is whether the magistrate had jurisdiction to apply <case> of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The plaintiff contends that he did not because the section does not apply to proceedings commenced by complaint under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s53.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/). I think there is substantial merit in that argument by reason of the words used in the section. I shall return to this matter later. But a more fundamental question seems to me to arise in this case, and although in some respects it is central to the arguments raised by the parties, it was not averted to at the hearing before me. It was assumed before the magistrate and before me, that the matters were appropriately commenced by complaint. In my opinion that assumption is at best of very doubtful validity indeed. Although, for reasons which I will express later in this judgment, it is strictly unnecessary for me to decide this issue in order to determine the stated cases, I do not think that I should let the matter pass without indicating why I have considerable doubts about the use of a complaint to commence proceedings under <case> of the
Strata Titles Act. However, as the matter is not central to my decision and as it was not argued I will refer to it only briefly.

The provisions of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) maintain the traditional distinction which has existed from time immemorial between proceedings commenced by complaint and those commenced by an information. That distinction is clear from the terms of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s52.html) and [53](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s53.html) but I will not set out the sections here. The matter is discussed in detail in
Jones versus Metcalf [[1978] 2 NSWLR 709.] The chief distinction between proceedings commenced by an information and those commenced by complaint is that proceedings following a complaint are essentially civil rather than criminal: Chinchen versus Weiss [[1964] NSWLR ] at ; Jones versus Metcalf at 711. Proceedings by complaint have the purpose of obtaining an order of the court. That order was traditionally for the payment of money, although the order sought may require that some person do an act or refrain from doing an act. A recent example of the proceedings commenced by complaint are proceedings for apprehended violence orders under Division 2 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/index.html#p15) of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). Proceedings commenced by information, however, have the purpose of punishing a person for an offence by way of conviction for the offence charged in the information.

Therefore, in order to determine whether the proceedings should be commenced by complaint or information it is necessary to have regard to the ultimate purpose of the proceedings. Generally that purpose will be determined by a consideration of the statutory basis for the proceedings which are to be brought before the court and the nature of the proceedings which the statute authorises. However, it has been observed more than once that the legislature has not always observed the distinction between informations and complaints with clarity: Chinchen versus Weiss at 361; Jones versus Metcalf at 712. The decision in Jones versus Metcalf was that the use of the word "complaint" by the legislature in the provision there under consideration was taken to have been a non-technical use of the word, so that the proper procedure for the matter in that case was to commence proceedings by an information.

There is nothing in the Strata Titles Act 1973 (as it was at the time of the proceedings before the magistrate) which indicates how proceedings under <case> should be commenced. Section 142 is as follows: 
A person shall not contravene an order under this Part, not being an order under section 104A (2), to do or refrain from doing a specified act.

Maximum penalty: 1 penalty unit and, subject to subsection (2), a further penalty not exceeding 0.1 penalty unit for every day during which the contravention continues.

The maximum amount that may be recovered in any prosecution for an offence under subsection (1) is 5 penalty units.

A person shall not contravene an order under section 104A (2) to do or refrain from doing a specified act.

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units.

Proceedings for an offence under this section may be taken only: in any case, by the applicant for the order, or if the order relates to a parcel that is not a stratum parcel, by the body corporate for the parcel; or if the order relates to a stratum parcel, by each body corporate for a stratum parcel including part of the building or by any person in whom is vested an estate in fee simple in a part of the building that is not included in a stratum parcel.

In proceedings under this section: the imposition of a penalty operates as a judgment under the [Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/) against the defendant and in favour of the prosecutor for the amount of the penalty; and an order for a person to pay an amount of costs operates as a judgment for that amount under that Act against that person and in favour of the person whose costs are ordered to be paid 
A penalty imposed under this section or costs referred to in subsection (4) (b) shall not be enforceable or recoverable except as provided in subsection (4).

Any costs awarded against a defendant in proceedings under this section shall include the amount of the fee paid on filing the application for the order contravened.

A document purporting to be a copy of an order made by the
Commissioner or Board shall be admissible in evidence and shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to be an order made by the Commissioner or a
Board, as the case may be.

Section 142(1) in its terms creates an offence - it prohibits a course of conduct on pain of a penalty. Further, section 54 of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) relevantly provides that a penalty specified at the end of a subsection "indicates that a contravention of the... subsection... is an offence against the Act punishable on conviction by a penalty not exceeding the penalty so specified". Further still, <case> refers to proceedings under the section being "for an offence". From these provisions it seems to me that the argument that proceedings for a contravention of the section fall within [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s52.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) and should be commenced by an information is overwhelming. The fact that [subsection (a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s4.html) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s142.html) provides that a penalty shall be recovered as if it were a civil debt does not seem to me to be to the point. That provision is only dealing with the method of enforcement of the penalty imposed and does not change the nature of the proceedings. Proceedings by complaint were never intended to apply to a penalty. Rather a complaint was used for the recovery of monies which the defendant was liable to pay by reason of the operation of the law, such as payment for maintenance or wages.

The only reason that I have expressed my view about whether the proceedings were correctly commenced by complaint in terms of having a doubt about the assumption that the proceedings in the present matter were properly commenced is because, the point not having been taken before the magistrate or before me, it may be that, in the absence of the assistance of counsel, I have overlooked some provision in the Strata Titles Act or elsewhere which suggests that the plain meaning of the words of <case> and the clear purpose of the proceedings under that section are not determinative of the question.

Therefore, it may well be that the proceedings before the magistrate ought to have been commenced by information. If that were so, the question would then arise as to whether the magistrate had jurisdiction to hear the proceedings at all by reason of the fact that they were commenced by the wrong initiating process. My present view is that, provided that the charge had been read to the defendants by the magistrate at the commencement of the proceedings, the magistrate would have had jurisdiction notwithstanding that each of the summonses bringing the defendants before the court were erroneously issued, see Chinchen versus Weiss, above, at 362, and Ex parte Walker; Re
Goodfellow <case>; [(1944) 45 SR 103] at 108.

Had these proceedings been commenced by an information or if the defendants had each been charged before the magistrate with the offence, there would be no doubt about the jurisdiction of the magistrate to apply <case> of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). If, contrary to my doubts, the proceedings were correctly commenced by complaint, then the question arises whether the magistrate had jurisdiction to dismiss the complaints without proceedings to penalty even though he must have found the complaints proved by reason of his having accepted the pleas of guilty. As
I have already indicated in my view it is clear that <case> does not apply to proceedings by complaint. The section commences with the words "where any person is charged before any court with an offence punishable by such court" and expresses the power of the court under the section to be that "the court may, without proceeding to conviction, make an order...(a) dismissing the charge..". As I have indicated above, the use of terms such as "charge", "offence" and "conviction" are inconsistent with proceedings commenced by complaint.

Before me counsel for the defendants relied substantially upon the terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s78.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) as the basis of the jurisdiction of the magistrate to dismiss a complaint notwithstanding that the truth of the complaint had been admitted by the defendant. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s78.html) is as follows: 
Where the defendant appears at the hearing and has been provided with a written copy of any charges against him, the substance of the information or complaint shall be stated to him, and he shall be asked if he has any cause to show why he should not be convicted or why an order should not be made against him, as the case may be.

If he thereupon admits the truth of the information or complaint and shows no sufficient cause why he should not be convicted or why an order should not be made against him then the Justice or Justices present at the hearing shall convict him or make an order against him accordingly.

If he does not admit the truth of the information or complaint then the said Justice or Justices should proceed to hear the prosecutor or complainant and the witnesses whom he examines and such other evidence as he adduces in support of the information or complaint and to hear the defendant and the witnesses whom he examines and such other evidence as he adduces in his defence.

The submission was that the terms of [subsection ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s2.html) implies that the magistrate will only make an order against a defendant who admits the truth of the complaint (as the defendants did here) if the defendant "shows no sufficient cause... why an order should not be made against him". The argument was that, if the defendant showed that it was inexpedient to inflict a penalty (as the magistrate found in this case) then the magistrate would not make the order sought and under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s80.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) would dismiss the complaint.

Although I was initially attracted to that submission by reason of what appears to be the plain intent of the section, I do not believe that the submission is correct. The section has its genesis in a provision in one of the two Jervis's Acts, 11 & 12 Vic c 43 [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s14.html) That provision was incorporated into the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) virtually unchanged and, therefore, has existed in its present form for over a century.
Yet counsel could not refer me to any recorded case where a justice had used that section to dismiss either an information or a complaint. My own researches were unable to find any acknowledgment of such a power in any of the texts dealing with the summary jurisdiction of magistrates from the middle of the last century. To the contrary, there are statements which tend to deny the submission made by the defendants by suggesting that, where the defendant admitted the offence or confessed the charge, the only option was for the magistrate to convict; see Burns Justice of the Peace 28th ed (1837) at p 880;
Paley's Law and Practice of Summary Convictions 4th ed (1856) at 83; Oke's
Magisterial Synopsis 8th ed (1862) p131. In the 5th edition of Paley (1866) at it is made clear that the general rule was that, if the charge were substantiated and no valid defence was proved, the duty of the magistrate was to convict. The only reason why the learned author of that text thought it appropriate to state what he considered to be an obvious fact was because of the existence of provisions in particular statutes dealing with specific subject matters which gave jurisdiction to a magistrate to dismiss a charge for reasons other than that the charge had not been proved.

So reference can be found in early editions of Paley and Stone's Justices
Manual to the Criminal Justice Act 1855 (18 & 19 Vic c 126), the Larceny
Act 1861(24 & 25 Vic c 96), and the Malicious Injury to Property Act 1861 (24 & 25 Vic c 97) which statutes provided that a justice could discharge a defendant for an offence under those Acts where the circumstances of the case rendered it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. There is also reference to a provision in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861(24 & Vic c 100) which permitted a justice to dismiss a charge for assault if he thought that the offence was so trifling as not to merit punishment.. It should be noted that the power of a justice to dismiss an information for specific types of offences even though the offence was proved predates the
Jervis's Acts. For example, a justice had power to dismiss an information for assault under 9 Geo IV c 31 <case>, and could discharge the defendant for larceny under 7 & 8 Geo IV c 29 <case>.

But it can be seen that these were specific provisions and it seems clear that it was considered that the magistrate had no general power to decline to convict a defendant where the offence had been proved until such a power was given by the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vic c 49) <case>. This was a power which permitted a justice "without proceeding to conviction" to place the defendant on probation. In 1887 the Probation of First Offenders Act (50 & 51 Vic c 25) empowered a court to release a defendant upon probation instead of proceedings to punishment for the offence proved. By the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 (7 Ed V11 c 17) <case>, these two provisions were repealed and in their stead a general provision was enacted giving courts a power to dismiss an information or complaint in proceedings for any offence. That section was adopted virtually without change in this State when <case> was inserted into the New South Wales [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) by the
Crimes (Amended) Act 1929. The Second Reading Speech introducing the bill indicates that this provision was seen as innovative and was intended to give the courts a power they did not otherwise enjoy, see Hansard 1928-1929 Vol 114 p 533. Before that section was enacted the only provision in the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) permitting a justice to dismiss an information where the offence had been proved was <case> which allowed for the dismissal of a charge of assault and clearly had its genesis in the 19th century English statutes to which I have referred.

Particular reliance was placed by counsel for the defendants on a passage in the judgement of Windeyer J in Cobiac versus Liddy <case>; [(1969) 119 CLR 257] at 270, which, it was suggested, showed that justices had a general power to dismiss an information or complaint notwithstanding that they had found the offence proved. In the course of considering the history of a
South Australian provision similar to <case>, his Honour referred to the
English Probation of Offenders Act 1907, and considerations of the Act by a
Departmental Committee in 1936. His Honour stated: "The recommendation of the Committee were belated adopted in the Criminal
Justice Act 1948, which permits putting a person on probation after conviction, in lieu of penalty. No longer can justices in England decline to convict when they think a charge is proved: see Halsbury's Laws of England, rd ed., vol 10 p. 498; vol 25, p. 226; Law Quarterly Review, vol 65, pp.
-54. But in South Australia the statutory provisions are still substantially in their original form" (my emphasis).

However, the sentence underlined above, when considered in its context and by reference to the two texts cited as authority for it, has nothing to do with the interpretation of the provisions of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) or the general power of magistrates. The statement (which has its origins at page 54 of the volume of the Law Quarterly Review referred to) is a reference to the fact that prior to the Criminal Justice Act 1948, a magistrate when exercising the power to place a person on probation did not proceed to a conviction even though the offence had been proved. The dismissal of the information in that situation was criticised by the Departmental Committee to which Windeyer J referred because it was thought such action might be confused with a finding that the offender was not guilty. The recommendation of the Committee, which was adopted in the Criminal Justice Act 1948, was that the power to place a defendant on probation should be exercised only after conviction. When read in context, the statement in the judgment of Windeyer J relied upon by the defendants is in truth contrary to the submission that a general power to dismiss an information or complaint notwithstanding that it has been proved is to be found in the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/).

However, there are statements in some early texts which indicate what the drafter of the provision now found in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s78.html) had in mind. In the New South Wales Magisterial Digest by Connell (1866) at 372, after referring to the substance of the provision, the author states that, where the defendant admits the truth of the information, the magistrate is relieved of the need of considering the evidence but may adjudicate because the defendant's admission is sufficient to prove the information or complaint.
The text then goes on: "If the defendant, however, in admitting the truth of the information or complaint should show any cause why he should not be convicted, as by pleading qualification, justification, or such like, although the admission dispenses with the necessity of proving the charge, as contained in the information or complaint, yet the Magistrates should go into such evidence as may be necessary to prove or negative the qualification or justification, it being observed that the affirmative proof of any such matter which is relied upon in defence, is thrown upon the defendant. When the Magistrates have satisfied themselves of the true facts of the case, they can proceed to adjudicate." 
A similar statement is to be found in the Australian Magistrate by Wilkinson th ed (1881) at 355.

It seems clear that the provision found in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s78.html) was never construed as itself conferring a power on a justice or magistrate to avoid convicting or making an order where the offence or complaint was proved by an admission of the truth of the information or complaint. In order to avoid conviction where the defendant had admitted the truth of the information, the defendant had to show that he had some defence to the charge or, perhaps, that he came within some particular statutory provision which authorised the magistrate to determine the matter other than by conviction. If it were otherwise, so that the provision found in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s78.html) itself gave the court power to dismiss without conviction, the particular statutory provisions which gave the justice such a power would never have been necessary. The [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) was a consolidation of the existing law in respect of proceedings before magistrates and justices as it stood at that time and the Act should not be taken as having changed the law that existed at the time of consolidation unless there is a clear intention that it should: Spautz versus Dempsey [[1984] 1 NSWLR ]
at 457- 459 and the cases cited. In my opinion the submission by the defendants as to the interpretation of <case> cannot be accepted. The magistrate was given no authority by that section to dismiss a complaint which he had found proved by the defendant's pleas of guilty. No other power has been suggested.

However, even if I be wrong in this conclusion and the magistrate had jurisdiction to dismiss the complaints in the present matter, or even if in truth he had jurisdiction under <case> of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), such jurisdiction as he had could only be exercised if proper grounds existed for its exercise. Although the jurisdiction to dismiss proceedings without penalty or conviction is a very wide one and the exercise of that jurisdiction could not normally be attacked as erroneous in law, the reasons for the exercise of the discretion can disclose that the magistrate misunderstood the discretion he had, or that he had taken into account irrelevant matters in exercising the discretion and so error of law can be demonstrated. Such an error can also be shown if there was no evidence to support the findings of fact relied upon in exercising the discretion. A case where error of law was shown in the determination of a magistrate to dismiss a charge although having found the offence proved is Federal Commission of Taxation versus Wormald International
Aust Pty Limited (1985) 85 ATC 4844. In that case Yeldham J held on a stated case that a magistrate's decision to dismiss an information under a provision equivalent of <case> was erroneous in law because none of the matters which the magistrate relied upon to exercise the power justified the formation of the view that it was inexpedient to inflict any penalty.

I have already indicated that the magistrate in the present matters reached the view that it was inexpedient to inflict any penalty because he found the actions of each of the defendants were reasonable in that each had parked in a convenient place and that the owners corporation should ensure that "tenants are reasonably catered to in the provision of parking". The magistrate, therefore, must have found that it was reasonable for each of the defendants to defy the order of the Commissioner and to continue to breach the by-law forbidding parking in the visitor's carspaces. That was a finding of fact which in my view was so perverse and so lacking in any evidence to support it, that the magistrate must have misconceived the basis upon which he could exercise any jurisdiction he had to dismiss the proceedings before him.

The first finding, that the defendants parked their vehicle in a convenient place, was not open on the evidence and was completely irrelevant to the issue the magistrate had to decide. Presumably the magistrate based this finding upon some view, which is unsupported by any evidence which has been set out in the stated case, that there was no inconvenience to the persons residing in, or visiting, the units by the defendants using a visitor's parking space as a permanent parking spot. True it is that there were 36 parking spaces for visitors, but the strata scheme contained 166 lots and I cannot see how he could come to a conclusion that the defendants action's were not inconvenient.
But, in my view, such a finding had no bearing upon the question of whether the complaints should be dismissed. The contravention to which the proceedings related was not one of parking in the visitor's carspace without approval or breaching the by-law, but a contravention of an order made by the Commissioner under the statutory regime under the Strata Titles Act.

The Commissioner's power to make such an order as he made in this case was part of a scheme prescribed by the legislature for dealing with disputes that arose in relation to strata title premises. That scheme was set out in Part 5 of the Act. The Commissioner was appointed under the Act to determine disputes arising in relation to strata title properties and has been given by the Act considerable powers and authority in determining matters referred to him or her. The authority of the Commissioner is supported by the provision of offences to punish conduct which is aimed at frustrating the Commissioner in carrying out his or her functions. Persons who may be affected by an order are entitled to make submissions to the Commissioner who is given general power to investigate the matter in dispute. Where an order is made requiring a person to do or refrain from doing a specified act, that person has a right to appeal to the Board against the order made. There is a further right of appeal from the Board to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

In light of this statutory scheme and the facts set out in the stated cases I find it quite impossible to see how the magistrate could have found that it was reasonable for the defendants to wilfully and persistently disobey the order of the Commissioner, even if I were to accept that a contravention of an order may in a very rare case be regarded as reasonable. The defendants had rights under the scheme to make submissions in relation to the contravention of the by-law and could even appeal to the Board against the order made. It was the statutory function of the Commissioner to determine whether to enforce the by-law against the defendants. It was no function of the magistrate on the facts before him to redetermine that matter by deciding upon the reasonableness of the by-law, the order enforcing it or the failure of the defendants to comply with the order.

Nor, in my view, was it the function of the magistrate to determine the obligations and duties of the body corporate in relation to the provision of parking for occupiers of units. His personal views on such a matter had nothing to do with the determination of the proceedings before him. As the order of the Commissioner indicated, it may well have been that the body corporate had no control at all over the provision of parking for occupiers of the premises. But in any event, the fact that there was only one parking space provided for an occupier must have been a matter which the defendants took into account either when deciding to take up occupancy in the block of units or when deciding to purchase a second vehicle. It was hardly a case where they were compelled by circumstances beyond their control to act in contravention of the order. The magistrate could not have found that the defendant's actions in contravening the Commission's order were reasonable on this basis.

The fact that the magistrate's findings as to the reasonableness of the defendant's actions were perverse would not itself mean that the magistrate had erred on a point of law, see Azzopardi versus Tasman UEB Industries Ltd [(1985) 4 NSWLR 139] at 156. But this finding, in my view, indicates that he misconceived any discretion he may have had to dismiss the proceedings. The findings of fact he made, even if there had been evidence to support them, could not as a matter of law justify a finding that it was inexpedient to inflict any penalty. On the contrary, on the undisputed facts before him, the magistrate had to find that in each case there had been a wilful contravention of the Commissioner's order, that the contravention was not an isolated incident, and that the defendants contravened the order simply because it suited them to do so.

Orders made by a Commissioner under the authority of the Act must be respected not only by the persons to whom the orders apply but also by the courts who are called upon to deal with contraventions of the orders. Failure to uphold the orders will give rise to a belief that they can be ignored or contravened with impunity and the whole scheme of dispute resolution put in place by the parliament will be undermined. The Local Court is not part of the scheme to resolve disputes which occur under the Act nor does it have the function of determining the correctness of the Commissioner's orders. Rather its sole function is to determine whether an offence has been committed under the Act and to punish such an offence where it has been proved. This is not to deny that the court has power in a proper case and for proper reasons to dismiss the proceedings because it determines that in the special circumstances of the case it is not appropriate to inflict any punishment. But that decision must take into account the seriousness of a refusal to comply with the order of a
Commissioner, the need to ensure that the scheme provided by the Act serves its purpose. This considerations of necessity require the court to take into account the need to deter others from failing to abide by the decision of the
Commissioner to make an order under the Act.

In my view the magistrate erred in law in determining for the reasons given in the stated case that it was not expedient to inflict any punishment and so to dismiss the proceedings. However, that does not mean that I should uphold the stated case and remit the matter to the Local Court. The defendants were unrepresented before the magistrate and they pleaded guilty immediately.
Through no fault of theirs they have found themselves taken to the Supreme
Court because the magistrate misunderstood his jurisdiction. I have been told that they are no longer occupiers of the units. Although the magistrate should not have dismissed the proceedings and ought to have imposed some penalty upon the defendants, the maximum penalty for the offence was only $100 at the time the matter was before the court. Although, as such contraventions go, this could not be said to be a trivial example, it was hardly a matter which warranted a penalty near the maximum provided. The purpose in bringing the stated case was obviously to ensure that the magistrate was corrected by a judgment of this Court which would have binding effect on him and other magistrates in the proper determination of such proceedings in the future.

In all the circumstances, therefore, although in my view the magistrate was in error in dismissing these proceedings, I decline to remit the matter and dismiss the summons. The plaintiff should pay the defendants costs. It is unfortunate that the plaintiff who was justifiably aggrieved by the magistrate's decision should be left to foot the bill not only of the proceedings which were quite appropriately taken before the magistrate but also of these proceedings. However, it would not be just to allow the appeal and remit the matter simply because of an issue of costs. Unfortunately I cannot give a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act where I am dismissing a stated case notwithstanding that the magistrate was erroneous in point of law.
However, I commend <case> of the Act to the plaintiff.
