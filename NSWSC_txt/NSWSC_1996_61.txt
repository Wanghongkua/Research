NSWSC 61 (4 April 1996) 
Application of J W Murphy and P C Allen Application of BPTC Limited (In
Liquidation) /95 5008/90 
Thursday, 4 April 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Before the Court are two applications which have been heard together. The first is an application by the liquidators of BPTC Limited (in liquidation) for directions under s.379(3) of the Companies Code made by notice of motion in the winding up proceedings, and the second is an application by the trustees of the Meridian Investment Trusts for the opinion, advice or direction of the Court under [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) made by summons in proceedings commenced for that purpose.

The applications initially related to an agreement constituted by a deed dated October 1995 to which BPTC, the liquidators and the trustees were parties, relating to assignments of certain choses in action by BPTC to the trustees.
During the course of the hearing the applications altered so that they related to a proposed deed, not yet executed, relating to such assignments. I have come to the conclusion that the directions sought in each case should, in substance, be given but there are two matters which have arisen during the course of the hearing to which I wish to make particular reference.

The first is this: both s.379(3) of the Companies Code (and the equivalent s.479(3) of the Corporations Law) and [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) of the [Trustee
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/) are essentially concerned with future action by a liquidator or a trustee, as the case may be. Typically, under either provision the Court would give a direction to the effect that the applicant, as such liquidator or trustee as the case may be, would be justified in acting in a specified way or on a specified basis. Frequently however, it is convenient for the liquidator or trustee first to enter into (or in the case of a liquidator cause the company to enter into) a transaction in respect of which the Court's sanction is desired, which is expressed to be conditional upon the Court making an order or direction of some kind, and then to apply to the Court for the requisite order or direction in order to satisfy the condition. In such a case it is important that the order contemplated in the contractual condition is expressed in terms which the Court can properly make in the particular circumstances. For example, the Court could not properly make an order that an applicant is or would be justified in entering into a specified contract if that contract has already been entered into, albeit subject to the condition in question. In a case of that kind it is, in my view, preferable for the contract to be expressed to be conditional on the approval of the Court and for application to be made to the Court for an order approving the contract.
In the case of a liquidator such an order may be made under the inherent power of the Court to supervise and guide the activities of its own officer (cf the analogous inherent jurisdiction in relation to a Court-appointed receiver, as to which see Re Sandwell Park Colliery Company [1929] 1 Ch 27 and Kerr on Receivers, 5th ed at pages 186 to 187) and in the case of a trustee, under the powers conferred by [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/index.html#p68) rule 2(4)(a) of the Supreme Court Rules (cf the old practice recorded in
Daniell's Chancery Practice (5th ed) at page 1141).

The second matter relates to the position of third parties. In the correspondence put before the Court during the hearing of the present applications, concern was expressed on behalf of parties external to the winding up of BPTC that the assignments in question may affect their rights adversely. It is to be emphasised that an application for directions under s.379(3) of the Companies Code (or s.479(3) of the Corporations Law) is an administrative non-adversary proceeding, and a direction given pursuant to that section has no effect on the substantive rights of persons external to the winding up. The limited effect of such a direction was explained at some length in Re G B Nathan & Co <case>; [(1994) 49 FCR 334], Northrop J expressed the view that s.479(3) of the
Corporations Law did empower the Court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments determining substantive rights. That view expressed by his Honour appears to me, with respect, to be founded on a misconception of the decisions of Adam J in Re Reid Murray Holdings <case>; [1969 VR 315], and of Street J in Re Gapes Interstate Transport [(1970) 79 WN .] His Honour seems to have been of the opinion that each of those two last-mentioned cases involved an application by a liquidator for directions under the respective equivalents of s.479(3) of the Corporations
Law. In fact, neither case did involve any such application. The basis of the summary jurisdiction discussed in each of those decisions was the inherent, and not a statutory, power of the Court.

In proceedings 5008/90 I make orders in terms of the short minutes initialled by me and placed with the file, and in proceedings 4162/95 I make orders in terms of the short minutes of order initialled by me and placed with that file.
