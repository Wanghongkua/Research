JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES  criminal DIVISION  
KIRBY J  November 2001  /01 - REGINA versus Jeffrey William Spencer ROSE  
Judgment [No 10] - Direction on Identification  KIRBY J: An issue arose during the trial in respect of which I gave a ruling, undertaking to later provide reasons. This judgment contains those reasons.   The Crown foreshadowed a request under [s165(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) for a warning that certain evidence may be unreliable. The evidence was from a witness who identified the deceased at a time, and in circumstances, inconsistent with the Crown case.  It is the Crown case that the deceased went to the accused's flat at about .00 pm on 30 April 1982. She was travelling to Brisbane by bus that evening.
The bus was scheduled to leave at 11.00 pm. She was supposed to meet friends beforehand at the New England Hotel. When she did not appear at the hotel, her friends became concerned. They went to the flat of Mr Rose, arriving at about .45 pm. Mr Rose answered the door. He told the deceased's friends that his wife was not there, and that she had "gone off with a young bloke" at about .30 pm.  The disappearance of Mrs Kristine Rose received considerable publicity.
Within three days of her disappearance, on 3 May 1982, Mr Dawson came forward.
He was the proprietor of the Centrepoint Laundromat in Armidale. He told the police that he had seen the photograph of the missing woman on television. He recognised her. She had been to his laundromat between 9.00 pm and 9.30 pm on the night that she disappeared (30 April 1982). He spoke to her. She told him that she was on her way to Brisbane by bus.  Mr Dawson was again interviewed on 26 May 1982, after the body of Kristine
Rose had been found in a creek bed six kilometres from Armidale. He said that he was certain that the woman in the photograph was the woman in the laundromat.  The Crown relies upon [s165(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), which is in these terms:  "[s165(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
Unreliable evidence  
This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  identification evidence; .... "  Once a party requests a warning, the Judge is obliged to provide that warning [(s165(2)(a))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html), unless there are good reasons for not doing so [(s165(3)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)  Mr Stratton contends that the warning should not be given. He points to the definition of "identification evidence" in the Dictionary which accompanies the Act. Identification evidence is the identification of the accused. The definition is as follows:  "Identification evidence means evidence that is:  an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where:  the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed; or  an act connected to that offence was done;  at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time; or  a report (whether oral or in writing) of such assertion."  Mr Stratton suggests that the asymmetry in the Act is quite deliberate. It is consistent with the approach taken with respect to accomplice evidence. In respect of that part of an accomplice's evidence that may support an accused, no accomplice direction should be given (Jamison, Elliot and Blessington [(1992) 60 A Crim R 68];
Gleeson CJ with whom Lee AJ and Hope AJA agreed; R versus Baker <case>, per Ipp AJA, para 27).  The argument has some force. However, I think the better view is that a warning under [s165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) is appropriate. I take that view for a number of reasons. First, providing a warning is consistent with the purpose of [s165.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
If I may be forgiven for quoting my own judgment (with which Spigelman CJ and
Smart AJ agreed), the purpose was stated in R versus Baartman <case>, in these terms: (at para 62)  "In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable.
Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, [s165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is the danger that the jury may over-estimate the probative value of certain evidence (see ALRC 26, Vol 1, para 1017)....."  Secondly, identification evidence is specifically dealt with in [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s116.html) of the Act. If Mr Stratton's argument were right, [s165(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) has little or no work. [Section (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s116.html) and (b) mirror the requirements of [s165(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html), and (c). I think the better view is that [s116](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s116.html) is the specific provision dealing with identification of defendants in criminal trials. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) is the general provision. It is not confined to criminal proceedings (contrast [s165(1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) and (e) with [s165(1)(g)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
It includes situations analogous to the various categories identified in [s165(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html), where the danger of the evidence is not obvious and the purposes of [s165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) are served (such as the identification of a motor vehicle, or objects) (R v
Clout [(1995) 41 NSWLR 312], per
Kirby ACJ (with whom Allen and Dowd JJ agreed); R versus Lowe <case>; [(1997) 98 A Crim R 300], per Hunt CJ at CL, esp 314 to 318).  Thirdly, the generality of [s165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) is reinforced by the opening words. The section applies to evidence "of a kind that may be unreliable" (cf R versus Stewart  <case>; esp Howie J). There follows the words "including the following kinds of evidence", with a list of seven classes of evidence. The list is not exhaustive (Beazley JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J agreed) in R v Lewis (CCA, unreported, 8.9.98) at p17)). The combined force of these two expressions ("of a kind that may be unreliable" and "including the following kinds of evidence") authorises the use of analogy.  Here, the same considerations that may make the evidence of an eye witness identifying an accused unreliable, apply to the identification by Mr Dawson of the deceased. The need to acquaint a jury, with matters of which they may otherwise be unaware, applies equally to such evidence.  Having said that, it must be acknowledged that the matter is not free from doubt. This has been a long trial, and one postponed for almost two decades. I believe that caution is warranted. In the circumstances, I will not tell the jury, in terms, that the evidence of identification may be unreliable. Rather,
I will draw to their attention the need to consider the reliability of such evidence, and the sorts of issues that they may think appropriate to address.  *
