HEADNOTE 
Subpoena - Administrative Tribunal - Whether required to produce notes made by members in course of their deliberations - Public interest immunity - [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [ss 129](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s129.html) and [130](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s130.html) - [Residential Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), <case>.

In an appeal from the Residential Tenancies Tribunal the plaintiff caused a subpoena to issue requiring production of the complete file of the Tribunal relating to the relevant matter.

The Tribunal produced all records of proceedings including published reasons for decision but claimed public interest immunity for members' handwritten notes made in the course of them performing their office as members of the
Tribunal or notes of those persons' deliberations in acting as such members.

Held: The documents sought were privileged from production on the ground of public interest immunity.

THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DIVISION 
DUNFORD J 
Friday 12 February 1999 /98 - TIMOTHY KARMAS - AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF ELENI KARMAS & 4 ORS versus NEW SOUTH WALES LAND AND HOUSING CORP & ANOR 
JUDGMENT -  HIS HONOUR: This is an application by the Residential Tenancies Tribunal for an order relating to a subpoena that has been directed to it on behalf of the plaintiffs in the proceedings which are in substance an appeal by the plaintiffs against a decision of the Residential Tenancies Tribunal dated 7
July 1998 as amended by a notice dated 6 August 1998 and a number of interlocutory rulings or orders by the Tribunal.
 The first defendant is the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation which was successful in the Tribunal in obtaining an order for possession of certain premises at 10 Anthony Street, Padstow, and the second defendant has filed a submitting appearance.
 The subpoena seeks production of the complete file of the Tribunal in relation to the relevant matter. An affidavit by the acting Registrar of the
Tribunal discloses that most of the documents referred to in the subpoena have been produced without objection, but a claim for public interest immunity is made in respect of the balance contained in a confidential exhibit, and the affidavit discloses that each of the remaining documents is a note made by a member of the Tribunal in the course of that person performing the office of member or is a note of that person's deliberations in acting as such member; and that none of the documents not produced is a minute of the Tribunal or a written record of reasons given by a member for a decision of the Tribunal nor constitutes published reasons of a decision of the Tribunal.
 The second defendant relies on the terms of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s129.html) and [130](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s130.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s129.html) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, evidence of the reasons for a decision made by a person who is a judge in an Australian or overseas proceeding or the deliberations of a person so acting in relation to such decision must not be given, nor must such evidence be given by tendering as evidence a document prepared by such a person; and "judge" is defined in the
Dictionary to the Act as "the judge, magistrate or other person before whom the proceeding is being held".
 Section 82 of the [Residential Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) confers on members of the Tribunal in the exercise of the functions of a member the same protection and immunity as a justice in the exercise of the functions of a justice under the [Justices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).
 [Section (5)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s129.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides an exception in respect of an appeal from or judicial review of a decree, order or sentence of the court. It has long been established that although the formal act or orders of a judge or court can be proved when an appropriate occasion arises, such as in the circumstances referred to in [s (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s129.html), no evidence can be given or can be required to be given of the thought processes or deliberations of a judge or arbitrator in reaching a decision, nor can the production of any notes recording his or her thoughts or deliberations in that process be produced.
 A number of cases have dealt with this including the Duke of Buccleuch -v- Metropolitan Board of Works [(1871) LR 5 HL 418]; Ex parte Electronic Rentals Pty Ltd; re Anderson & Ors [[1970] 3 NSWR ];
Hennessey -v- Broken Hill Pty Limited <case>; [(1926) 38 CLR 342] at 349; Zanatta -v- McCleary [[1976] 1 NSWLR .] In the last mentioned case Samuels JA referred to a suggested distinction between the judges of superior courts and other judges, but his Honour doubted the distinction was valid and in Ward -v- Shell-Mex and BP Limited [(1952) 1 KB 280] it was held that evidence as to the reasons which prompted a member of a Medical Board to come to the conclusion which resulted in the certificate which had been granted by the Medical Board was inadmissible.
 The principle was summarised by Samuels JA in Wentworth -v- Rares (unreported Court of Appeal 19 December 1990), where his Honour said: "It has been contended...that a judge is not compellable to produce documents which have been involved in the performance of his duties as a judge, including drafts of judgments. Secondly it is put that there is a public interest immunity also which covers the situation." After referring to Zanatta -v- McCleary his Honour went on: "I think there is no significant difference between prohibition upon a judge's being called to testify and his or her being required to produce in documentary form those considerations which have been involved in the act of judgment. It is a principle, I would have thought, clearly justified by grounds of common sense and policy." For these reasons I am satisfied that the production of the remaining documents so far as not produced cannot be compelled both on the grounds of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s129.html) and public interest immunity under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s130.html)
The plaintiff respondent has and will have available at the hearing the transcript of the various days, the reasons for the various judgments and rulings, and will have ample opportunity to make the points that are sought to be made by reference to those documents.
 Accordingly I make order 1 as in the notice of motion and I order the respondent/plaintiff to pay the applicant/second defendant's cost of the motion.
 Exhibits to be returned.
