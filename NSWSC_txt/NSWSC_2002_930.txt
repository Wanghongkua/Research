EQUITY DIVISION  
YOUNG CJ in EQ  
Friday 27 September 2002  /02 - RE OPEN TELECOMMUNICATIONS LTD; EX PARTE ROBERT WILLIAM WHITTON AND PETER GEORGE YATES AS JOINT ADMINISTRATORS  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: This is an application made by administrators of Open
Telecommunications Ltd to postpone the adjourned second meeting of creditors of that company.  The meeting was duly convened and held on 8 August 2002. The creditors resolved that the meeting be adjourned and, bearing in mind the structure of [s
B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439b.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), resolved that the meeting be adjourned for no more than sixty days.  Although the creditors had the Act in mind in the resolution they made, it seems to me that this sort of resolution really should be for adjournment to a date certain, if at all possible. This is because such a definite resolution saves costs in the administration. Even if that is not possible, the resolution should set out the machinery for bringing about the adjourned meeting.  Whilst the company is in life, it is usually not necessary to provide this machinery because the company's constitution provides for who may convene meetings and for notification of adjourned meetings. There does not appear to be any such machinery in [Pt .3A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.3a) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), so the meeting must supply it. Where the meeting does not supply it then the court needs to supply it in making an order under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).  The initial application was to extend the time for convening the adjourned meeting, but that application has been abandoned in view of the decision in
Re LOCM Pty Ltd [(1997) 15 ACLC 1576.]  So far as the merits are concerned, I have said on previous occasions that because of the legislative intent that administration shall be concluded speedily the court must always look critically at applications for extension of time. However, in the instant case, in view of what is in the affidavit of
Mr Yates, the circumstances show that the present is a proper case to extend the time for twenty-one days.  The proper order is pursuant to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) following what I said in Cawthorn versus Keira Constructions Pty Ltd <case>; [(1995) 16 ACSR 498.] That case seems to be quite close to the present and I follow what his Honour says, but, with respect, I am not quite sure about whether his order 4 set out on page 500 is technically the correct one to make. I prefer to make the following orders: 
Pursuant to [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) in the administration of Open Telecommunications Ltd the time provided for in [s
B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439b.html) for the holding of the adjourned meeting of creditors of Open
Telecommunications Ltd held 8 August 2002 is extended to 28 October 2002. 
The said meeting has not terminated, but is to be treated as having been adjourned to a time and place to be notified by the plaintiffs, provided that eligible creditors are given at least five clear days' notice of the adjourned meeting. Such notice may be given by notice given by posting same by pre-paid ordinary post no later than 5.55 pm on 18 October 2002. 
Leave be reserved to any person claiming to be interested, including any creditor of Open Telecommunications Ltd, to make such application as he, she or it may be advised to vary these orders on 24 hours' notice to the plaintiffs and to the court. 
Liberty to apply on two days' notice to a judge, preferably the
Corporations List Judge. 
There be no order as to costs. 
The confidential affidavit to be placed in an envelope marked "not to be opened without leave of a Judge or Master". 
Exhibits may be returned. 
These orders may be entered forthwith.
