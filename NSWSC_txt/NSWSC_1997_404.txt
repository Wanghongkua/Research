Laurel May Pretty - Executrix of the Will of Arthur Stuart Wilson versus Naomi Sarah Wilson` ` 4280/96` `16 September 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /96 LAUREL MAY PRETTY - EXECUTRIX OF THE WILL OF ARTHUR STUART WILSON versus NAOMI SARAH WILSON - THE LEGAL PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF KEITH HARCOURT WILSON & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The present is a case in which the question for decision arising out of the Will of Arthur Stuart Wilson, deceased, can be very clearly stated. Mr Wilson left his estate to be split into three major parts after payment of legacies and gave what he called the second part "to Dr & Mrs Robert Arthur Pretty ...". The Will was made on 15 January 1968. Dr Pretty died on 12 November 1985. The deceased died on 9 July 1994. Mrs Pretty survived the testator and, in fact, obtained probate of his estate. 
The deceased died possessed of real estate in both New South Wales and South
Australia as well as cash and shares. It would seem that he was domiciled in
New South Wales at the appropriate time. Probate was granted here. His estate has been administered here and for the purposes of the present argument it has been taken that we are dealing with New South Wales personalty because of an implied trust for sale. Accordingly, it is New South Wales legislation which is considered in these reasons.

The [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s26.html) provides as follows: "(1) In the construction of any instrument coming into operation after the commencement of this Act a disposition of the beneficial interest in any property ... to or for two or more persons together beneficially shall be deemed to be made to or for them as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants.

This section does not apply to persons who by the terms or by the tenor of the instrument are executors, ... nor in any case where the instrument expressly provides that persons are to take as joint tenants or tenant by entireties." 
Accordingly, when one is looking at the gift to Dr and Mrs Robert Pretty, one is to determine that that is a gift to each of them as tenants in common unless one can see that the instrument expressly provides for them to take as joint tenants or tenants by entireties. The reference to tenants by entireties is odd because the effect of <case> of the Married Women's Property Act 1901 (re-enacting <case> of the 1893 Act) was to abolish tenancies by entireties; see now [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mposa1996396/s9.html) of the [Married Persons (Equality of Status) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mposa1996396/). This was so held in Ex Parte Wood <case>; [(1925) 26 SR 1], affirmed by the High Court of Australia as Registrar General versus Wood <case>; [(1926) 39 CLR 46.] At page 55 of the High Court report, Isaacs J refers to the fact that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s26.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) uses the expression "tenants by entireties" and says that while that at first sight is a little disturbing, it does not affect the general flow of the section.

Mr Cameron for Mrs Pretty says that when one looks at the whole of the Will, one can see that it clearly appears that Dr and Mrs Pretty were to take as joint tenants.

This makes one look to see what the test is as to when "the instrument expressly provides" that people are to take as joint tenants.

The case nearest to the present is Mole versus Ross (1950) 1 BPR 9101. In that case, there was a gift by Will "Unto Howard Francis Mole and Lily his wife as
Joint legatees." Sugerman J held that gift was to the Moles as tenants in common. His Honour said at 9102: "It is to be noted that the sub-section does not refer to the instrument's disclosing a `contrary intention'; it does not say 'unless the contrary intention appears', nor does it enact that a joint tenancy may be created where the instrument provides that the persons are to take as joint tenants or uses words to the same or similar effect. It enacts that the section is not to apply where the instrument 'expressly provides' that the persons are to take as joint tenants or tenants by entireties." 
His Honour then said that "expressly" often meant no more than "plainly" and then continued: "So that it may be that, on the true construction of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s26.html) if it plainly or clearly appears, not by implication or inference as to the intention but from the plain or clear language of the instrument, that persons are intended to take as joint tenants, they will take as joint tenants although the words used are not 'as joint tenants' but other words more appropriate to the particular class of property which is the subject matter of the disposition." 
He held that the words "Joint legatees" were not enough.

I considered that judgment in Manton versus Parabolic Pty Ltd [(1985) 2 NSWLR ]
at 373 in connection with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s38.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), and I indicated that I thought that a more benign view of the words "clearly indicated" had been taken in later cases. However, the present proceeding relates directly to the construction of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s26.html)
Sugerman J was a master of the law of equity. His decision has stood for some years, and I think it would be quite wrong for me to depart from the approach which he has taken.

In the instant case, the highest that the plaintiff's case goes is that it clearly appears by inference from other dispositions in the Will that the
Prettys are to take as joint tenants. I am not convinced that is so, for reasons I will mention in a moment, but even if it were, the test laid down by
Sugerman J would not have been met.

The matters which Mr Cameron raised were that when one looks at the other dispositions, one can see that the testator has expressly used the word "each" to make sure that gifts are gifts as tenants in common or are several gifts rather than joint gifts. Thus, in the third part, he leaves the property to
Michael and Peter Wilson "to be held in trust until each reaches the age of 21 years". Then he makes gifts to Professor Birch and his godsons, Michael and
Francis Birch, $200 each. He then gives to Mr and Mrs Littler $20. That is not $20 each as it is in the other cases but $20 between them, ergo when one sees the only other gift to a husband and wife, the gift to Dr and Mrs Pretty, it is a gift of the one-third share that they were to receive as joint tenants.

I have a lot of sympathy for that approach and it may possibly be what the testator intended, but it does not seem to me that those matters are sufficient to make the instrument expressly provide that there is to be a joint tenancy. It must be remembered, when making a decision as to the construction of the Will, that the court is not permitted to say what, had the testator contemplated the events which have, in fact, happened, he would have done. So in a recent case, the English Court of Appeal said that the court could not say: "Of course, if he is to murder me, then my estate is to go to ... my nephews." See Re Jones [[1997] TLR 221], 222 noted [(1997) 71 ALJ 598.] That is just speculation. What a court of construction has to do is to examine the words used in the whole of the Will and see whether they have expressly provided for a consequence other than that set out in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s26.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). In my view, they have.

I have not mentioned the submissions of Mr Mallon for the next of kin. He shortly and concisely relied on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s26.html) and to my mind his argument is correct.

Mr Cameron pointed out also that apart from the court's usual disinclination to find there is a partial intestacy, there was an additional factor in that the testator, a bachelor, deliberately divided his estate amongst his friends and gave to his next of kin, his two brothers, in the one case $20 and in the other case 20 cents. This, Mr Cameron emphasised, was because the testator did not wish there to be any partial intestacy. However, the real problem here is that he just did not anticipate the possibility of one of the married beneficiaries for which he had made provision predeceasing him and did not, as wise testators must do, revise his Will every five years to make sure that it was still in accordance with the state of affairs that, in fact, then applied.

The question is whether upon the true construction of Arthur Stuart Wilson's
Will and in the events which have happened, the gift to Dr and Mrs Robert
Arthur Pretty: is a gift to both as joint tenants; is a gift to each as tenants in common; or has lapsed and goes on intestacy.
 is the correct answer but the consequence is that Mrs Pretty takes one- half of that share and the other half fails and as a lapsed share of residue passes as on a partial intestacy.

As to costs, Mr Cameron says that they should be payable out of the one-sixth lapsed share of residue. Mr Mallon submits that the whole one-third described as "the second part" should bear the costs. It is not difficult to appreciate the merits of both points of view.

The ordinary guidelines are set out in the judgment of this court per Maughan,
AJ in Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd versus Paling <case>; [(1924) 25 SR 56] at 60, where, having analysed all the cases, the court said, "I think that the whole trend of modern English decisions is in favour of the view that the costs should come out of residue. ... and this, according to my experience, has been the rule applied in this Court in many unreported decisions and in at least one reported case ... . In several of these cases the subject matter was a pecuniary legacy, but the principle seems to me to be the same." See also
Re Mulcahy <case>; [[1969] VR 545] at 555 and Ledgerwood versus Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (No 2) (Young, J, 25 August 1997, unreported).

Following these guidelines by analogy, the costs should come out of the lapsed share of residue.

After these reasons were given, but before their revision, counsel brought in short minutes. It is thus only necessary to make orders in accordance with those short minutes as slightly amended by me.
