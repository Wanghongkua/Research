JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
HIS HONOUR: By an originating process filed on 25 October 2013 and amended on 12 November 2013 the plaintiff Cameron Davy sought an order pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 601AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html), that the first defendant Australian Securities and Investments Commission reinstate the registration of Balesfire Pty Limited. Balesfire had been deregistered on the application of its directors while proceedings brought by the plaintiff against it in the District Court, for damages for personal injury suffered by the plaintiff when he fell from a ladder in the course of working for Balesfire either as an employee or as an independent contractor, were pending.
A claim for compensation had proceeded and the second defendant Allianz Australia Workers' Compensation Ltd, Balesfire's workers' compensation insurer, had responded to that claim. However, when the formal proceedings were instituted in the District Court, Allianz did not admit indemnity and put into issue the question of employment. It then emerged that Balesfire had been deregistered.
At the time of Balesfire's deregistration its liability to the plaintiff was covered by one or other of a workers' compensation insurance policy issued by the second defendant Allianz, or a public liability policy issued by the third defendant SGIO. Which of them would respond to the claim would ultimately depend on whether Mr Davy was an employee or an independent contractor of Balesfire.
Mr Davy's solicitors sought the consent of the insurers to be "substituted" as a defendant in the District Court proceedings pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html), which relevantly makes an insurer liable to a plaintiff who has a cause of action against a deregistered company which was covered by an insurance policy immediately prior to deregistration. For some reason, which does not readily appear, those advising the plaintiff took the view that there was some novelty or difficulty about joining two insurers in the alternative in the District Court proceedings pursuant to [s 601AG.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) While consent to such a joinder was sought, when it was not forthcoming, instead of making an application for such joinder in the District Court, the present application for reinstatement of Balesfire was brought in this court pursuant to [s 601AH.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html)
In my view, the present application was unnecessary and misconceived as a superior result could have been obtained at much less cost and inconvenience by an application for joinder of the two insurers pursuant to [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) in the District Court. I do not think that the fact that the second defendant Allianz put employment into issue can really be said to be the cause of the present application. Insurers often put in issue liability on one basis or another. The response to that dispute should have been an application under [s 601AG](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) to join the insurer in the District Court, so that the dispute could have been resolved.
Today, Allianz admits that Balesfire was the employer of the plaintiff at the time of the accident in which he was injured, and indicates that it consents to be joined to the District Court proceedings pursuant to [s 601AG.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html) That admission having been made, the potential liability of SGIO as the public liability insurer evaporates. Accordingly, SGIO has been brought to court ultimately for no purpose and no relief is granted against it and it is impossible to see why it should not recover its costs in this respect. However, I do not accept that the joinder of the insurers in this context in the [s 601AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) application was inappropriate in the sense that reinstatement of the company pursuant to [s 601AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) would revive a liability of those insurers which they would otherwise not be exposed to and in those circumstances natural justice would require that they be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the reinstatement question if it were a live one.
Allianz has indicated that it does not oppose an order that the costs of this application be costs in the substantive proceedings, and that is the most generous order that the plaintiff can expect. No application has been made by or against the directors in respect of the costs of these proceedings.
The court notes that: 
The second defendant Allianz Australia Workers' Compensation Ltd admits, for the purpose of these proceedings and for the purpose of the proceedings instituted in the District Court of NSW by the plaintiff against
Balesfire Pty Ltd, that Balesfire Pty Ltd was the employer of the plaintiff at the time of the events which gave rise to the liability asserted in the
District Court proceedings.
The second defendant consents to an order being made by the District Court joining it as an additional defendant in the District Court proceedings to respond to a claim pursuant to [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s
AG.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ag.html)
The Court orders that:
The plaintiff pay the third defendant's costs of these proceedings.
The plaintiff's costs of these proceedings be costs in the District Court proceedings.
