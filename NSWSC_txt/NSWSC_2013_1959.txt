EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
Ms Berberian, counsel for the first defendant, tenders a document which has been previously marked MFI 7. It is the form of an application for employment made by a Mr Vanthavong, who gave evidence before me on Friday. Mr Vanthavong is a leading hand who was working at the first defendant's premises at the time the plaintiff suffered his injury in March of 2004. 
Ms Berberian says the relevance of the document is that it goes to the establishment of the identity of the witness's employer, which she says is not her corporate client. As I understand the argument, if it can be established that supervisors working at the site at the time of the plaintiff's injury were not employees of the first defendant then that consideration may be relevant to the nature, scope and content of any duty owed by the first defendant and more pertinently to the question of apportionment between the defendant and the plaintiff's direct employer, the second defendant.
Mr Lidden of senior counsel, appearing for the plaintiff, objects and joins issue with the relevant issue. He points out that in the statement that was tendered in evidence Mr Vanthavong described his employer as being the first defendant and that no application was made to cross-examine him about that matter under [s 38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) . He also points out, so far as any weight that might be attached to the document is concerned, that it was signed in the early to mid 1990's, a long time before the events with which we are concerned in this case. 
Mr Polin, counsel who appears for the second defendant, adopts Mr Lidden's submission but also points out that it will be shown in due course - and he has documentation by way of company searches to establish it - that the entity that Mr Vanthavong applied to for employment was not his client, but a separate company. He says that, therefore, it is simply not relevant to any fact in issue in the present case.
Acknowledging the force of the submissions made by those counsel who oppose the admission of the document it does seem to me, given that in deciding the second defendant employed the plaintiff, the Court of Appeal expressly left open the question of the identity of the employer of the other persons working at Park-Tec on the day of the plaintiff's accident, that this document is capable of establishing, or at least assisting to establish directly or indirectly the identity of that employer.
Although Mr Vanthavong was not challenged, or otherwise questioned, about who he thought his employer was, in my judgment that matter is neither here nor there for the purposes of determining the admissibility of this document. 
I am conscious that in Pitcher versus Langford [(1991) 23 NSWLR 142] Gleeson CJ, when Chief Justice of New South Wales, observed that the question of employment is indeed a question of mixed fact and law.
In the circumstances, I do not think it was to the point to challenge Mr Vanthavong, a relatively junior person in the hierarchy notwithstanding his status as a leading hand, about who he believed his employer was.
For those reasons I admit MFI 7 as exhibit 1D16. * * *
