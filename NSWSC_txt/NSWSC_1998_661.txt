REGINA versus ADAM JOHN BOWHAY (NO. 4) /97 November 1998 
Dunford J and a Jury of Twelve 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Criminal Division 
JUDGMENT - On admissibility of evidence; see p 365.

HIS HONOUR: Yesterday afternoon the Crown indicated that the next witness it proposed to call had just yesterday supplied further information and a fresh statement. It turns out the witness, Terri Louise Leahy, who made a statement on 10 March 1997, in her fresh statement made yesterday describes RF smoking a bong of cannabis at the witness' home on 7 March 1997, but the accused declining an invitation to do likewise. 
It has been indicated that one of the defences will be diminished responsibility and that the opinions of the psychiatrists will, to a degree at least, be based on alleged drug taking by the accused.

This evidence tends to contradict that hypothesis, and in particular tends to contradict the evidence given by the accused on the voir dire about his drug taking in the days immediately prior to the death of the deceased. It is, therefore, highly relevant and highly probative.

Mr Conditsis has submitted that I should exclude the evidence under [s.137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused or, alternatively, that it should be excluded in the exercise of my discretion under [s.135](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s135.html) because it is unfairly prejudicial to the party.

Such unfairness is alleged to arise not from the nature of the evidence but from the lateness of it. The lateness is unfortunate but I accept the Crown's explanation that, for obvious reasons, Ms Leahy, who has a criminal history, did not wish to disclose to police that she was involved in the supply and the use of cannabis at the time, and that it was only when she spoke to the Crown
Prosecutor yesterday, and her attention was directed specifically to this issue, that she indicated she was prepared to give the evidence on this point.

As I say, the witness has a criminal history and no doubt her credit can be attacked, although I observe that it is difficult to see why she would implicate RF in drug taking and not the accused. It is difficult to see her motivation for such an approach.

But the reliability of the evidence is, of course, a matter for the tribunal of fact and not for me.

In all of the circumstances, the evidence is available, it is relevant, and to exclude it could result in the jury accepting opinions of psychiatrists based upon a hypothesis, namely, drug taking, which was not in fact true. In other words, the trial could go off on a false premise. This would not be in the interests of the community, and for the trial to proceed with all the relevant facts before it could not be said to be unfair to the accused.

Because of the short notice I have suggested, and the Crown has agreed, that the witness will not be called prior to the luncheon adjournment so that Mr
Conditsis can have more time to prepare his cross-examination.

I will have the statement of Terri Louise Leahy dated 10 March 1997 Marked for
Identification 2 and the statement of Terri Louise Leahy dated 16 November Marked for Identification 3.
