EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (REVISED 5 JULY 2012)
This judgment should be read in conjunction with the judgment I delivered in this matter on 26 June 2012.
This matter came before me as Duty Judge on 26 June 2012. On that occasion I gave a judgment in which I indicated (at [16]) that I would make the orders sought by the plaintiff if evidence could be adduced as to the practice of the Registrar-General following the making of an order under [s 138(3)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s138.html) of the [Real Property Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)"). 
The matter was adjourned to today so that the parties could seek to obtain such evidence.
Mr Skinner, who appears for the plaintiff now reads the Affidavit of Ms Fazio sworn 28 June 2012. Ms Fazio annexes a letter sent to the plaintiff's solicitors from the Registrar-General in which the Registrar-General states:- "The Registrar-General on receipt of an Order under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s138.html) of the [Real Property Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/)") undertakes to do the following action:
Cancel the old certificate of Title, Vol 14340 Fol 235; and a notation would be added advising of the cancelled edition of the Certificate of Title.
The Registrar-General would issue a computerised folio of the Registrar.

Any prudent purchaser or mortgagee dealing with the land would conduct a title search. The search of title would disclose the current edition of the
Certificate of Title."
That intimation from the Registrar-General allays the concerns I had about the making of an order under [s 138(3)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s138.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). 
In those circumstances, I make the orders set forth in the document called Short Minutes of Order, initialled by me and dated today and placed with the papers, save that instead of order four in that document, I make the order referred to in paragraph one of the plaintiff's Notice of Motion of 13 April 2012.
