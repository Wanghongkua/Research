REGINA versus WAYNE JOSEPH HOLTEN /98 April 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: In the matter of Wayne Joseph Holten I regret that I feel constrained to refuse bail. I say that because I understand the appalling problem that is faced by persons who suffer from the condition from which Mr. Holten suffers, and I particularly understand the difficulties of persons with that condition in the gaol system and the problems the authorities have within that system, in being able to set up a suitably compassionate and humane regime to enable persons within that system with that condition to live some life of dignity. Further, I understand the admirable objectives of Foley House and of those who work there. Nonetheless, this is a matter in which there are very serious charges, there is not only no presumption of bail but bearing in mind the circumstances that attend the commission of the earlier offences and which are alleged to attend the commission of the major offence with which he presently stands charged, then he is a person who has unfortunately put others at very severe risk. In addition there are a great number of offences still to be dealt with and he is a person who has, on occasions, failed to appear in circumstances in which I can have no confidence that he would attend in the future. Bail is therefore refused. * * *
