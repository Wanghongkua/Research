EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT  
HIS HONOUR: By Originating Process issued on 9 May 2011, Steelco Group Pty Ltd, a judgment creditor of the defendant moves to wind it up on the basis that it is insolvent. The defendant was previously called Demian Constructions Pty Ltd. 
A statutory demand directed to the defendant was not set aside, giving rise to the statutory presumption of insolvency under [s 459C(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459c.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)"). [Section 459S](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459s.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides as follows: 
In so far as an application for a company to be wound up in insolvency relies on a failure by the company to comply with a statutory demand, the company may not, without the leave of the Court, oppose the application on a ground:  that the company relied on for the purposes of an application by it for the demand to be set aside; or  that the company could have so relied on, but did not so rely on (whether it made such an application or not).  
The Court is not to grant leave under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that the ground is material to proving that the company is solvent. 
By Interlocutory Process dated 15 July 2011, the defendant sought leave, in opposing the winding up, to rely on a matter upon which it did not rely in an application to set aside the demand, namely, that the debt was genuinely disputed. However, without any resistance on the part of the defendant, that process was, earlier today, dismissed with costs. 
The defendant has led no evidence as to its solvency. 
On Friday last, 5 August 2011, a newly appointed sole-director of the defendant, Mr Vedat Gulasi, passed a resolution appointing Mr Ozem Kassem as voluntary administrator. [Section 440A(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s440a.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides that: 
The Court is to adjourn the hearing of an application for an order to wind up a company if the company is under administration and the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up. 
The defendant now submits that the hearing of the winding up application should be adjourned for 28 days and that the Court should be satisfied, as required by the section, that it is in the interests of the defendant's creditors for the defendant to continue under administration rather than being wound up. 
Mr Kassem has sworn an affidavit in support of the defendant's position. 
The only basis upon which the adjournment is sought is Mr Kassem's evidence that he has been informed by the newly appointed director (who has held office for three days) that it may be that a deed of company arrangement will emerge which would give the creditors a quicker or potentially better dividend than in a winding up. 
A number of matters, including with respect to Mr Kassem's affidavit, are worthy of comment. 
Firstly, according to Mr Kassem, he has been advised by Mr Gulasi that the defendant has five creditors who are demanding payment. According to him, these include the plaintiff, which is owed $16,000 and Allstop Fire Systems Pty Ltd, which is owed $130,000. 
Information he has been given by Mr Gulasi is obviously wrong. As at 6 April 2011, the amount owed to the plaintiff was $16,625.99. Allstop Fire Systems is a judgment creditor of the defendant for $206,231.82. 
Mr Kassem's affidavit records that a supporting creditor, Employers Mutual NSW Ltd, is owed $10,375. I was informed from the Bar Table that this figure is also understated but in the absence of evidence I place no reliance on the asserted understatement. 
Secondly, there is evidence sourced from an Examination Summons directed to an erstwhile director of the defendant that its only asset is a claim against an entity styled Riverlands Club Holding Pty Ltd (in liq) ("Riverlands"). Mr Kassem's affidavit does not disclose, as the evidence establishes, that on 20 May 2011 he was appointed liquidator of this company. 
Thirdly, the evidence shows that, for a time, Mr Charbel Demian was a director of both the defendant and Riverlands. 
The faint prospect of a term unspecific deed of company arrangement, in the context of the earlier observations with respect to the evidence, falls far short of satisfying me that it is in the interests of the creditors that the company should continue under administration rather than have a liquidator appointed. 
The vast majority of the body of creditors supports the winding up. I am of the view that it is appropriate that the company be wound up. 
In those circumstances I do not propose to adjourn the hearing of the winding up application. This being the case, it is inevitable that a winding up order must follow. 
The plaintiff, however, does not have a consent to appointment by an appropriate qualified liquidator. In the circumstances, I propose to order that the defendant, Tarshu Pty Ltd, be placed under winding up order, but to order further that the order will be stayed until 2.00pm tomorrow and will be made final in the event that an appropriate consent to act is produced by a liquidator.  August 2011  
On 9 August 2011, the plaintiff produced a written consent from Geoffrey Philip Reidy to be liquidator upon which he was appointed. 
His Honour also ordered, pursuant to [s 447A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that the voluntary administration of the defendant end forthwith. His Honour also directed that the plaintiff and supporting creditors be entitled to only one set of costs, collectively, in respect of the proceedings on 8 August 2011. * * *
