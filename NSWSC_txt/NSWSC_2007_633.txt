JUDGMENT  
The notices of motion  There are before the Court a number of notices of motion brought by disparate defendants seeking to strike out particular paragraphs of the
Further Amended Statement of Claim ["FASOC" or "Statement of Claim"] filed on September 2006. The defendants in question are the fourth and fifth defendants [together referred to as "the GCRA parties" or simply "Gen Re"], the sixth defendant ["Carpenter"], and the eighth defendant Goldman Sachs ["Goldman"].  
The proceedings  The FASOC runs for 188 pages covering 610 paragraphs. A convenient approach has been taken by the preparation by the plaintiffs of an epitome of the statement of claim [amended to record causes of action no longer pressed], which mercifully extends across only 11 pages. However following the very extensive citation during address of paragraphs from the FASOC, the reasons are naturally based on the precise terms of the pleading under attack.  The epitome [underlined to give focus] reads as follows:  
INTRODUCTION 
This document is provided to the Court and the parties as an aide. It is a preliminary guide summarising the claims made by HIH as set out in the further amended statement of claim (FASOC). It is not intended to be definitive and is not a substitute either for the FASOC itself or for any evidence. 
The FASOC pleads the various claims brought by HIH Insurance Limited and
HIH Investment Holdings Limited against 10 defendants for losses that the plaintiffs incurred as a result of the takeover of the FAI Group of companies in 1998. 
The defendants are:

The FASOC is divided into 4 sections:  
The first section ("Preliminaries") contains a description of the parties and pleads various statutory requirements applicable to the financial statements that were published by the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June (FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements).  
The second section is entitled "the Course of Events", (paragraphs 21 to ) and pleads, in broadly chronological order, the facts and matters that give rise to the claims against each of the defendants.  
The third section of the pleadings, entitled "Causes of Action" (paragraphs 294 to 583), pleads the causes of action against each of the defendants.  
The fourth and final section of the FASOC (paragraphs 584 to 609) pleads the loss and damage claimed against each defendant. 
The following paragraphs are an overview of [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s2.html) to [4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s4.html) of the FASOC.  [SECTION 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s2.html) OF THE FASOC - THE COURSE OF EVENTS  
The intentions of FAI senior management in relation to the FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements and under-provisioning within the FAI Group (paragraphs 21 to 27) 
In 1998, the FAI Group was a major Australian insurance group. FAI
Insurances Limited (FAI Insurances) was its ultimate holding company. 
During the course of the 1998 financial year, senior management of the FAI
Group, including Messrs Adler, Mainprize and Wilkie (FAI Executive Directors) became aware of a serious shortfall in the provision made by companies within the FAI Group for outstanding claims liabilities under policies of insurance written by them. The necessary increase in provisions would have a substantially adverse effect on the reported results of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998. 
At all material times, it was the intention of the FAI Executive Directors that the FAI Group would publish financial statements for the year ending 30
June 1998 that showed that the Group had made a net profit or alternatively only a minor loss. To achieve that result, they intended that FAI would enter into one or more purported reinsurance contracts, recognise illusory profits under those contracts and thereby improve the reported results for FAI Group for the 97/98 financial year. It was also their intention that the FAI Group would not make the necessary increases in its provision for outstanding claims liabilities.  
The GCRA arrangements (paragraphs 28 to 50, 67 to 69, 73 to 75) 
In March 1998, Mr Mainprize and Mr Wilkie began discussions with GCRA and
GCR for the purpose of procuring a purported reinsurance contract under which
FAI could recognise illusory profits to improve its reported results for the year ending 30 June 1998. GCRA and GCR were informed of FAI's under- provisioning and the fact that senior management of FAI were proposing a "staged" increase in the reserves of the FAI Group over a number of years. 
Discussions between senior management of FAI and GCRA and GCR in relation to a possible contract continued through March and April 1998. In the course of these discussions (in April) GCRA and GCR conducted a due diligence investigation into the financial condition of the FAI Group and concluded that
FAI was under reserved by more than $110 million. 
The discussions led to an agreement that was entered into between GCRA and FAI on 6 May 1998. The agreement (the First GCRA Agreement) consisted of a number of separate contracts and arrangements, including an aggregate excess of loss contract (the First AXOL Contract) which, on its face involved an apparent risk that GCRA would be obliged to pay more in recoveries to FAI than it would receive in premiums. However, the First GCRA Agreement also included other purported reinsurance arrangements (the 6 GCRA Slips) under which FAI companies would be obliged to pay premiums to GCRA totalling $12.5 million and a side letter (the May Side Letter) by which FAI agreed to make no claims under the 6 GCRA Slips without the agreement of GCRA. These parts of the First
GCRA Agreement ensured that GCRA would be protected from any loss under the
First AXOL Contract and that it would also receive a fee for agreeing to enter into the arrangements with FAI. 
In June 1998, FAI sought an increase in the overall aggregate limit under the First AXOL Contract. This led to a renegotiation of the arrangement with the result that the First AXOL Contract was replaced by another aggregate excess of loss contract (the Second AXOL Contract). The Second AXOL Contract was part of the same transaction as the six GCRA Slips and the May Side
Letter. This further agreement between GCRA and FAI (the Second GCRA
Agreement) also included a further side letter by which FAI agreed not to make claims under one section of the Second AXOL Contract. 
As GCRA and GCR were aware, the Second GCRA Agreement entailed no transfer of material insurance risk to GCRA and was in substance a loss making deposit or loan arrangement for FAI. At all material times, GCRA and GCR were aware that it was the intention of senior management of FAI to account for the
Second AXOL Contract as a genuine contract of reinsurance, recognising an illusory profit (net recovery) of approximately $30 million under that contract to improve the reported results of the FAI Group for the year ending June 1998. They were also aware that senior management of FAI intended to mislead the FAI Group auditors as to the substance, purpose and effect of the arrangements that had been entered into with GCRA in order to achieve their accounting objectives. GCRA and GCR had proposed a structure that would allow
FAI senior management to mislead the auditors in these respects.  
Guy Carpenter and the NI Contract (paragraphs 51 to 63, 70 to 72 and 76 to 78) 
In 1998, Guy Carpenter was a broker for FAI. Early in June 1998, Mr Adler asked Guy Carpenter to arrange a purported contract of reinsurance for the purpose of improving the FAI Group's reported results for the year ending 30
June 1998. In this context, Guy Carpenter was told of the existence of a substantial under-provisioning within FAI. 
Later in June 1998, Guy Carpenter approached the US reinsurer, National
Indemnity Company. National Indemnity proposed a purported reinsurance contract which, after some negotiations with Guy Carpenter on behalf of FAI, was entered into on or about 30 June 1998. The contract, covering a number of
FAI's underwriting years, required that FAI pay to National Indemnity premiums totalling $55 million. The maximum amount that FAI could recover under the contract was limited to $50 million. This could increase to $80 million, but only if the conditions set out in a clause in the contract were satisfied.
That contingency was intended to be, and was, an extremely remote possibility, involving two earthquakes occurring in Australia, each causing damage in excess of $5 billion. 
Senior management of FAI intended to account for the NI Contract as a genuine contract of reinsurance, recognising an illusory profit (net recovery) of approximately $30 million under the contract. However, the NI Contract did not involve a transfer of material insurance risk to National Indemnity and could not properly be accounted for as a genuine contract of reinsurance in the manner intended by senior management of FAI. The contract was entered into on the last day of the 97/98 financial year with the object of allowing the
FAI Group to recognise illusory profits to improve its reported results for that year. These financial results would not present a true and fair view of the performance of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 and its position at the end of that year. FAI had not sought any reinsurance for losses caused by earthquakes and the earthquake clause had been included at the instigation of National Indemnity for the sole purpose of giving the contract the appearance, but not the reality, of risk transfer. At all material times, Guy Carpenter was aware of these matters and of the intention of senior management of the FAI Group to mislead the FAI Group auditors in relation to the NI Contract and, in particular, the purpose for which it had been entered into and the date on which it had been entered into, so as to achieve their objective of accounting for the contract as a genuine contract of reinsurance. 
Shortly after the contract had been entered into, Guy Carpenter prepared a backdated cover note (NI Cover Note) containing the terms of the NI Contract with the object of allowing FAI management to create the pretence that the NI
Contract had been entered into at the beginning of the 1997/98 financial year, rather than on the last day of that period.  
The misleading of the FAI Group Auditors and the 26 August meeting (paragraphs 79 to 152) 
The auditors of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 (the
Auditors) were the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. 
In about July and August 1998, there were discussions between senior management of the FAI Group (including the FAI Executive Directors) and the
Auditors in relation to the accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract and the NI Contract. Management of FAI proposed that both contracts should be accounted for as genuine reinsurance contracts, with FAI recognising net recoveries of approximately $30 million under each contract. In order to induce the Auditors to accept this accounting treatment, the FAI Executive
Directors withheld from the Auditors information and documents relevant to the proper accounting treatment of these two contracts. In particular, the
Auditors were not told about the 6 GCRA Slips or the May Side Letter and their connection with the Second AXOL Contract. Also, they were only provided with the NI Cover Note and were not told of the purpose of the NI Contract or the circumstances in which it had been entered into. 
At a meeting on 21 August 1998, Mr Wilkie and Mr Mainprize represented to the Auditors that the two contracts involved the transfer of material reinsurance risk to the reinsurers. Later, the Auditors were provided with an
FAI position paper that represented that the contracts involved risk transfer and had been entered into as part of the FAI Group's normal reinsurance programme. 
At no time during the period of the audit did the FAI Executive Directors disclose to the Auditors the shortfall in FAI's provision for outstanding claims liability. 
On 26 August 1998, a meeting was held at the offices of FAI Insurances between Mr Martyn Scrivens, a partner of Arthur Andersen and the signing partner for the FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements and various officers of
FAI, including Mr Wilkie and Mr Mainprize. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss FAI's proposed accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract and the NI Contract. Representatives of GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter were invited by FAI to attend the meeting. Mr Barnum and Mr Smith, who were agents of both
GCRA and GCR, attended the meeting. Mr Tuckfield, a director of Guy Carpenter, also attended to answer questions about the NI Contract. 
At the meeting, Mr Barnum and Mr Smith, through their statements and also by reason of the information that they deliberately withheld, misled Mr
Scrivens in relation to the Second AXOL Contract. They allowed Mr Scrivens to continue under what they knew to be mistaken assumptions as to the purpose, substance and effect of the arrangements between FAI and GCRA. Guy Carpenter's representative, Mr Tuckfield also made misleading statements to Mr Scrivens in relation to the NI Contract, withheld information relevant to the accounting treatment of that contract and allowed Mr Scrivens to proceed under mistaken assumptions as to the purpose, substance and effect of the NI Contract. 
On or about 3 September 1998, draft financial statements for the FAI
Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 were provided to the Auditors by senior management of FAI. The Second AXOL Contract and the NI Contract had been accounted for as genuine contracts of reinsurance, resulting in a material misstatement of the reinsurance recoveries properly recognisable by companies within the FAI Group. The draft financial statements did not make adequate provision for the FAI Group's outstanding claims liability. As a result of these matters, the draft financial statements materially misstated the financial performance of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 and its position as at the end of that year. 
As a consequence of the conduct of the FAI Executive Directors throughout the period of the audit, and the conduct of GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter at the August meeting, the Auditors accepted the proposed accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract and the NI Contract and did not discover the FAI
Group's serious under-provisioning.  
The publication of the misleading FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements and associated documents on 9 September 1998 (paragraphs 153 to 209) 
The FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements were approved by the FAI board of directors on 9 September 1998. They stated that, in the year ending 30 June , the FAI Group had made an operating profit before tax of $8.609 million and had, as at 30 June 1998, net assets of $337.170 million. 
The FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements accounted for the Second AXOL
Contract and the NI Contract as genuine reinsurance contracts. The financial statements did not make adequate provision for the outstanding claims liabilities of companies within the FAI Group. As a result of these matters, the FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements materially misstated the net profits of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 and its position as at the end of that year. The accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract and the
NI Contract resulted in an overstatement of $35.675 million and $31.078 million respectively in the reported net profits and net assets. The failure to make proper provision for the outstanding claims liabilities of companies within the FAI Group itself resulted in an overstatement in net profits and net assets in the order of $170 million. The financial statements also materially overstated the reinsurance recoveries properly recognisable by the
FAI Group and understated the amount of the FAI Group's net claims incurred and net discounted outstanding claims. 
The FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements were provided to the ASX on 9
September 1998 together with the Directors' Statement, signed by Mr Adler and
Mr Mainprize, the Auditors' Report, a Preliminary Final Report in the form required by the listing rules, and a letter to the ASX from Mr Adler referring to aspects of FAI's reported results. The documents accompanying the FAI Group /98 Financial Statements was materially misleading in the respects pleaded in paragraphs 183 to 200 of the FASOC.  
GSA, Turnbull and Pillemer and Project FireLight (paragraphs 210 to 219) 
In the period from late 1997 to September 1998, GSA, through Mr
Turnbull and Mr Pillemer, was involved with Mr Adler in discussions concerning a proposed joint venture privatisation of entities within the FAI Group, code named Project FireLight. The project was not disclosed to the FAI non- executive directors. 
As part of Project FireLight, GSA was provided with and reviewed a significant amount of financial information relating to the FAI Group. As a result of its investigations, GSA and Messrs Turnbull and Pillemer formed the opinion that the true financial position and net assets of the FAI Group were substantially less than those that were to be reported by the Group for the year ending 30 June 1998. On 12 September 1998, GSA informed Mr Adler that it had decided to abandon Project FireLight.  
The takeover of the FAI Group, the misleading Part B Statement and the conduct of GSA, Turnbull and Pillemer (paragraphs 220 to 293) 
On 9 September 1998, the same day that the FAI Group 97/98 Financial
Statements were provided to the ASX, Mr Adler sent them under cover of a letter to Mr Williams, the CEO of the HIH Group (Williams letter) in connection with a potential takeover of the FAI Group by the HIH Group. 
HIH relied upon the published financial statements of the FAI Group (and the associated documents referred to in paragraph 26) in deciding to make a takeover offer for the FAI Group. On 18 and 21 September 1998, HIH began acquiring shares in FAI Insurances on market, in anticipation of a formal takeover offer. On 23 September 1998, the HIH Group made a formal takeover announcement. 
On or about 28 September 1998, GSA was retained by FAI Insurances as an adviser in relation to the HIH takeover offer. Pursuant to that retainer, GSA agreed to provide FAI Insurances with financial advice in connection with the proposed takeover including advice as to the net worth of the FAI Group. GSA advised the FAI Board not to appoint an independent expert and undertook to provide its own report as to the value of FAI. 
As part of the services it provided to FAI pursuant to its retainer, GSA made two presentations to the FAI Board on 13 and 23 October 1998 and attended a number of FAI Board meetings. In the course of those meetings, drafts of a
Part B Statement to be issued by FAI were considered. These drafts did not disclose that the FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements (being the most recent audited financial statements for the Group) contained any material misstatement. However, each of Mr Adler, Mr Mainprize and GSA knew that those financial statements did not contain a true and fair view of the performance of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 or its position as at the end of that year. 
On no occasion during the course of the takeover, including the presentations that GSA gave to the FAI Board and the Board meetings that they attended, did GSA or Messrs Turnbull and Pillemer disclose to the FAI non executive directors the fact of Project FireLight or the opinions that GSA had reached as to the true net worth of the FAI Group. Further, GSA impliedly represented to the Board that it was appropriate for the FAI Board to approve the issue of the Part B Statement in the form or substantially the form in which it was issued. 
The Part B Statement was approved by the FAI Board, including Mr Adler and Mr Mainprize, on 13 November 1998 and, on the same day, signed by Mr Adler and Mr Harris (one of the FAI non-executive directors). The Part B Statement did not disclose the knowledge that Mr Adler and Mr Mainprize possessed in relation to the misleading nature of the FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements, the fact of Project FireLight or the opinions GSA had reached as a result of its investigations into the financial condition of the FAI Group. Indeed, the
Part B Statement expressly represented that there was no information known to any director that was material to the decision of FAI shareholders whether or not to accept HIH's offer that was not disclosed in the statement. The Part B
Statement also impliedly represented that the FAI Group 97/98 Financial
Statements gave a true and fair view of the financial performance of the FAI
Group for the year ending 30 June 1998 and its financial position as at the end of the year. 
HIH relied upon the misleading Part B Statement in continuing with and concluding the takeover of the FAI Group. The takeover was declared unconditional on 4 January 1999. HIH Investment's takeover costs were $229,969,861.33. HIH Insurance's takeover costs were in the order of $65,500,000.  
SECTION 3 OF THE FASOC - CAUSES OF ACTION 
There are a number of causes of action pleaded against each of the defendants. These are divided into 3 broad groups:  claims relating to the misleading of the Auditors (paragraphs 294 to 434);  claims relating to the publication of the misleading FAI Group 97/98
Financial Statements and their provision to the HIH Group (paragraphs 435 to ); and  claims arising from the misleading conduct of various parties in the course of the takeover (paragraphs 539 to 583).  
A separate index lists all of the pleaded claims, by reference to the paragraphs of the FASOC. The following paragraphs contain an overview of the claims in each of the categories.  
Claims relating to the misleading of the Auditors 
These claims are brought against each of the FAI Executive Directors,
GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter. The claims are brought both under the [Trade
Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) and the Corporations Law (the Law, being the Law as it then applied; the causes of action arising thereunder are continued by [s.1400](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1400.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)). The claims include direct claims and accessorial claims. 
As noted in paragraphs 17 to 23 above, each of the FAI Executive
Directors provided misleading information to the Auditors during the audit of the FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements. The claim is that the FAI Executive
Directors or FAI Insurances misstated to the Auditors the financial performance of the FAI Group during the year ending 30 June 1998 and its financial position as at the end of that year. This conduct gives rise to direct claims against each of those directors under section 1005 of the Law for breach of section 999. These contraventions also form the basis of accessorial claims against each of GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s79.html) of the Corporations Law. 
Alternatively, the conduct of each of the FAI Executive Directors is attributed to FAI Insurances and the FASOC pleads contraventions by FAI
Insurances of section 999 of the Law and [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s52.html) of the TPA. These contraventions form the basis of accessorial claims pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s79.html) of the Law and section 75B of the TPA against each of the FAI Executive
Directors, GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter. 
There are also three further alternative formulations of the relevant primary contraventions of the FAI Executive Directors and FAI Insurances, giving rise to alternative accessorial claims. 
In addition to the accessorial claims, there are direct claims for breaches of section 999 of the Law and [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s52.html) of the TPA by GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter arising out of their conduct at the 26
August meeting. 
Paragraphs 409 to 434 of the FASOC pleads facts and matters relevant to the causation case that is made in respect of the claims relating to the misleading of the auditors.  
Claims relating to the publication of the misleading FAI Group 97/98 financial statements 
Again, these claims are brought against each of the FAI Executive
Directors, GCRA, GCR and Guy Carpenter. The claims are brought both under the
TPA and the Law and include direct claims and accessorial claims. 
There are claims against Mr Adler and Mr Mainprize for breach of section of the Law relating to the statements made by each of them in the
Directors' Statement. 
As noted in paragraphs 24 to 26 above, the FAI Group 97/98 Financial
Statements and associated documents that were provided to the ASX on 9
September 1998 were materially misleading. The claim is that, by providing these documents to the ASX, Mr Adler, or alternatively FAI Insurances, materially misstated the financial performance of the FAI Group during the year ending 30 June 1998 and its financial position as at the end of that year. Mr Adler breached section 999 of the Law by sending these financial statements and accompanying documents to the ASX. Alternatively, this was the conduct of FAI Insurances and gave rise to contraventions of section 999 of the Law and [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s52.html) TPA. 
These contraventions form the basis of accessorial claims pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s79.html) of the Corporations Law and section 75B of the TPA. Again, there are three further alternative formulations of the primary contraventions that also give rise to alternative accessorial claims. 
The sending of the Williams letter gave rise to a breach by Mr Adler of section 995 of the Law. Alternatively, this was the conduct of FAI Insurances and Mr Adler was involved in that contravention within the meaning of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s79.html) of the Law. 
Paragraphs 535 to 538 of the FASOC plead facts and matters relevant to the causation case that is made in respect of the claims relating to the publication of the misleading FAI Group 97/98 financial statements.  
Claims arising from the misleading conduct of various parties during the course of the takeover 
These claims are made against Mr Adler, Mr Mainprize, GSA, Mr Turnbull and Mr Pillemer. Claims are brought under section 1005 and [section (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s704.html) of the Corporations Law. 
The following claims are made:  direct claims against GSA, Mr Turnbull and Mr Pillemer for breach of section 995 of the Law relating to the misleading of the FAI non-executive directors;  direct claims against Mr Adler and Mr Mainprize for breaches of section and [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s704.html) of the Law relating to the misleading Part B statement;  alternatively, the issue of the Part B Statement by FAI Insurances gave rise to a contravention by the company of section 995 of the Law and Mr Adler and Mr Mainprize were involved in that contravention pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s79.html) of the Law;  accessorial claims against Mr Turnbull and Mr Pillemer arising out of their involvement in the contraventions of section 995 of the Law by FAI
Insurances, Mr Adler and Mr Mainprize. 
Paragraphs 574 to 583 of the FASOC plead facts and matters relevant to the causation case that is made in respect of these claims.  [SECTION 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s4.html) OF THE FASOC - LOSS AND DAMAGE 
Claims are made against each of Mr Adler, Mr Mainprize, Mr Wilkie, GCRA,
GCR and Guy Carpenter in relation to the misleading of the Auditors and the publication of the misleading FAI Group 97/98 Financial Statements. The amounts claimed are:  $229,969,861 by HIH Investment Holdings Ltd  $65,500,000 by HIH Insurance Ltd 
Total: $295,469,861 plus interest (currently in the order of $234,202,364.19) and costs. 
Claims are made against each of Mr Adler, Mr Mainprize, GSA, Mr
Turnbull and Mr Pillemer in relation to conduct during the course of the takeover. The amounts claimed are:  $195,868,024 by HIH Investment Holdings Ltd  $65,500,000 by HIH Insurance Ltd 
Total: $261,368,024 plus interest (currently in the order of $207,171,753*) and costs.  
These were costs incurred after the takeover announcement was made by HIH, and do not include some $34.1 million incurred in acquiring shares in FAI
Insurances before then.  
The extensive submissions  The parties have exchanged extraordinarily detailed written submissions which extend to cover over two hundred pages [including a number of charts and schedules].  
Use of the word "demurrable"  Although from time to time and in a rather old-fashioned way I use the word 'demurrable' this should not be taken to suggest that I am not familiar with and do not intend to apply the uniform civil procedure rules. The relevant rule which governs an application for a strike out is as follows:  [r 14.28] Circumstances in which court may strike out pleadings  .28 (1) The court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the whole or any part of a pleading be struck out if the pleading:  discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence or other case appropriate to the nature of the pleading, or  has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings, or  is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.  
The court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (1).  
The principles  Shortly stated the principles to be applied are as follows:  the defendants must meet a high threshold of persuasion;  the Court should only exercise its power if the pleaded case has been shown to be "obviously untenable" and the power of the Court should be exercised sparingly;  the test to be applied has been expressed in various ways "but all of the verbal formulae which have been used are intended to describe a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome of the proceeding if it were allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way": Agar versus Hyde <case>; <case>;  as Dixon J put it in Dey versus Victorian Railways Commissioners <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 62] at 91, "once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process" <case>; [(1964) 112 CLR 125] infra].  For obvious reasons save as insofar as it is strictly necessary to do so, the Court on a strike out motion should be cautious on occasion in relation to determining questions of law. In some circumstances determining certain such questions will be naturally appropriate.  Barwick CJ in General Steel (supra) at 129 to 130 adopted the summary of authorities by Dixon J, as his Honour then was, in Dey versus Victorian Railways
Commissioners <case>; [(1949) 78 CLR 62] at 91:  "A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination in the appointed manner by the court with or without a jury. The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious." [Emphasis added.]  For those reasons I have approached the instant applications from the viewpoint that save where an issue of law may be seen as so clear as to require a section of the statement of claim to be struck out, the reasons will involve no more than identifying matters of law which are distinctly arguable.  Finally and with particular regard to some of the parameters of these instant applications, it is appropriate to note that in Preston versus Star City
Pty Ltd [[1999] NSWSC 1273], Wood CJ at CL:  referred [at 26] to the highly demanding nature of the test imposed upon a party seeking summary disposal of a claim by citing with approval the following observations by Rolfe AJA with whose reasons Priestley JA agreed in
Air Services Australia versus Zarb (Unreported, NSWCA, Priestley, Powell JJA and
Rolfe AJA, 26 August 1998):  "The demanding nature of the test is in no way lessened in circumstances where there are the (sic) potential for difficult factual and legal issues to arise.
Rather, as the decision in Webster made clear, it is heightened: see also
Wickstead & Ors versus Browne [(1992) 30 NSWLR 1] and Esanda
Finance Corp Ltd versus Peat Marwick Hungerfords [(1997) 188 CLR 241."]  referred [at 29] with approval to the observations emphasising the need for caution in emerging areas of the law as noted by Master Allen as he then was, in Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia versus Hunt [(1984) 44 ALR ]
at 373-4, in a passage cited with approval by Badgery-Parker J in Gibson v
Parkes District Hospital [(1991) 26 NSWLR 9] at 35/36:  "...It is not by any means rare in the history of the development of the common law that a high appellate court, in enunciating a novel development in the law, albeit one avowedly based on a miscellany of old cases, has chosen to use general words of imprecise limits in meaning to facilitate the arrival, in later cases, of the final form of the development without the need to overrule what earlier had been stated. That being so I am of opinion that a court at first instance should be particularly astute not to risk stifling the development of the law by summarily throwing out of court actions in respect of which there is a reasonable possibility that it will be found, in the development of the law, still embryonic, that a cause of action does lie. The risk of injustice to the plaintiff, which summary termination of his claim would entail, is real. One cannot predict, with firm assurance, what the future holds as the final formulation of the new development."  cited [at 30] with approval, NRMA Insurance Ltd versus A W Edwards Pty Ltd,
NSWCA 11 November 1994, where the Court of Appeal reversed a decision of Cole
J (as he then was) in a case that was likely to turn upon developing doctrine, so as to allow the action to continue. Kirby P, with whom Powell JA agreed, said (at p7):  "... the more complex and arguable is the legal point, and the more dependent it may seem to be upon debatable factual premises, the less likely is it that the peremptory relief sought by a party will be appropriate to the circumstances of the case, particularly where it would have the consequence of terminating proceedings altogether or terminating them forever against one party."  observed [at 35] that:  "The strike out power is not appropriate in a case where the issue primarily relates to a conflict as to matters of fact or of credit, notwithstanding that one may have a strong prima facie view as to the ultimate result: Sidebottom v Cureton [(1937) 54 WN 88],
Bank of New South Wales versus Murray [(1963) 80 WN 272] and Spellson versus George [(1992) 26 NSWLR 666] at 678 per Young AJA, observations made in relation to SCR Pt13 r5, but equally applicable to SCR Pt15 r26."  
The issues  During the exchange of submissions in relation to the strike out application the plaintiffs determined that they would not press the parts of the pleading alleging a joint enterprise involving each of Gen Re and Guy
Carpenter.  Without being exhaustive the following remaining matters were addressed in the extensive submissions:  
Accessorial Liability - Extent of knowledge  i. Whether two of three types of accessorial claims alleged against Gen Re and
Guy Carpenter should be struck out on the basis of the extent of knowledge alleged against them;  
Indirect reliance  iv. Whether certain indirect reliance claims against Gen Re, Guy Carpenter and
GSA should be struck out in light of the Court of Appeal's decision in Digi-
Tech (Australia) Ltd versus Brand and Ors <case>; [(2004) 62 IPR 184];  
Damages  v. Whether parts of the damages claims should be struck out.  
Findings  Again, without being exhaustive, the crucial findings in the reasons which follow are:  
As to accessorial liability and extent of knowledge  i. the GCRA Parties and Guy Carpenter are each alleged to have known of their own contracts and of the above-described under-provisioning;  ii. they are each alleged to have taken steps to assist FAI to engage in the misleading conduct;  iii. depending upon the precise circumstances, it is arguable that it may not matter that each defendant did not know of all key respects in which FAI/the
Executive Directors were ultimately to engage in the misleading conduct - it is arguable that the focus is on the essential elements, not the particular details of the contravention;  iv. in the present state of the law it is arguable that if each defendant knew of one or more method that the principal contravener intended to use to mislead, that would be sufficient to make good the case of accessorial liability.  v. it is arguable that the intention and knowledge requisite to be proven of an accessory in order to establish accessorial liability:  a) is knowledge of the type of harm and not the extent of harm,  b) hence does not extend to a requirement to have knowledge of all of the consequences [or possible consequences] of the principal contravener's action.  [The 'divide' is as between:  * The GCRA/GCR contention that the plaintiffs must prove that these defendants had actual knowledge of each essential matter-vide each matter which must be proved to establish the contravention in the terms alleged  [which GCRA/GCR say must include knowledge of each of:  the overstatements of net profit and net assets by reason of the accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract;  the overstatements of net profit and net assets by reason of the accounting treatment of the NI Contract;  the overstatements of net profit and net assets by reason of failing to bring outstanding claims liabilities to account.]  and  * the plaintiffs' contention that actual knowledge of each of the matters described in 1, 2 and 3 above is not required but that they have pleaded sufficient of the relevant knowledge to permit the matter to go to trial, the ultimate curial decision being required to treat with:  a. close questions of fact and degree as well as,  b. interrelated questions both of fact as well as law.  [These being matters for the Court's evaluation from case to case.]  [Hence the plaintiffs' contention is that the requisite knowledge for an accessory is knowledge that the principal contravener intends to engage or is engaging in some conduct in trade or commerce, being the same type of conduct as that which actually occurs, and knows facts sufficient to establish that such conduct would be characterisable as misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.]  
Indirect reliance  vi. whether or not the Digi-Tech decision is to be read in the fashion suggested by the defendants does not require to be presently answered. The position at law has not so crystallised as to justify the strike out motion.  
Damages  vii. There is no substance to the strike out claim.  
Accessorial liability claims  An analysis of what are and are not necessary elements underpinning a cause of action for accessorial liability serves as a convenient starting point.  Notwithstanding that claims are made under both the Corporations Law and the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), I accept that it is convenient to focus upon the principles applicable to TPA claims: the principles that apply, if not materially identical are sufficiently close to warrant the same attention; the TPA claims are a little simpler and there is more case law concerning such claims.  It is necessary to distinguish between the following concepts:  i. the misleading conduct by the principal contravener said to breach [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html);  ii. the loss or damage said to be suffered by the claimant and sued upon under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) [including issues of whether the loss/damage sued upon was caused by the contravention by the principal];  iii. the conduct by the accessory said to aid/abet etc that conduct [falling within one or more of the categories of s.75B];  iv. the knowledge required of the accessory before they may be found liable for a claim under [s.82.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html)  [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) of the TPA relevantly provides as follows (emphasis added):  "A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of [section 52]... may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention."  It is [s82(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) which creates the relevant cause of action, not [s.52:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html)
Wardley Australia Ltd versus State of Western Australia <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 514] at 525.3.  Section 75B of the TPA relevantly provides as follows:  
A reference in this Part to a person involved in a contravention of a provision of Part ... V ...shall be read as a reference to a person who:  has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention;  has induced whether by threats or promises or otherwise, the contravention;  has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention; or  has conspired with others to effect the contravention.  To my mind each of the following propositions are clearly arguable on the present state of the law:  i. the gist of an accessorial liability cause of action is that the claimant has suffered loss or damage by conduct of another person (the principal contravener): see generally the analysis in Western Australia versus Wardley
Australia Ltd <case>; [(1991) 30 FCR 245] at 257 and 259 (Full Federal Court);  ii. [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) enables the claimant to recover "the amount of the loss or damage", implicitly being the loss or damage they have suffered by the conduct of the principal contravener.;  iii. that loss or damage may be recovered either by action against that principal contravener "or against any person involved in the contravention";  iv. hence one contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) may give rise to causes of action against various defendants in relation to the same amount of loss or damage;  v. the text of [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) indicates that the required causation element is that the claimant has suffered loss or damage by the conduct of the principal contravener;  vi. the text makes clear that it is no element of a claim against a person involved in a contravention that the actions of that person has caused the loss or damage which is sued upon;  vii. a person will be taken to be involved in a contravention when they fall within one of the provisions in s.75B(1) of the TPA;  viii. they may fall within more than one provision;  ix. allegations that a defendant both aided a contravention and was knowingly concerned in a contravention do not create different causes of action. They are simply different routes to establishing the cause of action under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html), being different specifications of how the relevant defendant was involved in the contravention by the principal contravener, which contravention caused the loss/damage sued upon.  
The core complaint by Gen Re and Guy Carpenter  The core complaint against the accessorial liability claims made by these defendants is that they are sought to be made liable for misleading conduct involving broadly three aspects [the Second AXOL Contract, the NI Contract and under-provisioning by FAI], when it has only been alleged that they each had knowledge of two of those three aspects [ie it is not alleged that Gen Re had knowledge of the NI Contract, or that Guy Carpenter had knowledge of the
Second AXOL Contract]. The proposition is that neither the GCRA parties nor
Guy Carpenter had knowledge of what they contend are all of the constituent elements of the contraventions by the directors/FAI alleged in the pleading.  Guy Carpenter also seeks to suggest [in contrast to Gen Re] that its knowledge of significant under-provisioning is insufficient as there is no allegation that it had knowledge of a "shortfall of $170 million". Guy
Carpenter also appears to assert that it cannot be an accessory in respect of that part of the misleading conduct relating to the under-provisioning in the accounts as it did nothing to facilitate it.  The loss or damage sued upon by the plaintiffs here is the purchase price of FAI, it being alleged that the shares of FAI were worthless when purchased.
Issues of causation are put in somewhat different ways for the various different causes of action.  As against Gen Re and Guy Carpenter on the accessorial liability claims it is alleged that but for the misleading and deceptive conduct of FAI/the executive directors - in which conduct Gen Re and Guy Carpenter were involved - the plaintiffs would not and/or could not have proceeded to purchase FAI.  In my view there is an arguable case in support of each of the following propositions:  i. for the accessorial liability claims against the defendants to succeed it is not necessary to show that their conduct was a cause of any particular loss or damage suffered by the plaintiffs;  ii. rather, it is necessary to show that particular contravening conduct by
FAI and/or the executive directors caused certain loss or damage to the plaintiffs, and that each of the relevant defendants were "involved" in that contravention or in those contraventions;  iii. equally, a claim against an alleged accessory does not require proof that they themselves engaged in misleading conduct;  iv. rather, it involves showing that they were involved in one of the relevant ways in another person's misleading conduct.  
Matters of characterisation  In the manner in which the motions were argued there has been some special focus placed upon the legal characterisation of the claims made as against
GCRA parties. The matter is generally explained in the following terms in the submissions of GCRA parties:  "It is important to understand that, so far as it is relevant to GCRA and GCR, three alternative approaches have been taken to the characterisation of the misleading conduct said to give rise to the contraventions. Each approach has been pleaded in the alternative:  
Approach 1  a) the first approach characterises the misleading conduct as the dissemination by Adler, Mainprize, Wilkie and FAI Insurances (as relevant) of information in relation to the Second AXOL Contract and its appropriate accounting treatment that was false and misleading. This approach is narrower than the two characterisations described below because it relies solely on conduct in relation to the Second AXOL Contract. No reliance is placed on either the NI Contract or FAI's Inadequate Claims Provisions. These submissions will refer to this as the "narrow contravention";  
Approach 2  b) the second approach characterises the misleading conduct as materially misstating to the Auditors the amount of reinsurance recoveries which FAI could recognise, thereby materially misstating FAI's financial performance and financial position. [See, for example, paragraph 301, FASOC]. Under this approach, reinsurance recoveries have been improperly recognised (and hence financial performance and position overstated) by virtue of two separate matters: (a) improper accounting for the Second AXOL Contract and (b) improper accounting for the NI Contract. These submissions will refer to this as the "middle contravention";  
Approach 3  c) the third approach characterises the misleading conduct as materially misstating to the Auditors the "financial performance of the FAI Group during the year ending 30 June 1998 and its financial position at the end of that year". [See, for example, paragraph 295, FASOC.] Particulars subsequently supplied have clarified that the misstatement of financial performance and position is in fact an overstatement of profits and assets. Under this approach, profits and assets have been misstated by reason of three separate matters: (a) improper accounting for the Second AXOL Contract; (b) improper accounting for the NI Contract; and (c) failing to reveal the true extent of
FAI's Inadequate Claims Provisions. These submissions will refer to this as the "broad contravention"."  [I interpolate to note that as will appear from what follows, these characterisations are not always strictly accurate.]  
Dealing with the challenges to the ' broad allegation'  For the reasons given by the plaintiffs there is no substance in the challenge to the manner in which this allegation is pleaded or to the suggestion that the pleading is demurrable. Adopting those reasons the following is apparent in terms of a fair explanation of the plaintiffs' case suitable to be tried:  i. The primary allegation against the executive directors and FAI in relation to both misleading the auditors and the publication of misleading accounts is the "broad" allegation: namely, that the executive directors and FAI "materially misstated [to the auditors or in the published accounts] the financial performance of the FAI Group during the year ending 30 June 1998 and its financial position as at the end of that year". That allegation is put as against both the executive directors (Adler, Wilkie and Mainprize) and against
FAI itself. It is also pleaded as a contravention of both s.999 of the
Corporations Law and [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the TPA. But these permutations do not alter the central, simple substance.
The first example of that allegation in relation to misleading of the auditors is found at [295] of the FASOC and at [441] in relation to publication of the accounts.  ii. In answers to request for further particulars the plaintiffs have confirmed that the material misstatements consisted of an overstatement of net profits before tax of the FAI Group for the year ending 30 June 1998, and of the net assets of the FAI Group as at 30 June 1998, the overstatements being by the amounts as alternatively particularised in particulars (b), (c) and (d) of the relevant paragraphs. Those particulars specify overstatements in the net profits and net assets of the FAI Group by an amount in the order of respectively $235m, $205m and $200m.  iii. The first of these figures ($235m) relates to a summation of the overstatement of profits and assets involved in combination of the effect of the accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract, the NI Contract and under-provisioning. The second figure ($205m) relates to a summation just of the effect of the accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contract and under- provisioning, and the third ($200m) relates to a summation of the accounting treatment of the NI Contract and under-provisioning. The second and third of these particulars are put in the alternative to the first.  iv. Gen Re concedes that it is not going to challenge here that it had knowledge of the substantial under-provisioning within FAI.  v. There is nothing artificial about this identification of the misleading conduct. There are specific entries and statements in the 1998 financial accounts relating to net profits before tax and net assets of the FAI Group.
The same is true of the draft accounts provided to the auditors. It is the case of the plaintiffs that these figures were false, being overstated by amounts in the order of what has been identified. Such a formulation of a misleading conduct case is entirely unremarkable.  vi. In the nature of such things, auditors spend some time reviewing draft accounts and discussing issues with management prior to settling the accounts that they are prepared to certify. It is alleged in particulars (b), (c) and of [295] of the FASOC (for example) that, by reason of the identified matters, the executive directors overstated the net profits and net assets of the FAI Group in the draft accounts provided to the auditors by the relevant amounts. It is specified at particular (a)(iii) of [295] that they failed at any material time to correct the relevant misstatements identified in earlier versions of the draft financial statements. The case is thus the same in substance as the publication of accounts case which is the second half of the case.  vii. The fact that the executive directors had a period of time during the conduct of the audits to correct the misstatements does not change the substance of the analysis. The relevant entries in the draft accounts were false `when first provided to the auditors. They were false on each subsequent occasion draft accounts were provided to the auditors. At no stage prior to finalisation of the accounts on 9 September 1998 were the false entries corrected or the misleading conduct drawn to the attention of the auditors.
That the misleading conduct was engaged in, repeated and not corrected over a period of time does not alter the fact that in essence there is one complaint of misleading conduct in relation to misleading of the auditors.  viii. Gen Re's articulation of the "broad" contravention thus is erroneous. It fails to recognise that on this "broad" contravention, properly understood, the contravention is not a simple matter of adding together three disparate elements and pretending that they are one piece of conduct. Rather, it is identifying specified conduct - notably insertion of line items in published and draft accounts - which are said to be misleading, where the degree to which they are misleading is identified in particulars (b), (c) and (d).  ix. In any event, the "course of conduct" complaint of Gen Re can have no application with respect to the contraventions alleged relating to publication of the 1998 accounts.  
Dealing with the challenges to the ' middle' allegation  Here again for the reasons given by the plaintiffs there is no substance in the challenge to the manner in which this allegation is pleaded or to the suggestion that the pleading is demurrable. Adopting those reasons the following is apparent in terms of a fair explanation of the plaintiffs' case suitable to be tried:  i. The "middle" level of alleged contravention is pleaded (for the s.999 contraventions) at [301] of the FASOC relating to misleading of the auditors and [447] relating to publication of the accounts. Here the allegation is that the relevant documents and the executive directors "materially misstated the amount of reinsurance recoveries that could properly be recognised by companies within the FAI Group and thereby materially misstated the financial performance of the FAI Group during the year ending 30 June 1998 and its financial position as at the end of that year". The amounts specified in the relevant particulars is in the order of $65m, being the summation of the erroneous accounting treatment of the two purported reinsurance contracts taken together. There is a line item entry in the 1998 accounts for reinsurance recoveries.  ii. Once again, these allegations relate to conduct that is readily identifiable. That is so not merely in relation to the statements of the net profits and net assets of the FAI Group as at 30 June 1998. The 1998 financial statements have a specific line item relating to reinsurance recoveries. It is the case of the plaintiffs that that item was false. Similarly, it is the case of the plaintiffs that the draft accounts provided by the executive directors to the auditors contain a false entry of the same kind. Again, there is nothing remarkable about this type of pleading.  iii. To make a claim under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) of the TPA relating to a contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) it is necessary to establish two things: that the principal contravener (usually being a corporation) has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) and that this contravention has caused the claimant loss or damage.  iv. A cause of action under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) thus arises where the claimant can point to loss or damage having been suffered as a result of identifiable conduct. Sometimes that conduct will be one distinct and confined representation. At other times, the relevant conduct will encompass a broader set of acts or omissions over a period of time.  v. In some contexts it is not sensible or appropriate to break a set of acts and omissions down into particular distinct statements as opposed to having regard to the totality of the relevant conduct: see eg Trade Practices
Commission versus Lamova Publishing Corp Pty Ltd <case>; [(1979) 28 ALR 416] at 421 per Lockhart J; AJ Thompson Pty Ltd versus KLK
Manufacturing Pty Ltd [(1986) ATPR 40-718] per Fisher
J at 47,879-80, upheld Sutton versus AJ Thompson Pty Ltd (in liq) [(1987) 73 ALR ]
at 236-8 (discussed further below); note also Lezam Pty Ltd versus Seabridge
Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [(1992) 35 FCR 535] at 541.  vi. The issue of identifying the misleading conduct is connected to the issue of causation. Where reliance is alleged it is necessary to identify what was relied upon and by whom.  vii. For example, in a conversation there could be a series of quite distinct representations made (eg "this is a good business"; "the business has revenue of $1million per annum"; "the business made a profit of $100,000 last year").
Or the representations might be made during the course of three separate conversations. They might be made by different representatives of the seller.
The person who is the object of the conduct may rely on just one of these representations, or two or three, or they may have merged into one overall impression created in the object's mind as a result of the conversation (eg "it is a profitable business"). The relevant conduct for any TPA claim must be assessed in light of the evidence.  viii. If the object of the conduct says "I took the conduct to suggest X", then the question for the court is whether the contravener did engage in conduct X (ie whether X was communicated by the contravener's acts or omissions) and whether the claimant suffered loss of damage caused by the contravener having engaged in conduct X.  ix. The assessment of whether or not conduct is misleading involves looking at the conduct as a whole. The case of Butcher versus Lachlan Elder Realty Pty
Ltd <case>; [(2004) 218 CLR 592] concerned whether or not a representation implicit in a diagram in a real estate agent's brochure - which was erroneous - was relevantly characterisable as misleading conduct by the agent. The majority held it was not. At [39], having quoted from Yorke versus Lucas <case>; [(1985) 158 CLR 661] at 666 with respect to when an agent might be held liable for a representation based upon information sourced elsewhere, their Honours said:  "In applying those principles, it is important that the agent's conduct be viewed as a whole. It is not right to characterise the problem as one of analysing the effect of its "conduct" divorced from "disclaimers" about that "conduct" and divorced from other circumstances which might qualify its character. Everything relevant the agent did up to the time when the purchasers contracted to buy the Rednal land must be taken into account."  x. McHugh J, who was in dissent on the facts, stated the principles similarly at [109] (citations omitted):  "The question whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive is a question of fact. In determining whether a contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) has occurred, the task of the court is to examine the relevant course of conduct as a whole. It is determined by reference to the alleged conduct in the light of the relevant surrounding facts and circumstances. It is an objective question that the court must determine for itself. It invites error to look at isolated parts of the corporation's conduct. The effect of any relevant statements or actions or any silence or inaction occurring in the context of a single course of conduct must be deduced from the whole course of conduct. Thus, where the alleged contravention of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) relates primarily to a document, the effect of the document must be examined in the context of the evidence as a whole. The court is not confined to examining the document in isolation. It must have regard to all the conduct of the corporation in relation to the document including the preparation and distribution of the document and any statement, action, silence or inaction in connection with the document."  xi. Just as the question of whether conduct is misleading cannot be divorced from the whole course of conduct, so too the question of what the conduct is must be seen in the whole context.  xii. The following factors may be taken to be relevant in assessing what the relevant "conduct" was for a claim made under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) relating to conduct in contravention of [s.52:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html)  a) the particular acts or omissions;  b) the context in which those acts/omissions occurred;  c) the understanding likely to be, and actually, created by those in the object of the conduct.  xiii. The issue of identifying the misleading conduct cannot be divorced from consideration of the facts. It is not something that may be done by reference to pleadings alone. Indeed, so much is implicit in the very label that Gen Re has attached to the three types of contravention alleged: characterisation.  Returning to the facts it may be observed that GCRA and GCR do not assert that the middle and broad contraventions alleged against FAI Insurances and its executive directors are not arguable. GCRA and GCR accept that misleading conduct can be the overall effect of a complex amalgam of a number of acts and omissions occurring over a period of time.  However GCRA and GCR whilst accepting that it is all very well to plead such a complex amalgam, go on to observe that if one does so, that will have necessary consequences for allegations that others were "involved" in those contraventions. The more complex the sequence of events which comprise the misleading conduct, the more essential facts there will be.  In many ways this very complexity of the plaintiffs' allegations of misleading conduct is an important reason why in this particular case, the strike out application should not be acceded to. The complexities involved are demonstrated in what GCRA and GCR themselves put forward in terms of a consideration of the content and the structure of particulars supplied in relation to paragraph 295 of the further amended statement of claim. Using their own words these parties submit as follows:  
This [ie paragraph 295] is the pivotal paragraph of the FASOC which draws together each of the strands of argument giving rise to the broad contravention relating to the misleading of the auditors. It is important to understand that the complexity runs in two directions, as is demonstrated in diagrammatic form in the GCRA/GCR document [MFI J1] (being the diagram saved onto a floppy disk). Along a horizontal axis, one sees acts and omissions relating to three separate matters. The first distinct matter is the Second
AXOL Contract. The acts and omissions relating to that matter are grouped together in particular (a)(i)(A) of paragraph 295. The second distinct matter is the NI Contract. The acts and omissions relating to that matter are grouped together in particular (a)(i)(B). The third distinct matter is FAI's
Inadequate Claims Provision. The acts and omissions relating to that matter are grouped together in particular (a)(i)(C). Then, along a vertical axis, one sees acts and omissions occurring over time with respect to each of those three matters. For example, the acts and omissions occurring over time in relation to the Second AXOL Contract involved:  a) failing to provide the Auditors with all of the documents material to
Second AXOL Contract (particular (a)(i)(A)(I));  b) failing to disclose matters material to the decision of the Auditors as to whether to accept the proposed accounting treatment for the Second AXOL
Contract (particular (a)(i)(A)(II));  c) making misleading representations in relation to the Second AXOL Contract (particular (a)(i)(A)(III));  d) confirming the proposed accounting treatment of the Second AXOL Contact in the FAI Position Paper (particular (a)(i)(A)(IV));  e) providing the auditors draft financial statements which understated net discounted outstanding claims and misstated net profits and net assets by reason of the Second AXOL Contract (particular (a)(ii)); and  f) failing at any time to correct the misstatements in the draft financial statements (particular (a)(iii)).  In the result both the "broad" and "middle" contraventions are seen to be properly pleaded as such given the specific line items they relate to in the final and draft 1998 FAI Group accounts.  
The necessary conduct by the accessory  The parties have exchanged cross submissions throwing up a lively issue as to the extent to which there is utility in attempting to compare principles drawn from the criminal law with cases of misleading conduct. Here again it is inappropriate for the Court presently to treat with these submissions put by the respective parties otherwise than by indicating what may or may not be arguable.  On that basis it seems to me that with respect to an identification of the principle which informs the nature of the conduct by an accessory required to be involved in a contravention, the plaintiffs submissions are very clearly arguable in the present state of the law. That is to say:  i. Clearly enough the forms of accessorial liability provided for in s.75B of the TPA are drawn from criminal law, and have been interpreted in that light:
Yorke versus Lucas <case>; [(1985) 158 CLR 661] at 669.  ii. There is a close - although not complete - analogy here between the criminal law notions and the civil concept of accessorial liability enshrined in s.75B of the TPA and its analogues.  iii. In Giorgianni versus The Queen <case>; [(1985) 156 CLR 473], at 493, Mason J noted that the terms "aid and abet" are generally used to refer to the conduct of a person who is present at the commission of the offence, whilst the terms "counsel or procure" are generally used in relation to the conduct of an accessory before the fact. Otherwise, the same legal principles apply to these notions.  iv. In Giorgianni it was indicated that to be secondarily liable in a criminal offence in this way, the defendant:  "must have intentionally participated in the principal offences and so must have had knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up the offences ... in question, whether or not he knew that those amounted to a crime" (Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ at 500.2; see also Gibbs CJ at 482.3 and -8, and Mason J at 493-4). [Emphasis added.]  v. In Stokes & Difford versus R [(1990) 51 A Crim R 25] at , Hunt J, with whom Wood and McInerney JJ agreed, broke down what was required for a criminal aiding/abetting charge as follows:  "To establish that an accused is an accessory to the commission of a crime by another person (whether or not he is a co-accused) by aiding and abetting him, the Crown must establish:  the commission of that crime by the principal offender, and...  ....  that (subject to an exception...) the accused knew all the essential facts or circumstances which must be established by the Crown in order to show that the crime was committed by the principal offender (whether or not the accused knew that they amounted to a crime), and  that, with that knowledge, he intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal offender to commit that crime."  vi. The following may be said to be required with respect to an accessorial claim relating to a contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the TPA:  a) that the principal contravener engaged in misleading conduct in contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) which caused the loss or damage claimed;  b) that the secondary defendant had actual knowledge "of the essential matters which went to make up the" contravention, that is, "the essential facts which made what was done" a contravention (see Gibbs CJ in Giorgianni at 488.1). It is not necessary to establish the knowledge of any damage being suffered, because damage is not part of what must be shown to establish a contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) (as opposed to a cause of action under [s.82)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html);  c) that knowing these essential facts, the secondary defendant intentionally did act to aid, abet, counsel or procure (etc) the contravention - that is, they did those acts with the intention of assisting or encouraging the contravention by the principal contravener.  vii. In the criminal context the requirements have been paraphrased as a necessity to show that the defendant "is in some way linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime [i.e. the contravention], and is by his words or conduct doing something to bring about, or rendering more likely, such commission": R versus Russell <case>; [[1933] VLR 59] at 67; quoted approvingly by Mason J in Giorgianni at .5; see also R versus Phan <case>; <case> and [76] per Wood CJ at CL. Or, as Gibbs CJ put it in Giorgianni at 482.3, along with having knowledge of the essential circumstances, "the person charged must have intended to help, encourage or induce the principal offender to bring about the forbidden result".  In relation to element (c) identified above- the aiding [etc] conduct by the accessory - it is clearly arguable that what is required is the doing of "something" which acted to help, encourage or induce the executive directors/FAI to engage in misleading conduct [see R versus Russell etc cited above]: the search is for a 'link in purpose'.  
The pleaded conduct of Gen Re and Guy Carpenter  The plaintiffs allege that by their conduct Gen Re and Guy Carpenter did do something to bring about, or render more likely, the misleading conduct in the form of the provision of misleading information to the auditors and in the published 1998 accounts. Gen Re is said to have engaged in such conduct by entering into arrangements with FAI, which were structured in a way designed to mislead the auditors, and then directly misled the auditors at the 26
August 1998 meeting. Guy Carpenter is said to have done so by procuring the NI
Contract, preparing a backdated cover under artificially recreated letterhead for the purposes of misleading the auditors, and [like Gen Re] then directly misleading the auditors at the 26 August 1998 meeting.  The plaintiffs have submitted and I accept that in this respect it is arguably not to the point that the information and accounts supplied to HIH were also misleading because of additional matters. Self-evidently, a person said to be secondarily liable will not have engaged in all of the conduct which constitutes the contravention. They must merely have done something to assist or encourage the bringing about of the contravention. Where it is alleged that the information and accounts were misleading, the facilitation of
FAI/directors being misleading in that way may constitute material assistance towards the commission of the contravention.  [Indeed, it is arguable that a person may be knowingly concerned in a contravention for the purposes of s75B(1)(c) even if the defendant's particular conduct turns out not to have been causally connected with the contravention: TPC versus Australia Meat Holdings Pty Ltd <case>; [(1988) 83 ALR 299] at 357-8. That point serves to emphasise that the fact that the secondary defendant's conduct was only one step of assistance, where many other steps are involved, does not mean that secondary liability cannot be established.]  Guy Carpenter appear to suggest that because "it did nothing to facilitate the under provisioning" (indeed it asserts that, if anything, it was seeking to rectify it in part by providing to FAI a device for recognition of illusory profits) it therefore cannot be an accessory in respect of that part of the misleading conduct relating to the under-provisioning in the accounts (both final and draft). This submission appears to overlook the fact that the relevant misleading conduct at the "broad" level is claimed to be the misstatement of the net profits and assets of FAI.  The plaintiffs' case is that Guy Carpenter did "something to bring about or render more likely" this contravention by, amongst other things, procuring the
NI Contract, preparing a backdated cover under artificially recreated letterhead for the purposes of misleading the auditors, and directly misled the auditors by their conduct at the 26 August 1998 meeting.  
Returning to knowledge of the essential elements  As already observed, the plaintiffs' submissions are generally adopted as of substance in terms of establishing a sufficiently arguable case to go to trial.  The central issue of present relevance is whether it is necessary to show that Gen Re and Guy Carpenter had knowledge of all respects in which the information and accounts as ultimately provided/published by the principal contraveners were misleading, or whether instead it is enough to show knowledge that the accounts would materially misstate FAI's profitability and net asset position [in relation to the "broad" contravention].  The joint judgment in Yorke versus Lucas (supra) at 670, drawing upon the judgments in Giorgianni, spoke of the necessity to show "knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention" and, shortly thereafter, "knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention". In Giorgianni there was reference to "knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up the offences" (Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ at 500.2) and knowledge of "the essential facts which made was done" a contravention (Gibbs CJ at 488.1). In
Rural Press Ltd versus ACCC <case>; <case> per
Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ, the language of "actual knowledge of the essential elements constituting the contraventions" was again employed.  I accept as correct the proposition that the key idea appears to be that it is necessary to show in a criminal context, that a secondary offender knew such facts as would be sufficient for the prosecution to establish that a crime was to be committed by the principal offender, that is, facts sufficient to establish each of the elements of the offence.  At the least it is distinctly arguable that the use of the word "essential" would seem to focus attention on it being necessary to show only facts sufficiently establishing the elements of the offence, and not all the particular facts of the crime that was actually committed: if X assists Y knowing that Y is to commit a crime then X may be culpable, even if he/she does not know all the details of what is to occur.  For accessories before the fact, it is necessary to show that the secondary offender had the knowledge in advance of the principal offender's intention to engage in the relevant conduct. But that is also usually true (at least to a significant extent) for a secondary offender who is present at the scene: see
Stokes & Difford versus R [(1990) 51 A Crim R 25] at -9 per Hunt J (for NSW CCA); McCarthy & Ryan versus R [(1993) 71 A Crim R ] at 409.8.  The same commonly is true in relation to contraventions of [s.52.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html)
Indeed, that is the case here - the plaintiffs allege that Gen Re and Guy
Carpenter armed FAI with the means to later engage in misleading conduct in information provided to the auditors and published in the 1998 accounts.  The circumstance that typically the accessory provides assistance in advance, necessarily undermines the argument that the accessory must know all of the respects in which the conduct was misleading, when that conduct has not yet occurred and naturally may evolve. That very characteristic of secondary liability is one factor which has led to a recognition in the criminal cases that it is only necessary to show that the accessory knew the type of offence intended, and need not know all of the particular details.  
Dealing with the criminal case law on knowledge  The plaintiffs in particular cited a number of authorities drawn from the criminal case law on knowledge. These included:  i. R versus Bainbridge [1959] 3 WLR 656 where a decision of the trial judge was that it was only necessary for the prosecution to prove that the secondary offender "knew that type of crime which in fact was committed was intended" [at 658.5] that being a circumstance where the defendant had supplied oxygen cutting equipment to a person who had used it for the purpose of breaking and entering premises to steal therefrom [the decision was upheld by the English
Court of Criminal Appeal].  ii. The House of Lords decision in DPP for Northern Ireland versus Maxwell [[1978] 3 All ER 1140] where an accomplice to a terrorist attack involving the throwing of a bomb from a car was shown to have known that there was to be some form of attack but not to have known that this was to be by way of a bomb. The terrorist group in question had with the knowledge of the accomplice previously carried out such attacks by way of shootings or bombings. Lord
Hailsham indicated at 1146h that the question in the appeal could be put either as a matter of whether the degree of knowledge was of the "essential matters constituting" the offence in fact committed, or whether the defendant knew that the offence in which he participated "was a crime of the type described" (picking up on the words in Bainbridge).  [notably the decisions in Bainbridge and Maxwell have been applied in
Australia. In Ancuta versus R [(1990) 49 A Crim R 307] at -313, the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a conviction where the secondary defendant had supplied car compliance plates to the principal offender for the rebadging of cars, even though the secondary defendants did not know what particular cars were going to be rebadged]  iii. In Bruce versus Williams [(1989) 46 A Crim R 122]
Priestley JA referred at 129 to Bainbridge and Maxwell (having also discussed Giorgianni), observing that they established that the accused need not know the particular crime intended or committed so long as he knew the type of crime intended. In that respect, Priestley JA stated at 129.8:  "Clearly, it will be a matter of the court's evaluation from case to case whether the particular crime committed bore such similarity to that of which the accused had knowledge, to fall within the rule, and no doubt there will be cases where it is difficult to be sure that the rule is fulfilled."  Other authorities drawn from the criminal law:  i. involve close questions of that which has to be known by a person charged for aiding and abetting the relevant offence;  ii. tend to focus upon the proposition that the essential facts necessary to have been known require findings on the agreement or common design but must not be characterised in too narrow a fashion: cf James Andrew Sweeney versus State of Western Australia  <case>  I accept that the following represents a fair explanation of the plaintiffs' attempts to draw analogies from criminal law principle:  i. It is only necessary to establish that the accessory had knowledge of the type of offence planned by the principal offender and not that they knew the particular details of what was planned or occurred.  ii. Whether or not the particular crime committed bore such similarity to that of which the accused had knowledge is, in the words of Priestley JA in Bruce v Williams (supra), "a matter of the court's evaluation from case to case".  iii. It is in this sense that the references to essential elements, facts or matters must be understood.  iv. It is not necessary for the accessory to know all aspects of what is intended or what actually occurs. [Were that to be required then, bearing in mind accessories provide aid in advance, the doctrine of accessory liability would substantially be undermined.]  v. These references to essential elements (etc) must be understood as referring to knowledge of an intention to commit, or the possibility of committing, acts which would be sufficient to constitute a criminal offence of the type committed.  vi. The drink-driving cases do appear to be closely analogous. In those cases it has been held to be sufficient that the accessory knew that the driver was over the limit even if he/she did not know how far over the limit, where the level of being over the limit actually determines what charge is brought.  Hence it is at the least distinctly arguable that in the TPA context, to require that the accessory had known in advance, all of the respects in which the conduct actually turned out to be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive would be to move well beyond requiring knowledge of the essential elements to knowledge of all of the relevant facts.  
Returning to the case in hand  Here, the plaintiffs do not allege that Gen Re or Guy Carpenter knew precisely how misleading the material in the accounts ultimately turned out to be. Nevertheless, they are said to have known in advance that, based upon their own assistance, the relevant entries in the accounts and relevant information provided to the auditors would be misleading and deceptive; ie, they are said to have known that the net profits and assets entered in the draft and final accounts would be overstated. I accept that that is enough to permit the pleading of the "broad" contravention to go forward. They are said to have known that the reinsurance recoveries would similarly be overstated. I accept that that is enough to permit the pleading of the "middle" contravention to go forward.  Similarly, there is a close analogy between the circumstances here and the facts of Sweeney: that more was stolen from the shop than planned (and there even with a different victim than intended) did not preclude accessorial liability. Here, that the conduct may have been misleading [to an even greater extent than Gen Re or Guy Carpenter may have realised] does not alter the fact that they are alleged to have agreed to do what they did, knowing that it was to be used for the very kind of misleading purposes to which the two purported reinsurance contracts were in fact put.  Finally and importantly, in terms of the instant application, in light of the observation of Priestley JA in Bruce versus Williams, this is not an issue which is suitable to be determined purely on the pleadings. The matter inheres in an examination of the whole course of conduct.  Brennan J put the issue in the following terms in Yorke versus Lucas (supra) at 677 (emphasis added):  "But s75B(a) does require knowledge of the acts constituting the contravention and of the circumstances which give those acts the character which [s52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) defines, namely, "misleading or deceptive or ... likely to mislead or deceive". As the net of civil liability for a contravention does not catch those who would not be caught if [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) created an offence, honest ignorance of the circumstances which give a representation a misleading or deceptive character or the character of a representation which is likely to mislead or deceive is inconsistent with civil liability under s75B(a)."  In Sutton versus AJ Thompson Pty Ltd (in liq) [(1987) 73 ALR 233] - an external accountant was held to be an accessory to representations made by a client to a potential purchaser of a business in circumstances where the accountant had been involved in preparation of the accounts and was present at a meeting between the vendor and purchaser. The relevant misleading conduct was found to be representations that the "business was viable ... , capable of achieving sales of 1800 [units] per month with a substantial gross profit margin and that in the light of the value of the component parts of the business the price of $200,000 was reasonable" (at 237.2). The accountant knew that the claim of being capable of selling 1800 units per month was misleading, and that the average selling price was below $65, although he probably did not know what the average selling price actually was (242-3).
Thus his knowledge was limited - it was not suggested that he knew all the details of the substantial gross profit margin, nor precisely why a selling price of $200k was not reasonable. In relation to one particular misrepresentation (about the number of sales in one particular month) he may well have been honestly mistaken (see at 242.9). Nevertheless, he was held liable.  As the Full Court said at 243.3, the accountant "played a significant part in the contravention by keeping important information (the financial statements) from Messrs Thompson and Stevens and by accepting joint responsibility for false statements about the volume of sales of Flexebars and their selling price". That was enough. Implicit in the decision is that it was not necessary for the accountant to have known or understood all the misrepresentations in order for him to be held liable as an accessory to the overall contravention.  The argument here really just goes to extent. To use some examples provided by the plaintiffs:  a) If someone supplies a baseball bat to one person to break another's arms, that the legs are also broken would not excuse the supplier.  b) If an accessory gives the principal the keys to a building in order to enable the principal to break, enter and steal from that building, the accessory should reasonably be held liable even if the principal obtains other keys from another person enabling the principal to gain access to more rooms in the building then the accessory had foreseen. That is so because the essential elements of the contravention - the intention by the principal to break, enter and steal - were known to the accessory, even if he/she was not aware of all the details of how that would occur, or of the extent of the theft that would occur.  c) A car dealer represents to the buyer that "this car is safe to drive". The sales representative knows that this is false because the brakes do not work properly and neither do the seatbelts. One mechanic agreed with the sales representative that they would sell the car and represent that it was safe to drive even though the brakes had only partially been fixed. Another mechanic agreed with the representative that they would sell the car and represent that it was safe to drive though only some of the seatbelts had been fixed. Each mechanic was unaware of the other's role yet it would be appropriate to hold both liable as accessories, for both knew of the intended conduct (the representation that the car was safe to drive) and that the conduct was misleading, even if they did not appreciate all respects in which this was so.  Guy Carpenter does however submit that there is "no allegation" that it had knowledge that there was or would be a shortfall of $170 million in provisions as a result of wrongful conduct by the directors. Just as for Gen Re, the plaintiffs allege that Guy Carpenter was aware of the significant under- provisioning within the FAI Group. Whether Guy Carpenter was aware that the under-provisioning was in the order of $170 million does not detract from its knowledge of this core problem, which problem was the very context in which the NI Contract was procured.  Thus, of the misstatement of the order of $235 million in the 1998 accounts as to net profit and assets, the plaintiffs allege that Gen Re and Guy
Carpenter each knew of their own contracts and of the under-provisioning, which in the result amounts to a sum in the order of $200 million. Despite having such knowledge, each of Gen Re and Guy Carpenter are alleged to have gone on intentionally to take steps to assist FAI to engage in the misleading conduct. On any view, that is more than enough to establish a perfectly arguable case of accessorial liability.  Importantly to say that such knowledge is necessarily insufficient to justify imposing liability, and to require knowledge of all key respects in which FAI was to engage in the misleading conduct, would be to enter an area of the particular details of the contravention which raises an issue closely tied to the facts.  
Causation and indirect or 'second-hand' reliance  These attacks on the further amended statement of claim raise the following question:  
Is it an essential element of the causes of action pleaded variously against
Gen Re, Guy Carpenter and GSA that the plaintiffs relied upon or were induced by the relevant misleading conduct?  The above defendants contend that on the present state of the law [the so- called 'Digi-Tech issue'], an affirmative answer to this question means that the pleading is demurrable: vide must be struck out.  The applications that the defendants make based on Digi-Tech relate only to the first category of claims, the misleading of the auditors.  
The pleaded claims against GSA  Three separate causes of action are pleaded against GSA. The first two are direct causes of action - namely that GSA itself contravened s.995 of the
Corporations Law. The third cause of action is an accessorial claim, namely that GSA was knowingly concerned in contraventions of s.995 of the
Corporations Law by FAI Insurances, Adler and Mainprize.  GSA seeks to strike-out the first two of the three causes of action pleaded against it. It does not seek to strike-out the claim relating to being involved in misleading conduct by FAI Insurances, Adler and Mainprize.  
Returning to the issue  The defendants assert that the Court of Appeal decision in Digi-Tech involved that Court construing a provision [s 82 TPA] [which is relevantly in identical terms to <case> of the Corporations Law] to mean that, in cases where "plaintiffs suffer loss because they, themselves, are induced by misleading representations to perform some act or omission by which they are prejudiced", it is essential to prove that the plaintiffs relied upon or was induced by the misleading conduct, and, therefore, "by" that conduct, suffered damage,  GSA puts the matter as follows:  i. It is beyond question that the use of the preposition "by" in s.1005 imposes a requirement that there be a sufficient causal link between the defendant's contravening conduct and the plaintiff's loss [Janssen-Cilag Pty
Ltd versus Pfizer Pty Ltd <case>; [(1992) 37 FCR 526] at 530; I & L Securities Pty Limited versus HTW Valuers
Pty Limited <case>; <case>, 127 [54]].  ii. As Brennan J pointed out [San Sebastian Pty Limited and Anor versus Minister
Administering the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) and
Anor <case>; [(1986) 162 CLR 340] at 366]:  "A causal relationship between a representation... and economic loss does not exist because of the operation of the laws of nature. It exists because the representation induces the representee to do something which causes the loss or to refrain from doing something which would have avoided the loss. It is the operation of the representation on the representee's mind - the inducement - which links the representation with the conduct which more immediately causes the loss".  iii. It was the absence of that very same link between the misleading conduct and the alleged loss (i.e., the absence of any inducement) which led the Court of Appeal to conclude as it did in Digi-Tech [at 212 [156]] and it is the absence of that link between Goldman Sachs' alleged conduct and the
Plaintiffs' loss that is fatal to the causes of action pleaded in the Relevant
Paragraphs. To borrow the words of Lander J (with whom Hill and Jacobson JJ agreed) <case>; <case>]:  "If Ford did not rely upon the misrepresentations it cannot be said that Ford suffered loss or damage 'by conduct of' Tristar. Ford was not induced by the misleading or deceptive conduct to do or refrain from doing something which caused it damage."  iv. This is not to say that reliance by or inducement of the plaintiff is always necessary. It was not necessary in Janssen-Cilag <case>; [(1992) 37 FCR 526], in Stockland (Constructors) Pty Ltd versus Retail Design Group
Pty Ltd  <case>, or in Hampic Pty Ltd versus Adams <case>
But (as the Court of Appeal explained in Digi-Tech, and as Lander J (with whom Hill and Jacobson JJ agreed) made clear in Ford Motor), the reason why it was unnecessary to prove reliance or inducement in those cases was that "the misleading conduct had caused others to act to the direct prejudice of the plaintiff" (eg, by causing them to purchase a competitor's product) [Digi-Tech, at 211 [152], 211 [155] - 212 [157]; Ford Motor, at 538 [114] - 539 [123]]. The requisite link between the defendant's misleading conduct and the plaintiff's loss is made out, absent inducement of the plaintiff, because the (third party) representee's act "by its very nature, causes the plaintiff loss" [Digi-Tech, at 212 [155]; Ford Motor, at 539 [123]].  v. However, where (as in the present case) the representee's act does not, by its very nature, cause the plaintiff's loss, reliance by or inducement of the plaintiff is essential.  vi. Wilson J was making the same point in Gould versus Vaggelas [(1985) 157 CLR ]
at 236, when he said:  "Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the representee does not rely upon it he has no case."  
See also at 223 per Gibbs CJ.  vii. That statement has long been regarded as applicable to claims made under ss.52 and [82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s82.html) of the TPA (including by Gleeson CJ, with whom Samuels AJA and Meagher JA agreed), in Lam versus Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd [(1989) 97 FLR ]
at 477, 478; see also Sutton versus A J Thompson Pty Ltd (In Liq) [(1987) 73 ALR ]
at 240; Butcher versus Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd <case>; <case> and it is equally applicable here.  The resultant proposition put by GSA is that it follows that a plaintiff who claims to have undertaken a commercial transaction, and to have suffered loss as a result, must establish the requisite causal link between its loss and the defendant's misleading conduct by proving it relied upon or was induced by that conduct.  As the plaintiffs in contradistinction contend, and I accept, the following is at the least arguable:  i. the defendant's approach constitutes an extreme proposition, amounting to a significant narrowing of the operation of [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s82.html)
It involves a categorical approach to [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s82.html), effectively stating that even if misleading conduct was a materially contributing cause of loss, and even if recognising such causation is a matter of common sense and is within the statutory purposes, nevertheless some previously unseen clog inherent in the word "by" prevents recovery. Such a construction is not only counter-intuitive as a matter of construction, it is fundamentally inconsistent with High Court authority.... It should not be accepted by a judge at first instance without the clearest statement of principle from an appellate court;  ii. the notion of causation is imported into [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s82.html) of the TPA by the word "by": Wardley <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 514] at 525; Marks versus GIO Australia Holdings Ltd <case>; <case> per
Gummow J. As is implicit in the case law analysed in the previous section of this submission (section (iv)), that word has not been viewed as a limiting one. As Gummow J stated in Marks at [99], pre-empting the more recent emphasis given to considerations of statutory purpose in relation to such causation questions (citations omitted):  "The TP Act is a fundamental piece of remedial and protective legislation which gives effect to 'matters of high public policy'. It is to be construed so as 'to give the fullest relief which the fair meaning of its language will allow'."  iii. that the section is not be approached in a categorical fashion was made clear by Lockhart J in Janssen-Cilag <case>; [(1992) 37 FCR 526] at 529-320, in a passage quoted approvingly by Gummow J in
Marks at [101]:  "Section 82 is the vehicle for the recovery of loss or damage for multifarious forms of contravention of the provisions of Pts IV and V of the [TP] Act. It is important that rules laid down by the courts to govern entitlement to damages under <case> are not unduly rigid, since the ambit of activities that may cause contravention of the diverse provisions of Pts IV and V is large and the circumstances in which damage the reform may arise will vary considerably from case to case.  
What emerges from an analysis of the cases (and there are many of them) is that they do not impose some general requirement that damage can be recovered only where the applicant himself relies upon the conduct of the respondent constituting the contravention of the relevant provision."  iv. further, it follows from the defendants' submissions that in the category of cases they identify there will be no occasion for the court to inquire into the purpose of the statute and its application to the facts. It matters not that the plaintiff can establish that the misleading conduct materially contributed to the plaintiffs' loss. If it is not part of the plaintiff's case that he or she relied directly on the misleading conduct at issue, he or she cannot succeed in a claim for damages under s.82.  The plaintiffs further submitted as follows in terms of the suggested proper analysis of Dig-Tech:  i. The Digi-Tech litigation involved a series of transactions between Digi-
Tech and a number of investors relating to the intellectual property rights to telecommunication products owned by Digi-Tech. Digi-Tech carried out its own valuation of these rights and, in addition, retained the accounting firm
Deloittes to provide various analyses and to value the products.  ii. On appeal, the Court of Appeal was required to consider a number of issues concerning what had been referred to at first instance as the "profit potential representation". The manner in which the representation was pleaded is set out in paragraph [67] of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The representation, that the products had a "high revenue and profit potential", was derived from the various documents referred to in particulars. These included a Digi-Tech information memorandum, as well as two documents prepared by Deloittes, including an indicative valuation setting out forecasts provided by Digi-Tech. Importantly, while the relevant representation was contained in documents that included the Deloittes documents the case proceeded on the basis that the relevant representation was a representation by Digi-Tech to the investors.  iii. The Court of Appeal found that the profit potential representation was misleading because Digi-Tech had not adduced evidence that it had reasonable grounds for making it. The next issue that the Court had to decide concerned causation - whether the investors would have entered into the relevant transactions if they had been told that Digi-Tech did not have reasonable grounds for the revenue and profit projections upon which the Deloittes valuation was based; that is, whether the investors had been induced by the representation to entering into the transaction. After considering the findings at first instance, the Court concluded, at [131], that it could not decide this issue and remitted it for re-trial.  iv. It was in this context that the plaintiffs sought to rely upon what was referred to as "indirect causation". The submission was that if Digi-Tech had not produced the misleading forecasts, Deloittes would not have produced the valuation which it did and the investment scheme would not have gone ahead.
The appellants, relying upon cases such as Janssen-Cilag, argued that the requisite element of causation did not require a finding that individual investors were induced by a reading of the relevant documents to enter into the transaction.  v. The Court of Appeal rejected the appellants' submissions, stating, at [159]:  "We accept Mr Sheahan's submission that, whatever might be the position in other contexts, in cases of this kind (misrepresentation inducing a transaction) the courts have required reliance by or on behalf of the plaintiff on the misrepresentation as being essential to the proof of causation as required by s.82(1) of the TP Act. Persons who claim damages under <case> on the ground that they entered into transactions induced by the misrepresentations of other persons must prove that they relied on such misrepresentations and, therefore, by that conduct, they suffered loss or damage. As Mr Sheahan pointed out, were it otherwise, representees could succeed even though they knew the truth or were indifferent to the subject matter of the representation."  vi. It is notable that the Court of Appeal cited no authority in this paragraph. It is evident that it was not attempting any substantial change to the law relating to s.82, or the imposition of any significant new restriction of the kind for which the relevant defendants now contend.  vii. In the present strike out applications, the defendants have seized upon the words "reliance by or on behalf of the plaintiff on the misrepresentation". However the facts of the case make it clear that the Court did not intend to invest the words "on the misrepresentation" with the significance and meaning for which the defendants contend. The Court of Appeal used these words simply because, in that case, the misleading conduct at issue (the profit potential representation) was directed at the plaintiffs themselves. In this respect, Digi-Tech is not a case which is analogous to the present case.  viii. In rejecting the appellants' submissions, the Court of Appeal was following the well established principle that the "but for" test is not the test for causation in s.82(1). The plaintiff must do more than simply establish that "but for" the misleading conduct, he or she would not have suffered the loss claimed. The Court was also confirming that, in order to establish causation in cases where the plaintiff claims losses resulting from the entry into a transaction, the plaintiff must establish that that he or she was induced to enter into the transaction. There is nothing novel in either of these propositions, however, the case is not authority for the proposition that such inducement can result only from direct reliance by the plaintiff on the misleading conduct in issue.  ix. That this is a correct view of the decision is established by the last sentence of the quote, in which the Court identified the concern that underpinned the decision - were it otherwise representees could succeed even though they knew the truth or were indifferent to the subject matter of the representation. GSA has attempted to apply this concern to the present case and the attempt reveals the flaws in its argument. It asserts that the consequence of the theory of indirect causation would mean that the HIH plaintiffs could succeed even if they "paid no regard to GSA's misrepresentation or were ignorant of it". However the Court of Appeal did not use such words. The Court was not concerned about cases where the plaintiff was ignorant of the fact that the representation had been made, but about a case where the plaintiff was claiming damage was suffered as a result of misleading conduct where he/she/it knew the true position or was indifferent to the subject matter of the misrepresentation - ie where the element of reliance was absent.  x. The present case is not such a case. In relation to the claims against Gen
Re and Guy Carpenter, the plaintiffs plead that they relied upon the [incorrect] view of the position and performance of the FAI Group set out in the accounts published by FAI on 9 September 1998 (para 427 to 429 of the
FASOC). These accounts had been approved by the auditors, in reliance upon the misleading conduct on the part of the FAI executive directors, Gen Re and Guy
Carpenter.  xi. Similarly, the pleaded claim against GSA is that GSA misled the FAI non- executive directors and/or the FAI Board, which caused a misleading Part B
Statement to be issued. The misleading Part B Statement was, in turn, relied on by HIH. Had there been no misleading conduct, the Part B Statement would either not have been issued at all (in which case the takeover could not have proceeded) or would have been issued in a non-misleading form (in which case
HIH would not have proceeded with the takeover). Whether such matters are established, and assuming they are established, are sufficient to satisfy the
Court that the loss and damage claimed by HIH was caused "by" GSA's misleading or deceptive conduct, are matters which can only be determined after a final hearing.  xii. It follows from the allegations of reliance by the HIH plaintiffs that they did not know the "true position", that is that FAI was worthless, and that they were not "indifferent" to the subject matter in issue, being the true value of FAI.  xiii. The construction which the defendants seek to give the decision in
Digi-Tech would result in a substantial narrowing of the circumstances in which a claim for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct could be brought.  The above set out respective contentions of the parties make clear that it is unnecessary for the Court on the present application to determine which of the respective approaches concerning the proper reading of the Court of Appeal decision be correct. This is so for a number of reasons:  i. the first is that the plaintiffs have made clear that even if the proper reading of the Court of Appeal decision is that advanced by the defendants, the plaintiffs wish to seek to test that matter before the High Court;  ii. the second is that the plaintiffs are correct in their observation that the principles applicable to questions of causation and in particular to the manner in which the word "by" in <case> should be understood are seen to have been evolving in recent times:  a) These principles have been the subject of recent consideration by the High
Court in Henville versus Walker <case>; [(2001) 206 CLR 459], I & L Securities Pty Ltd versus HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty
Ltd, <case>; [(2002) 210 CLR 109] and, most recently, in Travel Compensation Fund versus Tambree <case>; [(2005) 224 CLR 627];  b) Initially it was determined that the word "by" in section 82 should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common-sense concept of causation referred to in March versus Stramare (E&MH) Pty Ltd (1991)171 CLR (see Wardley Australia Ltd versus Western Australia <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 514] at 525);  c) However, in recent cases, in particular the Travel Compensation Fund case, emphasis has been given to taking a purposive approach to causation that seeks to determine the issue by reference to the statutory subject, scope and purpose in which the issue arises, thus marking a departure, or at least a possible one, from viewing causation strictly according to common law concepts;  d) In the Travel Compensation Fund, Gummow and Hayne JJ stated at [45]:  "It is now clear that there are cases in which the answer to a question of causation will differ according to the purpose for which the question is asked [citing Chappel versus Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 at 256 per Gummow J, 285 per Hayne
J; Environment Agency versus Empress Car Co (Abertillery) Ltd <case>; [[1999] 2 AC ] at , 31 per Lord Hoffmann]. As was recently emphasised in Allianz Australia
Insurance ltd versus GSF Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [(2005) 221 CLR 568] at 596-597 <case>- <case> per
Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ, is doubtful whether there is any "common sense" notion of causation which can provide a useful, still less universal legal norm. There are, therefore, cases in which the answer to a question of causation will require examination of the purpose of a particular cause of action, or the nature and scope of the defendant's obligation in the particular circumstances."  [See Henville versus Walker, at [96] per McHugh J; and I & L Securities Pty
Ltd versus HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd, <case>; [(2002) 210 CLR 109] at 119 per Gleeson CJ].  
Notably Gleeson CJ in Travel Compensation Board made the point that:  "in recent cases [this Court] has pointed out that, in deciding whether loss or damage is "by" misleading or deceptive conduct, and assessing the amount of the loss that is to be so characterised, it is in the purpose of the statute, as related to the circumstances of a particular case, that the answer to the question of causation is to be found";  iii. Importantly these particular proceedings will clearly raise difficult questions of fact arising in unusual circumstances not necessarily addressed in any previous authority.  
Decision on indirect reliance  At the end of the day I accept that it is always a question of fact as to whether the loss or damage claimed has been caused "by" the misleading or deceptive conduct. Indeed as has been observed in the TPA context "to speak of reliance can be an artificial approach to causation, which can be established if there would have been inaction or some other action if the true position had been known": Colly Cotton Marketing Pty Ltd versus Simmons <case> per Giles JA [at 161], Spigelman CJ and McColl JA agreeing.  The plaintiffs are entitled to contend that the issue must be decided in accordance with the principles established in the recent High Court decisions referred to above. Whether or not the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Digi-Tech is to be read as intending to substantially narrow the circumstances in which a claim for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct could be brought should not be determined on a strike out application but on a final hearing. It certainly cannot be said that the position has crystallised and is so clear, as to justify a strike-out claim based on this broad construction of Digi-Tech particularly where, if necessary, an approach to the High Court to decide the issue is foreshadowed. Further, in the event that the defendants be correct in their analysis of Digi-Tech, it is clearly possible that leave to reargue the matter could be granted by the Court of
Appeal.  In truth it cannot be said that the so-called 'indirect causation theory' is unlikely to turn upon developing doctrine. Whether absent GSA's conduct HIH could or would not have suffered a loss by relying on the Part B Statement is a matter suitable to be tried.  
Substantial overlap in facts  A parameter of the principled approach to the exercise of the relevant discretion is seen in the observation by Kirby P in Wickstead versus Browne [(1992) 30 NSWLR 1] at 5-6, that a Court would be reticent to summarily dismiss an action where, even if the action was dismissed, other causes of action, based on either identical or overlapping facts, will still go to trial. This is the position presently. The principle was stated by Merkel J in Johnson
Tiles Pty Ltd versus Esso Australia Ltd (No. 2) <case>; [(2000) 97 FCR 175] at 177 in the following terms:  "In Wickstead versus Browne at 5-6 observations were made by Kirby P, which was subsequently approved by the High Court on appeal, to the effect that a Court should be very reluctant to terminate summarily part of an action based on an alternative cause of action when the trial on the other cause of action, which is based on substantially overlapping facts, will be proceeding."  
The challenge to the plaintiffs' reliance on journal entries as supporting their claim to damages  The plaintiffs rely on certain journal entries as supporting their claim for damages suffered. The allegation in question which the defendants seek to strike out [specifically para 283 of FASOC] [on the basis that it is said to disclose no reasonable cause of action], accounts for almost half [approximately $142 million] of the damages sought by the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs contend that their interpretation of the journal entry as set out in a letter to Gen Re's solicitors (dated 4 June 2007) is not untenable. The relevant extract from the letter reads as follows:  "In summary, the plaintiffs contend that the combined effect of the entries contained in journal GJ-31236-May-99 is to record that:  for HIH Insurance - HIH Insurance issued 70,012,364 shares to the value of $142,125,098.92 and HIH Investments incurred an obligation to pay HIH
Insurance the sum of $142,125,098.92; and  for HIH Investments - HIH Investments incurred an obligation to pay the sum of $142,125,098.92 to HIH Insurance (for the issue of 70,012,364 shares by
HIH Insurance), and HIH Investments acquired an interest in FAI Insurances
Limited."  Notwithstanding the considerable detail into which the respective cross- contentions travel, I am satisfied that there is no substance in the attack on the pleading or particulars. The reasons are as follows:  i. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1305.html) of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) provides inter alia as follows:  [s.1305](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1305.html)
Admissibility of books in evidence  "(1) A book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of this Act is admissible in evidence in any proceeding and is prima facie evidence of any matter stated or recorded in the book. "  ii. in a strike out action the Court is required to assume that the facts pleaded are correct and that there is no contrary evidence to rebut the prime facie position;  iii. the occasion of a strike out application represents an inappropriate vehicle for determining in contested proceedings whether or not any, and if so what form of agreement, may be inferred from all of the evidence to be called relating to the effect to be given to journal entries;  iv. the trial judge may have regard to the journal entries, to whether there was a course of dealing and to whether, in the circumstances, there was a commercial rationale for the entering into of the obligations;  v. these are matters for evidence and argument before the trial judge. They may raise questions of admissibility of close order. The evidence is presently not before the Court [it seems doubtful in the extreme that the issue would be appropriate for a separate question determination but certainly there is no current application for such];  vi. the journal entries will be required to be considered as part of the matrix of fact;  vii. HIH intends asking the Court to infer from certain entries in the intercompany loan accounts of various HIH Group Companies that there was an obligation to pay moneys consistent with the entries in the loan accounts.
Unless it can be concluded that such an inference could never be drawn, the appropriate course is to allow the matter to go to trial. The finding is that it cannot on the present application be concluded that such an inference could never be drawn.  Both groups of parties cited a number of authorities to the Court. It is unnecessary to examine each of those authorities for the reason that the particular complexities confronting a Court in determining whether or not an agreement is to be inferred from particular evidence are by and large instance specific. The point was made by Kearney J in Electrical Enterprises Retail
Pty Limited versus Rodgers [(1988) 15 NSWLR 473:] see also
Petagna Nominees Pty Ltd versus AE Ledger, Liquidator of Linun Pty Ltd [(1989) 1
ACSR 547] at 552, 558-9; Linter Group Limited (in liq) versus Goldberg [(1992) 7 ACSR 580] at 591, 595, 617-619; Valoutin Pty Ltd and Anor versus Furst and Ors <case>; [(1998) 154 ALR 119] at 126-7, 131-2.  In Electrical Enterprises (supra) the Court was concerned with whether accounting records of inter-related companies provided adequate evidence to establish an agreement to on-sell at cost property subject to a floating charge. Kearney J set out in detail the evidence bearing on the accounting entries and noted that whilst the authenticity of the journal entries was queried he considered them prima facie to represent the records of the company. His Honour then stated (at 489) [emphasis added]:  "On the issue as to the effectiveness of the entries to evidence the on- selling or agency transactions alleged by the plaintiffs, it is common ground that the entries of themselves do nothing to create an agreement. To have any effect they must represent the agreement between the parties involved ...  
As to whether an agreement is to be inferred, the defendants pointed to two obvious features, first the absence of any formal record in the form of an agreement or resolution of a meeting of directors and secondly, to the continued dealing by NEE with suppliers and franchisees respectively. ... It is stressed that the terms of the suggested agreement are unknown and uncertain, and it is necessary that the transaction evidenced by entries in books of account should be one which is valid and effective to create legal consequences...  ...  
It seems to me that the subject entries in the books..., supported by the annual accounts and supplemented by the explanations given by [the witnesses] when considered in the light of corresponding entries in the books of EER, and its annual accounts together with the consolidated accounts of EEL provide evidence establishing an agreement for NEE to on-sell to EER at cost the stock purchased by NEE from suppliers ...  
Within a group of associated companies, it is not surprising for internal arrangements to be made informally. Hence the inference is readily available of compliant directors of the respective companies agreeing to tacitly accepting the arrangements propounded by Mr Wright. Mr Langley's statements to
Mr Nygh support this conclusion as do the recorded transactions and discussions of the directors of EEL and the adoption by the directors of the various companies of the annual accounts based on such arrangements having been made."  [Read as a whole Kearney J was saying no more than one must have regard to the whole of the evidence when considering whether there was an agreement of the kind asserted by the plaintiffs.]  There is clear substance in the plaintiffs' response to the defendants' contention that the obligation to pay the sum of approximately $142 million referred to in paragraph 283 of the FASOC discloses no reasonable cause of action and is untenable. In short and as the plaintiffs have contended:  i. The defendants' reasoning appears to be that the only evidence in support of the obligation is the journal entry GJ-31236-MAY-99 which a journal entry without more cannot establish that HIH Insurance has incurred an actual loss;  ii. the plaintiffs contend as follows.  a) Firstly, the journal entry records a liability, namely, HIH Investments is liable to HIH Insurance for approximately $142 million: [the plaintiffs contend the money is due and owing from the time the shares were issued].  b) Secondly, the question whether HIH Insurance has suffered an actual loss will depend on a consideration of all the evidence.  c) Thirdly, the plaintiffs do not and have never contended that the journal entries constitute the only evidence to be relied upon in support of the existence of the obligation. The journal entries will need to be considered as part of the matrix of facts.  d) Fourthly, on a strike out application where the assertion is that the pleading is untenable, the defendants must show the cause of action is doomed to fail. In the present case we have a business record (journal entry) which has been the subject of lengthy particulars. This journal entry is open to the interpretation that HIH Investments agreed to pay HIH Insurance $142 million in relation to the issue of 70 million HIH shares. Such a pleading discloses a cause of action and is not untenable.  e) Fifthly, where there is a real issue of fact of this kind it should not be determined at an interlocutory stage but should await final determination.
[I interpolate to add that this is not the occasion for the determination of whether the share issue gave rise to a loss in the form of an obligation to pay in relation to the share issue]  iii. Insofar as the defendants [albeit conceding that the journal entries are prima facie evidence of a liability] proceed to contend  a) that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1305.html) is of no assistance;  b) that the journal entries without more are not probative of there being an "obligation to pay" in the form of actual loss,  it is appropriate to observe that the distinction which the defendants seek to draw as between (i) a liability on the one hand and (ii) an actual loss on the other, is arguably misconceived for the reason that the journal entry records and is evidence of a liability owing by HIH Investments to HIH Insurance in the sum of $142 million [(s.1350](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1350.html) [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)). Hence concepts of contingent loss, actual loss, crystallisation of loss would seem to be irrelevant.  It is appropriate before concluding to add a reference to two reasonably recent authorities:  i. In Angas Law Services Pty Limited (in liq) versus Carabelas <case>; [(2005) 215 ALR 110], the High Court was concerned with an application by the liquidator of the Applicant based upon a contention that at the time the
Applicant was insolvent, it entered into transactions involving preferences under [s.588FA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588fa.html) and s.[588FC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588fc.html).
Gleeson CJ and Heydon J found the preference claims were founded upon an attempt to take at face value certain book entries made by the accountant of the Applicant in circumstances where the evidence provided no justification for concluding that the entries reflected the true facts and where there was evidence to cast doubt on those entries (at 122). Gleeson CJ and Heydon J continued as follows (at 122-123):  "Counsel for the present respondents argued in the Full Court that there was no evidence that these entries recorded any actual transactions, that once the order for winding up was made the directors of [the applicant] had no power to authorise any such transactions, that the evidence did not show that they purported to authorise such transactions, that if any such transactions had occurred they occurred after the winding up, that there were no transactions that amounted to preferences, and that there were merely a number of incorrect book entries. Doyle CJ agreed. The trial judge, he noted, was understandably reluctant to allow the present respondents to impeach entries made in the records of [the applicant]. However, "the evidence indicates that there was no transaction before the winding up began, that these entries record or reflect". The trial judge had not relied on estoppel or any other principle that would prevent [the respondents] from relying upon the facts disclosed by the evidence. The proper conclusion, on the facts, was that the journal entries were not a true record of any transaction and that there was no transaction that was binding on [the applicant] or the other companies." <case>; [(2005) 216 ALR 320.] Austin J was concerned with the tender of various records by
ASIC and was required to determine the admissibility of those records pursuant to [s.69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s69.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and/or [s.1305](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1305.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). His
Honour noted that [s.1305](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1305.html) was introduced into the Australian corporations legislation upon the enactment of the [Companies
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/ca1981107/) and Codes of 1981. At page 371 his Honour referred to the explanatory memorandum to the [Companies Bill 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/cb1981117/) which stated the following:  "This is a new provision based on section 156(3) of the Ontario Business [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). It is an evidentiary provision that is intended to expedite legal proceedings where books are to be introduced in evidence. This provision obviates the need to call witnesses to prove the books are books of the corporation when this fact is not in question and to prove transactions recorded in books when these matters are not in dispute."  
His Honour continued as follows (at 371):  "Where it applies, [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1305.html) allows a document properly tendered to become prima facie evidence of any matter stated in it, regardless of whether the stated matter offends an exclusionary rule of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), such as the hearsay rule or the opinion rule. Subsection (2), where applicable, avoids the need to prove the authenticity of the document, unless the presumption is rebutted. ... Thus section 1305, if applicable, gives ASIC a "fast track" to admissibility of its tendered documents."  Sufficient has been demonstrated in the above reasons to make clear that the respective defendants' submissions on this strike out segment are of no substance. However it should also be noted that in so far as it has been contended that paragraph 283 [which deals with the approximate $142 million obligation] is demurrable because there was no pleading as to the existence of an agreement or of its terms, a close examination of the pleading together with the very extensive particulars which have been provided [to be found in attachment E to Exhibit R1] include a particularised agreement as between HIH
Investments and HIH Insurance. The allegation is that what is to be inferred is that the former agreed to pay to the latter, the sum of approximately $142 million in return for the latter issuing shares as the scrip consideration for the takeover offer. The matters giving rise to that inference are then set out.  
Short Minutes  The parties are to bring in short minutes on which occasion costs may be argued.
