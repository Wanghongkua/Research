JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE - REVISED) 
Introduction
By summons filed in Court today, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the Commissioner), seeks orders pursuant to [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth) (the Act). In support of the summons, the Commissioner relies on the affidavit of Scott Michael Mathews affirmed 30 November 2015. Federal Agent Mathews deposes in paragraph 1 of his affidavit that he is a member of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

Legislative requirements [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the Act [Section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the Act provides that a Court with proceeds jurisdiction (which includes this Court) must, if certain conditions are fulfilled, make an order that property not be deposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person. The Court's obligation to make an order with respect to serious offences is subject to its satisfaction that an appropriate undertaking has been given: [s 21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s21.html) (addressed below).
[Section 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) provides: "Restraining orders--property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc. 
When a restraining order must be made 
A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must order that: property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person; or  property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order; if: a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and  there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is: the *proceeds of a *terrorism offence or any other *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of
Commonwealth concern (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known); or  an *instrument of a *serious offence; and the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an *authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that: in any case--the property is proceeds of the offence; or  if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence--the property is an *instrument of the offence; and including the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion; and  the court is satisfied that the *authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

Property that a restraining order may cover 
The order must specify, as property that must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with, the property specified in the application for the order, to the extent that the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that that property is: in any case--*proceeds of the offence; or  if the offence to which the order relates is a *serious offence--an *instrument of the offence.

Refusal to make a restraining order 
Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make a *restraining order in relation to an *indictable offence that is not a *serious offence if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order. 
Note: A court can also refuse to make a restraining order if the
Commonwealth refuses to give an undertaking: see [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s21.html) 
Restraining order need not be based on commission of a particular offence 
The reasonable grounds referred to in paragraph (1)(d) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence. 
Risk of property being disposed of etc. 
The court must make a *restraining order even if there is no risk of the property being disposed of or otherwise dealt with."
The conditions, the fulfilment of which entitle the Commission to an order under [s 19(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) or (b) are set out in [s 19(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) - (f) of the Act. These will be considered in turn.
 [Section 19(1)(c):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) application made by a proceeds of crime authority
The Commissioner is a proceeds of crime authority by reason of the definition under [s 338](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s338.html) of the Act. Accordingly [s 19(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) is fulfilled.
 [Section 19(1)(d):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) reasonable grounds for suspicion
There must be reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence. The relevant offences are offences against [s 142](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s142.html) of the [Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/) (Cth) and an offence contrary to <case>.9(1) of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code), which is contained in Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code.
These are both "serious offences" within the meaning of <case> of the Act, which relevantly includes: * (1) unlawful conduct constituted by or relating to a breach of Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code (moneylaundering): paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of "serious offence"; and * (2) an offence against [s 142](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s142.html) of the [AntiMoney Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act 2006](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/) (conducting transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements relating to threshold transactions): paragraph (ec)(i) of the definition of "serious offence".
Having read the affidavit of Federal Agent Mathews, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property referred in schedule 1 of the summons and to the minute of order is the proceeds of an indictable offence, or indictable offences, within the meaning of [s 19(1)(d)(i).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s19.html) [Section 19(1)(e):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s19.html) the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer [Section 19(1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/alacfa2006522/s19.html) provides that it is a condition of the making of an order that the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects, relevantly, that the property is proceeds of the offence. The definition of "authorised officer" in <case> of the Act includes an AFP member if authorised by the Commissioner.
The evidence establishes that Commissioner Negus, by authorisation dated 26 August 2013, authorised all AFP members to be authorised officers under the Act. Accordingly, Federal Agent Mathews is an authorised officer.
The condition in <case>(e) is fulfilled by the affidavit of Federal Agent Mathews affirmed 30 November 2015. He sets out the basis for his belief in paragraphs 13 to 47 to his affidavit and summarises those grounds in paragraph 48 of his affidavit.

Section 19(1)(f): reasonable grounds
I am required to be satisfied that the officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that the matters set out in paragraphs 13 to 47 and summarised in paragraph 48 of the affidavit provide sufficient basis, by way of reasonable grounds, for the suspicion to which Federal Agent Mathews deposes.

Other relevant legislative provisions 
Section 26(4): application without notice
Section 26(4) of the Act provides that I must consider an application such as the present without notice having been given if the responsible authority requested the Court to do so. Ms Millington, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff in the current application, requests, on behalf of the plaintiff, that I hear the application without notice. Accordingly, I am bound by section 26(4) to do so.

Section 21: requirement for undertaking
Section 21 of the Act provides that I may refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses or fails to give the court an appropriate undertaking with respect to the payment of damages or costs (or both) for the making and operation of the order. Ms Millington has, on behalf of the plaintiff, given what I regard as an appropriate undertaking with respect to the payment of damages and costs for the making and operation of the order.

Conclusion
For those reasons, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the orders set out in the short minute of order, which also notes the plaintiff's undertaking.

Orders
Accordingly, I make orders as follows as sought in the short minutes of order which I will sign and date and place with the papers:
