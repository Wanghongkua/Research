JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
JUDGMENT (Admissibility - Child Welfare Records - T4870 - relevant to defence of qualified privilege) HIS HONOUR: The second bundle will be admitted as Exhibit CB. It is material on which the plaintiff proposes to rely to defeat the defence of qualified privilege.
 I note the plaintiff's "assertion" at the time of the tender, and I stress the word "assertion" that it was material available to the defendant in relation to a person who appeared on both programs, and in the context of the first programme having been published, proceedings had been instituted before the publication of the second program.
