Inter Image Homes P/L versus Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Ors [1997]
NSWSC 145 (18 April 1997) `INTER IMAGE HOMES P/L versus COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA AND ORS` `2010/97` `THURSDAY 10 APRIL 1997` `THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: This is an application to restrain payment of moneys by a bank pursuant to what is commonly called a bank guarantee. There is no doubt at all that the Commonwealth Bank gave a guarantee in favour of the second defendant at the request of the plaintiff on 5 November 1996 and that it is on its face an unconditional guarantee. The plaintiff says, however, that the guarantee was subject to a condition precedent which was not fulfilled, that the plaintiff would receive a cheque for the sum of $33,812. Accordingly, it is said, the guarantee never came into operation. ` ` There may be some argument about whether, if the facts are as the plaintiff has them, there was a condition precedent; see, for instance, Macedone v
Collins - Court of Appeal, 20 December 1996, unreported. ` ` There is also a problem for the plaintiff in that it relies on a conversation with Mr Barr who is alleged to be the third defendant's project manager in October 1996. A representative of the plaintiff said: "Can we have the retention released in exchange for the bank guarantee for $33,812?" to which Mr Barr is alleged to have said "Yes". Mr Baird, the solicitor for the proprietor, the third defendant, points out that in October 1996 the proprietor was entitled to claim the five per cent retention of each progress payment and the quantity surveyor's certificate as at January 1997 shows that the amount entitled to be retained was $66,525. This sits ill with the conversation that Mr Dubler, counsel for the plaintiff, says was a conversation in anticipation of a certificate of practical completion issuing (if it actually issued on 31 January) when under clause 36 the retention would be reduced to 2.5 per cent.` ` Each side of the argument appears to have its oddities. However, there has not yet been an opportunity for the material to be placed before the Court, as the proceedings only commenced this afternoon. ` ` As the plaintiff is only seeking an injunction for three days, I do not consider I need to be as concerned about the strength of any arguable case as
I might otherwise have to be.` ` The question then comes to the balance of convenience. The plaintiff confesses it has minimal assets. It says that it would be affected if it had to assume a liability to the Commonwealth Bank under the bank guarantee. It offers to leave the guarantee in place as security should it lose this case and it has to be said in such circumstances that the second and third defendants really suffer no loss. ` ` The third defendant says that it is entitled to have the money paid by the
Bank to the second defendant. In support it says that there is a bank guarantee and the whole commercial purpose of a bank guarantee is that the money will be paid over. It can use the money. There is no doubt as to its solvency and it undertakes to the Court that it will give security by way of bank guarantee to refund the money if it is unsuccessful in these proceedings.
` `` The case is almost evenly balanced, but I think for three days or even a couple of days longer if the defendants require more time, I should prefer the status quo to anything else.

Accordingly, I will just make Order 3 at this stage upon the plaintiff, by its counsel, giving to the Court the usual undertaking as to damages. That will be a one-off order. By that I mean that I have done nothing more than hold the status quo until the evidence can be put on; I have not adjudicated in any real sense on the issues that arise between the parties. I direct that all the plaintiff's affidavits be filed and served no later than 4 pm on 11 April ; the third defendant's affidavits by 16 April 1997; and any affidavits in reply by 17 April 1997.

The matter will be listed before the Duty Judge at 10 am on 18 April 1997. I give leave to the plaintiff to amend the summons to add a third defendant and an amended summons will doubtless be filed when the affidavits are filed.

Costs of today reserved; the exhibits may be returned.
