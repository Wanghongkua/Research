JUDGMENT
On 21 October 2015 Button J made restraining orders pursuant to [s 19](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s19.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth), relevantly, in relation to property contained in schedule 5 of an Amended Summons. The Plaintiff now seeks forfeiture pursuant to [s 49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) of the Act in relation to the property in Schedule 5. That property consists of funds standing to the credit of two companies, being Option One (Aust) Pty Ltd and Advanced Option (Aust) Pty Ltd, with the various financial institutions set out in Schedule 5.
The Court is required to make a forfeiture order under [s 49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) if the matters enumerated in subs (1) of that section are satisfied. There are three relevant matters to be satisfied on the present application. They are: that it is a responsible authority who is applying for the order; secondly, that the restraining order has been in force for at least six months; and, thirdly, that the Court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property. Another requirement set out in [s 49(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) of the Act is not required to be satisfied in the present case pursuant to subs (3) of [s 49.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html)
In the present case, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff is a responsible authority as defined in the Act. I am satisfied from the affidavits of Catherine Therese Horan sworn 7 March 2016 and 20 April 2016 that reasonable steps have been taken to identify and notify the persons with an interest in the property. Notification was made to one of two email addresses directed by the Court on an application for substituted service. That email address is branco1950@hotmail.com. The alternative email address in the order made by the Court for substituted service resulted in a notification that there was no such address. However, I am satisfied from these affidavits that the relevant information has been forwarded to the defendant and the interested parties.
The third requirement is satisfied because the restraining orders were made on 21 October 2015, being more than six months prior to today. The background to the making of the restraining orders is contained in an affidavit of Matthew Oliveiro sworn 21 April 2016, also relied on in this application.
Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paras 1 and 2 of the Short Minutes of Order. The matter is listed for directions before the Registrar on 31 May 2016 and there is liberty to restore on three days' notice. The orders may be taken out forthwith.
