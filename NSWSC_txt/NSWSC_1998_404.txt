KEVIN FREEMAN versus LAKE CONJOLA DISTRICT BOWLING CLUB LIMITED 
CA 40566/98 August 1998 
Meagher JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I must say were it not for Mr Glissan's generosity I would be inclined to dismiss the application largely because the appellant, the bowling club, has put on no evidence from which I could infer that Mr Freeman would be unable to repay the money if it were wrongfully paid out to him now. 
Prima facie he is entitled to receive it now and if the appellant wishes to justify its stay one of its obligations is to prove that it will be prejudiced by normal payment. That has not been done. However, Mr Glissan has generously offered to accept a stay conditional to Mr. Freeman in the meantime.

The result is I order that a stay of execution of the judgment be made now until further order as prayed in the amended notice of motion of 21 August , but only on condition that the claimant Club pay the sum of $150,000 within seven days to the opponent Freeman.

The claimant to pay the costs of today's motion.
