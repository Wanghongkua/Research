JUDGMENT
By a Notice of Motion filed on 12 February 2015, the defendants seek an order under [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) r 14.28 that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim be struck out. The defendants, for whom Mr M V Sahade of Counsel appeared, contend that certain of the plaintiffs' claims are not maintainable, either because they are precluded by the principles of res judicata or issue estoppel, or are an abuse of process. The plaintiffs, for whom Mr D C Eardley of Counsel appeared, contend that the principles of res judicata and issue estoppel do not operate in the circumstances to preclude the bringing of the claims, and that in doing so the defendants are not engaged in any abuse of process.
The proceedings were commenced on 5 August 2013 by the filing of a Statement of Claim. The plaintiffs are Robert Najjar and Salam Najjar (the parents of the late Lorie Najjar, who died in 2005), and Grenstar Pty Ltd ("Grenstar"), a company controlled by Robert Najjar. The defendants are Najwa Najjar, who was the wife of the late Lorie Najjar, and Lorie Najjar & Sons Pty Limited ("Lorie Najjar & Sons"), a company that was formerly controlled by the late Lorie Najjar but is now under the control of Najwa Najjar.
The Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 11 April 2014. Particulars of that pleading were sought by the defendants in June 2014, and particulars were provided by the plaintiffs in October 2014. No defences have yet been filed.
The plaintiffs plead various claims against the defendants, including the following: * (1) a claim that a property at 64 Leylands Parade, Belmore, and later the consolidated lot of which 64 Leylands Parade, Belmore formed part, was owned beneficially by Grenstar (see paragraphs 12-17 of the Amended Statement of Claim); * (2) a claim for contribution in respect of a loan from AMP Bank Limited ("AMP Bank") which was entered into by Grenstar and Lorie Najjar & Sons as borrowers and guaranteed by Mr and Mrs Najjar Senior, Lorie Najjar and Najwa Najjar (see paragraphs 18-20 of the Amended Statement of Claim); * (3) a claim for contribution in respect of a loan from ING Bank (Australia) Limited ("ING Bank") which was entered into by Grenstar and Lorie Najjar & Sons as borrowers and guaranteed by Mr and Mrs Najjar Senior, Lorie Najjar and Najwa Najjar (see paragraphs 21-29 of the Amended Statement of Claim); and * (4) a claim by Mr and Mrs Najjar Senior, as assignees from ING Bank, for repayment of amounts owing under the ING Bank loan (see paragraphs 30 and 31 of the Amended Statement of Claim).
By their Notice of Motion, the defendants seek the striking out of each of those claims. Broadly, it is put that each of those claims was the subject of earlier proceedings in this Court that were heard and determined by Black J, and that the pleading of the claims in the present proceedings constitutes an impermissible attempt to re-litigate issues that were determined adversely to the plaintiffs in those earlier proceedings.
The proceedings before Black J concerned the winding up of Lorie Najjar & Sons, which had been placed into voluntary liquidation in 2008. The proceedings were commenced by the liquidator, who claimed that certain payments made by the company to Najwa Najjar in 2007 were recoverable under [s 588FDA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588fda.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), and were made in breach of her duties as a director of the company. Najwa Najjar filed an Interlocutory Process in the proceedings by which she sought orders under [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) for the termination or stay of the winding up.
That application, which was initially pressed as a stay pending the determination of the costs properly payable to the liquidator, was heard by Black J on various dates in March, April and May 2013. His Honour delivered a judgment on 18 June 2013 (see In the Matter of Lorie Najjar & Sons Pty Ltd (in liq)  <case> in which he concluded that the winding up be stayed (see at [134]). The present plaintiffs were not, at least at that stage, parties to the proceedings before Black J. However, they had been granted leave to be heard in the proceedings pursuant to r 2.13(1) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) . 
In his judgment delivered on 18 June 2013, Black J stated (at [3]): "[...] The question of solvency is a matter relevant to the exercise of the
Court's discretion as to whether to stay or terminate the winding up. It seems to me that the Court could properly exercise its discretion to terminate the winding up if it was satisfied that it was likely that the Company was solvent, without reaching a finding as to that matter on a final basis. I propose to reach findings as to that matter to the extent that it is necessary to allow the proper exercise of the discretion whether to stay the winding up.
These findings will reflect the detailed affidavit evidence led by the parties and full cross-examination of the relevant witnesses."
On the question of solvency, which his Honour regarded as the key question to be determined (see at [29]), it was the position of the liquidator that Lorie Najjar & Sons was insolvent from at least August 2007, and remained so thereafter. The liquidator's analysis of insolvency rested in large part on treating $1,225,000 (referable to the debt previously owing to ING Bank) as owing to Mr and Mrs Najjar Senior and $1,309,804 (referable to the debt previously owing to AMP Bank) as owing to Grenstar (see at [27]).
Black J proceeded to make various findings and reach various conclusions including the following: "I do not find that LN [Lorie Najjar] held 64 Leylands Parade or his interest in the consolidated Leylands Parade property on an express trust for
Grenstar. It also does not follow from the fact that Grenstar advanced the amount of the purchase price of the Leylands Parade property to LN, that LN held that property on an implied or resulting trust for Grenstar, although that is one possible outcome." (see at [59]); "My finding that it has not been established that LN held 64 Leylands
Parade on trust for Grenstar undermines a critical step in Grenstar's claim, and the Liquidator's view, that the sale of that property to repay the debt owed by the Company and Grenstar to AMP gives rise to a claim (still less a debt) owed by the Company to Grenstar." (see at [60]); "Even if Grenstar had a claim in respect of the AMP loan or interest arising from it, it would not presently constitute a debt of the Company and should now [sic not] be taken into account in assessing the Company's solvency." (see at [62] and [67]); 
An agreement reached at a meeting of family members in about June 2007, to the effect that the proceeds of sale of the Leylands Parade property would be used to pay off part of the AMP loan with any remaining debt to be secured over other property, provided a further basis to conclude that Grenstar's claim in respect of the AMP loan is not a debt that can be taken into account in assessing solvency (see at [103] and [60]); 
The liquidator had failed to discharge its evidentiary onus of establishing the amount of the ING Bank debt as at the date of the Deed of
Assignment between ING Bank and Mr and Mrs Najjar Senior, so as to make good its contention that the subject matter of the assignment was a substantial debt (see at [85]).
At [134] his Honour concluded: "I have ultimately formed the view that the winding up should be stayed, in what seem to me to be exceptional circumstances. I reach that result because the claims against the Company on which the Liquidator relies do not, in my view, support a finding that the Company is presently insolvent. The claim by
Grenstar in respect of the AMP loan and the claim by RN [Robert Najjar] and SN [Salam Najjar] for contribution or unjust enrichment in respect of the ING loan are unliquidated claims that, on the authority of Box Valley versus Kidd, do not support a finding of insolvency. The assignment of the ING debt to RN and
SN does not, for the reasons noted above, support a finding that the Company is presently insolvent. [...]"
As noted earlier, the present plaintiffs had been granted leave to be heard under r 2.13(1) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/). It appears that they were represented by Counsel at the hearing, and that Counsel cross-examined witnesses and made submissions. On 30 April 2013, during the course of the hearing, a direction was made that any application by them to become parties should be made by 8 May 2013, and that any further evidence to be led by them should be served by that date. I was informed that no such application was made, or further evidence served. However, it appears from Black J's judgment that an affidavit sworn by Mr Najjar Senior was read at the hearing, and he was cross-examined. It is also apparent that the present plaintiffs were involved as funders of the liquidator in the earlier proceedings.
It should be noted that Black J seems to have considered that it would be open to the present plaintiffs to pursue their various claims against Lorie Najjar & Sons at a later stage. That appears from the judgment at [2], as well as from [123]-[124] where his Honour said: "As RN's, SN's and Grenstar's solicitors point out, the effect of a termination of the winding up would leave them free to bring proceedings against the Company so as to establish their claims against it. (They have, of course, always been free to bring proceedings against NN [Najwa Najjar] notwithstanding the liquidation.) In those proceedings, RN, SN and Grenstar would need to establish the basis for a claim for equitable contribution, unjust enrichment or their entitlement to rely on the assignment of the ING debt or any other basis on which they claim to be entitled to judgment against the Company. If they were successful, a debt would be established and the
Company may well then be placed in liquidation. If they are not successful, that result would not follow.

In each case, the creditors' claims would be determined on their merits, rather than the present proceedings being pursued by the Liquidator relying in part on causes of action under [Part .7B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.7b) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (which, as the heading to the Part reflects and as I noted above, is directed to recovery of property or compensation for the benefit of creditors of insolvent companies) where the Company is not presently insolvent for the reasons noted above. I do not regard that outcome as either "futile" or in any way inconsistent with <case> of the Civil Procedure Act."
Mr Sahade submitted that what his Honour said at [123] should be read as intending to refer only to pursuit of unliquidated claims. I do not think that the paragraph should be read in that way. His Honour included a specific reference to a claim based on the assignment of the ING Bank debt, and further employed the expression "or any other basis". Moreover, after expressing his view that the evidence did not support a conclusion that Lorie Najjar & Sons was insolvent, his Honour said at [135]: "This result will leave it open to Grenstar, RN and SN to bring such proceedings against the Company as they may be advised, subject to leave of the Court under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s500.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) while the winding up is stayed, and without such leave if the winding [up] is ultimately terminated. The proceedings generally should be stayed while the winding up is stayed."
The present proceedings were commenced within two months of the delivery of Black J's judgment. On 3 October 2013, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Motion seeking, inter alia, leave to proceed against Lorie Najjar & Sons, and a stay of the liquidation of the company pending the hearing of the plaintiffs' claims. The proceedings, along with the liquidator's proceedings, came before Black J for directions on 29 October 2013 and 4 December 2013.
By that time, the present defendants were seeking orders in the liquidator's proceedings that the winding up be terminated. The hearing of that application, and an application by the liquidator for certain costs to be paid by the present plaintiffs as funders of the proceedings, took place on 19 December 2013 before Black J.
On that occasion, the liquidator filed an Amended Interlocutory Process to seek an order that the present plaintiffs be joined as defendants to the liquidator's proceedings under either Supreme Court (Corporations) Rulesr 2.13(3) or [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) r 6.24. Black J, in an ex tempore judgment delivered on that day, concluded that such a joinder should occur. His Honour noted that the present plaintiffs were opposing the costs orders sought against them. He also noted that they were seeking a stay of the winding up rather than a termination of it. His Honour said (at pages 6-7): "In the present case, by way of summary, it seems to me that the termination of the winding up sought by Mrs Najjar has a direct impact on the legal rights of the Funder, so far as it is the necessary first step to giving rise to a dismissal or discontinuance of the proceedings, an order for costs against the liquidator and a claim under the Funding Agreement against the Funders. The determination of the dispute between Mrs Najjar and the liquidator as to whether costs of the proceedings, should at least in part be borne by the liquidator or the Funder, also has a direct impact on the Funders' interests, notwithstanding that the Court could also in some circumstances make orders for costs against a non-party.

For these reasons, I am satisfied, both for the purposes of r 2.13 and r 6.24, that the Funder is at least a proper party to the proceedings, at least so far as the issues as to termination of the winding up and whether a costs order should be made directly against the Funder are concerned, and I will make an order joining the Funders as defendants in the proceedings."
During the course of the hearing on 19 December 2013, the present plaintiffs made a submission that the most appropriate course would be for the liquidation to be stayed pending the determination of the proceedings they had recently commenced. The present plaintiffs were given the opportunity to file further evidence in opposition to the proposed termination of the winding up (which, by that stage, was not opposed by the liquidator). It appears that such an affidavit was filed on about 31 January 2014. No party sought a further oral hearing in respect of that evidence.
Black J delivered a further judgment on 12 February 2014 (see In the matter of Lorie Najjar & Sons Pty Limited (in liq) (No 9)  <case> His Honour: * (1) did not accept the submission that a stay of the winding up would be the appropriate course (see at [16]); * (2) was satisfied that the winding up should be terminated in circumstances where the liquidator's costs were agreed as between Najwa Najjar and the liquidator, and the only liquidated debt shown to exist was to be paid from moneys held in Court (see at [18]); and * (3) held that it was appropriate to order the present plaintiffs to pay the liquidator certain of the costs the liquidator was to be ordered to pay Najwa Najjar (see at [22] and [43]). In that regard, his Honour noted that the present plaintiffs exercised a significant degree of control over the conduct of the proceedings through the choice of legal representatives.
Mr Sahade, in his written submissions, put that, having regard to what occurred in the liquidator's proceedings before Black J, and particularly his Honour's findings on issues going to the question of solvency, it was an abuse of process for the plaintiffs to seek to re-litigate the issues concerning: * (1) the beneficial ownership of the properties in Leylands Parade; * (2) the claim for contribution in respect of the AMP Bank loan; and * (3) the claim based on the assignment of the ING Bank loan.
(These issues will henceforth be together referred to as "the impugned issues"). No complaint was made in respect of the claim for contribution in respect of the ING Bank loan.
Mr Sahade referred to the judgment of Gageler J in Plaintiff S3-[2013](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s2013.html) versus Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  <case> at <case>- <case>. At [11], Gageler J referred to the joint judgment in Walton versus Gardiner  <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 378] at 393 where it was stated: "[...] proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings."
At [12] in Plaintiff S3-[2013](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s2013.html) versus Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (supra), Gageler J referred to the statement made by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Johnson versus Gore Wood & Co (No 1) [[2002] 2 AC 1] at 31 that: "The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all."
The above statement of Lord Bingham had earlier been cited with approval by French CJ in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited versus Australian National University <case>; <case>.
In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Sahade referred also to the principles of res judicata and issue estoppel. He submitted that these principles were applicable and operated against the plaintiffs in this case in circumstances where the plaintiffs were made parties to the liquidator's proceedings in December 2013. As I understand the submission, it was put that the plaintiffs are bound by the terms of Black J's judgment that the winding up be terminated and by his Honour's adjudication that Lorie Najjar & Sons was not insolvent. It was further put that the plaintiffs are bound by the critical or essential findings of fact made by Black J that underpin his conclusion as to solvency.
In my view, the plaintiffs are not prevented, either by the principle of res judicata, or by reason of any issue estoppel, from advancing any of the claims made in the Amended Statement of Claim. Neither basis provides a good ground for striking out the impugned claims.
The principle of res judicata operates to prevent a right or cause of action, that has merged into a judgment in a proceeding, from being maintained in a subsequent proceeding (see Blair versus Curran <case>; [(1939) 62 CLR 464] at 597). The causes of action advanced by the plaintiffs in these proceedings were not causes of action that were pursued and taken to judgment in the earlier proceedings. Those proceedings, insofar as they were dealt with by Black J in 2013, concerned Najwa Najjar's application for orders under [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), not any rights or causes of action asserted by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, who did not become parties to the earlier proceedings until after Black J had delivered his judgment in June 2013 and ordered that the winding up be stayed, at no stage sought to have any of its causes of action litigated in those proceedings.
Issue estoppel was described by Dixon J in Blair versus Curran (supra) in the following terms (at 531-532): "A judicial determination directly involving an issue of fact or of law disposes once for all of the issue, so that it cannot afterwards be raised between the same parties or their privies. The estoppel covers only those matters which the prior judgment, decree or order necessarily established as the legal foundation or justification of its conclusion, whether that conclusion is that a money sum be recovered or that the doing of an act be commanded or be restrained or that rights be declared. The distinction between res judicata and issue-estoppel is that in the first the very right or cause of action claimed or put in suit has in the former proceedings passed into judgment, so that it is merged and has no longer an independent existence, while in the second, for the purpose of some other claim or cause of action, a state of fact or law is alleged or denied the existence of which is a matter necessarily decided by the prior judgment, decree or order." (see also Starke J at 510).
As Dixon J's description makes clear, an issue estoppel only operates in later proceedings between the same parties or their privies. Here, the plaintiffs became parties to the liquidator's proceedings to which the defendants were also parties. However, this did not occur until after Black J had delivered his judgment on Najwa Najjar's application for a stay of the winding up. The issue estoppels alleged in this case are said to arise from the findings made by Black J in that judgment.
I was not referred to any authority, and I am not aware of any authority, to the effect that an issue estoppel could bind a person who was not a party to proceedings at the time the relevant judicial determination was made. In my view the plaintiffs, who were not parties until 19 December 2013 (albeit that they had earlier been given leave to be heard under [Supreme Court (Corporations) Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) r 2.13(1)), cannot be bound as a party by any issue estoppel arising from the findings made by Black J in his judgment of 18 June 2013.
It was not suggested by Mr Sahade that the plaintiffs, by virtue of their role in the proceedings, including as funders of the liquidator, are relevantly privies of the liquidator. In any case, I do not see any basis to conclude that the plaintiffs are privies of the liquidator (see Ramsay versus Pigram <case>; [(1968) 118 CLR 271]
In the light of those conclusions it is not necessary to consider the extent to which the findings made by Black J in his judgment of 18 June 2013 might otherwise have given rise to issue estoppels binding upon the plaintiffs. In that regard I note, however, that his Honour's decision to stay the winding up was fundamentally based upon his conclusion that Lorie Najjar & Sons was not presently insolvent, and that such conclusion was in turn squarely based upon his various findings to the effect that the two main debts alleged by the liquidator were not made out on the evidence (see, for example, the findings at [59], [60], [62], [67], [85] and [103]).
I turn now to consider the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs, by seeking to litigate the impugned issues, are engaging in an abuse of process. The conduct is said to amount to an abuse primarily because it involves the re-litigation of matters that have already been disposed of by Black J. It was also suggested that the conduct may amount to an abuse because it involves the raising of matters that should have been raised by the plaintiffs, if at all, in the proceedings before Black J.
There is no doubt that an attempt by a party to re-litigate an issue resolved adversely to that party in earlier proceedings can amount to an abuse of process even in the absence of res judicata or an estoppel (see Reichel versus Magrath  <case>- <case>).
In one sense, the impugned issues were resolved in the liquidator's proceedings adversely to the current plaintiffs. Moreover, even though the current plaintiffs did not become parties to those proceedings until after those issues had been dealt with in Black J's judgment of 18 June 2013, they had the opportunity and the practical ability to place relevant evidence before the Court, and participate in the hearing to at least some extent. They also had an involvement as funders of the liquidator, and in that role had, as Black J found, a significant degree of control over the conduct of the proceedings through the choice of legal representatives.
Nevertheless, the liquidator's proceedings as constituted was never a vehicle for the plaintiffs to seek to vindicate their claimed rights against Lorie Najjar & Sons. The company remained in liquidation and the plaintiffs were pursuing their claims through the lodgement of proofs of debt. No attempt was made by the plaintiffs to obtain leave to proceed against the company to pursue their claims in those proceedings. It seems to me that, in these circumstances, the plaintiffs should not be regarded as being in a position akin to parties who, having pursued their rights (or sought to defend their position) in litigation, and having lost, seek to re-litigate the same matter in subsequent proceedings.
Viewed that way, the pursuit of these proceedings by the plaintiffs does not seem to me to involve any significant unfairness to or oppression of the defendants. Further, having regard to the nature of the liquidator's proceedings as constituted, I do not think that any findings in these proceedings favourable to the plaintiffs would be fairly regarded as so inconsistent with the findings made by Black J that the integrity of the system of justice would be called into question.
Although not determinative, it is noteworthy that Black J himself expressly contemplated that the plaintiffs might bring other proceedings to pursue claims against Lorie Najjar & Sons. His Honour evidently regarded such a course as one properly open to the plaintiffs, notwithstanding his findings on the question of solvency. I note also that after these proceedings were commenced, and were before Black J in late 2013 in conjunction with the liquidator's proceedings, no suggestion seems to have then been made that they amounted to an abuse of process. As far as I am aware, that suggestion was not made until the present motion was brought in February this year.
It is also my view, based upon the nature of the liquidator's proceedings as constituted, that this is not a case where it can be said that the plaintiffs, if they were going to raise the impugned claims at all, ought to have done so in the liquidator's proceedings.
For the above reasons, I do not think that the pursuit of the impugned claims by the plaintiffs in these proceedings amounts to an abuse of the process of the Court.
It follows from the above that the defendants' strike out motion fails. The Court will order that the defendants' Notice of Motion filed on 12 February 2015 be dismissed with costs.
