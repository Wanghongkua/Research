Rosalind Au Yong and Anor versus Australian Chinese Forum of New South Wales
Inc and Anor [1996] NSWSC 180 (7 June 1996) 
ROSALIND AU YONG & ANOR v. AUSTRALIAN CHINESE FORUM OF NSW INC &
ANOR /94 
FRIDAY 7 JUNE 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
BRYSON J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: ACF and this litigation.

These proceedings relate to the effect of resolutions of the Management Committee of Chinese Australian Forum Inc. at a meeting on 2 September 1994. 
Before and until 2 September 1994 the first plaintiff Dr Au Yong held office as President and the second plaintiff Iris Lee Yong held office as Secretary.
The first defendant's name then was Australian Chinese Forum of NSW Inc referred to as ACF. It was incorporated under the [Associations Incorporation
Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/) and changed its name on 9 December 1995. Its present [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) came into effect after adoption by a Special General Meeting of members on 24
June 1994. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of
ACF operates with the Model Rules under subs.19(3) which is in these terms: "Where in relation to any matter the model rules make provision but the rules of an incorporated association do not make provision, the provision of the model rules shall, in relation to that matter, be deemed to be included in the rules of the incorporated association." The Model Rules were made by the
Associations Incorporation Regulation 1994, Instrument 1994 - No. 404, which commenced on 1 September 1994, the day before the most significant events.
There were earlier Model Rules but they no longer applied.

The objects of ACF are stated in cl.2 of its [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) in these terms: "The objects of the Association shall be: .1 To promote political awareness of Australian Chinese.
 .2 To provide a forum for the expression of political views by Australian
Chinese.
 .3 To foster and promote unity amongst Australian Chinese.
 .4 To promote the image of Australian Chinese in the community.
 .5 To promote the ideals of multi-culturalism and interracial understanding and harmony in Australia, as well as the advancement and development of
Australia.
 .6 To provide responses to community issues affecting Australian Chinese.
 .7 To do all such things as the Management Committee of the Association consider necessary or desirable in the furtherance of the objects of the
Association." 
Dr Au Yong, who had earlier been President, was one of twenty Management
Committee members elected by an Annual General Meeting on 23 July 1993. At a
Management Committee meeting on 13 August 1993 she was elected President, the second plaintiff was elected Secretary and the second defendant Dr Ang was elected Vice-President. On this occasion there were two nominations for
President and a secret ballot was held. On the previous occasion on which Dr
Au Yong became President there was only one nomination and there was no ballot, and no occasion for a ballot.

Seventeen committee members, including the plaintiffs and the second defendant
Dr Tiam Ang attended a Management Committee meeting which began at 7 pm on
Friday 2 September 1994 in the Tai Ping restaurant. The notice which called the meeting included an agenda and Item 4 was "Allegations against the
Secretary". The Minutes record discussion of matters relating to the form of the minutes of the previous meeting and discussion of an agenda item "Allegations against the Treasurer". They then record business relating to a motion moved by Dr Ang "That in the best interest of ACF we suspend the agenda in order to put forward an urgent motion" which was carried ten to seven. The minutes then record a motion by Dr Ang "That a motion of no-confidence be made in the President and direct her to step down immediately". This was carried ten to seven. The Minutes then record a motion "That T. Ang assume the office of President until the election of a new President, and take over as a chair at this meeting." This was carried nine to two with four abstentions. The next motion recorded was "That a motion of no-confidence be made in the Secretary and direct her to step down immediately." This was not carried.

The plaintiffs did not attend the Annual General Meeting which was held on 9
September 1994. At that time Dr Au Yong was taking the position that the arrangements for that Annual General Meeting were not effective. Dr Ang as
President reported on the events of 2 September 1994 and the Annual General
Meeting resolved "That the President's report be accepted." Twenty-three persons were elected to the Management Committee. The plaintiffs were not nominated and not elected. Dr Ang became President by a decision of the new
Management Committee on the same day, and the affairs of ACF continued without participation by the plaintiffs. Dr Au Yong did not renew her membership by 1
January 1995, and as a result she ceased to be a member on 1 July 1995. She has not since been a member or taken any part in the affairs of ACF.

These proceedings were commenced by Summons on 12 October 1994. Various declaratory orders were sought, principally declarations that Dr Au Yong then held office as President and that Dr Ang did not. No relief was sought which specifically related to the position of Ms Lee Yong who had undoubtedly continued to hold office as Secretary and as member of the Management
Committee until 9 September. At the hearing she did not seek any relief relating to her own position.

The agenda for the Management Committee meeting.

One ground on which it was said that the resolution of 2 July 1994 relating to Dr Au Yong's stepping down lacked effect related to the absence from the notice of meeting of any agenda item relating to her removal.

The terms of the resolution are not entirely clear in that she was not removed from office in so many words. After expressing no-confidence in her, the words used were "direct her to step down immediately". The next following resolution "That T. Ang assume the office as President until the election of a new
President" and the conduct of all concerned show clearly that the resolution was intended and understood to have the effect of removing Dr Au Yong from office as President.

It was contended that Model [Rule (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s21.html) had effect and produced the result that the meeting of the Management
Committee was unable to deal, and did not effectually deal with the resolution for removal of the plaintiff. Model [Rule (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s21.html) provides "Notice of a meeting ... must specify the general nature of the business to be transacted at the meeting and no business other than that business is to be transacted at the meeting, except business which the
Committee Members present at the meeting unanimously agree to treat as urgent business." As I have said, the resolution relating to urgency was not carried unanimously but was carried ten to seven.
 [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) cl.7 "Proceedings of the Management Committee" is in these terms: "7.1 The Management Committee shall meet at least once every two months to dispatch the business of the Association. The President and the Secretary at the request of any two members of the Management Committee, may at any time call a meeting of the Committee.
 .2 Matters arising at any Committee shall be decided by a majority of those present which shall for all purposes be a determination of the Committee. In the case of an equality of votes the person chairing the meeting shall have a second or casting vote." 
Clause 7 and the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) generally contain no provision dealing with what must be contained in a notice of a meeting of the Management Committee. Subclause 7.1 does not say in what manner the meeting is to be called. As the Model Rules make provision in relation to that matter the effect of subs.19(3) of the Act is in my opinion that some of the provisions of Model Rule 21(4) are deemed to be included in the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
These are the provisions relating to what the notice of the meeting is to specify, the prohibition on transacting other business, and the exception relating to transacting business which Committee members agree to treat as urgent busines. However the provisions of cl.7.2 establish that matters arising at any Committee, meaning all matters so arising, shall be decided by a majority of those present. It cannot be said then, referring to the terms of subs.19(3), that the rules of ACF do not make provision for the support which must exist for a decision to agree to treat business not specified in a notice of meeting as urgent business. This is so because of the generality of cl.7.2, which extends to all matters arising in any Committee. Accordingly in my opinion all of Model [Rule (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s21.html) applies except the requirement for unanimity, and Model [Rule .(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s21.html) did not prevent the Management Committee from considering the resolution requiring Dr Au Yong to step down.

The power to remove Office-bearers.

The next ground on which the resolution was attacked was that the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) does not give the Management Committee power to require the President to step down, or to dismiss the President. This again requires consideration of the interaction of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), subs.19(3) and the Model Rules. 
By [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) cl.26 the Management Committee has power to discipline members and this extends to power to expel a member. A very detailed procedure is prescribed for disciplinary action including expulsion, and includes detailed prescription relating to a notice of grounds, an opportunity to make representations to the Management Committee and a right of appeal to a General
Meeting. Clause 26 does not in terms deal with expelling an Office-bearer, or removing an Office-bearer from office.

The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) contains provisions relating to appointing and removing Management Committee members. Under cl.10 the Annual General Meeting is to elect the Management
Committee members. Clause 8 is entitled "Vacation of offices," and by subcl.8.10 the office of a member of the Management Committee shall become vacant upon a resolution passed by a three-quarters majority of members present at a Special General Meeting.

This power is not exercisable by an Annual General Meeting. There is a clear distinction on the face of the constitution between these two different classes of General Meeting. Detailed provisions in cl.11 deal with convening a
Special General Meeting and business at such a meeting.

By [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) cl.6, there are to be eight officers including the President, and by subcl.6.2 "The Office-bearers shall be elected by secret ballot from amongst the members of the Management Committee at its first meeting to be held as soon as possible after the Annual General Meeting." By [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) subcl.5.1 "The Management of the Association shall be vested in the Management
Committee ...". Enumerated powers of the Management Committee include appointing members to the Management Committee to fill casual vacancies; subcl.5.5.

In my opinion the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) contains no provision which deals expressly or by implication with the removal of Office-bearers and empowers any organ of ACF, whether the Management
Committee or any class of general meeting, to remove an Office-bearer from office. In particular subcl.5.1 and cl.7.1 which place the management and the dispatch of the business of the Association in the Management Committee do not have that effect. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) should not be so understood in view of its explicit provisions dealing with expulsion of members and removal of Management Committee members; when the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) deals with expulsions and removals it deals with them expressly, and there is no implication that removal of Office-bearers is included within the broad class of management matters which are vested in the Management Committee. The provisions of cl.6 relating to the election of Office-bearers do not by any implication which should be made carry with them any conferral of power to remove Office-bearers. If a member of the Management Committee were removed by a resolution of a Special General Meeting under cl.8, it would follow in my opinion that that person would cease to be an Office-bearer. Clause 8 is headed "Vacation of Offices" but I do not think that this should be understood as showing that cl.8 was intended to deal with vacation of the office of an
Office-bearer under cl.6; the terms of cl.8 show at length that the only offices with which it deals are the offices of members of the Management
Committee. Removal from office as an Office-bearer is an incidental consequence of a decision under cl.8, but it cannot be said that the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) makes provision for removal of an Office-bearer by cl.8.

The defendants' counsel submitted that the power to remove and suspend Office- bearers is implied in cl.6.2 of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
The plaintiffs' counsel took a similar position in an alternative argument, accompanied by the contention that the procedural requirement for secret ballot applies to removals. I do not accept this because the language of cl.6.2 is entirely clear and relates only to election. An implied grant of power to remove, which is not supported by the language used, could be made only if the implication were necessary to make the express grant of power effective; there is no such necessity.

The Model Rules also do not deal explicitly with removal of Office-bearers from office.

The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) does not make provision with respect to the application of the provisions of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) to the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/); it does not say anything about whether the provisions of the [Interpretation
Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) apply or do not apply. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and in particular cl.6 do not contain any provision with respect to whether the power to elect Office-bearers extends to making other decisions dealing with holding office, such as removal. Model [Rule (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s1.html) provides: "The provisions of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) apply to and in respect of these rules in the same manner as those provisions would so apply if these rules were an instrument made under the Act." In my opinion the
Model Rules make provision in this way in relation to a matter for which the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) does not make provision, so that by subs.19(3) Model [Rule (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s1.html) is deemed to be included in the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), and the provisions of [s.47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s47.html) of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) apply and extend the Management Committee's power to elect to office to include, in terms of subs.47(1)(b)(i) and (ii), the power to remove or suspend an office holder and to appoint some other person to act in the office. However the extended powers may in my opinion be exercised only in the same manner as the power of election itself, by secret ballot. Under subs.47(1)(a) the power may be exercised as occasion requires, and hence is not limited by subcl.6.2 to the first meeting after the Annual General Meeting.

It is on the evidence clear that there was no secret ballot and no ballot at all on the resolution relating to removing Dr Au Yong from office. So far as appears, the question of a ballot was not considered or discussed; there was no call for a ballot and no attempt to take one.

In my opinion the requirement for a secret ballot is not a requirement with which it was mandatory to comply; if it were, its not being complied with would mean that what took place was entirely ineffectual. It is a directory requirement which must be complied with in substance, so that if it is not complied with in substance the decision is voidable, and its lack of effect may be established by a declaratory order of this court, which the plaintiffs claim. As the requirement is no more than directory, it can be waived; but any waiver must be made by all persons affected, and that must include Dr Au Yong and all who were opposed to it, who can be taken to include the seven who voted against it. If voidable decisions are acted on in some way in which persons concerned in its validity alter their positions, the position would arise that those opposed to them become estopped from maintaining that they were void, or there will come to be discretionary grounds for withholding an order for avoidance; but as the plaintiffs acted with reasonable promptness, they are not impeded by those matters.

In my opinion the operation of subs.19(3) is not limited to cases where the whole of some rule or subrule in the Model Rules can be picked up and inserted, like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, in its exact terms into the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), nor to a reverse process. What is to be applied is a provision made on a matter by the Model Rules, and the application of such a provision may require some accommodation and departure from literal terms. The defendants' counsel suggested that the reference to "any matter" in subs.19(3) uses the word `matter' in the same sense as "matters" is used in subs.73(1) relating to the power to make regulations, and in Schd.(1) which specifies matters to be provided for in rules and in Model Rules. Hence he contended that the matter to be considered for the application of subs.19(3) must be the entirety of the subject in one of the paragraphs in Sched.(1). In my opinion however the use of the word `matters' in s.73 and in Sched.(1) does not establish a genus to which it must be understood that the use of "any matter" in subs.19(3) conforms, and subs.19(3) uses "matter" in its ordinary sense, which is extremely general.

In my opinion then the resolution of 2 September 1994 lacked effect and Dr Au
Yong was not thereby removed from office as President.

Ratification.

Counsel for the defendants contended that if the purported removal of Dr Au Yong from office as President was not effective, it was ratified by a decision of the Annual General Meeting held on 28 January 1995. Neither plaintiff attended. The Minutes show that 39 members were present and the following resolution was passed "That the resolution of the Management Committee on 2 September 1994 that the then president, Rosalind Au Yong, be removed from that office as at that date, be ratified." The minute records that this motion was carried and "there was only one dissenting vote". The number of votes in favour is not given. The minutes do not show that the meeting was a Special General Meeting and no evidence suggests that it was, or that procedures in the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) cl.11 for convening a Special General Meeting were followed or that the requirement of [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) cl.8.10 for a three-quarters majority of members present to vote in favour was met. 
In my opinion the purported ratification was not effective because the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of
ACF does not empower the members in an Annual General Meeting to remove an
Office-bearer, and hence they are not in a position to ratify an ineffective purported removal by some other organ of ACF. The reasoning which shows that the Management Committee is empowered to remove Office-bearers cannot be applied to the members in an Annual General Meeting. Further, the purported ratification took place at a time when the term of office which the plaintiff held had expired and had no continuing effect; the purported ratification related to events which were past and closed so that it was not possible for anyone to give effect to or act on the ratification.

Waiver.

Defendants' counsel contended that there had been a waiver and observed that it is not necessary that a person should be subjectively conscious of the existence of alternative rights to be bound by conduct in adhering to one of them to a waiver of the other. However there is in my opinion in the present case no question of waiver or election as Dr Au Yong did not at any point adhere to one of alternate and inconsistent rights. 
In the circumstances in which Dr Au Yong was placed at the meeting of 2
September 1994, her not raising the question of a need for a secret ballot on that occasion cannot fairly be understood as indicating that she waived or forewent her right to a secret ballot. It was not a shortcoming of hers, but of the mover and seconder of the motion that there was no advertence to the need to comply with this procedural requirement. Dr Au Yong was taken by surprise and when the resolution was passed she could not reasonably be expected to attempt to maintain the position of being the President and chairing the meeting in the face of a resolution which, among other things, directed her to step down. Such behaviour would have been extremely disruptive and, whether she was validly removed or was still President, the meeting was undoubtedly entitled to direct the person in the chair to step down and to place someone else in the chair for the purpose of that meeting. The plaintiff did nothing further to maintain her position, so far as appears by evidence except to write a letter on 5 September asserting that she was still in control. She did not attempt to maintain this position at the Annual Meeting on 9 September and Dr Ang went to that meeting in the apparent position of
President appointed by a majority of the Management Committee and with the moral advantage which flowed from that. His position was extremely tenuous but as it was to come to an end with that Annual General Meeting there could have been little to gain from debating it. His position was tenuous because in a resolution debated without notice he had obtained ten out of twenty Management
Committee votes, not even a majority of the Management Committee, in a meeting attended by 17 people, and it was not possible then and is not possible now to know what would have happened if notice of the business to be discussed had been given. Perhaps some of the missing three would have attended; perhaps some of the supporting ten would not; different contributions might have been made to the debate, the voting might have been different and if there had been a secret ballot some who voted in support may have voted against. The past cannot be recreated and examined. Dr Ang gained an advantage, which he carried into the meeting on 9 September, from the voting his motion attracted on 2
September; it seems quite possible that this support was fortuitous and evanescent. This litigation was commenced on 12 October 1994 and in my view was commenced with sufficient promptitude to demonstrate that there was no acquiescence or waiver.

Procedural unfairness.

The validity of the resolution was also attacked on the ground of procedural unfairness. It was said that there was a denial of natural justice because there was no notice of intention to deal with removal, there was no reasonable opportunity to debate it, there was no actual debate, and there was no clear statement of grounds upon which Dr Au Yong was removed from office. The factual basis of these complaints is clearly correct; Dr Au Yong was ambushed in a manner which, as must have been obvious to all present, was grossly unfair. There were no clear statement of grounds, no real discussion of whether or not grounds existed and hence no opportunity to answer them. They could not be answered as it was not clear what they were, and the matter was hustled through so that Dr Au Yong had no real opportunity to deal with whether or not she should be removed. The manner of her removal was indecent and inappropriate, and not in accord with the manner in which ACF had earlier dealt with similar business. 
I will address the source of the view that the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) contains an implied agreement that proceedings for removal of Office-bearers are to be conducted by fair procedures, although the purported removal from office was otherwise defective for lack of power in the Management Committee.
Some indications on which decisions of Courts requiring fair procedures have been based are absent; the organisation is voluntary in nature and there is no context in which removal from office is injurious to the opportunity to gain a livelihood or to any other significant economic interest.

As I have held earlier, Model [Rule (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s21.html) requires notice of a meeting specifying the general nature of the business. In practical terms there will usually be routine business on which a listing in an agenda and express notice would have no real effect, because all concerned should reasonably expect that routine business will be dealt with. There will often be other business which could be continued and dealt with appropriately even without notice. However, business of the order of importance presented by removal of an Office-bearer would not be adequately dealt with unless reasonable notice of the business to be brought forward had been given. It is not necessary that the notice be given by any particular person, and the party proposing the motion could give it. The absence of notice before a meeting might produce the result that after the motion had been received, there should be an adjournment.

Authorities relating to the general law on notice of business at a meeting of a corporation were collected by Kelly SPJ in Ephstathis v. The Greek Orthodox
Community of St George [(1988) 13 ACLR 691] at 693.
 "The basic rule applicable to meetings is expressed in Halsbury's Laws of
England, 4th ed, vol 9, para 1296, in these words: `Where notice is given that particular business will be transacted at a meeting, no other business can be embarked upon at that meeting unless the whole body corporate is present and consents.' The rationale of the rule is that the purpose of the notice is to enable persons receiving it to know what is proposed to be done at the meeting so that they can make up their minds whether or not to attend.
This was explained by Joske J in McLure versus Mitchell [(1974) 6 ALR 471] at 494, in a passage which I would respectfully adopt: `If the members of a corporation are summoned to appear for one particular purpose they cannot proceed to any other matter without the unanimous consent of the whole body: (Machell versus Nevinson <case>; [(1724) ER 936).] Thus all the shareholders of a company must be present and agree to the waiving of formalities: (Re Oxted Motor Co [[1921] 3 KB ]; [[1921] All ER Rep 646]; Re Express Engineering Works [[1920] 1 Ch 466]; Re Sanders
Ltd [(1932) 49 WN 220).]
The purpose of a notice of meeting is to enable persons to know what is proposed to be done at the meeting so that they can make up their minds whether or not to attend. The notice should be so drafted that ordinary minds can fairly understand its meaning. It should not be a tricky notice artfully framed: (Henderson versus Bank of Australia [(1890) 45 Ch D 330] at 337).
Thus notice of an extraordinary general meeting must disclose all facts necessary to enable the shareholder receiving it to determine in his own interest whether he ought or ought not to attend the meeting. His absence may be because he does not know the real facts and, if he had known them, he may have attended: (Tiessen versus Henderson [[1899] 1 Ch 861]; Ryan versus Edna
May Junction GM Co <case>; [(1916) 21 CLR 487).'"] 
Underlying the principles is the simple need for effectiveness of the meetings, which cannot be achieved unless those who attend have a reasonable opportunity in advance to know what they are to deal with, consider how they should deal with it and indeed consider whether they need to attend and participate at all. This has special force where their own interests are involved in some way, as instanced by this case. The source of these general rules, in my understanding, is the implication into its constitution of a requirement that proceedings will be conducted in a reasonably fair and effective manner. This will be a requirement for any corporation which has a number of members so that its affairs must be conducted by meetings. Unless its constitution authorises proceeding in some other way the contractual bond among the members requires that its proceedings be conducted in a reasonably fair and effective manner, with reasonable notice of important business, and the same implied requirement means that there must be fair consideration of business which if carried would be adverse to the interests of a member, such as expulsions, suspension or removal from office. Without these implications it seems hardly possible that, in the Australian community in the present age, people would take the trouble to participate.

An organisation and each member of a corporation have an interest in its functioning in a regular and efficient manner and in members having an opportunity to know what is to be dealt with and to decide whether to attend, whether to participate and in what way to participate. I say ordinarily because there must be many exceptions; cases where the rules of the organisation authorise dealing with business without notice, cases where urgency of business makes it necessary to proceed without notice, cases of routine business where notice would add nothing, and there may be other instances.

The attention which can be given to the interest of individuals must at least to some degree be affected by the nature of the organisation. Fair treatment of particular members will usually be subsidiary to the attainment of the objects of the organisation, but the degree of subordination may be greater or less. The question who should continue to be a member of the board of directors of a company carrying on business for gain could reasonably be considered in a different way to continuance in office in a community organisation. I would think that attainment of the objects of ACF would tend to be impeded, at least to some degree by observance of procedures which were not fair.

The importance attached by courts to fair procedures for expulsions and similar decisions in organisations of many kinds is well illustrated by a passage in the judgment of Megarry J in John v. Rees [[1970] 1 Ch 345] at 398 to 400 in which his Lordship set out lengthy passages from his decision in Fountaine v. Chesterton, which is not fully reported, and included the following passage at 399 - 400: "`It is trite law that the rules of an unincorporated association form a contract between all the members of that association. It is, indeed, a somewhat special form of contract; but subject to that, what I am required to do is to construe the terms of a contract. Where the terms in issue deal with the exercise of a power of peremptory suspension or termination of the rights of one of the parties to such a contract, then I think that the common expectation of mankind would be that the power would be exercised only in accordance with the principles of natural justice unless the contrary is made plain. This expectation rests upon high and ancient authority. When a member of a university was deprived of his degrees without being given an opportunity to defend himself, Fortescue J. said: "The laws of God and man both give the party an opportunity to make his defence, if he has any. I remember to have heard it observed by a very learned man upon such an occasion, that even God himself did not pass sentence upon Adam, before he was called upon to make his defence. Adam (says God) where art thou? Has thou not eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat? And the same question was put to Eve also': Rex v. Cambridge University (1723) 1 Stra. 557, 567.
Even if the law permits the principles of natural justice to be effectually excluded by suitable drafting, I would not readily construe the rules as having achieved this result unless they left me in no doubt that this was the plain and manifest intention. Put a little differently, I would say that if there is any doubt, the applicability of the principles of natural justice will be given the benefit of that doubt. The cry `That isn't fair' is to be found from earliest days, in nursery, street and school alike; and those who wish to confer upon the committee or other governing body of a club or association a power to act unfairly or arbitrarily in derogation of common and universal expectation must make it plain beyond a peradventure that this has been done. This view is, I think, at least consistent with the approach of
Romer L.J. in Lee v. Showmen's Guild of Great Britain [[1952] 2 Q.B.
], , C.A. on a not dissimilar point, where he said that it would require `the use of clear language' before he was satisfied that the members of any body such as the trade union in question had agreed to leave the construction of the trade union's rules to the committee, to the exclusion of the courts." 
Discretion to make a declaratory order.

It is for consideration whether the court should in its discretion make a declaration of right. Declaratory orders are not a matter of course. The power to make a declaratory order is conferred by [s.75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s75.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and is not restricted by the absence of some context of a claim to equitable relief based on property rights. For these reasons the plaintiffs' claim to a declaration is quite distinct from the claim which the High Court rejected in Cameron v. Hogan [51 CLR 388.] 
The litigation deals with a subject on which Dr Au Yong had legal rights, in the nature of contractual rights having regard to subs.11(2) of the [Associations Incorporation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aia1984307/), to the effect that the affairs of the Association should be conducted in accordance with the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).

The utility of making a declaration is a prominent discretionary consideration. The declarations which the plaintiffs seek would not have high utility, as the question who was the President from 2 to 9 September 1994 has no discernible impact on the continuing economic interests of the plaintiffs, or of ACF. The courts have a well established reluctance to deal with controversies within voluntary organisations and social and sporting clubs, particularly when there are mechanisms internal to those organisations for handling the controversies. (Here there are not.) ACF has political objectives; its affairs have a different and higher importance than the affairs of social and sporting organisations, and it has actually achieved some effectiveness in political action relating to immigration, the interests of overseas students in Australia, and the interests of Australian Chinese.

What an order would establish is whether Dr Au Young was in office for seven days from 2 to 9 September 1994. There is no suggestion that Dr Ang took any significant step while he purportedly held office to the continuing prejudice of Dr Au Yong or of ACF or of any other person. Dr Au Yong's tenure as
President and Management Committee member would in any event have ended on 9
September, when she had an opportunity, with all other members, to seek election again as a member of the Management Committee, and if she did, to seek to become President again. The plaintiff took no part in the events of 9
September, and let her membership run out and did not renew it. There was a later meeting in January 1995, in which she again took no part. She has gone her own way and let ACF go its own way.

The defendants' counsel marshalled a number of discretionary considerations, to which I have directed attention. He contended, among other things, that nothing of substance had been lost by the failure to follow prescribed procedure, that the relief sought would serve no practical purpose and had no utility now and indeed, that it should be found that it did not ever have any practical effect. These contentions were based on what I regard as a wrong view of the effect and importance of Dr Au Yong's removal from office, a week before the Annual General Meeting and indeed a week before a municipal election in which she was a candidate. The event was the subject of reports in
Chinese language newspapers, must have been known to a circle of interested members of the public and must have seemed important to them. Dr Au Yong's reputation was obviously involved, and obviously adversely affected. This cannot be disregarded, but should be put right.

It was also urged on me that the effects in the affairs of ACF were temporary and are wholly in the past, and that Dr Au Yong's interest in being a member and in ACF affairs is also in the past; she has not renewed her membership and like other members has no proprietary interest in the assets of ACF; her office holding was not remunerated and she seeks no damages. The last event of participation in affairs is her unfortunate letter of 5 September 1994. I have had regard to these considerations but in my view they are outweighed by other factors.

Defendants' counsel contended that I should see the purported ratification as an expression of the views of members, in effect closing the controversy. I see the significance of this resolution in quite the reverse sense; that ineffective resolution showed the persistence of views which were quite wrong about the effect of the events of 2 September 1994 and left the injustice of
Dr Au Yong's position unrequited. This resolution closed off the affair in the records of ACF on a wrong basis.

In my judgment the manner in which Dr Au Yong was purportedly removed from office was quite unfair, and it was an extremely unsatisfactory event in an
Association with the objects of ACF. Presidents and other Office-bearers of such organisations should not be overborne without notice by hurried motions and by mustering a bare majority, without notice and without observing required procedures. It is very unsatisfactory that the affairs of an organisation with serious objects should have been conducted in that way. This is particularly so as there was to be an Annual General Meeting within a short time, and arrangements had been made (and were fulfilled) for it to take place within a week, at which the members were to consider who were to be their
Management Committee. There was no prospect of harm for ACF if Dr Au Yong continued in office for a week, or even for several weeks, and went into the meeting as the President. The procedural requirement that an Office-bearer be removed only by secret ballot had a significance which was not limited to its significance for Dr Au Yong. It was an interest of ACF and also of each member that its [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) be complied with in this important respect. The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) was disregarded. There was no real urgency which could justify what took place.

In the circumstances I am quite satisfied that the plaintiffs must not be sent away without a declaration establishing what the correct position was.

MY ORDERS ARE: 
Order that the Amended Summons dated 14 February 1996 be amended so as to show the name of the First Defendant as Chinese Australian Forum Inc.

President and direct her to step down immediately" passed by the Management
Committee of the First Defendant on 2 September 1994 did not have effect to remove the First Plaintiff from office as President.

Order that the Defendants pay the Plaintiffs' costs of the proceedings.
