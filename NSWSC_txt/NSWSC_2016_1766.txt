JUDGMENT
BARRETT AJA: I am dealing with the question of costs in each of two proceedings following my judgment of 6 September 2016 (In the matter of Shaolin Temple Foundation (Australia) Ltd <case> Written submissions on costs were filed as directed.
Each proceeding was an application by Shaolin Temple Foundation (Australia) Ltd ("Shaolin") under [s 459G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459g.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on Shaolin. One demand was served by Street Quinn Pty Ltd ("SQPL"). The other was served by Kwok Leong Pang. In each case, it was ordered that the statutory demand be set aside.
The natural consequence, in terms of r 42.1 of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) , would be that SQPL and Kwok Leong Pang each be ordered to pay Shaolin's costs. Shaolin therefore submits that the following order should be made in each proceeding: "The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceeding, including all reserved costs, on the ordinary basis."
There are, however, circumstances which, according to SQPL and Kwok Leong Pang, warrant departure from the general rule. They say that it would be unfair and unreasonable to require them to bear the whole of Shaolin's costs. Reference is made, in that connection, to the following features of the litigation: * (1) In the SQPL matter, Shaolin filed a motion seeking enforcement of a notice to produce and discovery orders, which application was withdrawn in the course of hearing on 11 May 2016 on the preliminary issue of whether the <case> application by SQPL had been made within the period of 21 days specified in that section. On 11 May 2016, it was ordered that Shaolin pay SQPL's costs of the withdrawn motion. Shaolin's costs of that motion should therefore be excluded from costs of the proceedings awarded to it.
* (2) The question of the date of service of the SQPL statutory demand was determined in favour of Shaolin on 1 June 2016 and costs of that aspect were reserved. SQPL contends that the appropriate order in respect of that determination is that each party bear its own costs. The basis for that contention is that crucial evidence as to the question of the time of service of the demand was not served by Shaolin until about a week before the hearing on 1 June 2016, which evidence could have been produced much earlier, thereby resolving the matter more expeditiously.
* (3) In both matters, Shaolin made unsuccessful attempts to have substantial quantities of new evidence admitted at the final hearing - to the extent that the first of two hearing days (4 August 2016) was taken up by very substantial argument about evidence. Much of the argument was determined adversely to Shaolin at the hearing. The balance was determined adversely to it in the reserved judgment. Shaolin's attempts, it might be noted, were made after 20 June 2016, the day on which Brereton J had made certain directions limiting further evidence without special reasons being shown.
* (4) When the matter was adjourned part heard on 4 August 2016, it was made clear by the court that no further evidence was to be relied on by either party, except as to certain narrowly defined matters. Despite this, Shaolin served, on the afternoon of Sunday 14 August (the day immediately before the resumed hearing), a number of documents relating to the Kwok Leong Pang case which the court ultimately declined to admit into evidence.
Some of the particular matters mentioned are peculiar to the SQPL matter. Others are common to the two proceedings.
The orders the defendants consider warranted are: * (1) In the SQPL proceeding: * (a) The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs on the ordinary basis except for: * (i) Costs associated with the interlocutory process filed by the plaintiff on 17 March 2016 and withdrawn on 11 May 2016; * (ii) Costs associated with the determination of the separate question of jurisdiction heard on 1 June 2016; and * (iii) Costs incurred in the period 21 June 2016 to and including the hearing on 4 August 2016.
* (b) The costs of the defendant ordered on 11 May 2016 to be paid by the plaintiff in respect of the interlocutory process filed by the plaintiff on 17 March 2016 and withdrawn on 11 May 2016 be set off against the costs payable by the the defendant.
* (2) In the Kwok Leong Pang proceeding: * (a) The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs on the ordinary basis except for: * (i) costs incurred in the period 21 June 2016 to and including 4 August 2016; and * (ii) costs of obtaining inadmissible further documentary evidence on or about 5 to 14 August 2016 and sought to be tendered on 15 August 2016.
As to the interlocutory process in the SQPL matter filed on 17 March 2016 and withdrawn on 11 May 2016, Shaolin accepts that a costs order against it was made by Black J on 11 May 2016. Shaolin's costs of that interlocutory process should therefore be excluded from any general order for the payment of Shaolin's costs by SQPL. I do not understand Shaolin to oppose an order that the costs it is obliged to pay by the 11 May 2016 order should be set off against costs payable by SQPL by reason of the ultimate decision in favour of Shaolin.
As to the jurisdiction question separately determined on 1 June 2016, Shaolin points out that Black J ordered that costs be reserved. It was, says Shaolin, incumbent upon SQPL to apply then, rather than now, for a costs order in relation to that aspect. SQPL's response is that there was simply no time for the question of costs to be argued on the relevant occasion, judgment having been delivered after 5pm. In those circumstances and in view of the outcome on the determination of the separate question, the costs outcome should be as SQPL proposes, that is, that each party pay its own costs.
In relation to costs associated with the substantial body of material that the court declined to admit on the final hearing, Shaolin's position is that its approach and conduct were not such as to warrant an adverse costs determination against it. I disagree. The court had made it clear on 20 June 2016 that no further evidence was to be produced without special reasons being shown. Thereafter, Shaolin undertook a project of gathering further evidence at considerable cost including travel by at least two lawyers from Melbourne to China. The result was the production of affidavits and documents that the court found were not affidavits which were rejected in part because of form and in part because admission would have caused unwarranted prejudice to the defendants in circumstances where the evidence was effectively closed. The defendants should not be saddled with the not inconsiderable costs of that abortive exercise.
Shaolin submits, however, that it is inappropriate to deprive it of its costs of that exercise by reference to the period from 21 June during which the attempts at evidence gathering occurred since it cannot be presumed that there were not other activities during the period. Given that the period included the lead-up to the commencement of the final hearing on 4 August 2016 (during which preparation would obviously have occurred), that submission must be accepted. The exclusion from the costs order should be by reference to activity rather than period, even though that may make the process of assessment more difficult.
As to the first day of the hearing, it may be accepted that substantive aspects were dealt with to some extent. But the fact remains that a large part of the day was spent on matters going to the admissibility of Shaolin's evidence, including a voir dire in the course of which Ms Mustafa-Ay was examined, cross-examined and re-examined about the processes adopted in relation to the preparation of the supposed affidavits in China. The defendants should have to pay only one-half of the costs of that day.
The orders are as follows: 
In proceedings 2016/37802 (SQPL proceedings): 
The defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings on the party/party basis except for: * (a) the plaintiff's costs associated with the interlocutory process filed by the plaintiff on 17 March 2016 and withdrawn on 11 May 2016; * (b) the plaintiff's costs associated with the determination of the separate question of jurisdiction heard on 1 June 2016; and * (c) the plaintiff's costs incurred after 21 June 2016 of an incidental to obtaining and preparation of evidence sought to be tendered or read upon the final hearing on 4 and 15 August 2016 and rejected by the court.
 * (d) one-half of the plaintiff's costs of the hearing on 4 August 2016 
The costs of the defendant ordered on 11 May 2016 to be paid by the plaintiff in respect of the interlocutory process filed by the plaintiff on 17
