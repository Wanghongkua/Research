JUDGMENT
On 10 February 2014, Adams J made the following orders: 
Mr Rahman is prohibited from instituting proceedings in New South Wales without first obtaining leave of the Court; no further steps are to be taken by Mr Rahman in any proceeding already instituted by him in New South Wales without leave of the Court; all proceedings already instituted by Mr Rahman in New South Wales are stayed pending leave of the Court to proceed; [Mr Rahman] is to pay the [Attorney General of New South Wales'] costs.
His Honour delivered a judgment in support of those orders: Attorney-General of New South Wales versus Rahman  <case>
On 23 May 2014, Mr Rahman ("the applicant") filed a summons in this Court. On the same date, he filed an affidavit that he had affirmed before a Justice of the Peace.
On 26 June 2014, the applicant filed an affidavit with regard to service upon four persons who are named as defendants in the summons.
Due to the orders made by Adams J on 10 February 2014, the matter was referred to me for determination in Chambers. In short, the question for determination is whether the applicant, having been declared a vexatious litigant, should nevertheless be granted leave to institute proceedings.

Overview of the applicable statutory structure [Section 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) ("the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/)") is relevantly as follows:  Application for leave to institute proceedings 
This section applies to a person (the applicant) who is: subject to a vexatious proceedings order prohibiting the person from instituting proceedings, or ...

The applicant may apply to an appropriate authorised court for leave to institute proceedings that the order would otherwise prohibit the person from instituting.

The applicant must file an affidavit with the application that: lists all occasions on which the applicant has applied for leave: under this section, or ...
 lists all other proceedings the applicant has instituted in Australia, including proceedings instituted before the commencement of this section, and discloses all facts material to the application, whether supporting or adverse to the application, that are known to the applicant.

The applicant must not serve a copy of the application or affidavit on any person unless: an order is made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s16.html) (1) , and the copy is served in accordance with the order.

An appropriate authorised court may dispose of the application by: dismissing the application under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html), or granting the application under [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s16.html) 
Despite any other [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) or law, the applicant may not appeal from a decision disposing of the application.
[Section 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html) is as follows:  Dismissing application for leave 
An appropriate authorised court must dismiss an application made under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) for leave to institute proceedings if it considers: the affidavit required by [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) (3) does not substantially comply with that subsection, or the proceedings are vexatious proceedings, or there is no prima facie ground for the proceedings.

The application may be dismissed even if the applicant does not appear at the hearing of the application.
"Proceedings" are inclusively defined in [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s4.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) as follows: Meaning of "proceedings"

Summary of effect of legislation 
In short, there can be no doubt that [s 14(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) of the [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) applies to the applicant. [Section 14(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html) applies to the summons that he has filed. Pursuant to [s 15](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s15.html), leave to institute proceedings must be refused if the applicant has not filed an affidavit that substantially possesses the three attributes set out in [s 14(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s14.html); or if the proceedings are vexatious; or if the proceedings lack a prima face ground.

Extracts from documents filed by applicant
The summons and affidavit are lengthy, and I do not propose to recount them in their entirety in this judgment. I consider that the following extracts are sufficient to convey their flavour. They have been precisely replicated. 
The first order sought in the summons is as follows: 
Your Hon. would be pleased enough 'for granting Application for leave ' of Applicant's Summons, for relief against the 'three
Defendant's acts' under [s12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s12.html)

Hon's decisions , the applicant' as construe are violations of the " Core functions and responsibility of Judiciary is to that 'The Law should protect the rights and freedoms of members of the community -irrespective of races- as applied in Australia (but was initially excluded in our Constitutions that
Aborigines are not). The administrations of law should be just under law .
Such responsibility has been entrusted to the Australian Judges / Registrars for the administrations of any rights incursions against the community by the
Executives and dominant social class (as submitted). And henceforth such role (Justice (s)/ Registrar (s) to upheld the rule of law and serve the community.

The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) contemplates Federal -to -States vesting of Jurisdictions. But it has nothing to say about 'State - to - Federal' vesting of Jurisdiction : Case Ref:

,and R versus Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte

And thereby any acts by the Federal Magistrates Court , Federal Court of
Australia and ISTA' are invalid and unlawful in applicant's proceedings, and
Hon. would be pleased enough to granting for such orders for the applicant of administrations of justice to upheld Rule of law.

Should leave be granted?
Turning to the statutory preconditions for a grant of leave, the applicant has filed an affidavit that he affirmed before a Justice of the Peace on 23 May 2014. The document is typewritten and in general conformity with the technical requirements of the Rules of the Court. 
In short, I consider that the chapeau of <case> of the Act has been the subject of general compliance.
It seems that the applicant has served the purported defendants to the summons with copies of the documents that he has filed, contrary to <case> of the Act. However, I am prepared to proceed on the assumption that that was an unintended contravention, and I do not regard it of itself as disentitling the applicant to a grant of leave. 
By way of paragraph 7C of his affidavit, the applicant has sought to incorporate in his affidavit the extensive review of all of his litigation contained in the judgment of Adams J, itself based (I infer) on extensive evidence tendered before his Honour by the Attorney General of New South Wales in the proceedings that culminated in that judgment. In that sense, the applicant has brought to my attention the highly adverse fact that he has been engaged in a vast amount of litigation in the past. To my mind, it could be onerous and fruitless to call upon an applicant, pursuant to <case>(b) of the Act, mechanistically to recount in an affidavit material that is readily available in a detailed judgment with regard to the same subject matter. In the absence of submissions to the contrary, I am prepared to proceed on the assumption that the applicant has complied with <case>(b) of the Act by incorporating portions of the judgment of his Honour.
As for <case>(c) of the Act, it is impossible to assess whether the applicant "discloses all facts material to the application, whether supporting or adverse to the application, that are known to the applicant". I am prepared to proceed on the assumption that the applicant has done his best to comply with it, and reveal the facts of which he has knowledge and that he regards as material. 
However, the applicant has not complied with <case>(a), in that he has not deposed to all of the occasions upon which he has applied for leave under this section since he was declared a vexatious litigant. 
I infer from paragraph 7 of the affidavit (which is extracted above) that that failing is the result of a misunderstanding on the part of the applicant, in that he has listed occasions upon which he has sought leave from the New South Wales Court of Appeal, and not leave pursuant to <case>(a)(i) of the Act.
On this basis alone, the precondition for mandatory dismissal of the application for leave contained in <case>(a) is established.
There is a further basis upon which the application for leave must be refused; namely, that the proceedings are vexatious. That is because, to my mind, they are an abuse of the process of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. I say that making due allowance for the fact that the applicant is unrepresented; that English is not his first language; and that a sense on his part of having suffered a serious injustice may have affected the documents that he has drafted and filed.
The summons filed by the applicant seems to suggest that the applicant claims that, on 19 October 2012, some persons in some fraudulent way dealt with a piece of real property in which he had an interest.
The affidavit seems to suggest that Adams J was wrong in declaring the applicant a vexatious litigant, and that the legislation under which his Honour did so is constitutionally invalid in any event.
Although it is possible to understand to a degree the contentions of fact and law that the applicant is putting forward, I respectfully consider that the two documents as a whole are verbose, repetitive, and garbled to the point of incoherence.
If the applicant were granted leave to institute proceedings, the summons would be immediately liable to be struck out by an opponent. And the affidavit, if there were an opponent, would be the subject of countless successful objections.
I consider that the determination of this threshold question in Chambers does not call for a detailed analysis by me of what proceedings may be characterised as an abuse of process. In any event, it is well established that the concept of abuse of process cannot and should not be reduced to defined or closed categories: see for example Batistatos versus Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales <case>; <case>- <case>. 
It suffices to say that I am satisfied that the summons and affidavit fall soundly within the concept of "vexatious proceedings" in the Act. I consider that the extracts from the filed documents amply demonstrate that proposition. 
It follows that a second precondition for mandatory dismissal, namely that contained in <case>(b) of the Act, has been established. Leave must also be refused on that further basis.

Conclusion and order 
In short, on two separate bases, the Act commands that I must not grant leave to the applicant to institute proceedings.
I make the following order: 
Leave to institute proceedings is refused.
