JUDGMENT
Before the Court is a Notice of Motion filed on 24 February 2016 in the Registry of this Court. The Motion that I am asked to determine seeks expedition of the hearing of a Statement of Claim filed by the plaintiff. The Statement of Claim relates to the medical and nursing care provided to a 93 year old lady.
The expedition is required because the determination of a Statement of Claim is necessary to ensure that adequate and appropriate care can be provided to the patient. Both parties agree that expedition is appropriate, having regard to the age of the patient, and more particularly, to some specific injuries which she sustained in February of 2015.
There is an issue as to whether the defendant is responsible for those injuries, owing to its negligence. That is an issue that will need to be determined with some speed in all of the circumstances.
Accordingly, and noting the consent of the defendant, I make the orders sought in the Notice of Motion, that is, that the hearing of this matter is to be dealt with with expedition.
