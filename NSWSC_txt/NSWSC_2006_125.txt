JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
GZELL J  
FRIDAY 10 MARCH 2006  /05 LEDA PTY LTD & ANOR versus JOHN WEERDEN (NO 2)  
JUDGMENT  
The acquisition of the Leisure Trust  Leisure Management Pty Ltd was the trustee of a unit trust called the
Leisure Developments Trust. It acquired land at Surfers Paradise in Queensland before 20 September 1985. It constructed a hotel and managed it. In so doing it generated losses of approximately $39 million. It sold the hotel in March and retained the management rights.  In April or May 1991 the plaintiff, Leda Pty Ltd, began to investigate the prospect of acquiring the Leisure Trust. By then Leisure Management held a unit, office and shop relating to a bowling club.  The proposal was for Leda to acquire the shares in Leisure Management and the shares in Leisure Developments (Queensland) Pty Ltd which owned all the units in the Leisure Trust.  Leda was entitled to units in the Tuggeranong Town Centre Trust that had constructed a shopping centre in Canberra. It was poised to make a large profit assessable to income tax. It was proposed that some of its entitlement to those units be transferred to the Leisure Trust so that net income of the
Tuggeranong Trust could be distributed to the Leisure Trust to off-set its tax losses.  The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) contained anti-avoidance measures with respect to transfers of tax losses. Section 80A, as it then stood, required a continuity of beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the shares in a loss company from the year of incurrence of the loss to the year a claim to deduct the loss was made under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s80.html) or <case>. Section 80E provided that if that test was not satisfied, the company had to carry on the same business before and after the change in beneficial ownership if the losses were to constitute a deduction. Neither of those requirements, however, then applied to trusts.  Losses incurred before the end of the year ended 30 June 1989 could only be carried forward to offset assessable income in the seven years following the incurrence of the loss under the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), s (2).  There were, however, general anti-avoidance provisions in the [Income Tax
Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [Pt
IVA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a)
Under [s
F(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s177f.html) the Commissioner of Taxation had a discretion to cancel a tax benefit. That concept was defined in [s
C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s177c.html), relevantly for present purposes, as a deduction being allowable where the whole or part of it would not have been allowable, or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable, if a scheme had not been entered into or carried out. [Section
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s177d.html) provided that [Pt
IVA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a) applied to any scheme where, having regard to eight specified matters, it would be concluded that one of the persons who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of it, did so for the purpose of enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme. Purpose was defined in [s
A(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s177a.html)
It provided that a reference to a scheme being entered into or carried out for a particular purpose should be read as including a reference to the scheme, or part of it, being entered into or carried out for two or more purposes of which that particular purpose was the dominant one.  
Price Waterhouse's retainer  The defendant, John Weerden, was a partner of Price Waterhouse, chartered accountants, and was sued as the representative of that firm. He had given advice to Leda in the past. He was retained to give advice with respect to the proposed acquisition of the shares of Leisure Developments and Leisure
Management. He provided a letter of 6 June 1991. Leda claims that it relied on that letter and purchased the shares in July 1991. It attributed the bulk of the purchase price to the tax losses at 6 cents in the dollar amounting to approximately $2.38 million.  
The profit on sale of the hotel   Price Waterhouse had been retained to prepare the accounts and tax returns of the Leisure Trust in the period when the hotel was sold. That sale generated a profit of over $45 million. That profit was not subject to capital gains tax because the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), s 160L(1)(b) restricted the operation of those provisions to disposals of property acquired on or after 20 September 1985. Price Waterhouse treated the profit as on capital account in the Leisure Trust income tax return.  In the years that followed, there was no cause to set-off any of the losses in the Leisure Trust against assessable income of the trust.  In 1988, the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [s
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s25a.html) applied to property acquired before 20 September 1985. It provided that the assessable income of a taxpayer should include profit arising from the sale by the taxpayer of any property acquired by it for the purpose of profit-making by sale or from the carrying on or carrying out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme.  
The Commissioner's assessment  In August 1993, the Commissioner of Taxation issued a position paper claiming that the profit on sale of the hotel constituted assessable income under the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [s
A(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s25a.html)
Amended notices of assessment issued that exhausted the tax losses by setting them off against the profit on sale of the hotel. From adverse decisions on its notices of objection, Leisure Management applied to the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decisions of the Commissioner under the [Taxation Administration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/) (Cth), [s
ZZ(a)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/taa1953269/s14zz.html) as it then stood. The Tribunal upheld the Commissioner's amended assessments on the basis that at least one of the intentions of the former directors of
Leisure Developments and Leisure Management, Richard Tweedy Holt and Richard
John Graham, was to construct the hotel for the purpose of resale.  
The issues  Leda claims that Mr Weerden's letter of 6 June 1991 was negligently prepared and was misleading or deceptive. It claimed damages including damages under the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s68.html) quantified as the difference between the purchase price of the shares and the proceeds of sale of the assets of the Leisure Trust plus the costs of objecting to the amended assessments and the costs of the proceedings in the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  Mr Weerden claims that he was not retained to give an opinion on the availability of tax losses as prospective deductions to the Leisure Trust, and he did not give such advice. He denies that the letter was misleading or deceptive and he denies that Leda relied upon the letter in entering into the agreement for purchase of the shares.  If, contrary to his primary submission, Mr Weerden was negligent, he claims that Leda was contributorily negligent. He also alleges that any claim under the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) is statue barred. Mr Weerden also claims that in incurring costs in objecting to the amended assessments and applying to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review, Leda failed to mitigate its losses. Further, Mr Weerden claims that he and the other partners of Price Waterhouse acted honestly and ought to be excused from any liability under the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1318.html)  Mr Weerden filed a cross-claim against Leisure Management alleging that it failed to inform him of its intention to develop the hotel for sale. Mr
Weerden argues that in so doing, Leisure Management engaged in conduct in trade or commerce that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) He seeks damages and an order under [s (1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) that he and Price Waterhouse be indemnified against any liability to Leda.  By its defence, Leisure Management alleges that it was an implied term of
Price Waterhouse's retainer that it should exercise reasonable care to ensure that it had full and complete instructions on all relevant matters and, in breach of that term, it did not ask all necessary questions to ensure that it had such knowledge. Leisure Management also pleaded that any claim under the
Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) was statute barred.  
The lead-up to the letter of 6 June 1991  In about April 1991, Stephen John Robinson, the financial controller of
Leda, had a conversation with Mr Weerden who said he had spoken to Peter
Maletz, a partner of his at the Gold Coast, who had confirmed that the Leisure
Trust had tax losses of about $40 million and that Price Waterhouse had done all the accounting and tax work for the trust.  On 14 May 1991, Leda wrote to Mr Weerden outlining a proposal for the purchase of the Leisure Trust and the appropriation of net income of the
Tuggeranong Trust to it to offset tax losses of approximately $39 million. Mr
Weerden was asked to comment on the tax consequences of the purchase in general and was asked to advise specifically on the possible impact of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [Pt
IVA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a) and on alternatives to the proposed structure.  On 23 May 1991, Mr Robinson reported to William Robert Ell, the executive chairman of Leda, on the proposal including the verbal advice from Price
Waterhouse.  On 27 May 1991, Mr Robinson sent a facsimile to Mr Weerden stating that the purchase of Leisure Developments was "on hold" until Leda had received written advice from him. Mr Robinson said there were two crucial points to be addressed: "Do the losses exist and are they available for use by Leda?" Mr
Robinson said that the final terms of the deal had not been determined. The facsimile went on to describe alternative approaches and stated that Leda acknowledged the need to continue the business of the Leisure Trust although
Mr Ell was looking for a way to minimize his financial exposure. The letter concluded with the words: "Do you have any suggestions?"  On 28 May 1991, Mr Robinson gave Mr Weerden explicit instructions on the opinion Leda sought from him:  "I confirm that before Leda purchase the shares of Leisure Developments (Qld)
Pty Limited and Leisure Management Pty Limited we will require your written opinion on the following:-  The amount of income tax and capital losses carried forward as at 30th June in:- 
Leisure Developments Trust 
Leisure Developments (Qld) Pty Limited  In each case above, the year in which the losses were incurred.  The effect on losses in Leisure Developments Trust in the event of the writing off of $11,680,327 of loans to group companies and directors.  The deductibility of the losses in the Leisure Developments Trust against income to be derived from the units to be issued in the Tuggeranong Town
Centre Trust.  In order to facilitate the eventual winding up of the structure we propose that Leisure Developments (Qld) Pty Limited may subscribe for $60,750,000 of units in Leisure Developments Trust in order to increase the indexed cost base of its investment. In order to unwind the structure, the units would be redeemed at some point in time when the indexed cost base exceeds the redemption price. Are there any other alternatives for winding up the structure with minimal tax exposure?  It is proposed that either Barob Pty Limited, Leda's parent company, or
Teresina Pty Limited, which in its capacity as the trustee of the Ell Family
Trust owns all issued shares in Barob Pty Limited, may acquire the shares in
Leisure Developments (Qld) Pty Limited. Will either event have any tax impact?  The terms of the purchase are not yet finalised. It is presently proposed that Leda will contract to purchase the shares for $3.4 Million, $2.4 Million to be paid in sixty (60) days with the balance due within two (2) years.
Interest will be paid on the outstanding balance and the vendor will receive a mortgage over the assets of the trust. It is envisaged that the vendor will ultimately negotiate the sale of the trust's assets and in the event of the sale being in excess of $1 Million, will receive the excess. 
The preferred alternative from my point of view is a simple purchase at $3.4
Million with Leda retaining the assets and business for say a couple of years.
This would carry some financial risk which the directors are obviously trying to minimise. 
Please comment on the above alternatives together with any suggestions as to how the purchase may be structured.  Any other material taxation consequence of the proposed transaction. 
As the proposed acquisition cannot proceed until we have received your advice,
I ask that you please reply on or before Wednesday 29th May. If this is not possible, please contact me as soon as possible."  Mr Weerden telephoned Mr Robinson and told him that he could not say whether the tax losses were available without conducting a due diligence review. Mr Weerden then wrote to Raymond Phillip Fazzolari, the finance director of Leda, on 29 May 1991 reiterating that he could not give an opinion on the availability of the tax losses without conducting a due diligence exercise. He referred to Mr Robinson's letter and said:  "...Most of the matters raised in Steve's letter are reasonably straight forward with the exception of point 4, the deductibility of the losses in LDT against other income. 
In order for us to give an opinion on the deductibility of these losses it will be necessary to carry out a due diligence review of the trust. This would require a detailed examination of a number of matters including the following:  income tax returns, working papers and accounts going back to the year losses are still available for carry forward;  any legal agreements entered into by the trust which may have an impact on the existence of the losses; and  the Trust Deed and minutes of the trustee relating to the activities of the trust. 
It will also be necessary to hold discussions with the Directors and Price
Waterhouse Brisbane to ensure there are no matters of which we are unaware such as disputes with the Australian Taxation Office. 
We would estimate that a due diligence of this type would cost approximately $12,000 and take about a week after the documents become available.  
Mr Weerden went on to comment briefly on the eight questions raised in Mr
Robinson's letter:  "We briefly comment below on the matters raised in Steve's letter in order. 
We can confirm the amount of the losses when given access to the income tax returns. 
As in 1 above, we can confirm the year that losses were incurred when given access to the income tax returns. 
The writing off of loans is unlikely to generate an income tax deduction.
However, if the loans can be said to be "disposed" off, a capital loss may be generated. 
Subject to the due diligence review discussed above. 
To be advised. 
No. 
To be advised. 
The major obstacle to the proposed transaction may be [Part
IVA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a) of the Act. It will be critical to demonstrate the commercial purposes behind the structure of the transaction. If the Australian Taxation Office believe the transaction was entered into solely for tax reasons they may deny any tax benefits that arise. 
Would you please let me know if you wish us to proceed with the due diligence or if you have any other questions in relation to the proposed transaction."  Mr Weerden and Mr Robinson had a telephone conversation in which Mr
Robinson said that Mr Ell refused to pay for a due diligence review since
Price Waterhouse had already done the work. Mr Robinson said this conversation occurred before Mr Weerden's letter of 6 June 1991. He said Mr Weerden responded that he would have to speak to Mr Maletz about the tax losses and then reply to Mr Robinson's letter.  Mr Weerden said the conversation occurred after he sent his letter of 6
June 1991 while he was still awaiting instructions to carry out the due diligence exercise and he responded that he could not confirm the deductibility of the losses without due diligence as he knew nothing of the financial affairs of the Leisure Trust and Price Waterhouse had not already done the work. It was Peat Marwick who were Mr Holt's advisers outside the construction period of the hotel and he would not sign off on the matter without a due diligence review. Mr Weerden said he had no further contact with
Leda about the matter after this conversation.  For reasons that appear later in this judgment, I do not have to resolve this issue.  
The letter of 6 June 1991  Having referred to Mr Robinson's letter of 28 May 1991 and Mr Weerden's response of 29 May 1991, the letter stated that Mr Weerden was able to answer some of the questions more fully, and he did so:  "...We are now able to more fully answer some of the matters raised in Steve's May letter after further discussions with yourself and Peter Maletz of
Price Waterhouse Brisbane. 
In relation to points 1 and 2 raised in Steve's letter we refer to the letter from Peter Maletz dated 4 June 1991 to the Directors of Leisure Management Pty
Limited (copy attached). 
This letter details by loss year the quantum of losses shown to be available to be carried forward to offset against LDT's future assessable income. The total carried forward losses as shown in the 30 June 1990 income tax return for LDT is $39,668,033. 
As mentioned in that letter, losses that the Commissioner accepts as available to be carried forward may only be carried forward for seven years from the year in which they were incurred. For example, should the Commissioner accept the $7,569,490 of losses incurred during the year ended 30 June 1986, these losses must be utilised prior to or during the year ending 30 June 1993."  The attached letter of Mr Maletz contained the following:  "The income tax returns for the Trust for the years ended 30 June 1989 and 30
June 1990 showed net incomes for taxation purposes of $Nil after deducting carried forward losses of $9,319,160 and $71,496 respectively. After recouping these losses the Trust has carried forward losses for taxation purposes as at June 1990 of $39,668,033 which have been calculated as follows: 
Year ended 30 June 1986 ,569,490  
Year ended 30 June 1987 ,003,814  
Year ended 30 June 1988 ,094,729  
These losses are available to be carried forward for seven years from the year in which they were incurred and offset against future income of the Trust during that period."  To return to the letter of 6 June 1991, Mr Weerden went on to deal with point 3 of Mr Robinson's letter and then point 5 of that letter. No mention was made of point 4 of the letter.  Having mentioned that the specific anti-avoidance provisions with respect to transfers of carry-forward losses in the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth) as it then stood applied only to companies, Mr Weerden went on to discuss the general anti-avoidance provisions in [Pt
IVA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a)
Mr Weerden warned:  "The commerciality of the acquisition of units in LDT as an investment by the
Leda Group should be obvious so as not to run the risk of the Commissioner forming an opinion that Leda entered into the transaction to avail themselves of tax losses shown to be available in LDT."  The letter then went on to deal with point 7 of Mr Robinson's letter, mentioning again the possible application of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/), [Pt
IVA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a)
It then concluded:  "In summary, the Commissioner may conclude that the acquisition of LDT was part of a scheme where the dominant purpose is seen to be to obtain a tax benefit. However, should the Leda Group provide sufficient evidence that the purpose of the transaction was of a commercial nature, the Commissioner should be persuaded that the dominant purpose was not to gain such tax benefits. 
Should you have any further questions in relation to the above, please do not hesitate to contact Greg Stevens or myself."  
Did Mr Weerden advise on deductibility?  Kenneth Aubrey Traill and Edgar Martin Baltins, chartered accountants, prepared reports on whether Mr Weerden acted as a reasonably competent taxation adviser, acting in accordance with professional standards at the time, in providing the letter of 6 June 1991. Much of the reports contained the accountants' views of the proper construction of the correspondence. Those opinions stand outside the expertise of these gentlemen and I have ignored them.  It was submitted on Mr Weerden's behalf that the letter did not give advice on the deductibility of the carry-forward losses of the Leisure Trust when income was introduced to it from the Tuggeranong Trust. It was pointed out that the letter did not refer to point 4 of Mr Robinson's letter of 28 May
But nor did it refer to points 6 and 8 of Mr Robinson's letter.  It was submitted that point 6 had been categorically considered in Mr
Weerden's letter of 29 May 1991 and with respect to point 8, he had there said that the major obstacle to the proposed transaction was the [Income Tax
Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [Pt
IVA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a)  It was submitted that the attached letter of Mr Maletz of 4 June 1991 was advice to the directors of Leisure Management and not advice to Leda. But Mr
Weerden's attachment of the letter and his reference to it in his letter of 6
June 1991 made it part of his advice to Leda.  It was submitted that when Mr Weerden said of Mr Maletz' letter that it: "details by loss year the quantum of losses" and "The total carried forward losses as shown in the 30 June 1990 income tax return for LDT is $39,668,033",
Mr Weerden was merely stating the amount and year of the losses claimed in the
Leisure Trust's income tax returns.  It was submitted that the letter of 6 June 1991 emphasised that Mr Weerden was not giving an opinion confirming the deductibility of the tax losses when he again referred to Mr Maletz' letter and said: "As mentioned in that letter, losses that the Commissioner accepts as available to be carried forward may only be carried forward for seven years". It was submitted that the words: "For example, should the Commissioner accept the $7,569,490 of losses incurred during the year ended 30 June 1986" made it quite clear that the question whether the Commissioner of Taxation would accept the losses as deductions was unresolved. But a statement that the Commissioner had not ruled on the deductibility of the losses is not inconsistent with an expression of opinion by Mr Weerden that the losses would be deductible.  It was submitted that Mr Maletz' letter of 4 June 1991 could not be interpreted as stating an opinion about the existence or deductibility of the losses. The letter said that the income tax returns of the trust showed specified losses in specified years. But the letter went on to say that the losses could be carried forward for seven years from the year of incurrence: "and offset against future income of the Trust during that period."  Furthermore, in referring to Mr Maletz' letter, Mr Weerden said:  "This letter details by loss year the quantum of losses shown to be available to be carried forward to offset against LDT's future assessable income. The total carried forward losses as shown in the 30 June 1990 income tax return for LDT is $39,668,033."  In my opinion that paragraph is to be construed as the expression of opinion by Mr Weerden that the losses were available to be carried forward to offset the Leisure Trust's future assessable income.  It was argued that this construction was not open because Mr Weerden had said he needed to conduct a due diligence review, he had not done so and when he wrote his letter he was still awaiting instructions to carry out that due diligence. But there is no mention of due diligence in the letter of 6 June
It says that the questions raised by Mr Robinson may be more fully answered following Mr Weerden's discussion with Mr Maletz. The inference to be drawn is that Mr Weerden had abandoned his requirement for due diligence before expressing his opinion on the deductibility of the carry-forward losses.  And the absence of specific reference to point 4 of Mr Robinson's requests is explicable on the basis that, having expressed the view that the losses were available to be carried forward to offset future income, there was no need to address point 4 specifically. It sought an opinion as to the deductibility of the losses against future income. Mr Weerden had already expressed his opinion on that issue in his answers to points 1 and 2.  
Was the opinion qualified?  Mr Weerden's letter of 6 June 1991 contained a qualification that deductibility of the tax losses against future income might not be available if the Commissioner invoked the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [Pt
IVA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a)
But it contained no other qualification. It did not contain a qualification that due diligence was a prerequisite to any opinion on the deductibility of the carry-forward losses against future income. It did not contain any specific statement that the Commissioner had not ruled on the deductibility and the qualification that he might not accept the losses as deductible. It did not state that it was essential to analyse the nature of the profit on sale of the hotel, because if it were on revenue account, the tax losses would have been absorbed.  If Mr Weerden was still waiting for instructions to carry out due diligence he should, at the very least, have included a warning in the letter of 6 June that he was expressing no opinion on the deductibility of the carry- forward losses pending his carrying out of a due diligence review.  
The duty of care  Professionals are expected to exercise a standard of care that may reasonably be expected of practitioners practising in the relevant area of expertise. Thus in Rogers versus Whitaker <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 479] at 483 the High Court said:  "The law imposes on a medical practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment...The standard of reasonable care and skill required is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill."  In Pech versus Tilgals 94 ATC 4206 at 4211, Dunford J said:  "As a person holding himself out as possessing professional skill as an accountant and tax agent the defendant was bound to exercise the skill and diligence of a reasonably competent and careful practitioner in that profession."  
The views of the experts  Mr Traill expressed the view that Mr Weerden's advice of 6 June 1991 should have referred to a number of issues. First, the fact that the availability of tax losses in the Leisure Trust was dependent on the profit realised on the sale of the hotel being categorised as a capital profit and being accepted by the Commissioner of Taxation as such. Secondly, that the treatment of the profit on sale of the hotel as a capital profit depended on the Commissioner conducting a tax audit of the tax return of the Leisure Trust and accepting that the subjective intentions of the directors of Leisure Management were to hold the hotel as a long-term investment. Thirdly, that there was, or might be, some doubt that the Commissioner would accept that the stated intentions of the directors of Leisure Management were to hold the asset as a long-term investment, because the hotel was sold within two years of the completion of the development. Fourthly, to the extent to which the Commissioner disallowed the treatment of the profit from the sale of the hotel as a capital profit, it would be treated as an assessable gain on revenue account and reduce the quantum of the available tax losses. Finally, if the Commissioner disallowed the treatment of the profit as a capital profit, the only redress against the decision of the Commissioner was to object against that decision and then, if the objection was disallowed by the Commissioner, to appeal to either the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court of Australia against the
Commissioner's decision.  Mr Traill said that the absence of qualification in relation to the carry- forward losses was inconsistent with what he considered that a reasonably competent taxation adviser, acting in accordance with good professional standards applicable at that time, would have included in the letter.  Mr Traill based this opinion upon assumptions he was asked to make. They were that Mr Weerden was aware that notices of assessment had not issued to
Leisure Management, that the hotel was sold for a substantial capital profit approximately equal to the revenue losses, and that the hotel was sold within two years of the completion of its development.  Mr Baltins took the view that Leda's refusal to instruct Mr Weerden to carry out a due diligence review meant that Mr Weerden was not obliged to give any tax opinion. Mr Baltins took the view that Mr Weerden gave no advice in the letter of 6 June 1991 and, in consequence, there was no need to qualify it, particularly as on the assumptions he was asked to make, Mr Weerden was unaware of the matters assumed by Mr Traill. For example, Mr Baltins said that a reasonably competent taxation adviser would not have warned a sophisticated client like Leda that the Commissioner of Taxation had not accepted the carry- forward losses if he was unaware of the Commissioner's views and was not aware of any tax audit.  In a subsequent report, Mr Traill said that if Mr Weerden was not aware of the matters he had been asked to assume, it would have been appropriate to carry out a due diligence review and since that had not been approved, it was even more appropriate to qualify the advice suitably in the letter of 6 June 
The extent of Mr Weerden's knowledge  There was a conflict in the evidence as to the extent of Mr Weerden's knowledge of the matters assumed by Mr Traill. On 20 October 1987 Mr Weerden signed a memorandum headed Kumagai Gumi Company - Holiday Inn Project -
Leisure Developments Queensland Trust. The memorandum stated that the Leisure
Trust had incurred tax losses arising from interest during construction, investment allowance and operating and pre-opening expenses of about $45 million as at 30 June 1987. It stated that the cost of construction of the hotel at that date was about $81 million and as a consequence of the sale to be made for about $125 million, the Leisure Trust would make a capital profit on sale of about $44 million. The memorandum continued:  "This profit is not, in our view, taxable, because the hotel was acquired by the Trust before capital gains tax commenced (19 September 1985). Further, it would be argued that the profit is also not taxable, because the Trust did not buy the hotel for resale at a profit, but as an asset of a business to be carried on by it."  The memorandum went on to state that the profit on sale, not being taxable, would not use up the tax losses, except with respect to depreciation on plant and equipment and claims for investment allowance. Accordingly, the memorandum noted that after the sale of the project, the Leisure Trust would have remaining in it substantial tax losses that could be carried forward for up to seven years. The memorandum noted that a change in all or part of the ownership of the Leisure Trust to Kumagai would not cause the tax losses to be lost because there were no tests applied to trusts such as continuing ownership or the same business:  "As a result, the Trust could earn income or profits from any source (such as interest) and use up the tax losses in the trust, without paying tax and without generating any taxable income which would otherwise be taxable to unit holders."  Mr Weerden said that the memorandum summarised information given to him by
Mr Maletz in a telephone conversation. It was a proposal Mr Maletz was developing and they were workshopping the idea. Mr Weerden said he had no recollection of the document when he swore his affidavit but since reading the document, he had a very clear idea of its origin.  Mr Maletz gave evidence that he had a conversation with Mr Weerden that precipitated the memorandum being sent to him in the Brisbane office and he had no role as to the figures contained in the document and that Mr Weerden must have prepared the memorandum from various bits of information that he had at his disposal.  Were it necessary for me to resolve this issue, I would prefer the evidence of Mr Maletz and reject Mr Weerden's evidence of the origin of the memorandum as unconscious reconstruction on his part. Mr Maletz was a forthright witness and I see no reason to reject his evidence. On the other hand, Mr Weerden had little recollection of the correspondence and conversations and only recalled the document and its origin during cross-examination.  
Breach of Duty  The terms of Mr Weerden's letter of 29 May 1991 make it clear that he did not regard it as part of his retainer to advise on the deductibility of the carry-forward tax losses in the absence of a due diligence review. However, Mr
Weerden chose to write his letter of 6 June 1991 in the absence of due diligence containing, as I have found, advice on the issue of deductibility.
Having elected to take that course, Mr Weerden was bound to exercise the degree of care and skill required of the competent accountant and tax adviser.  In my view, it does not matter whether Mr Weerden was aware of the issues referred to by Mr Traill or not. If he was, I accept Mr Traill's opinion that he was duty bound to warn Leda of the problems. If he was not, and was ignorant of the circumstances in which the carry-forward losses had arisen and the hotel had been sold, it was even more important for him to qualify any opinion that the losses were available for deduction against future income of the Leisure Trust.  In my view, in writing the letter of 6 June 1991 without the advantage of due diligence and without expressly qualifying his statement that the quantum of losses shown in the tax returns were available to be carried forward to offset future assessable income of the Leisure Trust, Mr Weerden failed to meet the standard of a prudent and reasonable taxation adviser.  
The timing of the rejection of the request for due diligence   As I have indicated, this finding means that it is unnecessary for me to determine when the conversation between Mr Weerden and Mr Robinson, to the effect that Mr Ell would not pay for due diligence, took place. Had it been necessary for me to resolve that issue, however, I would have preferred the evidence of Mr Robinson.  Mr Robinson last worked for Leda at the end of 1993 and had no real interest in the proceedings. His version of the conversation with Mr Weerden, that he said took place soon after he received Mr Weerden's letter of 29 May , was to the effect:  "I got your letter. Bob says there's no way he's going to pay Price Waterhouse $10,000 to do a due diligence on the tax losses because your firm did the audit on Leisure and have already been paid for that work. Bob cannot understand why you need to do a due diligence: you've already done the work and there is no reason to repeat that work. That is why Bob wants your sign off: he wants you to confirm the value of the tax losses and the availability of them to Leda or he won't proceed."  Mr Robinson said Mr Weerden responded that he would have to speak to Peter
Maletz about the tax losses and then reply to the letter.  Mr Robinson was taken to task because, in cross-examination, he said he discussed with Mr Weerden ways round the due diligence issue on the basis that
Mr Maletz would provide a letter certifying that the losses were there but he had made no mention of this in his affidavit.  When Mr Robinson left Leda, he made a hand written note on 1 December 1993.
That note confirmed what Mr Robinson said in cross-examination. It contained the following:  "We requested that JW confirm in writing to Leda the amount of the tax losses in the trust. He refused to do so stating that he had not prepared the returns and would therefore need to do a due diligence review of PW Gold Coast's work.
He quoted a fee of around $10,000 and estimated a few weeks to complete the task. 
RF and I put this proposal to WRE for his approval which was not given as the amount was excessive and the work considered unnecessary. 
A compromise was struck whereby Peter Maletz provided an opinion to the directors of Leisure Management P/L (the trustee of the trust) stating the amount of losses and the age of those losses. 
John Weerden, in response to my written request of 27th May 1991 to confirm the quantum of losses, forwarded Maletz's letter. He did so knowing that Leda would not proceed with the purchase without it and that we were therefore relying on its content."  Mr Robinson went on to say that most correspondence and work papers were shredded due to their tax implications. The evidence did not identify who ordered the shredding. That was a discreditable act that usually gives rise to the strongest possible presumption that if the documents were produced they would have told against the party who destroyed them (Allen versus Tobias <case>; [(1958) 98 CLR 367] at 375). But that rule depends upon the content of the destroyed documents. In this case the material documents relating to Mr
Weerden's advice were before the court. And while Mr Robinson's complicity in the destruction does not aid his credibility, it does not alter the fact that the diary note is consistent with Mr Robinson's version of the conversation with Mr Weerden and its timing and inconsistent with Mr Weerden's version.  Mr Weerden's lack of recollection of conversations is understandable since the events in question took place in 1991. But that lack of recollection contrasted with his adamant assertion that the conversation with Mr Robinson in which he was informed that Mr Ell refused to pay for due diligence took place after 6 June 1991. His recollection that this was so may well be due to unconscious reconstruction.  The facts that Mr Weerden did contact Mr Maletz and Mr Maletz did write his letter of 4 June 1991 are consistent with Mr Robinson's version of events. And
Mr Weerden's opening comments in his letter of 6 June 1991 are consistent with the compromise to which Mr Robinson referred, a comprise that abandoned Mr
Weerden's insistence upon due diligence and replaced it with reliance upon Mr
Maletz' letter:  "We refer to Steve Robinson's letter of 28 May 1991 and our response of 29 May
We are now able to more fully answer some of the matters raised in
Steve's 28 May letter after further discussions with yourself and Peter Maletz of Price Waterhouse Brisbane."  
Causation  There is no doubt that Leda regarded Mr Weerden's advice as significant. On the day after the letter was sent, Price Waterhouse was thanked for its advice and was asked for further information about the possibility, if debts of the
Leisure Trust were released, of claiming a deduction under the [Income Tax
Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [s
B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/s70b.html) upon a disposal of a traditional security.  In Mr Robinson's memorandum of 15 July 1991, the day before the settlement, it was stated that Mr Weerden had reviewed the original documentation and had agreed to all subsequent changes and all their advice, including advice on the existence and use of the tax losses was on file.  But it does not necessarily follow that, but for Mr Weerden's advice, the transaction would not have gone ahead. Leda was not an unsophisticated taxpayer. It was Mr Fazzolari who put to Mr Weerden a detailed proposal for the acquisition of Leisure Developments and Leisure Management and changes to the structure of the Tuggeranong Trust to assign to the Leisure Trust the right to at least 60.75% of the profits to be offset against the losses of approximately $39 million in the Leisure Trust in his letter of 14 May 1991.
That letter sought Mr Weerden's comments on a number of issues including the possible impact of the [Income Tax Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) (Cth), [Pt
IVA.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a)
Leda's executives were well aware of the danger that [Pt
IVA](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/index.html#p4a) posed and they, no doubt, used that risk in negotiating the figure of 6 cents in the dollar for the tax losses. The rate of tax for a private company in was 39% ([Income Tax Rates Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itra1986174/) (Cth), [s (3)(a)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itra1986174/s23.html)
The huge discount that Leda was able to achieve reflected the high degree of risk that the carry-forward losses would not be available as a deduction against Tuggeranong assessable income.  Furthermore, each of Messrs Ell, Fazzolari and Robinson was aware that a profit on sale of property acquired prior to the introduction of capital gains tax was included in assessable income if the property was acquired for the purpose of profit-making by sale or from the carrying on or carrying out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme. Mr Ell had been told by Mr Holt that
Leisure Management's purpose in developing the hotel was to hold it for the long term. Mr Fazzolari had a similar understanding. He said he was aware that there would be an issue as to the tax treatment of the profit on sale of the hotel: "It was an issue we needed to understand. That is why we engaged Mr
Weerden". Leda was not ignorant of the risk that the Commissioner of Taxation might treat the profit on sale of the hotel as on revenue account. Senior executives had made their own enquiries from Mr Holt.  Furthermore, most of the matters that Mr Traill said ought to have been raised by way of warning in the letter of 6 June 1991 were already known to Mr
Ell and Mr Fazzolari. Each of them set forth five matters that they said, had they been advised of any of them, Leda would not have acquired the shares.  First, it was said that had Mr Weerden advised that there was some doubt that the profits realised from the sale of the hotel were treated, properly, as capital profits, the share acquisition would not have proceeded. Mr
Fazzolari said he knew in 1991 that this issue would arise if the matter came before a tribunal and it was one of the matters that would have been addressed by Mr Weerden in due diligence. When the proposition was put to Mr Ell that he was aware of the problem, he evaded the question with the answer: "We had no advice that they were not properly treated."  The second matter was the failure to advise that it was unlikely that the
Commissioner of Taxation would decide whether to allow the revenue losses and the treatment of profits from the sale of the hotel as capital profits until revenue losses were relied upon as deductions by the Leisure Trust. Mr
Fazzolari conceded that he was aware of this issue. Mr Ell said: "We knew possibly, yeah."  The third issue was that the availability of the revenue losses was dependent upon the Commissioner of Taxation accepting that the profit on sale of the hotel was on capital account. Mr Ell was aware of this issue prior to completion and Mr Fazzolari was aware of the issue in May and June of 1991.  The fourth matter, that was raised by Mr Ell alone, was that Price
Waterhouse, in treating the profit on sale of the hotel on capital account, had relied on the subjective intentions of the previous directors of Leisure
Developments, Messrs Holt and Graham, as advised to Price Waterhouse. Mr Ell agreed that prior to completion he knew that the proper treatment of the profit depended upon the subjective intentions of Messrs Holt and Graham.  The fifth matter was whether the profit on sale of the hotel was treated properly depended upon a tribunal accepting the credibility of the evidence of
Messrs Holt and Graham, as to their subjective intentions at the time of the development. Both Mr Ell and Mr Fazzolari agreed that they were aware of this matter prior to completion.  The sixth matter, raised by Mr Fazzolari alone, was that Mr Weerden failed to advise that the Commissioner of Taxation had not accepted the tax losses.
But Mr Fazzolari was aware that there had been no ruling by the Commissioner about the deductibility of the losses.  The assertions of Mr Ell and Mr Fazzolari that, had any of these matters been raised in Mr Weerden's advice, the purchase of the shares would not have taken place, are self-serving. The fact that they were aware of the matters to which they complained Mr Weerden had not adverted, suggests, strongly, that his raising of these risks would have had no effect on Leda's ultimate decision. Leda was aware of the risks and went ahead.  Furthermore, Leda sought advice from Mallesons Stephens Jacques in May 1991 on the proposal having regard to, amongst other things, indemnities to be obtained by Leda in respect of the liabilities of Leisure Developments and the
Leisure Trust and the deductibility of the losses being purchased. A warranty was included in the share sale agreement, and Mallesons commented in July :  "I note that your main concern is the effect of a breach of the warranty with respect to the amount of carry forward tax losses in LDQPL and in the Trust. I would confirm that if this warranty is breached, then Leda would be entitled to claim as damages an amount equal to the loss it suffers as a consequence of that breach of warranty."  And Mr Robinson had sought advice from Mallesons before settlement on the prospect of suing Price Waterhouse. Mr Robinson conceded that it was one outcome.  Mr Robinson's memorandum of 15 July 1991, the day before settlement, noted that the vendors' warranties included that the tax losses carried forward amounted to over $39 million for the Leisure Trust and over $2 million for
Leisure Developments and Leisure Management. The longest entry in the memorandum was under the heading Tax Losses and was as follows:  "The vendors have warranted that the tax losses exist and are usable. 
Price Waterhouse have also confirmed that the losses exist and are usable. 
In the event that these warranties are not correct Leda will have cause to sue for damages for any loss. 
If the losses are shown not to be available prior to the introduction of income into the Trust, Leda's loss would be the 6 cents in the dollar it paid for the losses. 
Mallesons have advised us that in such a case it would not be clear as to what the purchase price of the losses was and suggested a side letter be provided by the vendors stating that the consideration for the losses was 6 cents in the dollars. Although the vendors are willing to supply this letter, I believe, as do Price Waterhouse, that such a letter would jeopardise the whole deal by highlighting the dominant purpose of the transaction as being the purchase of the tax losses. 
Alternatively, the price for the losses can be determined by deducting from the purchase price, the value of the other assets, as determined by the independent valuation by Eccleston & Fraser. Mallesons agree that this approach would also be acceptable in building a case for damages. 
If the losses are shown not to be available after the introduction of income into the trust, the damages would be quantified as the amount of tax payable and Leda would have recourse to both the vendors and Price Waterhouse."  The common law, common sense test of causation, accepts that negligent conduct may be causally connected to resultant loss or damage if it materially contributes to that result, even if other factors have contributed to the loss or damage. (Grant versus Sun Shipping Co Ltd [[1948] AC 549] at 563,
Bonnington Castings Ltd versus Wardlaw <case>; [[1956] AC ] at 620,
Gould versus Vaggelas [(1983-1985) 157 CLR 215] at , 250-251, March versus Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1990-1991) 171 CLR 506] at -513, Medlin versus State Government Insurance Commission <case>; [(1994-1995) 182 CLR 1] at 7, Henville versus Walker <case>; <case>, [97], [106]).  But in this case, I do not see Mr Weerden's failures in his advice as having materially contributed to Leda's loss. Leda had the unqualified advice of Mr Weerden but they also had vendors' warranties and they had advice that they could sue the vendors and Price Waterhouse if the losses were not available to be offset against assessable income of the Tuggeranong Trust. And
Leda was aware of the risks it said Mr Weerden failed to bring to its attention and went ahead despite the alleged shortcomings in his advice. Even if it could be said, and I doubt that it could, that Mr Weerden's failures played some part in the losses suffered by Leda, they were trifling. They could not, in my view, be regarded as material.  In my judgment Leda has failed to establish that Mr Weerden's breach of duty was a material cause of any loss or damage it sustained.  
Damages  It follows from what I have said that I am of the view that Leda is not entitled to damages in negligence.  
The alternative cause of action  Leda also claimed that in failing to qualify his advice of 6 June 1991, Mr
Weerden, in trade or commerce, engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive contrary to the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html)  It follows from what I have said that I do not need to determine whether the unqualified advice of Mr Weerden was likely to mislead or deceive, because
Leda did not suffer loss or damage by that conduct and is not entitled to damages under the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s68.html)
Leda did not rely upon the advice. Nor need I determine whether Leda's claim was statute barred.  
Other issues   It was alleged that Leda was contributorily neglect in failing to instruct
Mr Weerden to carry out the due diligence review. It is unnecessary for me to deal with that issue.  Likewise, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the issue of the way in which Leda claimed damages. Leda argued that but for Mr Weerden's advice it would not have purchased the shares and, in consequence, the proper measure of damages was the purchase price of the shares together with the cost of proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal less the proceeds of sale of the assets acquired in the transaction in reliance upon HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd versus Astonland Pty Ltd <case>; [(2004) 217 CLR 640.]  In order to obtain the evidence of the former directors of Leisure
Developments in the prosecution of its review before the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal, Leda released them from the warranty. It was argued that in so doing, Leda failed to mitigate its loss. That, too, is a matter that I need not decide.  The [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1318.html) empowers the court in certain circumstances to relieve a person from liability for negligence. I need not consider whether that power should be invoked in this case, because I have found that Mr Weerden is not liable to Leda in negligence.  
The cross-claim  It is unnecessary for me to deal with the issue under the [Trade Practices
Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth), [s 52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) raised in the cross-claim because it was predicated upon liability in Mr
Weerden which I have found did not exist. It is unnecessary to decide whether relief under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) was statute barred.  
Conclusion  In my view, Mr Weerden was negligent in giving the advice contained in his letter of 6 June 1991. I am of the view, however, that his advice was not a material cause of any loss or damage sustained by Leda and he is not liable to
Leda in negligence or under the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/), [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s68.html)  I will dismiss the further amended statement of claim and I will dismiss the amended cross claim. I will hear the parties on costs.  I direct the parties to bring in short minutes of orders reflecting these reasons.
