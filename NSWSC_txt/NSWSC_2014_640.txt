EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
These proceedings were commenced by summons in May 2013, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's Director (Financial Investigations), who deposed to his suspicions that the defendant, Mark Andrew Dunstone, had engaged in serious crime related activity, namely, supply and taking part in the supply of prohibited drugs, amphetamine and methylamphetamine, contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) and [s 25A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25a.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and participating in a criminal group contrary to [s 93T](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s93t.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) , for reasons there explained. 
In May 2013, restraining and other orders were made by Harrison J under [s 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s10a.html) and [s 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) , in respect of the Mr Dunstone's interests in certain property.
The parties now ask the Court to make further orders by consent, joining Paola Valenzuela as the second defendant to the proceedings; granting the Crime Commission leave to amend its summons; varying the restraining orders made against Mr Dunstone; making orders under [s 10B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html) as to reasonable legal expenses and otherwise vesting certain property belonging to Mr Dunstone and Ms Valuenzela to the Crown under [s 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html), subject to provisions under [s 10B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html) as to their reasonable legal expenses. 
Ms Valenzuela has indicated her consent to her joinder to the proceedings and the terms of the order proposed to be made against her by executing the proposed consent orders on 14 May 2014. Her signature was witnessed by Mr Mark Rumour, as her solicitor. Ms Miranda has today announced an appearance for Mr Mark Rumour, as solicitor for both defendants.
Having considered the terms of the orders sought, the other agreements which the parties have entered into and the circumstances in which they have been reached, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms which the parties have agreed. 
Accordingly, I make orders in the agreed terms.
