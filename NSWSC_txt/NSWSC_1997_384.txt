Kone Elevators Pty Ltd versus McNay and Anor [1997] NSWSC 384 (7 September )
 `KONE ELEVATORS PTY LTD versus McNAY & ANOR` `1518/97 ` `Monday 10 March 1997` `SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION` `YOUNG J` `` `JUDGMENT` `` `HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff is one of about four major companies in the business of the sale and maintenance of elevators. The second defendant is in the same category.` ` The first defendant was prior to 7 March, 1997, employed by the plaintiff.
He commenced employment with the plaintiff in January, 1980 as an apprentice and worked his way up through the company, his last two positions with the plaintiff being Branch Manager for the ACT and New Lift Sales Manager for
NSW.` ` When taking up the lastmentioned position, the plaintiff asked the first defendant to sign a copy of a document entitled "Letter of Appointment". The first defendant did so. The letter contained inter alia the following provisions:-` `Confidentiality` `` `During your employment with KONE Elevators, you will make use of Confidential
Information in carrying out your duties. Without limitation, "Confidential
Information" includes-` `` `(a) technical information relating to the goods and service of KONE
Elevators' business and the business of any other company in the KONE Group, including their operation, manufacture, use or performance;` `` `(b) all information concerning the business, its methods of operation, marketing and other activities; and` `` `(c) competitive and financial information concerning the business.` `` `which information, whether in the nature of trade secrets or otherwise, is not in the public domain.` `` `You must not whether during employment or after termination of your employment with KONE Elevators, without written authority, divulge
Confidential Information to anyone other than an employee authorised to receive the information or use such information for your own personal gain.` `` `Inventions and Copyright` `` `You agree to assign to KONE Elevators your entire right, title, and interest in and to any copyright and any industrial or intellectual property rights in any and all works, designs, computer programs, inventions, processes, concepts strategies and plans ("Confidential Property") which (either solely or jointly with others) you have developed or may develop during and/or as a result of your employment with KONE Elevators or in relation to work performed by you during such employment. You also agree to promptly disclose to KONE Elevators or to its attorneys any and all such Confidential Property developed by you and agree to execute upon demand, at the expense of KONE Elevators, all documents which may be desirable to secure to KONE Elevators the best copyright, patent or other protection in Australia and elsewhere and/or rights relating to such Confidential Property.` `` `` `` `Confidentiality following Termination of Employment` `` `` `You agree that upon termination of your employment with KONE Elevators you shall return to the Company Secretary all documents and any other materials constituting or containing Confidential Property or Confidential Information including, without limitation, maintenance manuals, circuit diagrams, lists of suppliers or customers, correspondence and other written material relating to
Confidential information or Confidential Property and that you will not retain any such documents or material or copies of such documents or material.` `` `` `Employment Restrictions` `` `For a period of one year after termination of your employment with the
Company for any reason you may not, without the previous written consent of the Company, engage in any business in Australia (whether as a director, principal, partner, consultant or employee) which could make use of
Confidential Information or Confidential Property to the material detriment of the business of the Company. If for any reason this provision is rendered void, unenforceable or otherwise ineffective that shall not affect the enforceability or effectiveness of any other terms or conditions of this contract of employment. Your remuneration includes consideration for this commitment on your part.` `` `` `On 7 February, 1997, the first defendant gave one month's notice of termination of employment. Under his contract this notice would effectively terminate his employment on 7 March, 1997. There is no secret that, unless restrained, the first defendant would have commenced employment as the
Queensland Branch Manager of the second defendant on that latter day. However, on 27 February, 1997, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings for injunction seeking to restrain the first defendant and the second defendant from employing the first defendant before 7 September, 1997 with certain ancillary orders. The summons was returnable on 3 March and heard on a final basis on 6
March, but I reserved my decision over the weekend so that I could ponder the balancing of issues in a rather difficult case. The plaintiff's position was preserved by an appropriate undertaking with, of course, a cross undertaking as to damages.` ` An employee is not entitled to remove from his employer any of the employer's property including its trade secrets. No special covenant is needed to bring this about. There are also fiduciary duties owed by employee's which will be enforced by the courts including the fiduciary duty to respect confidences. In addition, it is competent for the employer to take a covenant from an employee to protect the employer's trade secrets, and, to some extent, confidential information. As has been seen, such a covenant was taken in the present case. It is clear that some information which will not be protected in the absence of a covenant, may be protected by the appropriate covenant, see, if a covenant is taken, `Wright versus Gasweld Pty Ltd` `` [(1991) 22 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2022%20NSWLR%20317 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 334.` ` The law clearly puts a limitation on the breadth of a covenant that can be taken by an employer. It is trite law that an employer cannot take a covenant to protect itself against mere competition. I need do no more than refer to `Stenhouse Australia Ltd versus Phillips` `` <case>; [[1974] AC 391], 400 and the` Gasweld case`.`` In the latter,
Gleeson, CJ said at p 329:-` `"This is of critical importance, because a case such as the present involves a tension between two competing considerations of public policy. An employer is not entitled to protect himself against mere competition by a former employee, and the corollary of that is that the employee is entitled to use skill, experience and know-how acquired in the service of the former employer in legitimate competition. It is in the public interest that this should be so.... At the same time the law will protect trade secrets and confidential information, and will intervene to prevent their misuse. The decision of the
Court of Appeal in England in `Faccenda Chicken Ltd` `v` `Fowler` `` [[1987] Ch 117] illustrates the importance, when there is a conflict between these two principles, of a close examination and accurate categorisation of the nature of the alleged trade secret or confidential information. It is not necessary to adopt in its apparent rigidity the three-fold classification of information accepted in that case, or to accept the passage (at 137) dealing with the capacity of an employer to take a valid covenant against use of "second category" information, in order to see the case as a valuable guide to the resolution of the present problem. The very basis upon which the respondent's case was supported in evidence and argument demonstrates that what is here sought to be restrained is the obtaining of what is seen, rightly or wrongly, as an unfair competitive step rather than the misuse of information that can properly be described in 'secret' or 'highly confidential'. This conclusion is reinforced by the conceptual difficulties inherent in the proposition that what is involved is 'use' of the confidential information." ` `Furthermore, one must always remember the principles laid down in `Nordenfeld versus Maxim Nordenfelt Guns &` `Ammunition Co` `Ltd` `` [[1894] AC 535] that, prima facie, any restraint of trade is void as against public policy and it is only saved if it can be demonstrated as being reasonable. The onus is on the person seeking to enforce the covenant to demonstrate that the restriction is reasonable, `Herbert` `Morris Ltd v
Saxelby` `` [[1916] 1 AC 688], 715. However, because it is extremely difficult to fashion a covenant which will exactly protect only that confidential information which is able to be protected and because it is difficult to predict what exact problem will emerge, it is acceptable for an employer with a legitimate interest to protect to restrain an employee from taking competing employment for a set period. Cases where this was recognized include, `Haynes versus Doman` `` [[1899] 2 Ch 13], 19 and `Littlewoods` `Organisation` `Ltd versus Harris` `` [(1977) 1 WLR 1472], 1485.
In that latter case, Megaw, LJ following `Printers & Finishers Ltd v
Holloway` ``[1965] 1 WLR 1, said, "...it is appropriate that a covenant restricting an employee from full freedom of taking other employment when he leaves the existing employment, should be included in the contract of employment where there is a real danger that the employee will in the course of that employment have access to and gain information about matters which could fairly be regarded as trade secrets...."` ` Mr Ireland, QC who appeared for the plaintiff put that the letter of appointment contained a negative provision which should almost always be protected by injunction. He relied on the usual passage in `Doherty v` `Allman` `` [(1878) 3 App Cas 709], 720 to the effect that where a person has entered into a negative covenant, with his or her eyes open, equity should invariably grant an injunction to prevent a breach. Mr Ireland accepted that that proposition was not now as absolute as it was considered to be 100 years ago, (see eg the discussion by Bryson, J in `McLachlan Consultants Pty Ltd versus Boswell` ``(1988) 30 IR 417, ). However, he put that cases such as `Curro v` `Beyond Productions
Pty Ltd` `` [(1993) 30 NSWLR 337], 346-7, show that it still applies to contracts for "special service". He put that the present was a case of special services. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in `Curro's case`, ``there is no exhaustive definition of special services, but it has been held that performers on the live stage, the television stage and the sporting field may well fit into such category. The
Court of Appeal cited `Evening` `Standard` `Co Ltd versus Henderson` `` [[1987]
ICR 558] as one of the few cases of special services outside the performance field. I have read the case carefully. It concerned a newspaper production manager, but there was no negative covenant in the case, and the English Court of Appeal declined to grant an injunction to the employer. I cannot see where "special services" or the case of `Lumley versus Wagner` ``(1852) 1 De G M & G ; 42 ER 687 were not actually mentioned.` ` In `Warren versus Mendy` `` [[1989] 1 WLR 853], 857,
Nourse, LJ indicated that the "special services" category was one that usually arose in the "entertainment or sporting worlds". ` ` Mr Ireland QC puts that the facts in the present case mark it as one out of the ordinary. He says, and the evidence is undisputed, that the plaintiff is about to launch three new products onto the market. These products are known as CESER, KONE 7000 and Monospace. Within six to twelve months, the products will be well established on the market, but their initial launch is, it is put, a matter of great commercial secrecy. The plaintiff held a
Sales/Installation conference on 30 October - 1 November, 1996 at which the first defendant was probably present when marketing strategies for the launch of these products was discussed. The first defendant and others in the plaintiff company were then asked to prepare regional plans for launching the products in their regions. The first defendant did produce such a plan in
January, 1997. That plan is part of PX01 which contains confidential material so that I will not quote from it. However, the plan contains what people of commerce call a SWOT analysis (ie Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,
Threats). Six points were made under "Threats" including the fact that a company Deve was an established competitor. Deve is a subsidiary of the second defendant. ` ` Mr Ireland QC stressed the danger of a subsidiary of the second defendant as a competitor. Mr Simpkins, however, submitted that there was no evidence that the first defendant was likely to have any part to play in Deve and that I should not assume that a subsidiary company was managed by the managers of the parent. I agree with Mr Simpkin's submission and will say no more about Deve.` ` Mr Ireland QC puts that a person in such a position as the first defendant held in its organization must be considered as rendering special services.
This, with respect, seems similar to the proposition enunciated by Kekewich, J in` Whitwood Chemical Company versus Hardman` ``[1891] 2 Ch 416, 421 that the employee, a manager of a manufacturing company, was "a man who has special knowledge of a special business". The Court of Appeal was not attracted to this proposition and declined to extend the class of case to which the special services rule applied (see p 428).` ` I do not consider that the present, despite Mr Ireland QC's advocacy is a case of special services. Such cases are to be confined to the entertainment and sporting cases. Thus, I have a discretion as to whether or not I will grant an injunction. ` `I should interpolate at this stage that the defendants did not give any evidence, nor did their counsel, Mr Jonathan Simpkins, cross-examine. A judge assumes that a decision to run a case in this way taken by a counsel as able and experienced as Mr Simpkins is deliberate. Mr Ireland QC puts, however, that this course enables me to infer, especially in the absence of any explanation as to why the first defendant left the plaintiff's employ, that the move was set up by the second defendant to injure the plaintiff. He even points to the similarity of the typeface on the first defendant's letter of resignation and the typeface and mode of presentation employed by the solicitors for the defendants in correspondence. I do not consider that I should draw such inferences, but that fact does not really affect the decision in the case.` `However, the fact that the defendants did not tender evidence means that I do not have to take into account as a discretionary factor whether to grant the injunction would mean the first defendant was unemployed. Thus it would be very difficult to decline to make an injunction if the plaintiff was otherwise entitled to such an order. ` ` Mr Ireland QC then says that this is a clear case where the plaintiff should obtain an injunction. This is a case where the timing of the first defendant's exit from its employ could not have occurred at a worse time. His defection to the camp of a competitor undermines the launch of the plaintiff's new products. The detriment to the plaintiff is self evident. Furthermore, the evidence shows that the first defendant was carrying out extensive discussions with the Work Cover Authority during which he would have had further details of the strengths and weaknesses of the plaintiff's new products exposed to him. There is a national market for lifts. The first defendant is now to be employed by the second defendant as its Queensland Branch Manager and will be able to use the knowledge gained in the plaintiff's employ against the plaintiff's interest. ` ` I should add here that there was also an allegation that the first defendant had confidential information about the plaintiff's foreign exchange policy.
There was very little evidence on this matter and I was not convinced that whatever this policy was and whatever the first defendant knew about it was within the sphere of confidential information which could be protected by a properly drawn covenant.` ` Mr Simpkins puts his clients' case in a far less emotional way. He says that, following, `Orton versus Melman` `` [[1981] 1 NSWLR 583], 587, the Court must first construe the negative covenant, then determine its effect under the general law and then, if necessary, apply the [Restraints of
Trade Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/).` ` It is clear that the key provision is that headed "Employment Restrictions" quoted earlier in these reasons. I will, however, set out the core portions of this provision inserting distinguishing letters before the possible problem areas and then discusss those problems using the designating letter. The provision says "you may not...(a) engage in any (b) business in (c) Australia (whether as a director, principal, partner, consultant or employee) (e) which (f) could make use of (g) Confidential Information or (h) Confidential property (i) to the material detriment of the business of the Company."` `` ` (a) & (d) I was at first troubled by the words "engage in". However, the authorities noted below show that a person engages in a business if he or she is employed in a business, see `Rolfe versus Rolfe` `` <case>; [(1846) 15 Sim 88]; <case>; [60
ER 550]; `Ronbar Enterprises Ltd versus Green` `` [[1954] 1 WLR 815], 823; `Schindler Lifts Australia Pty Ltd versus Debelak` `` <case>; [(1989) 89 ALR 275], 308 and Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd versus Galli <case>; [[1985] VR 675], 707. I am of the view that the first defendant, by being employed by the second defendant in its lift business is "engaging in" such business.` ` ` ` (b) & (e) The business referred to is the business in which the employee might become engaged. This could well be a third party's business. It is this "business" that is the subject of the words in heading (f).` `` ` (c) Mr Simpkins puts that "Australia" is too extensive an area to seek protection. Mr Ireland QC, on the other hand, says that the evidence discloses that there is a national market for the selling, installation and maintenance of elevators and thus an Australia wide protection is appropriate. The defendants say that there are a series of markets in various States or regions. At one stage there appeared to be a distinction being made between selling and servicing lifts, but the evidence is insufficient to maintain such a distinction in this case. In any event, unless restrained by injunction, the first defendant will become the Queensland Branch Manager of the second defendant.` ` There was no expert evidence as to the market. Mr Ireland QC relied on recent cases to support the submission that the Court must decide what is the relevant market from all the facts. He relied on `Queensland Wire Industries
Pty Ltd versus Broken Hill` `Proprietary Co Ltd` ``(1989) <case>; [167
CLR 177], 190 and News Ltd versus Australian Rugby Football League Ltd [(1996) 58 FCR ], -504 (an aspect of the decision that was not affected by the allowing of the appeal against that decision by the Full Federal Court in <case>; [(1996) 64 FCR 410)]. ` ` I do not consider that I have sufficient material to determine whether there is an Australia wide market for lifts. There is some material which suggests this, but it is more than counter-balanced by other material. The plaintiff seems to operate in "regions" which appear to be co-extensive with States. The first defendant has spent the whole of his working career with the plaintiff in NSW or the ACT which it calls its central region. The second defendant also seems to operate State by State, hence the first defendant is the Queensland
Branch Manager. The exhibit PX01 asks each regional sales manager to prepare marketing strategies for his or her regional rather than on a national basis.
No-one favoured the Court with what might happen in the area between Lismore and the Queensland border or whether there was any national structure. The highest the evidence went was that there was at least one national conference of all the superior officers of the various regions. Even this is overstating the evidence as it is not certain that all those named in PX02 actually attended the national meeting. I am not satisfied that there is one national market.` ` However, even if there is no national market, an Australia wide area of restraint may be valid and reasonable. This is because the plaintiff has clearly demonstrated legitimate interests outside NSW which may call for protection. Thus, knowledge of a new product's weaknesses by a competitor will hurt the plaintiff outside NSW if the same new product is to be launched throughout Australia. I will return to this matter later.` `` ` (f) Mr Simpkins submitted that "could make use of" was far too wide. He submitted that "could" denoted possibility. He cited `Melbourne (City) v
Silverton Ltd` ``(1984) 54 LGRA 144, 148 in support of his submission. I consider that I should accept this view of the meaning of "could". I also accept that such a construction gives the provision a very wide operation.` `` ` (g) "Confidential Information" (note the capital initial letters) is defined in the appointment letter. Two initial points should be made which are virtually beyond contest. ` ` ` ` The first is that just because a person says that something is "confidential" does not of itself make it confidential within the scope of confidential information which equity protects. This is clear form `Re
Dalrymple` `` [[1957] RPC 449]; `Re Gallay Ltd's Application` `` [[1959] RPC ]; `Drake Personnel Ltd versus Beddison` `` <case>; [[1979] VR 13](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1979%5d%20VR%2013 "View LawCiteRecord" ) and `Wright versus Gasweld` `Pty Ltd` ``at p 333, though in the lastmentioned case, Kirby P said that "Courts should... exercise a modest disinclination to hold that information is not confidential when parties have taken the trouble to say it is." With respect, this dictum seems to run contrary to the authorities which are replete with situations where a person with superior bargaining power has endeavoured to protect itself from competition by a bold definition of "confidential information" and the courts have not been at all impressed with the attempt.` ` The second point is the Court looks at the matter of confidentiality at two points of time. For the purpose of discovering whether there is property being confidential information which it is legitimate and reasonable to protect, the
Court looks to the facts as at the time the parties made their contract, `Lindler v` `Murdock's Garage` `` <case>; [(1950) 83 CLR 628], 653; `Amoco Australia Pty Ltd v` Rocca `Bros Motor
Engineering Co Pty Ltd` `` <case>; [(1973) 133 CLR 288], 318; and `ICT Pty Ltd versus Sea Containers Ltd` `` [(1995) 17 ATPR 46-145] at p 53, 142, though cf `Geraghty versus Minter` `` [(1979) 142 CLR 177], 200. Of course, the Court takes into account future possibilities which could then have been foreseen, `Murdock's Garage` ``at , Sea Containers at p 53, 142. However, when the Court is considering whether an injunction should be granted, it looks to the facts as they exist at the date of hearing.` ` There was considerable discussion before me as to whether the information which at the date of the contract the first defendant had or might reasonably be supposed to have access to in the course of his new position as sales manager was confidential. Many allegedly analogous cases were read to me, some of which I discuss below.` ` It is abundantly clear that information which the lay person may consider has some degree of secrecy about it, in law may fall into various categories, some which the law protects and some which it does not. It is very difficult to draw the line as the authorities discussed below demonstrate. It is clear that a covenant not to make use of any information gained in the service of the employer goes far beyond what is legitimate and will be invalid, `Heine
Bros (Aust) Pty Ltd versus Forrest` `` <case>; [[1963] VR 383], 388. ` ` A useful commencement point for the discussion of the problems involved in this issue is the judgment of Megarry, J in `Coco versus AN Clark (Engineers)
Ltd` `` [(1968) 1A IPR 587], 590 where his Lordship said that there must be three elements viz, "First, the information itself...must have the necessary quality of confidence about it. Secondly, the information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it."` ` In `Faccenda Chicken Ltd versus Fowler` `` [[1987] Ch 117] Goulding, J split information which an employee may possess into three classes, viz (1) information of a trivial nature or which can easily be accessed, which is not confidential at all, (2) information which is said to be confidential when imparted by the employer, but which the employee will keep in his or her head, trade secrets. This tripartite classification has its uses, but may promote error as occurred with the English Court of Appeal in that case who considered that the only type of confidential information that could be protected even by covenant was that in the third category. ` ` A significant feature of this case appears at p 140 where Neill, LJ, in giving the judgement of the Court of Appeal said, "Information about the price to be charged for a new model of a car or some other product or about prices negotiated, for example, for various grades of oil in a highly competitive market in which it is known that prices are to be kept secret from competitors occur to us as providing possible further instances of information which is entitled to protection as having the requisite degree of confidentiality."` ` In the `Gasweld case`, ``all members of the Court used the `Faccenda` taxonomy as useful, but indicated that information in the second category could be protected by covenant. At p 334, Kirby, P listed a series of guidelines to distinguish between confidential information which could be so protected and that which could not. His Honour said:` ` "Determining what is confidential involves a decision on a question of fact in each case where that quality is asserted. Considerations which courts have found to be relevant, in particular cases, in determining this question include:` ` (a) The fact that skill and effort was expended to acquire the information: see `Interfirm Comparison` `(Australia`) `Pty Ltd versus Law Society of New South
Wales` `` [[1975] 2 NSWLR 104] at 117; `Wheatley versus Bell` `` [[1982] 2 NSWLR 544] at 546; cf `International` [1979] `Scientific Communications Inc versus Pattison` `` [[1979] FSR 429] at 434;` ` (b) The fact that the information is jealously guarded by the employer, is not readily made available to employees and could not, without considerable effort and/or risk, be acquired by others: see `Ansell Rubber Co` `Pty` `Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd` `` <case>; [[1967] VR 37](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1967%5d%20VR%2037 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 50; `E` `Worsley & Co Ltd versus Cooper` `` [[1939] 1 All ER ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1939%5d%201%20All%20ER%20290 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 307; cf `Stephenson` `Jordan & Hanison Ltd versus McDonald &
Evans` [(1952) 69 RPC 10] at 16;` ` (c) The fact that it was plainly made known to the employee that the material was regarded by the employer as confidential: see `Printers and
Finishers, Ltd v` Holloway `(Confidential Information)` `` [[1965] RPC ] at 256 and Faccenda (at 137);` `(d) The fact that the usages and practices of the industry support the assertion of confidentiality: see, eg, `Thomas Marshall (Exports) versus Guinle` `` [[1979] Ch 227] at 248; and` `(e) The fact that the employee in question has been permitted to share the information only by reason of his or her seniority or high responsibility within the employer's Organisation: see Faccenda (loc cit)".` `I should note, with respect, that care should be exercised when employing these guidelines. There is a tendency which was not altogether resisted in the present case, to go no further than to read the passage I have set out and not to examine the limitations in the cases relied upon. Indeed these guidelines are so broad that following them is only a preliminary step. To illustrate the `Interfirm case` ``was not a covenant case at all and it involved information which had been put together after exhaustive surveys. Nonetheless, the guidelines should be noted. ` ` Counsel referred me to a series of cases which they said illustrated where a court drew the line. Mr Ireland QC referred to `Aloha Shangri-La Atlas
Cruises Pty Ltd v` `Gaven` ``[1970] Qd R 438. He did so mainly to contrast it with the present case. In that case, the captain of a tourist boat successfully defended an action which sought to restrain him from using information as to what tourists preferred for his new employer. This was because that information was in the nature of know-how which, although learned in the employer's business had become the property of the employee. A similar result occurred in` Print Investments` `Pty` `Ltd versus Art-Vue Printing Ltd` `` [(1983) 1 IPR 149], a decision of Kearney, J in this Court. The defendants had obtained information as to the production of high quality art calendars during their employment with the plaintiff. This information was classed as know-how which had become the property of the employee and no injunction was granted.` ` On the other hand, in `Littlewoods Organisation Ltd v` `Harris` ``the employee was working in a mail order business and had access to the trends of mail order sales in the plaintiff's business, knew their plans for the foreseeable future and had access to their market research and attended board meetings (1484). An injunction was granted to police a covenant protecting this sort of information.` ` Whatever the general law may say about confidential information, it is important to consider the definition in this document of "Confidential
Information". The first thing to notice is that the term is an all inclusive term; it applies to the sum total of what is included in the inclusive definition and not to the whole and any part thereof.` ` It is abundantly clear that the drafter of the definition has pitched the claim too ambitiously. Information as to the plaintiff's business and its goods may not be confidential at all, or may be classified as know-how. Thus, apart from the application of the [Restraints of Trade
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/), the covenant seeks to protect too much.` ` Mr Ireland QC's prime focus was on the disaster that he says might befall the plaintiff because of the timing of the first defendant's exit from its employment. However, as I have said above, for the purpose of considering the reasonableness and hence the validity of the covenant one must look to see what information the parties might reasonably have in contemplation that the first defendant might have access to in the ordinary course of his employment.
If the present position is an extraordinary one because of the release on to the market of three new products, it might not be the case that the parties had this situation in mind when entering into the covenant. However, I infer that commercial people would have expected that, from time to time, this sort of event might happen, so that this type of information is legitimately protected by the covenant.` ` To sum up, the cases show that there is a legitimate interest in an employer protecting itself from a competitor poaching an employee who possesses information about new products and future marketing strategies (see particularly the `Littlewoods case` ``and `Faccenda` noted above).
However the confidential information which the drafter has chosen to protect is too wide a category. Thus the covenant itself must fail under the general law and the effect of the [Restraints of Trade Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/) will have to be considered.` ` Before considering the statute, I should complete my consideration of the terms of the relevant provision.` `` ` (h) The term "Confidential Property" is also defined in the letter of appointment, though in rather a strange manner. It will be remembered that the only definition of the term is within the section headed, "Inventions and
Copyright" with reference to the plaintiff's intellectual property. I will assume that the term was meanty to denote intellectual property. As such, it has no part to play in this case.` `` `(i) There is no doubt that any use by the second defendant of information gained by the first defendant whilst he was employed by the plaintiff would be materially detrimental to the plaintiff. As Mr Ireland QC has submitted, the effect of the first defendant being able to have the information in the service of the second defendant would give the second defendant what is usually referred to in this type of case as a springboard advantage. Courts are usually tender to see that people do not have such an advantage, see eg `Terrapin Ltd` `v` `Builders' Supply Co (Hayes) Ltd` `` [[1967] RPC ], ; `Speed Seal Products` Ltd `v Paddington` `` [[1985] 1 WLR ], ; `Gasweld` ``at p 338 and `Gurry, Breach of
Confidence`,``(Clarendon press, Oxford, 1984) pp 245-252.` ` I have already shown in section (g) above that the covenant is too wide in the type of information which it seeks to protect. There is also the question as to whether the area of restraint, the whole of Australia, is reasonable and whether one year is too long a time.` ` As to the area of restraint, the relevant factors are that, even if there was not an Australia wide market, the plaintiff and its main competitors carried on business throughout Australia with identical products being marketed throughout the country. The fact that the employer has a nationwide business is not usually determinative of the question of reasonableness of area if the employee only worked in a small part of the country, see `Heydon, The Restraint of Trade Doctrine` ``(Butterworths London, ) p 147 and the cases there cited. Even though the employer had some interests outside NSW which might be the subject of legitimate protection, I consider that, in the case of a NSW regional sales manager, an Australia wide restriction is too great.` ` As to time, it should be noted that the plaintiff only presses for a six month injunction. Mr Simpkins says, and I agree with him, that prima facie this means that the period is too long. However, here again, one must look to the circumstances that appertained when the covenant was exacted. Apart from the present problem of new product launch, it is difficult to see any real need for protection over a whole year with this type of industry and this class of employee. The need not having been demonstrated, it must be taken to be too wide and hence unreasonable and unenforceable. ` ` The covenant being too wide, I must consider whether it can be saved by the [Restraints of Trade Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/).` ` [Section (l)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html) of the [Restraints of Trade
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/) provides as follows: "(1) A restraint of trade is valid to the extent to which it is not against public policy, whether it is in severable terms or not."` ` The purpose and effect of that provision was described by McLelland J in `Orton versus Melman` ``[1981] 1 NSWLR 583 at 587. After referring to the report of the Law Reform Commission (LRC9) which led to the enactment of the legislation he said:` `"... Reference to that report clearly demonstrates that the perceived mischief or defect in the law was not confined to the rule that one could not by severing the words, change the substance of a restraint. The mischief or defect was that in determining the validity of a restraint, the courts were bound to consider all possible breaches within its terms (after any permissible severance) and determine whether public policy was infringed by the restraint of all such breaches, rather than by the actual or threatened breaches proved in the particular case...` `His Honour went on to say (at 587-588):` `"In my opinion where the court is to determine, in relation to a restraint to which [s (l)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html) applies whether (having regard to public policy) the restraint is enforceable in respect of an alleged breach (or threatened breach), it is proper first to determine whether the alleged breach (independently of public policy considerations) does or will infringe the terms of the restraint properly construed, and if so, then to determine whether the restraint, so far as it applies to that breach, is contrary to public policy. If the restraint, so far as it applies to that breach, is not contrary to public policy then by force of [s (l)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html) the restraint is to that extent valid, subject always of course to any order which may be made under [s (3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html)` `Whether, and if so, the extent to which, the court will have to define the outer limits of validity of a restraint in a particular case, will depend upon the nature, and degree of generality, of the relief which in that case it is necessary or proper for the Court to grant. For example, where injunctive relief is granted, the duration of a valid restraint of any breach enjoined will have to be determined. In applying [s (l)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html) the court should consider the circumstances of the particular case before it and determine the validity of the restraint to the extent that it purports to operate in those circumstances, and it is unnecessary to consider its purported operation in other conceivable sets of circumstances."` ` In the present case, the plaintiff seeks as an alternative to enforcing the covenant as framed, to enforce it as read down by the court under [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html) of the statute. This subsection is as follows:` `"(3) Where, on application by a person subject to the restraint, it appears to the Supreme Court that a restraint of trade is, as regards its application to the applicant, against public policy to any extent by reason of, or partly by reason of, a manifest failure by a person who created or joined in creating the restraint to attempt to make the restraint a reasonable restraint, the
Court, having regard to the circumstances in which the restraint was created, may, on such terms as the Court thinks fit, order that the restraint be, as regards its application to the applicant, altogether invalid or valid to such extent only (not exceeding the extent to which the restraint is not against public policy) as the Court thinks fit and any such order shall, notwithstanding subsection (1), have effect on and from such date (not being a date earlier than the date on which the order was made) as is specified in the order."` `` ` This subsection does not confer on the court unlimited power to reformulate covenants. In `Orton v` `Melman,` ``McLelland, J said at p 589 , "It is a condition precedent of the power of the court to grant relief...that there be found to be `a manifest failure by a person who created...the restraint to attempt to make the restraint a reasonable restraint'. The onus of establishing this rests upon the applicant.." This thought was also captured by Giles, CJ Comm D in `Douglass Automated
Laboratories & Allied Services Pty Ltd` `` [(1994) 16 ATPR 46-129] at 53,625 who added, "It seems that the order is to have an effect additional to that flowing from [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html), an effect somehow marking the manifest failure to attempt to make the restraints reasonable."` ` The application of this Act was also considered by Needham, J in `A Buckle & Sons Ltd versus McAllister` ``(1986) 4 NSWLR 426.
Both counsel agreed with Needham, J's statement at p 434, that whatever be the operation of the statute it does not empower "the court to create a valid restraint out of an invalid one unless it can be done by a reading down process." Thus, both counsel acknowledged that there were limitations in the use of the statute to validate a covenant which was invalid under the general law. ` ` In `Iraf Pty Ltd versus Graham` `` [[1982] 1 NSWLR 419], which involved a restrictive covenant placed on the vendor of a hairdressing business, Rath, J followed the approach in `Orton `and said at p , that the statute only operated to validate a restraint of trade to the extent that it imposes a reasonable restraint and that "this validation does not extend to other cases of invalidity: for example, voidness for uncertainty." This approach was followed in `Douglass Automated
Laboratories & Allied` `Services Pty` Ltd ``where the authorities are reviewed at p 534, 623.` ` It is tolerably clear that not only can the statute be used to read down the area and time of the restriction if it exceeds what is reasonable, but the court can also read down the extent of the restriction imposed. This was what
Kearney, J said in `Knogo Corp versus Halligan` ``(1984) 6 ATPR 40-060 and it has been a consistent approach thereafter. Thus, in `Gasweld `at first instance, Hodgson, J read down not only the area of applicability and duration, but also the subject matter of the covenant. On appeal, at p 337,
Kirby, P agreed with this approach. His Honour said:-` ` ` `"At common law such restraint of trade would have been held contrary to public policy and wholly unenforceable. It was to permit a new approach to such provisions that the [Restraints of Trade Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/) was enacted. A discretion is enlivened by the Act to permit the Supreme Court to order that the restraint be altogether valid or valid to an extent deemed: cf `Orton` `v Melman` [[1981] 1 NSWLR 583] at 587.
For the purpose of protecting what he had found to be the legitimate confidentiality of the information, Hodgson J fashioned the orders which have been set out. He limited them by reference to:` `(i) their subject matter;` `(ii) the place of their operation; and` `(iii)their duration.` `These are precisely the kind of orders which the Act envisaged to replace the former rule by which such provisions were typically struck down in their entirety.` `The clear policy behind the Act is that parties should be kept to their agreements to the fullest extent compatible with the continuing public policy which upholds freedom of trade and legitimate competition. The policy of the law of normally keeping parties to their agreements was expressed most recently by Gleeson CJ in` Baltic Shipping Co versus Dillon, "Mikhail
Lertnontov`" ``(1991) 22 NSWLR 1, at 9C.... Legitimate expectations of confidence should be also protected. On the other hand, freedom to exercise one's skills and to earn one's living are also important attributes of economic liberty which the law endeavours to uphold: cf `Mason versus Provident Clothing` `and` `` `Supply Co Ltd` `` [1913]
AC 724 at 732 (HL)....` `I have concluded, with Hodgson J, that in this case the employee should be held to his agreement as ordered. The confidential information which he obtained during the course of his employment, as defined by his Honour should be safeguarded."` `However, in the same case, the Chief Justice made it` `clear that there is a limit to which the statute can be utilized. He said at p329, "I would not deny the possibility that an appropriate covenant giving the respondent some form of protection against unfair post-employment activity by the appellant could have been formulated, but, in the view I take of the facts of the case, it would require far more extensive re-drafting of cl 6 than is justified by the [Restraints of Trade Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/) to produce that result". ` `A very awkward set of problems arise in the instant case. First, it is clear that the employer had a legitimate fear that there would be sensitive marketing information which it could protect by a covenant against the employee working for a competitor for a period after the employee's employment with the plaintiff came to an end. ` `I will first deal with reading down the provision as far as time and area are concerned. In` Fleming Bros` `(Monaro` `Agencies) Pty Ltd versus Smith` `` [(1983) 5 ATPR 40-389], Holland, J said that such an exercise must be done on impression with commonsense. See also my unreported decision in `Stanizzo` versus `Paussi` ``(17.9.1985). There may be cases where the lack of evidence is so pronounced that the court is unable to give the applicant any relief under [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html), see eg `ICT` `Pty Ltd versus Sea Containers Ltd` `` [(1995) 17 ATPR -145], a decision of the NSW Court of Appeal. However, if at all possible on the evidence, the court will endeavour to carry out the exercise referred to by the statute and perhaps particularly where it is only time or area in dispute because these involve a number of subjective factors on which it is difficult to present concrete evidence.` `In the instant case, I feel no difficult in following the approach taken by
Holland, J in respect of time and area. As to the former, it is fairly clear that 12 months is too long, but six months would probably exhaust any springboard advantage that the defendants might otherwise secure for themselves. ` `The appropriate area is difficult. The employee has worked virtually all his working life in NSW. However, his employment as the NSW Sales Manager has brought him into contact with a wider group of people and with what the industry is doing in other States. I believe that reading down the covenant to
NSW would be too drastic: application to the whole of Australia is too wide. I believe the proper area of restraint is the Eastern mainland States plus the
ACT. Although, the first defendant would have some information which might be of advantage to a competitor in the rest of Australia, local factors would probably outweigh this. In any event, the first defendant offered undertakings not to make use of confidential information. These were not accepted by me because the plaintiff did not consider that they gave it any real protection.
Whether they will now be renewed is a matter for the parties. ` ``Gasweld` shows that in a proper case, the court may read down the subject matter of a covenant. To my mind, a covenant in the form, "You may not engage in any business in the field of selling or maintaining elevators (whether as....consultant or employee) for six months after quitting the employ of KONE" might have been upheld. However, one has to do a considerable amount of redrafting to get to this position. Despite what Kirby,P said in `Gasweld `about the beneficent operation of the statute to enable the legitimate expectation that people will perform their contracts to prevail, I believe that, if I were to reformulate the covenant in this way, I would be acting contrary to the view of Needham,J in the `Buckle case` which both counsel adopted.` ` Of course, I need not actually read down the covenant. I could grant a clear injunction that the first defemdamt be restrained from being employed in any managerial position with the second defendant in Eastern Australia up to 7
September, 1997. This would be a simple injunction which would protect the legitimate interests of the employer and be in conformity with the intention of the parties. Although as I said earlier in these reasons, I have a discretion, as the defendants called no evidence, I have no material as to hardship which might go to disincline me to grant what the plaintiff requests.` ` I regret that I cannot do this as to do so would go further than is authorised by the statute. I would not be reading down the covenant. I would be adjusting it to cover a situation with which the drafter did not deal. The drafter considered that the employee should be restrained from dealing with what was roundly described as "Confidential Information": to protect that interest, the employee was to be prevented from working in a business that might possibly make some use of that "Confidential Information". I would be going well outside "reading down" the covenant to give relief under it of the type indicated.` ` An additional reason for reaching this view is that the plaintiff has not established any attempt to create a valid restriction which has manifestly failed. The plaintiff argued that the restraint that was imposed was valid throughout the case. It is true that it put an alternative argument that the covenant should be enforced as read down. However, running the case in this way made it difficult to establish any attempt to impose a reasonable restraint. The attempt was deliberately to impose a covenant extending far beyond what was legitimate. Thus, following what was said in `Orton v` `Melman `and the` Douglass case` ``set out earlier, no relief may be given under [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rota1976216/s4.html) of the Statute as a relevant pre-condition to jurisdiction has not been made out.` ` Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim must be dismissed. I will hear submissions later in the day as to the form of any ancillary orders. ` `` `` ``KONE ELEVATORS PTY LIMITED versus GRANT MCNAY AND ANOR (NO 2) /97 
MONDAY 10 MARCH 1997 
SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I gave judgment this morning on the principal issue. The parties now need to have final orders made so that there will be no technical barrier to an appeal. The two outstanding matters are the question of costs and the question of whether there should be a reference to a Master to assess any damages that shall be caused by the taking of the interlocutory undertakings in lieu of injunctions which were subject to an undertaking as to damages.

As to the first, there is no opposition to an order for costs. Mr Simpkins of counsel for the defendants, asks for costs on an indemnity basis and directs attention to page 21 of the affidavit of Mr Cassettari in which the defendants signalled that they would seek such an order.

I do not consider that this is an appropriate case for indemnity costs, but the matter causes me considerable fluctuation of mind. It was a borderline case and I do not consider that it is the type of case where one should visit indemnity costs because of some perversity on the part of the plaintiff in pressing its case. Accordingly, I will make the order that is not opposed as to costs, namely, the plaintiff pay the defendants' costs.

So far as reference to a Master is concerned, there is no opposition to it being referred to a Master to assess any damages that flow from the defendants' undertaking not to work until the case was decided.

So I will make the usual order, that is that the defendants be at liberty to issue a Notice of Motion returnable before a Master for assessment of any damages consequent upon the undertakings given to the Court on 3 March 1997 and extended on 6 March 1997 within twenty-eight days, or within twenty-eight days of the determination of the matter by the Court of Appeal whichever last occurs.

In making this order I am not precluding the Master from finding, if he considers it appropriate, that no such damages flow.

The costs of any such Notice of Motion will be at the discretion of the
Master. So that the order I make is that the plaintiff pay the defendants' costs to date: further costs are reserved. I will make the final orders in accordance with what I have just said.
 [Mr Arthur, for the plaintiff, then applied for an injunction to preserve the subject matter of the proceedings pending an appeal.

Mr Simpkins opposed and read three affidavits.

Mr Arthur read one affidavit in reply].

HIS HONOUR: This is an application made by an unsuccessful plaintiff for an injunction to protect its position pending an appeal which it proposes to file this week returnable before the Court of Appeal.

Mr Simpkins raises the objection that there is no jurisdiction after an application for injunction being refused on a final basis to grant such an application. He points out that the cases that are usually cited in connection with the jurisdiction, namely, Orion Property Trust Limited versus Du Cane Court
Limited [[1962] 3 All ER 466];
Erinford Properties Limited versus Cheshire County Council [[1974] 1 Ch ];
Paringa Mining & Exploration Co plc versus North Flinders Mines Limited (No 2) <case>; [(1988) 165 CLR 452], were all cases where the interlocutory injunction was refused and the Court granted an injunction pending an appeal, or refused such an application on its merits.

However, there are instances of injunctions after dismissal on the final basis of a suit. There has not been time to research them all, but two of the marked ones are Carlton & United Breweries Limited versus Tooth & Co Ltd (No ) Young J 19 September 1986, unreported, and AG for Hong Kong versus Reid (No ) [[1992] 2 NZLR 394.] I consider that I do have jurisdiction to make such an order. I should point out also that up to this point, because of the short time involved, no formal order has been taken out, so there is no question of me being technically functus officio.

I consider that in making a decision as to whether to grant the injunction pending an appeal I should look (a) to the strength of the appeal; and (b) to the balance of convenience.

As to (a), although prima facie the decision appealed from is correct, so that one does not get into the area of what is an arguable case as one does in an interlocutory application before final hearing, all one does, as a judge in this situation, is to consider whether there is bona fide ground for appeal.

An appeal in Australia is considered to be a right of all litigants and unless the judge can see that any appeal will be virtually hopeless or it has been put on viciously or for some collateral purpose, ordinarily a party should be given an opportunity to appeal and orders made preserving the subject matter so that any such appeal is not rendered valueless.

The present case was not one to which the answer was obvious and it may be that the Court of Appeal would come to a different decision to which I have reached; of course I do not believe it will. Accordingly, it seems to me that the plaintiff has passed the first barrier.

On the question of balance of convenience, there is something to be said to the proposition that the value of the appeal would be lost if no injunction is granted. Also I am only dealing with the situation up to and including next
Monday, though as Mr Simpkins said, the worry is that sometimes these preliminary orders are perpetuated for some months.

The defendants are protected by the undertakings as to damages, but that has its drawbacks because it costs money to file a motion to "collect" on an undertaking as to damages. Especially when an individual is involved, he may not have the funds to risk on such an assessment. I am told that the first defendant should have his severance moneys from the plaintiff. But even so, I think it would be appropriate that he should be given some current moneys.

Doing the best I can, on the balance of convenience, I would be prepared to grant an injunction up to and including 17 March 1997 in aid of the plaintiff's foreshadowed appeal. The injunction should be in the form of the first and second prayers in the Summons, and the injunction is granted subject to the usual undertaking as to damages being given.

The further conditions of the injunction are (1) that the plaintiff will pay to the first defendant the sum of $1,540 no later than Wednesday of this week, such money to be refunded should the plaintiff succeed in its appeal; (2) that a Notice of Appeal be filed and served no later than Wednesday 12 March by 4 pm; and (3) the plaintiff makes the appropriate application to the Court of
Appeal to have a Motion for expedition considered by that court as soon as possible.

I should also order that exhibit PX01 before me and the affidavit of Mr
Hellewell of 5 March 1997 be placed in a sealed envelope and delivered to the
Associate of the President of the Court of Appeal.
