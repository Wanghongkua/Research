JUDGMENT 
Introduction
The Attorney General of New South Wales seeks orders pursuant to [s 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) in relation to the defendant, Evangelos Rouvinetis. The orders sought are that all proceedings instituted by the defendant, excluding those proceedings in Evangelos versus David Knoll & 22 Ors 15679 of 2008, prior to the date of the order be stayed (vide [s 8(7)(a))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) and that the defendant be prohibited from instituting new proceedings without the leave of the Court (vide [s 8(7)(a)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html)
The plaintiff has standing under <case>(a) of the Act to bring the application despite being a stranger to the proceedings relied upon as grounding of the issued vexatious proceedings order. 
The application has been instigated by the defendant's involvement in more than fifty different proceedings, in the High Court, this Court, the District and Local Courts, the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal (formerly the Residential Tribunal) and the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, brief details of which are discussed below. It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, although of these 50 cases, 12 would not qualify themselves as vexatious proceedings within the meaning of <case> of the Act, they are relevant for the purposes of demonstrating the nature and extent of the plaintiff's litigation history. 
The evidence 
The plaintiff read the affidavit of Christopher Butler of 28 January 2011. Four volumes of materials containing pleadings, submissions, unreported decisions of various courts and tribunals in New South Wales relating to proceedings in which the defendant was or is involved were exhibited to that affidavit. No objection was taken by the defendant, who was self represented. I am satisfied that all of the material tendered by the plaintiff is admissible. 
The defendant called evidence from Michelle Fraser, barrister, and Andrea Howardova, a psychiatry registrar at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The evidence of both witnesses was irrelevant to the determination of the matter. Notwithstanding, it is appropriate to briefly summarise that evidence. 
The evidence, which the defendant sought to adduce from Ms Fraser, related to circumstances which led to her accepting the brief in proceedings between the defendant and the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal in the District Court. She said that she did so after her clerk inquired as to whether she would take the brief, having received an inquiry from the Registrar of the District Court. Upon receiving the court file she wrote to the defendant by letter dated 23 April 2009 making enquiries of him regarding the proceedings and requesting him to contact her. A copy of that letter was tendered. She said that she had a conference with the defendant, regarding the matter and thereafter provided advice by way of letter dated 28 April 2009. While it was not traversed during Ms Fraser's oral evidence, the letter of 28 April 2009 indicates that the defendant was proceeding in the District Court by way of appeal, claiming damages against the Tribunal in the amount of $133 after it had made an order directing him to pay an equal amount to the Department of Housing. Ms Fraser's advice was, essentially, that it was not worth prosecuting proceedings seeking such an amount, the matter was, at least to her mind, properly decided by the Tribunal and that there was no cause of action as the Tribunal had immunity in respect of its judicial function. 
The defendant enquired as to whether she was "appointed" by the District Court. When I questioned him as to the relevance of the question the defendant responded - "She is part of the conspiracy involving the plaintiff, that is what I want to prove. In this case she comes to say she was a barrister pro bono. We are having perjury that is the form with this witness. I brought her to prove that she was a part of a conspiracy she perjured."
The apparent trigger for the defendant's questioning of Ms Fraser appears to stem from a letter he received from the Assistant Registrar of the District Court dated 9 May 2011, less than a fortnight after Ms Fraser's letter, indicating that unsuccessful attempts had been made to find a barrister who would accept the defendant's brief. 
The evidence which the defendant adduced from Ms Howardova centred upon the events surrounding his being taken to the Prince of Wales Hospital by police officers on the afternoon of 7 December 2010. A "request by member of NSW police force for the assessment of an alleged mentally ill or mentally disturbed person at a declared mental health facility" form contained in the Prince of Wales Psychiatry Record, which was produced by Ms Howardova and admitted into evidence with the consent of the defendant, indicates that police had been called to the defendant's Department of Housing residence on 7 December 2010 after reports of a "breach of the peace" and after threats were made "to Housing and Police". Ms Howardova confirmed that the defendant was brought to the hospital by police and that she was contacted by a nurse at approximately 3.20 pm to conduct an assessment on the defendant which she ultimately did. She gave evidence that, having undertaken the assessment, she concluded that the defendant did not have a mental illness although she said that he displayed paranoid personality traits. Although the opinion of Ms Howardova provides perhaps some explanation for the defendant's conduct and attitude, it is of doubtful relevance and I have not taken it into account as either favourable or adverse to him. 
In addition to the evidence given by Ms Fraser and Ms Howardova, the defendant relied upon an affidavit sworn by him on 25 February 2011 along with five documents identified as being the defendant's submissions or further submissions dated 28 February, 29 March, 11 and 28 April and 16 May 2011. The defendant informed me that the submissions contained assertions of fact and that he wished for them to be treated as the truth. There being no objection on behalf of the plaintiff I admitted those documents into evidence. 
The legislative scheme 
Section 8(1)(a) of the Act provides that a vexatious proceedings order in relation to a person may be made where an "authorised court" (such as this Court - see the definition in <case>) is satisfied "the person has frequently instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in Australia". Section 4 of the Act defines "proceedings" as including: "(a) any cause, matter, action, suit, proceedings, trial, complaint or inquiry of any kind within the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal, and any proceedings (including any interlocutory proceedings) taken in connection with or incidental to proceedings pending before a court or tribunal, and any calling into question of a decision, whether or not a final decision, of a court or tribunal, and whether by appeal, challenge, review or in another way."
Section 5 of the Act defines "institute", in relation to proceedings, as including: "(a) for civil proceedings-the taking of a step or the making of an application that may be necessary before proceedings can be started against or in relation to a party, and for proceedings before a tribunal-the taking of a step or the making of an application that may be necessary before proceedings can be started before the tribunal, and for criminal proceedings-the making of a complaint or the obtaining of a warrant for the arrest of an alleged offender, and for civil or criminal proceedings or proceedings before a tribunal-the taking of a step or the making of an application that may be necessary to start an appeal in relation to the proceedings or to a decision made in the course of the proceedings."
Section 6 of the Act defines "vexatious proceedings", as including: "(a) proceedings that are an abuse of the process of a court or tribunal, and proceedings instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for another wrongful purpose, and proceedings instituted or pursued without reasonable ground, and proceedings conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose."
Section 8(7) of the Act provides that: "The Supreme Court may make any one or more of the following vexatious proceedings orders in relation to a person: an order staying all or part of any proceedings in New South Wales already instituted by the person, an order prohibiting the person from instituting proceedings in New South
Wales, any other order that the Court considers appropriate in relation to the person."
The test under <case>(a) requires that, before making a vexatious proceedings order, the court must first be satisfied that the person has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings as defined in <case> of the Act and then that those proceedings have been instituted or conducted frequently (see: Attorney General of NSW versus Wilson <case> per Davies J at [10]- <case>, Davies J helpfully (if I may respectfully say so) set out the relevant principles as follows - "I discussed in Attorney General of NSW versus Wilson <case> at <case>- <case> the principles associated with the making of an order under <case>(a) of the Act.
Those matters may be summarised as follows: the test of "frequently" is a less demanding test than was required under s 84 [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/); the term "frequently" is a relative term and must be looked at in the context of the litigation being considered; the number of proceedings considered may be small if the proceedings are an attempt to re-litigate an issue already determined against the person; regard may be had to applications made by the person in proceedings commenced against that person; regard may be had to the way the person has behaved and conducted himself or herself in the proceedings before the Court; regard may be had to proceedings in any Australian court or tribunal; regard may be had to the findings and result in the proceedings under consideration.
 [8] In these proceedings, reference has been made to the judgment of Perram J in Official Trustee in Bankruptcy versus Gargan (No 2) <case> where his Honour eloquently expresses the principles relating to vexatious litigants at [2]-[12]. Whilst acknowledging that the test his Honour had to consider was the test under <case> [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and is, as I have noted, a more demanding test than is required under the [Vexatious
Proceedings Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/), much of what his Honour sets out is relevant to the determination in the present case.
 [2] A comprehensive explanation of what makes a proceeding vexatious is difficult to proffer for the boundary between the persistent and over-zealous on the one hand, and the vexatious on the other, may at times be indistinct.
However, the following principles are, at least, well-established. First, the making of such an order is an extreme remedy depriving its object of recourse to the enforcement of the law which is every citizen's ordinary right. It is, therefore, not lightly to be made.
 [3] Secondly, the purpose of the order is not to impose condign punishment for past litigious misdeeds; it serves instead to shield both the public, whose individual members might be molested by vexatious proceedings, and the
Court itself, whose limited resources and needs must be carefully managed and protected from the expense, burden and inconvenience of baseless and repetitious suits.
 [4] Thirdly, as might naturally be expected, such a severe power is not enlivened by the mere single occurrence of a vexatious claim. To err is human and transient lapses of judgment, even serious ones, may be found in the most reasonable of places. Instead, the power to make the order is conditional upon the litigant having commenced not only a single vexatious proceeding but also upon having commenced similar such proceedings in this Court or in other
Australian courts.
 [5] Fourthly, the qualities of vexation to which O 21 is addressed are to be found, as the terms of r 1(1) show, in the commencement by the litigant of proceedings which lack reasonable grounds and where the litigant's institution of such proceedings may fairly be said to be both habitual and persistent.
 [6] Fifthly, whether a proceeding is instituted without reasonable grounds is a different question to, although not wholly disconnected from, the inquiry into a proceeding's legal merits. The wheat, no doubt, must be separated from the chaff but in this area the question is whether what is before the Court contains any wheat at all. Although, often enough, no great guidance is obtained by exchanging one formula of words with another, it will be usually of some assistance, limited perhaps, to ask whether the issues brought to the
Court for determination are manifestly hopeless or devoid of merit. It is, in that context, important to distinguish the difficult from the ridiculous and the unlikely from the hopeless.
 [7] Sixthly, although the ways in which unreasonable grounds may manifest themselves are myriad, one form often to be found in the baggage of the vexatious is a failure, often a refusal, to understand the principles of finality of litigation which rescue court and litigant alike from a Samsara of past forensic encounters.
 [8] Seventhly, it is the related quality of repetition which underpins, in part, a need for the institution of the proceedings to deserve the appellations habitual and persistent. The litigant's conduct will be habitual where the commencement of proceedings occurs as a matter of course when appropriate conditions for their commencement are present as was explained by
Roden J in Attorney-General versus Wentworth [(1988) 14 NSWLR 481] at 492.
That formulation may not wholly explain the litigant who commences proceedings on any occasion and without the presence of any conditions, whether appropriate or otherwise. In such cases, the idea of constant repetition driven by habit and symptomatic of an inability not to engage in the behaviour may be more useful. Persistence, on the other hand, generally suggests stubborn determination but, in the context of the vexatious, carries with it the capacity to endure failure beyond the point at which a rational person would abandon the field.
 [9] Eighthly, each of these notions - the want of reasonable grounds, habitual institution and persistent institution - are to be gauged objectively. But this does not mean that a litigant's own protestation as to his or her own mental state is irrelevant; frequently enough, the vexatious are betrayed out of their own mouths. Rather, the need for objective determination protects courts from the vexatious litigant who is genuinely, but misguidedly, persuaded as to the correctness of his or her own conduct.
 [10] Ninthly, the power to make the order arises when proceedings commenced in the way described are found to exist. But the notion of a proceeding is a broad one including a substantive proceeding directed at the attainment of final relief and collateral applications within such a proceeding; further, it extends outside the proceeding itself and embraces appeals therefrom and applications which, whilst not made in the proceeding, are properly to be seen as collateral thereto - so much flows from the definition of proceeding in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/s4.html) of the [Federal Court of Australia Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/) (Cth).
 ...
 [12] Finally, once it is concluded that the Court's power to prevent a litigant from commencing or pursuing proceedings has been enlivened, the considerations germane to the exercise of that power are unconfined. However, the factors which will be relevant are informed by the protective purpose which the order serves. Where a litigant displays insight into their previous litigious history this will, no doubt, be relevant for it will suggest - although not determine - a diminution in the risk posed to the public. On the other hand, the manner in which a litigant conducts herself in her affairs generally is also capable of throwing light on whether the commencement of further vexatious proceedings is likely. Those general affairs include the litigant's defence to the proceedings by which the order restraining him is sought. Because of the protective nature of the jurisdiction it is also relevant to know the extent of the damage and inconvenience the litigant's forays into the courts have caused, pecuniary or otherwise." 
The defendant's litigation history
In determining whether to make the orders sought by the plaintiff, it is first necessary to determine whether, if any, of the proceedings which the plaintiff points to as being vexatious are such and then to further determine whether they have been frequently instituted or conducted. In so doing, I have reviewed the proceedings pointed to by the plaintiff as demonstrative of the defendant's litigation history. It is necessary to focus on the nature of the defendant's claim in each case, the outcome of individual proceedings and the findings of or views expressed by the presiding judicial officer in determining the proceedings, the conduct of the defendant within the proceedings and the attitude or perceived attitude of the defendant towards his obligations as unsuccessful litigant. 
I have set out in some instances, the defendant's pleadings and submissions. For ease of reading, I have corrected some obvious spelling errors.

Proceedings involving the Department of Housing
In May 1996 the NSW Department of Housing commenced proceedings (number 96/10673) in the Residential Tenancies Tribunal for an order terminating the Residential Tenancy Agreement entered into between the defendant and the Department on 29 May 1995 on the basis of the defendant's conduct towards employees of the Department. The matter was finally heard by Member Cochrane on 16 May 1996 and orders were made by the Member on 24 May 1996 terminating the Tenancy Agreement and ordering vacant possession. The plaintiff does not submit that these proceedings are vexatious. 
On 30 May 1996 the defendant commenced proceedings (30068 of 1996) seeking judicial review of Member Cochrane's decision of 29 May 1995 on the basis that there "was an error of judgment". On 17 June 1996 by amendment of the summons, the defendant made claims against personnel of the Department alleging; "misconduct", "violation of tenancy agreement and the clause "22" of the Act", "dereliction of duty", "denial to acknowledge document", "violation of restriction orders" and "false pretences" and, "malicious prosecution". The amendments also asserted that the Tribunal's decision "has erred in judgment in facts and in law". The defendant's affidavit in support contained allegations regarding the conduct of employees of the Department who attended his residence in April 1996 and the failure of the Tribunal to inform "him about technicalities". 
On 17 July 1996 this Court (Dunford J) heard the defendant's application. The amended summons was dismissed so far as it pertained to allegations against employees of the Department, his Honour concluding that "if [the allegations] are appropriate to be brought at all, [they] are not appropriate matters to be brought in this Division nor are they appropriate matters to be included in a summons seeking to appeal on a question of law from a decision of the Tribunal". Notwithstanding, his Honour upheld the appeal against the determination of the Tribunal on the basis that the defendant had been denied procedural fairness and made orders remitting the matter for rehearing: Rouvinetis versus Department of Housing Commission of NSW (Supreme Court of NSW, Dunford J, 17 July 1996, unreported). The plaintiff does not submit that these proceedings are vexatious. 
Supreme Court Proceedings - 13455 of 1996
On 14 August 1996, the defendant commencing proceedings (13455 of 1996) seeking an order against the "Chairperson of the Residential Tenancy Tribunal" in respect of orders made against the defendant on 8 May and 17 May 1996 on the grounds "of conducting a hearing negligently", "denying natural justice" and "violating wilfully the law". The defendant filed two affidavits dated 14 and 16 August 1996 respectively in which he alleged violations of "natural justice", "findings of the Supreme Court", and conduct constituting breaches of State and Federal legislation. A letter dated 21 August 1996 addressed to the defendant on behalf of the Principal Registrar of the Court informed the defendant that the listing of the matter on 26 August 1996 had been vacated. However, the Court's file records that the matter proceeded before James J on 26 August 1996, the defendant appearing in person, with no appearance recorded for the Tribunal. The outcome was noted as "no evidence of service from the deft [sic]. No proper affidavit evidence. No relief granted". The file further indicates that the matter was listed before McInerney J on 9 September 1996, which accords with an amended return date on the Summons filed on 14 August 1996 although no result is recorded. The ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown, although the plaintiff submits that that I should draw the inference that the Summons was dismissed or discontinued. In my view this is appropriate inference to be drawn.
The plaintiff submits that these proceedings were vexatious because they were "commenced without reasonable ground and constituted an abuse of process". In support of this the plaintiff contends that the proceedings constituted a further challenge to the orders of the Tribunal in proceedings 96/10673 which had been dealt with by Dunford J in the defendant's favour in proceedings 13455 of 1996 and that they were commenced before the Tribunal had reheard proceedings 96/10673 on remittal. 
Supreme Court Proceedings - 13508 of 1996
On 19 August 1996 the defendant again filed a Summons (13508 of 1996) in this Court again seeking orders against the Department. The defendant claimed that the Department "is called to answer charges for its personnel R. Holden" on allegations of "false pretences", "corrupt commission", "corrupt inducement for advice", "perjury", "interfering with witness/es", "abettor in misdemeanour" and "indictment for conspiracy". An affidavit in support of the Summons of the defendant dated 19 August 1996 alleges contraventions by the Department or R. Holden of ss 185, 249, [327](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s327.html), [336](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s336.html), [351](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s351.html) and 393 of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). 
At a hearing on 2 September 1996, at which the Department was represented and the defendant appeared in person, Hamilton AJ made an order dismissing the proceedings. No reasons for the order were provided by the plaintiff and it was "likely" [that] the proceedings were dismissed by the Court on its own motion, as the summons disclosed no reasonable grounds". The plaintiff submitted that the proceedings are "clearly vexatious" as they were instituted without reasonable grounds with the purpose of harassing or annoying Mr Holden and other staff of the Department. 
Supreme Court Proceedings - 11648/1997 Rouvinetis versus Department of Housing
Commission of New South Wales (Supreme Court of NSW, Barr J, 16 June 1997, unreported)
On 2 June 1997, the defendant commenced proceedings (11648 of 1997) claiming contraventions by the Department "or its personnel named in the affidavits" in respect of ss 101, [249C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s249c.html), 375, 393 and [545B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s545b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The defendant swore an affidavit dated 2 June 1997 in support of the Summons in which he named four individuals as personnel of the Department as having committed the offences against the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) as alleged in the Summons. At the conclusion of a short hearing on 16 June 1997 at which the Department was represented and the defendant appeared in person, Barr J, sitting as the applications list judge, dismissed the summons on the basis that the orders contained therein sought the Court to "commence, or make orders facilitating the commencement of, criminal proceedings against the persons named in the affidavit". The defendant was ordered to pay the Department's costs. 
The plaintiff submits that the proceedings were vexatious on the basis that they were commenced without reasonable grounds and for the purposes of harassing or annoying officers of the Department. In considering this submission, and as discussed above, I am entitled to have regard to any relevant observations of Barr J and the conduct of the defendant during the proceedings. So far as the defendant's conduct is concerned, there is nothing either in the judgment or the transcript of the proceedings which indicates that the defendant's behaviour during the course of the proceedings was inappropriate. Relevantly, and as noted by Barr J, the proceedings arose from the same circumstances which gave rise to proceedings 13455 of 1996 and which were determined by Dunford J. During the course of the hearing Barr J made the following enquiries with the defendant - "His Honour: Do the matters raised in your present summons arise out of the circumstances which gave rise to the previous action? [Defendant]: I mention it because simply maybe a continuation of the dispute, sir. I may be subject of a grudge.
 ...

His Honour: Why should I make these orders...? [Defendant]: Is matter of justice, sir. I want conviction and compensation and
I am sixth time in the Supreme Court and five times in the [Tribunal]. I am 57 years old, I have intellectual and spiritual matters and I have more to do with my time than disputing with frivolous people and taking your time in the court." 
Court of Appeal Proceedings - 40361 of 1997
On 19 June 1997 the defendant filed a Notice of Appeal (proceedings number 40361 of 1997) in respect of the decision of Barr J of 16 June 1997 on the grounds: first, Barr J "erred in law in the findings of fact made therein these not being open to be found on the evidence presented"; and second, in the alternative, that Barr J "was biased and the judgment as a consequence is unsafe and unsound". The defendant sought orders setting aside the judgment and associated costs order and remitting the matter for hearing or, in the alternative, the substitution of the Court of Appeal's own "findings for those of His Honour Justice Barr." 
By judgment dated 8 September 1998 (Rouvinetis versus Department of Housing Commission of New South Wales [[1998] NSWCA 197]) the Court of Appeal, comprising Mason P, Sheller JA and Fitzgerald AJA, dismissed the appeal with costs. On the first ground of the appeal the Court found that Barr J had made no findings of fact and on the second, that there was no evidence to support the allegation of bias, the court stating "the allegation is patently without foundation." At the conclusion of the judgment, Fitzgerald AJA with whom (Mason P and Sheller JA agreed) stated: "[t]he relief claimed by the [defendant] in his summons is legally incomprehensible. He seeks a determination against the respondent that it "or its personnels" have to answer charges against various sections of the [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). That is not a matter which is justiciable between the appellant and the respondent in a civil proceeding in the Common Law Division." 
The Crown correctly submits that the appeal was a vexatious proceeding, having been commenced without reasonable grounds.
I turn to consider the defendant's conduct in the proceeding. Correspondence between the Court and the defendant indicates that the defendant acted inappropriately towards Court staff in respect of the proceedings. In a letter to the defendant dated 8 August 1997 the Registrar of the Court of Appeal wrote to the defendant in response the defendant's letter of 7 August 1997 in which he observed - "I note that you attended the Registry prior to the appointment and demanded that a registry officer prepare your draft appeal index. Quite correctly the
Registry Officer refused to do this.
 ...

Your attitude at the appointment (and your subsequent attendances at the
Registry) make this a difficult task. I did attempt to discuss certain problems which I believed your appeal had but you were in no way receptive. I also attempted to explain what would happen next but again you continually interrupted me. I am not in my own mind sure that your appeal is competent, but in light of your attitude I have decided to allow the appeal to proceed at your own risk.

You have on the 2 occasions I have met you displayed aggressive discourtesy to me and the Court. I also note that you have also been discourteous to Registry staff who have only been trying to do their jobs according to the rules and the procedures of the Court. Please, display appropriate courtesy to the Court and the Registry staff in the future conduct of this case."
In a letter to the Court dated 8 September 1997, the defendant wrote complaining that, when he sought a written acknowledgment that submissions made by him had been filed, the person at the counter "stamped the documents but refused to sign". I set out the defendant's letter in extenso to demonstrate the quite typical style and method of his submissions displayed in one way or another in many proceedings in which he has been engaged. His letter (in upper case) said - "I INSISTED THAT DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TO COURT ARE NOT LOVE BILLET DOUX AND
MUST BE RESPECTED, SIGNED PROPERLY AS DUTY, RULES, FORMALITY AND ETIQUETTE
REQUIRE, IN PARTICULAR THOSE TO BE ADDRESSED AND USED BY THE NATIONAL
AUTHORITY.

MY INSISTENCE PAID NO DIVIDENDS AND I GOT THE PICTURE.THAT MY INSTRUCTION AND
ADVICES INSTEAD OF BEING APPRECIATED RAISED AN UNBEARABLE CONFRONTATIONAL
LEVEL.

WISHING TO COMPLETE MY TASK SUCCESSFULLY I ASKED TO SEE THE REGISTRAR STEPHEN
JUPP WHO I HAD THE HONOUR TO SEE ONLY TWO DAYS EARLIER UNDER PECULIAR
CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE PERSONNEL ENGAGED TO AN ARGUMENT WITH ME INSTEAD OF SIGNING THE DOCUMENTS
AND RETORTED ANGRILY THAT THE REGISTRAR WAS NOT AVAILABLE ATTENDING AN
INTERVIEW.

DETERMINED I SAID THAT "I AM NOT GOING IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT SIGNED AND YOU
WILL HAVE TO CALL THE SHERIFF OR THE POLICE TO REMOVE ME." 
THE PERSONNEL IN MENTION TOOK THE DOCUMENTS AND WENT INTO AN OFFICE WITHIN MY
VISUAL RANGE AND REMAINED ABOUT TEN MIUNTES OF WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE THE
TIME OF PERUSAL OF THE DOCUMENTS BY SOMEONE IN THAT OFFICE, THEN REAPPEARED
WITH ANOTHER FEMALE LOOKING LIKE INDIVIDUAL.

THE NEWLY ARRIVED INDIVIDUAL WHICH I VIEW AS SUPERIOR TO THE DESK CLERK SHOWED
A CONFRONTATIONAL INITIATIVE BY ENTERING THE FRAY BY SAYING: "I WILL PUT MY
INITIALS ON THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT AND IF IT EVER GOES TO COURT, I WILL BE ABLE
TO RECOGNIZE IT'".

I STARED WITH INCREDULITY AND I TOOK THE IRRATIONALITY OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AS
AN AFFRONT AND NEARLY TAKE TO THE EDGE.
 "YOU PEOPLE HERE. YOU DEFY LOGIC BY SPEECH AND CONTACT, THE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT
INTERESTED AND NO ONE WILL CARE LESS IF YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR INITIALS OR NOT,
WHAT IS OF CONCERN THAT WHOEVER DEALS WITH DOCUMENTS MUST BE SURE AND HAVE
CLEAR PICTURE AS TO THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN DEALING OR HANDLING THE
DOCUMENTS".

THAT IS WHAT I SAID AND UPON THAT THE INDIVIDUAL TURNED AND WENT AWAY WITH THE
MIEN OF A DIVA.

I NEARLY HAD APOPLEXY, I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANYBODY AND NEVER GIVEN THE RIGHT
TO BE TREATED WITH CONTEMPT AND INSOLENCE BUT THAT WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON
OF WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO DISCOVER.

LOOKING AT THE INITIALS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL MY MEMORY PICTORIALLY RECALLED THE
INITIALS APPEARING ON LETTER SENT TO ME BY THE REGISTRY OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED
COURT, THE 16/7/1997 FOR WHICH I HAD MADE A LOT OF FUSS IN MY ATTEMPT TO
LOCATE THE SENDER.

IN THE STEPS TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THAT LETTER I HAD QUESTIONED THE
RECEPTION DESK CLERK WHO HAD DENIED TO KNOW TO WHOM BELONGED THAT UNREADABLE
SCRIBBLE POSING ON THE LETTER AND NOW I WAS DISCOVERING THAT SHE WAS WORKING
IN THE SAME OFFICE WITH THE SCRIBBLER AND AS A MATTER OF FACT WAS HER
CONTROLLING OFFICER.

I FELT A HELPLESS STATE OF ANGER AND I THOUGHT THAT MAY FOOLS, UNABLE TO SEE

WILSON AND OWING THE RANK OF OFFICE OF THE FELLOW INVOLVED TANTAMOUNT TO

High Court Proceedings - S49 of 1999
On 20 April 1999 the defendant filed an application in the Sydney Registry of the High Court seeking special leave to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal of 8 September 1998. The order sought related only to the "order of paying costs". The grounds of appeal were as follows - "THE SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT OF APPEAL WERE INAPPROPRIATE AND THE SUBSEQUENT
DISMISSAL STANDS AS AN ERROR IN LAW AND FACTS.

JUSTICE ACT 1902 CLAUSE 60(2) ... THE JUDGE TO WHOM BEFORE COMES
INFORMATION OR COMPLAIN WOULD CONSIDER TO REFER IT TO MEDIATION UNDER [COMMUNITY JUSTICE CENTRE
ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/cjca284/) OF 1983 
CLAUSE 80(a) CONSIDERATION TO THE MEANS OF PAYMENT 
CLAUSE 81(B) THE PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY MY WERE WITH GOOD REASON IN
FAITH TO JUDICIARY AND WITH GOOD MANNER, ACTION WHICH WAS COMPELLED BY SELF
PROTECTION AS I WAS ENDURING A PROLONGED AND ACRIMONIOUS DISPUTE WITH POWERFUL
AND MALPRACTICING DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNELS.

IN FACTS THE ERRORS STAND THAT MATERIAL EVIDENCE WHICH PAINFULLY COMPILED AND
PRESENTED WAS NEVER VIEWED 
ALSO THAT MY SUBMISSIONS TO THE APPEAL W3ERE INEFFICIENT OWING TO MY IGNORANCE
OF LEGAL TECHNICALITIES AND THOUGH IT CAME TO THE JUDGE NOTICE IT WAS NOT
TAKEN TO CONSIDFERATON OR TO ATTENTION."
The defendant also filed an application for an extension of time for bringing his application for special leave and an "Applicant's Summary" in which he articulated the reasons for his application - "I can not think of any questions raised by my appeal against the Supreme
Court Costs Order, though it seems to be incomprehensible to be asked costs when the responded despite the panoply of unaccountability possess a full legal representation by the state, besides I want to stress as a good subject
I would have never entered in dispute with the representatives no matter what injustice if it was not for my own safety."
The defendant also made the following remarks in the summary in respect of the costs order made by the Court of Appeal: "Here I am compelled to repeat that I am unable to pay as I am penniless but I assure you with no malice, under sense of principals even I had monies I would have never paid costs to well defendant departmental personnel who under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) I was brought up and educated would have never escaped the criminal charges."
The High Court file records that a submitting appearance was filed on 18 October 1999, although a copy of this document was not contained with the plaintiff's bundle, and a "draft index" was filed on 3 November 1999. The file records that the matter was "deemed abandoned" on 15 December 1999. An affidavit of Michael Callen sworn 18 October 2000 filed in the matter of Rouvinetis versus Department of Housing Commission of New South Wales proceedings number 12497 of 2000, which was included in the plaintiff's bundle, indicates on 18 November 1999 the defendant requested that the proceedings be discontinued. The Crown submits that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds. 
Supreme Court Proceedings - 13522 of 1997 and 13523 of 1997
On 22 December 1997 the defendant commenced proceedings (1352 of 1997) in this Court against the "Minister of Officer of Ministry of Urban Affairs and Planning" and the "Minister for Ministry for Housing". The defendant claimed that the "Minister or the Ministry has to answer charges in accordance" with offences against ss 14, 15, [347](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s347.html) and [351](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s351.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) and [s 43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psma1988235/s43.html) of the [Public Sector Management Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/psma1988235/) (now repealed) (PSM Act). The defendant filed an affidavit in support of the summons in which the he alleged that the "Minister or Ministry" had committed acts "tantamount to treason" and against the "Government of the Sovereign" as well as breaches of duties said to be owed under the PSM Act. 
On the same day the defendant filed a Summons (13523 of 1997) alleging that the "Department of Housing Commission of N.S.W or its personnels have to answer" charges against ss 14, [154](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s154.html), [160](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s160.html), [347](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s347.html) and [351](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s351.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). In an affidavit filed in support the defendant repeated the allegations in the Summons, which he identified as including "fraudulent abstraction of electricity", "embezzlement by persons in the public service" and, "abettors and misdemeanour". The Department filed a Notice of Appearance in these proceedings. 
Both matters were listed before Bruce J on 16 February 1998, his Honour directing the defendant to file pleadings in accordance with the Rules within 28 days and directing the defendants to the proceedings to write to the defendant and inform him of the orders made. The transcript records that the matter was determined in the absence of the defendant, the defendants to the proceedings being represented, and that he approached the Court at approximately 1 pm and was informed by Bruce J that he was not in Court at the time the matter was reached. The defendant said that he was present and was informed by Bruce J of the orders which had been made. In so far as the conduct of the defendant is concerned on that occasion, the transcript indicates that the defendant was, for the most part, polite and courteous to his Honour. The Court record indicates that the matters were not listed again until 17 March 2000 before Kirby J although the file, so far as it has been provided by the plaintiff, is devoid of any record of those proceedings. A letter from the defendant dated 9 December 1999 and addressed to the Court indicates that the defendant was advised by the Court by way of letter dated 30 November 1999 that both sets of proceedings were to be dismissed for want of prosecution. 
The plaintiff submits that the proceedings were vexatious as they were commenced without reasonable grounds and commenced and conducted in a way so as to harass and annoy the Department. 
Residential Tenancies proceedings - 98/25379
On 11 August 1998 the Department filed an application (98/25379) in the Tribunal seeking an order against the defendant that he "stop breaking a Tenancy agreement". The application states the reasons for the order as being that the defendant "has been in a (sic) a beach of the Tenancy Agreement" and that there "has been a long history of this tenant behaving irresponsibly." The matter was listed for hearing on 27 August 1998 and subsequently adjourned on two separate occasions. The plaintiff did not adduce any evidence as to the reasons for the adjournments. The matter was heard on 16 October 1998, the Tribunal dismissing the application on the basis that the material placed before it did not support a finding necessary to make the order sought. 
The plaintiff does not submit that the proceeding itself was vexatious but rather that the conduct of the defendant during the proceeding constituted vexatious conduct, namely that the issuing of summonses to appear to five officers of the Department by the Tribunal at the request of the defendant was for the purpose of harassing or annoying those departmental officers. The officers summonsed were J. Pratter, M. Modder, H. Domaradzka, G. Stringer and A. Esteban. In a letter to the Department dated 2 October 1998 addressed to the Department which enclosed the summonses, the defendant noted: "Also my additional request for those personnnels up on appearance of the hearing the 16/10/1998 in the premises of the address 20/26 O,Connell str
Sydney to produce duty lists and Job specifications."
In notices signed by the defendant and addressed to individual officers and accompanying the summonses he requested each officer to produce the "duty list and job specifications" to "facilitate questioning", "to enable to establish (sic) breaches or malpractice which may initiate further action against your person" and to "polarize accountability". 
Supreme Court proceedings 20212 of 1999
On 19 April 1999 the defendant filed a statement of claim (20212 of 1999) in this Court naming the department as the defendant, claiming "compensation of $25,000 for the covering of costs and injury" and damages. The statement of claim alleged that the defendant had been "subjected by personnels of the [Department] to malicious prosecution", "intent to injury", "conspiracy with interfering with selecting witnesses and ignoring ones supporting the plaintiff", "actions taken against the [defendant] in a bad manner and faith..." and "malicious slander". In a document entitled "Extension of Pleading" the defendant disclosed the facts and circumstances which were relied upon in respect of each allegation. In so far as the allegation of malicious prosecution is concerned, it appears that it relates to the Department's application to terminate the defendant's tenancy in Tribunal (proceedings 98/25379). In support of the allegations "intent to injury" and "malicious slander", the defendant alleges that included in the Department's file in respect of him is a document which "states that I have been charged for stabbing staff at Waterloo" despite him never having been charged with such an offence. The plaintiff tendered a copy of that document before me. It provides (inter alia) "[h]e [the defendant] has been charged with stabbing staff at Waterloo office has unsuccessfully attempted to instigate Supreme Court action." He relies upon a document contained within the same file in which, so he contends, it is admitted that "tenants stood to my support and witnesses were selected and incited though they were not living in proximity to my unit" in respect of an allegation that he has been the subject to discrimination. A copy of that document was tendered by the plaintiff before me. It provides: "[I]t seems however that we do not have evidence because the two people who complained do not want to fill in witness reports. The others, supported [the defendant]. It seems to be [a] personal thing." He contends that the Department "acted for three years unjustly against my person", a reference to the actions brought by the Department to terminate his tenancy agreement in the Tribunal, in support of his allegation of "action of bad manner and faith". 
The defendant filed lengthy submissions. Whilst they provide an account of his contact with persons, whom he contends were representatives of the Department, and the proceedings between him and the Department in the Tribunal and this Court they are confused and to a degree incomprehensible, and include allegations of improper conduct and self-aggrandising statements. An example of the latter is the following - "I am sick and tired I can argue and alienate people they do not come back but
I am coming to meet and those people of the likes of me trying to establish rationality in this world humanity has seen plenty and has got a gut full of them to the extent that whenever they reappear they will be crucified."
Between October 1999 and March 2000 the Registry of this Court and solicitors representing the Department wrote to the defendant advising him of deficiencies of his pleadings. On 3 December 1999 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion in this Court seeking (inter alia) the defendant's statement of claim be dismissed or, in the alternative that the proceedings stayed until the plaintiff satisfied the "outstanding" costs orders made in proceedings 90268 of 1999 and 90269 of 1999. The motion was heard by Master Malpass on 29 February 2000 and on 9 March 2000 the Master gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff dismissing the (present) defendant's proceedings and directing him to pay the costs of the proceedings and the motion. In his judgment Master Malpass observed - "[5] The proceedings have been the subject of Differential Case Management.
The need for amendment has been brought to the attention of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has been given leave to amend the process. He has not taken advantage of that opportunity. Indeed, he takes the approach that he does not intend to amend it.
 [6] The proceedings follow on other proceedings involving the parties. The plaintiff manifests very strong feelings towards the defendant and see these proceedings as inter alia a vehicle to rectify what he sees a past injustice...
 [9] In his submissions, the application was vigorously opposed by the plaintiff. His presentation was both volatile and offensive.
 [10] I carefully listened to those submissions. Perhaps because he may have regarded his task as hopeless, he did not address the real issues thrown up by this application. Rather, he used the occasion as a forum to vent his views of the defendant." 
The Master concluded - "[15] As things presently stand, the plaintiff has brought a clearly defective process which he does not intend to amend. Accordingly, the proceedings are doomed to failure. In my view, there is an abuse of process, which would itself justify a dismissal of proceedings. Be that as it may, there are even more serious problems.
 [16] The process fails to disclose any reasonable cause of action. The process identifies five areas as "Facts Pleaded"...At best this material can be regarded as no more than either allegations pertaining to causes of action not known to the law or allegations pertaining to causes of action which have no relevant to the circumstances of this case."
The plaintiff submits that the proceedings were vexatious as they were commenced without reasonable grounds and commenced and conducted so as to harass and annoy the Department. I accept this submission.

Local Court proceedings - 15350/99/198
On 24 June 1999 the defendant commenced a private criminal prosecution in the Local Court at Waverly naming Mr Michael Modder as the defendant. The summons and information issued alleged that in November 1997 Mr Modder, being an employee of the Department, issued contrary to [s 337](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s337.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), a false instrument, namely a briefing note, which contained a statement that the defendant had been charged by police with stabbing an officer of the Department of Housing. It appears that the briefing note was the same document upon which the defendant relied in his claim against the Department in proceeding 20212 of 1999 in this Court. By letter dated 3 September 1999 to the Clerk of the Local Court at Waverly the Director of Public Prosecutions declined to take over the prosecution.
The matter was heard by Garbett LCM in the Local Court at Waverly on 1 November 1999. The defendant appeared in person and Mr Fordham appeared for Mr Mooder. After some discussion between the defendant and the Magistrate, the defendant gave evidence that he located the briefing note in the Department's file in respect of him. He sought to tender the document, however Mr Fordham objected on the basis that its provenance had not been proved. While the objection was not formally upheld the defendant was excused after an exchange between him and Garbett LCM, part of which I have extracted as it is relevant to the question of the conduct of the defendant during the course of the proceeding - "[Magistrate]. Sir have you got any further evidence of proof relating to [Defendant]. You go to be joking.

Q. Have you got anything? If you haven't well -- 
A. Well we going to another court, we go higher up.

Q. I'm not going to spend all day on it? 
A. Yes we go higher up then, we go to District Court.

Q. Okay. Do you have anything further you want to say? 
A. No I have said what I have to say."
The defendant having concluded his evidence, Mr Fordham made a no prima facie case submission, which was upheld, and the matter was dismissed with costs awarded against the defendant. 
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious, having been commenced without reasonable grounds and commenced and conducted so as to annoy or harass Mr Modders and the Department. 
District Court proceeding - DC 99/12/1420
On 15 November 1999 the defendant filed a Notice of Appeal to District Court commencing proceeding 99/12/1420 (appeal no. 67/99) against the costs order made against him in the Waverly Local Court on 1 November 1999. The appeal was heard and upheld by Payne DCJ on 22 February 2000, the costs order being quashed. 
The plaintiff does not contend that these proceedings were vexatious. 
Residential Tribunal proceeding - RT 00/23881
The plaintiff tendered a decision of the Residential Tribunal in Rouvinetis versus Department of Housing <case> (8 May 2001). It did not contend that the proceeding was vexatious. While the decision itself is relevant, the reasons do not criticise the defendant's conduct of the case in a relevant sense.

NSW Administrative Decisions Tribunal - ADT 13010/2000
On 16 August 2000 the defendant lodged a Freedom of Information Application with the Department pursuant to the [Freedom of Information Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/) seeking production of materials contained in his "tenancy file" maintained by the Department. By determinations on 18 November 2000 and 27 June 2001 the Department released documents, either in whole or in part, pursuant to the defendant's request, and claimed exemptions in relation to certain other documents. The details of the application and exemptions are not presently relevant, suffice to say that the defendant was not satisfied with the production and, on 22 January 2001, after an exchange of correspondence between him and the Department, he filed an application for review of decision with the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (ADT). 
The defendant's application progressed through the ADT and was heard by his Honour Judge O'Connor, the President of the ADT, on 2 July 2001. After the release on 27 June 2001 the number of documents disputed was reduced to 105. The applicant appeared in person and Mr Fordham appeared for the Department. On 3 October 2001 his Honour published his reasons (Evangelos Rouvinetis versus Director General, Department of Housing <case>, which "varied" the decision of the Department and granted access to part or whole of some 11 documents over which the Department had claimed an exemption. 
Whilst the plaintiff does not contend that the proceeding in the ADT was vexatious, it does point to the observations made by Judge O'Connor in respect of the conduct of the defendant during the course of the proceedings - "[25] I note that in the lengthy written submissions filed by the applicant, and in his oral submissions at planning meetings and the hearing, much of which were irrelevant and expressed with great anger and aggression, he frequently made the following points: that as the file to which he sought access was about him he was entitled to see everything on it, and that the 'personal affairs' exemption was not relevant as he had not had any personal affairs with anyone.
 [26] These are misunderstandings of the relevant law." 
Supreme Court proceeding - 12497 of 2000
On 22 September 2000 the defendant commenced proceeding (12497 of 2000) in this Court claiming that the Department and or "its personnnels M. Moodder and J. Pratter" have to "answer global charges". The summons alleged: M. Modder had committed perjury contrary to the "Criminal Proceedings Act 1986...section 78"; "conspiracy committed by personal J. Pratter, M.Modder and a third party...name Beverly Grant..."; and "malicious prosecution with injury to repute by [J. Pratter and M. Modder] implicating B Grant." He filed an undated affidavit by him with the summons. The affidavit indicates that the allegation of perjury arises from statements made by Mr Pratter during examination by the defendant before the Tribunal (proceedings RT 00/23881). In particular, it is alleged that his response to the question put to him by the defendant as to why the card giving him, the defendant, access to the car park of the residential building he resided at had been cancelled, "because you did not have a car" was "a lie...provide by the file note of the Department...found in [the defendants] tenancy records". The allegation concerning malicious prosecution appears for, the most part, to relate to the issue of the access card. The balance of the affidavit is incomprehensible.
A copy of a "complaint and summons" tendered by the plaintiff indicates that an application for, what was then an apprehended violence order was made by Ms Beverly Grant, who is named in the summons and the affidavit filed by the defendant, in respect of the defendant. The grounds for complaint disclose that the defendant had been "harassing and intimidating" Ms Grant and that (inter alia) her car had been vandalised "whilst locked in a secure car park to which only tenants have access." The damage to Ms Grant's car led the Department to conduct an audit of access cards to the building car park and the defendant being informed that his access card would be cancelled if he did not provide the Department with the details of his cards. A letter from the defendant to department dated 4 May 1998 indicates that his access cards were indeed cancelled. It appears that the complaints contained in the summons stem from these events. 
It appears that the matter came before Hidden J on 23 and 24 October 2000. On 24 October 2000 the Department was granted leave to file in court a notice of motion seeking the proceeding to be dismissed along with an affidavit in support. The matter was dismissed and the defendant order to pay the Departments costs. In dismissing the proceeding his Honour made the following observations: "Put shortly, the summons asks me to launch criminal proceedings against two officers of the Department and a lady who apparently lives in the same block of units as the plaintiff.
 ...

This is by no means the first time the plaintiff has initiated proceedings of one kind or another against the Department and/or its officers...It is sufficient to say that on several prior occasions the plaintiff has filed summonses in the court seeking relief of fairly much the same kind as that which he now seeks.
 ...

As I have already said, the relief the plaintiff seeks is not relief which this Court can grant. The initiating of criminal proceedings is not a matter for this Court. If he wishes to pursue criminal proceedings then he must take the appropriate course to do so. The summons seeks relief which this Court has no power to grant. For that reason it is dismissed."
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable ground and to annoy or harass the Department and continued an abuse of process. 
Residential Tribunal proceeding - RT 21672/2001
The plaintiff tendered the reasons for decision of Member Balding in Rouvinetis versus NSW Land & Housing Corporation  <case> (3 December 2001). No other material was tendered by the plaintiff in respect of the proceeding. It submitted that the "having regard to the nature of the allegations, and the evidentiary findings and ultimate conclusions of Member Balding, this was a vexatious proceeding commenced without reasonable grounds and to annoy or harass the Department." They do not point to any particular part of the judgment in so submitting. 
The summary of this proceeding is drawn from the reasons of Member Balding. 
On 22 May 2001 the defendant filed an application in the Tribunal seeking orders that "agents personnel abide by the Tribunal's decision of 16-10-200 - 00/23881", "personnel do not persistently violate the tenancy agreement (Clause 8.5), that such persons contact the defendant by "registered mail" and not "again trespass and come banging on the door of my unit." Shortly put, the grounds upon which the application were made related to attempts by persons, alleged to be "personnel of the agent", to contact the defendant by attending upon his unit. 
The reasons of Member Balding explain, to my mind, that the proceedings were indeed unreasonably brought by the defendant without a proper basis. The evidence he relied on, so far from supporting his case, demonstrated that the Department had not been in breach of its obligations under the lease; quite the contrary.

Residential Tribunal proceeding RT 01/61752
On 11 December 2001 the Department lodged an application (RT01/61752) seeking orders, in substance, for the payment of arrears of rent of $716. On 30 January 2002 the Tribunal made orders (inter alia) requiring the defendant to pay the Department the amount of $117.60 "for subsidised rent owed under the terms of the residential tenancy agreement" and to pay rent for the future in accordance with the terms of the tenancy agreement. 
The plaintiff submits that during the course of the proceeding the defendant applied to have summonses to attend issued by the Tribunal to two Departmental officers. The defendant stated that the reasons for seeking to have the summonses issued were - "Both witnesses must appear for questioning hearing duty lists and job specifications of the office they were holding for actions committed to exhibits of the respondents submission and for which they will be questions.

Duty lists and job specifications are imperative to be produced not only for to indicate responsibility or to polarize questioning but to establish liability and grounds of it which may lay basis of compensation claims for which the questioning shall focus."
In a discursive follow-up letter the defendant claimed that the witnesses were required - "to establish liability on grounds which may support future actions to other hearings for compensation of injury and damages inflicted as already has charged criminally other agents of the defendant." 
Amongst his complaints was that one of the witnesses had "without ringing the bell, comes three floors up to place a card visit in my room without using my letter box". Other allegations of trespass are made because a letter as to back rent was stuck on his door instead of being placed in his letter box. He claimed that these actions were - "[a] serious violation of my safety, security and privacy as the agent never made me aware of that invasion by coming unannounced and unexpected forced me to issue by a letter of the same day a complaint against the agent in the department".
In my view it is clear that the purpose of the summonses was to attempt to press baseless claims as part of the defendant's campaign against the Department and its employees. 
Residential Tribunal proceeding - RT02/02987
On 1 February 2002 the plaintiff lodged an application for a rehearing with the Tribunal in respect of the orders made by it in proceeding RT01/61752. It appears the defendant sought the rehearing on the basis that not all the documents submitted by him in the proceeding were considered by the member and that the member erred in hearing the matter outside of the "30 days as prescribed by the Act." The defendant also complained that the Department did not provide him with copies of evidence at the hearing of the matter. 
On 4 February 2002 the application was refused "as the delegate of the Chairperson was not satisfied that the applicant may have suffered substantial injustice." The written reasons of the delegate state "[b]oth parties were present at the hearing and had an opportunity to put their evidence to the Tribunal. It appears the member considered the evidence and made a determination based on findings relying on that evidence." 
This proceeding was made without reasonable grounds or was otherwise vexatious.

Residential Tribunal proceeding - RT 02/03538
On 7 February 2002 the defendant lodged another application (RT01/61752) for rehearing in respect of the orders made by it in the proceeding. Consistently with the complaints raised in the application lodged on 1 February 2002, the defendant contended that the presiding member failed to have regard to the evidence that the defendant relied upon, he "went to accounts beyond 30 days specified by the Rules(3)", and he failed to provide the defendant with access to the documents upon which the Department relied upon. 
On 8 February 2002 the defendant's application for rehearing was dismissed. The written reasons of the Tribunal state - "I cannot reach any conclusion different from the previous determination of /2/02 of the Section 63 application.

The applicant had his submissions and evidence considered by the Tribunal. It appears that all matters raised by him at the hearing were considered.

The Member's decision was made in the light of the evidence before him."
The plaintiff submits that the application was vexatious as an abuse of process, given the dismissal of the previous rehearing application only days before, and was commenced without reasonable grounds. I agree.

Supreme Court proceeding - 30011/02
On 14 February 2002 the defendant flied a summons (30011 of 2002) in this Court seeking that the proceeding in RT01/61752 to be reheard and "if possible by a member of this Court as the plaintiffs [presumably a reference to the defendant] suspicious that the defendants are engaged to corruption and collusion." The summons pleaded that the orders of the Tribunal were "unsound" and a "violating of the rules under section 63 of the Residential Tribunal Act." The defendant also filed an affidavit sworn by him and in support of the summons on the same date. The affidavit is, for the most part, incomprehensible. Suffice to say that it contains a "chronology" relating to the payment of the defendant's rent and repeats the allegations contained in the summons together with the following - "Most disturbing and upsetting is that the hearing of the case 01/61725 of /01/2002 tells me that my rent credit of over $91.00 has disappeared without reason without explanation and without recorded action and that is why I raise that case in the court and I add by saying "no one can afford thin skin under the defunct constitution and if my suspicion are correct the agents of the applicant apart of their shoddy actions and contracts, for which I have submitted with dignity and courage two "2" different deposition to the I.C.A.C those agents under the unaccountability of the Crown they may not only have got away with murder rape and theft, against the needy and vulnerable members of the constituency are to serve but their accounts section may have got to misappropriation of funds amounting to an embezzlement of millions, perhaps, against the trusty and needy members of the constituency.

And I say to the Court if I found my suspicions founded as I am a man of calibre and intellect there will be no peace on earth for these people."
The Department filed a notice of appearance on 14 March 2002 and the Tribunal filed a submitting appearance on 27 May 2002. An affidavit of Michael Callen was filed by the Department on 14 May 2002 as to the history of the proceedings in the Tribunal and the procedure of the Department in relation to rental increases and claims for rental subsidies. On 21 May 2002 the defendant filed an affidavit in response to Mr Callen's affidavit. That affidavit contains a number of relevant dates and references to documents together with statements such as - "As for the falsification of dates and utter disregard to communication and punctuality is chicken feed for this people who they have highjacked the public machinery and hold the colonial state at ransom by the unaccountability of a sovereign who is nowhere to be found and are liable to lead it, instead of nationhood to doomhood and the courts and the tribunals have to understand that we are bound to common garment of destiny and no decent state can exist without accountability and equality in front of the law and we can not frustrate processes or victimize rouvinetises for to protect domarazakases [Departmental employee] State is and means more than that" [There follows a reference to the finding of the Tribunal that he was in arrears of rent of $117.64, though he claimed never to have stopped paying his rent and, despite different claims made by the Department - ] "[let] me unravel the wizardry of the residential tribunal which I do have charged criminally in this court which has overturned past rulings and has convinced me that the residential tribunal and its members have been successfully transposed without Alice in the Wonderland by stupidity or corruption and see what they eat but want to eat what they see."
The matter came before Foster AJ for hearing on 24 October 2002. The defendant appeared in person while Mr Jungwirth of counsel represented the Department. At the hearing before Foster AJ, the Department was granted leave to file a further affidavit of Mr Callen. On 28 October 2002 his Honour gave judgment dismissing the defendant's summons with no order as to costs (Evangelos Rouvinetis versus Residential Tribunal & Anor <case> His Honour made a number of observations regarding the nature of the defendant's application - "[3] A lot of that material was couched in emotional and somewhat colourful language. It was clear that [the defendant] was indeed aggrieved by the decision of the Residential Tribunal against which he was seeking to appeal and also by what he conceived to be sinister and conspiratorial conduct on the part of officers of the [Department], who had the responsibility of administering his subsidised rental payments in respect of the residence occupied by him as tenant from the second defendant. It is a matter for regret that he has these suspicions. I trust that when he reflects upon the matter further, he will come to realise that they are misconceived.
 [4] I felt that Mr Rouvinetis was not entirely clear as to the nature of the proceedings he had brought. From some of the material in his affidavits and from statements he made in Court, I gained the impression that he thought he was bringing some sort of criminal proceedings, related to the making of the
Tribunal of the order in respect of which he was complaining."
In dismissing the defendant's application his Honour stated - "[14] ...the only concern of this Court is whether a relevant error of law has been demonstrated. There has been no such demonstration. I should add, in this regard, that [the defendant] claimed breached of what he described as r63. I have been unable to determine what was meant by this assertion, nor was [the defendant] able to explain it to me.
 [15] As to the assertion of denial of natural justice. I am not able to detect any substance in this claim. It is clear that specific orders were made by the
Tribunal for the furnishing of the material to which I have made reference.
This was furnished to the Tribunal. [The defendant] also handed to the
Tribunal documents upon which he relied...I can see nothing which would indicate that he did not receive a fair and impartial hearing."
I accept the plaintiff's submission that the proceeding was commenced without reasonable grounds. Moreover, as the transcript demonstrated, the defendant was unable or unwilling to focus on the nature of the jurisdiction he had invoked, despite the assistance attempted by the judge.

Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 02/48230
On 19 November 2002 the defendant lodged an application (02/48230) with the Tribunal for the Department to "stop breaching the tenancy agreement" and that it "fix the gas stove." The application came on for hearing on 6 December 2002 before Member Moore and was dismissed. In dismissing the application, Mr Moore found that the contractors engaged by the Department had attended the defendant's premises in response to his complaints regarding the stove but had been prevented undertaking repairs "because of the unreasonable conditions that the [defendant] seeks to impose upon the Department['s]...contractors in entering the premises." He also noted that "[d]uring the hearing the applicant consistently refused to agree to reasonable arrangements for access to the premises" and that he was "not willing to modify his demands in order to permit a contractor to carry out any repairs...", concluding that by his conduct the defendant was "not entitled to claim the Department...has breached its obligations..."
The plaintiff tendered letters from the defendant to the Tribunal dated 3 and 13 December 2002. The letter of 3 December had the effect of inviting the Tribunal to transfer the matter for determination to a court under <case> of the CTTT Act "if you think that you may not be able to [give] a proper hearing for the case." The apparent reasons for the transfer were that the defendant did not trust the "personnel registrars or members" as he was in "possession of evidence that [the Tribunal] have engaged to conspiracies with the [Department]..." In addition the defendant foreshadowed further litigation, stating " [a]s more actions appear to be in store and I act unrepresented against the might of government agents and my health severely tried and battered I can afford no carelessness as a result of that endless dispute I live in my tenement under siege and that has to end." It does not appear, at least from the documents tendered by the plaintiff, that the Tribunal responded to the letter. The letter of 13 December, which is addressed to Mr Moore and is of some length, made complaint of Mr Moore's decision and catalogued matters which the defendant sought to reagitate.
It is plain from the Member's reasons that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds. 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 03/48426
On 14 November 2003 the defendant lodged an application with the Tribunal for orders that the Department "stop breaching the clause (6) (6.1) (6.2) of the tenancy Agreement." The basis for the application was that the defendant's "privacy" was being disturbed by other residents, whom he described as "persons mentally disturbed", of the unit block in which he resided. The defendant subsequently applied to withdraw the application on the same day as lodgement and it was withdrawn by the Tribunal on 20 November 2003.
Having regard to the withdrawal, I do not intend to take this matter into account. 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 04/05747
On 5 February 2004 the defendant filed an application (04/05747) for orders that the Department (referred to as the agent) and its personnel not "breach clauses 17.2-17.3 of the tenancy agreement" and "the return of a sensor card." On 20 February 2004 the Tribunal made orders, with the consent of the Department, that the Department provide the defendant a "second security card" and otherwise dismissing the application which, in substance, claimed that the Departmental officers on the premises without giving notice to the tenants were trespassers. In dismissing the application the Tribunal noted that it "is not satisfied (at the civil standard of proof) that the grounds required to make the orders sought have been [established]." 
The statement of the matter dismissed is enough to establish that it was vexatious. I note also that, when the defendant was asked to pay for a transcript of the proceedings in accordance with the prescribed fees, he responded with an insulting and abusive letter. His conduct in this respect was deliberately designed to harass and annoy. 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 04/12552
On 9 March 2004 the defendant lodged an application to enforce the order made by the Tribunal on 20 February 2004 requiring the Department to provide the defendant with a sensor card. The Department filed evidence indicating that it had attempted to arrange for the defendant to collect the sensor card from its office, as it required him to sign an acknowledgment of receipt. The matter was heard on 26 March 2004 and the application dismissed as the card was provided to the defendant at the hearing. The Tribunal found that the card had not been received by the defendant "pursuant to orders on file No RT 04/05747 on 20/2/04" because the "Department...wanted [the defendant] to sign personally for receipt of security card and [the defendant] wanted it posted to him."
The plaintiff submits that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds "in that [the defendant] refused reasonable attempts to provide the sensor card and so no breach of the tenancy agreement could have been found." 
The plaintiff further submitted that in the course of his dealings with the Tribunal, the defendant acted in a manner which harassed or annoyed Tribunal staff. In support of the latter submission, the plaintiff points to two letters from the defendant addressed to the Tribunal dated 15 February and 23 March 2004. The former was a letter in respect of proceeding CTTT 04/05747 and is therefore not relevant to the proceeding under consideration. The latter however relevantly provided - "In accordance with my letter of 25/02/2004 you are given in due process another fourteen (14) days for to provide me with a complete copy of the file of the case and hard copy transcripts.

I want what I request and nothing less or more whether you have a valid and legal grounds not to comply as such prepare to state so in the respective tribunal where I shall force to haul your rear ends or that of your representative.

The present is an ultimatum to your response of 18/03/2004." 
In my view the proceedings were vexatious as commenced without a reasonable basis and the defendant also conducted himself in a manner deliberately calculated to annoy.

Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 06/41710
On 17 August 2006 the defendant lodged an application for orders that the Department stop overcharging the defendant in respect of his rent and that it stop "harassing me with unsolicited correspondence and phone calls." The matter was heard by the Tribunal on 7 September 2006. In dismissing the application the Tribunal concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain a claim relating to the "amount of a rental subsidy provided" and it was satisfied that the "balance of the claim is misconceived." 
Given the lack of information about what transpired at the hearing, I am not satisfied that the proceedings were vexatious. 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 06/45367
On 8 September 2006 the defendant filed an application seeking orders against the Department "money of $1,840 paid under fraudulent claim for water by the agent of the landlord to be immediately reimbursed", "money of $207.10 paid in overcharged rent rate to be returned" and "inane and harassing correspondence by the agent to be...stopped." The defendant filed a number of documents with the registry of the Tribunal including letters addressed to him by the Department relating to payment of his water rates, copies of receipts for payment of those rates and other documents prepared by the Department. The application was heard on 28 September 2006 by Member Farey of the Tribunal who dismissed the application on the basis that the defendant's oral evidence "left the Tribunal in no doubt that [he] was seeking the same relief as dealt with on 7 September 2006" and that the Tribunal was not permitted to "revisit" an application which had been finally dealt with by another member and because the defendant did not seek a review of that decision "the matter became res judicata." 
The plaintiff submits, and I agree, that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds and was an abuse of process as it sought to re-litigate matters which were the subject of determined proceedings (CTTT 06/41710 and 06/45367). 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 06/58430
On 23 November 2006 the defendant lodged an application for an order seeking to strike out clause 30 of the defendant's Residential Tenancy Agreement by which the Department was empowered to grant a rental rebate or waive rent in its absolute discretion. The defendant contended (inter alia) that the clause "violates essentials of and for a valid contract" and that it violated "international covenants to which the Australian Federation is a signatory", the "law of contract", the "1215 Magna Carta" and the [Trade Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/). 
On 14 December 2006 the Tribunal made orders dismissing the application. The notification of the orders records, "[t]he Tribunal has no authority to remove such clause from the agreement but even if there was such authority the applicant has not satisfied the Tribunal that such action was appropriate or justified." 
By letter dated 15 December 2006 the defendant requested the Tribunal to provide written reasons for its decision dismissing his application. The letter provides: "With the present the above mentioned another and applicant request according the Act written stated reasons for the decision, as the case is in process to the Supreme Court as:error in law", at the soonest possible time.

The outcome of the court will determine the charges against the member in Act of error.

You may be a circus of fools, or fooling around, but make no mistake, the author and applicant knows that in case you have to be brought to justice the action may have to be made to overseas bodies where the (Australian
Commonwealth) is registered as a company (0000 80 5157)."
On 21 December 2006 Member Lennon gave written reasons (Rouvinetis versus Corporation of Land and Housing <case> In those reasons Mr Lennon found that the defendant made written submissions which "are vague and to a large degree incomprehensible" and that at the hearing "[h]e did not advance any further evidence at the hearing to justify removal of Clause 30". He noted that the application before him was the third made by the defendant "in the last four months" and that despite being informed by the defendant that "each was in respect of a different matter", there "appears to be a common thread running through each of these applications." The reasons record that in response to submissions by the Department that the Tenancy Agreement was in accordance with the relevant legislation the defendant submitted that he "does [not] give a damn what the Department thinks or does as the Clause is insane." Mr Lennon concluded that the Tenancy Agreement was entered into in accordance with the "[Residential Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) and the Housing Acts" and that the defendant had not articulated a basis upon which Clause 30 should be removed. 
The plaintiff submits the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds and was an abuse of process as it sought to re-litigate matters which were the subject of proceedings 06/41710 and 06/45367 in the Tribunal. Furthermore, the defendant's communication as set out above was abusive. 
Supreme Court proceeding - 30175/06
The defendant filed a summons in this Court on 22 December 2006 against the Tribunal and Department as defendants seeking review of the decision of the Tribunal on 14 December 2006 on the basis of an "error of law" and "denial of procedural fairness". The summons contained a number of allegations against the Tribunal and the Department which, for the most part, are incomprehensible. The defendant alleged - "the first defendant [Tribunal]: 
Appears as a statutory company under an Act which binds the Crown and endows with unaccountability of sovereign. Its mysteries may be in Gazettes or minutes for which investigation should require obtaining memorandums items and certificates to be probed by professionals.
 ...
 the second defendant [Department]: 
Emerges as statutory corporation or what ever it may be or what that term may really means but surely is a gem in the Crown not to be taken lightly both defendants apparently have mutated under the privatization process in a bizarre shape which only governmental wizardry can score and the
Frankenstein can 
Produce and seem to utilise services of statutory personnel on a rotating basis vested with substantial power with services of communal degree of demand and in possession of staggering assets and resources the combination of sensitive services with power and enormous resources in the case of neglect or malpractice or both of them shall cause grief beyond states bearings"
The defendant filed an affidavit on 15 February 2007 in which he complains that at the time of entering into the Tenancy Agreement he was under a disadvantage by reason of "linguistic limitations, ignorance, need, and absent of awareness of legal and technical terms" and reiterates the allegations contained in his application in the Tribunal in proceedings CTTT 06/58430 that clause 30 of the Tenancy Agreement is ultra vires, a breach of the [Trade Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), and violates international covenants to which Australia is a signatory. 
The defendant subsequently filed written submissions on 29 March 2007 in which the defendant outlines the history of the various proceedings between him and the Department. The following is a sample of the reasoning upon which the application was in part based - "(10) The second defendant submit affidavits too, which is a pile of massive nonsense and inconsistencies within their topic which is about rents and rents rebates and drifts, divorced from the responsibility which any body corporate must exhibit in its claim as a recipient of legal entity. But that is not their sole problem. The submitted affidavits are a classical example of monumental material fallacy by talking plenty of crap and bypassing the issue which is in the action and the court has to negotiate and is the insane term of "absolute discretion" in the [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s30.html) of the tenancy agreement.

The removal of a term which is illegal, violates, common law, is "ULTRA VIRES" and will deem the tenancy agreement as a contract void.

Now the PLAINTIFF in the shape of a chronographemma [sic] gives a brief narration of the conflict between the PLAINTIFF and the two defendants which may not be important to the case but must be told for the serious criminal contact of the defendants as statutory bodies which, if they continue the way they go in a constituency which has no legal redress and has from subjects, perhaps moved as corporation chattels.

The defendants as statutory bodies or whatever may be, god knows what they are, are vested with the accountability or so it seems, of the sovereignty of the Crown, as it appears in the various enactments, and can inflict enormous injuries to a constituency that appears defenceless, now which is the Crown, which provides them with a refuge to irresponsibility and where it comes from is another hot spud."
The defendant then launched into what he claimed to be an account of his history of interactions with the other parties, commencing from with "the beginning ... [being] faced with improper insolent contact", adding further complaints of the way he has been mistreated, attributing criminal and other misconduct to the Department and, though this is not altogether clear, to the Tribunal, showing how in one way or another, as he sees it, each proceeding is a part of this malevolence towards him.
The matter came before Malpass AsJ for hearing on 23 April 2007, the defendant appearing in person and Mr Jungwirth of counsel appearing for the Department. His Honour gave judgment on 24 April 2007 dismissing the summons and ordering the defendant to pay costs (Rouvinetis versus Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal  <case>, finding that that neither the Tenancy Agreement nor clause 30 were void or ultra vires and the Tribunal had not erred in dismissing his application. In dismissing the summons, his Honour stated - "If there was a power to do so [a reference to the power of the Tribunal to modify the terms of a Tenancy Agreement under [s14(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s14.html) the [Residential Tenancies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) ], this is not a case in which it would be exercised. The term is for the benefit of persons such as the plaintiff. There is no utility to him in modifying the agreement by striking the term out of it. The plaintiff must be labouring under misconception as to its function, otherwise he would not be moving to have it excised from the Agreement."
I am satisfied that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds and conducted in an unreasonable way.

Court of Appeal proceeding - 40486 of 2007
On 25 July 2007 the defendant sought leave to appeal (40486 of 2007) from the decision of Malpass AsJ of 24 April 2007. An unfiled notice of appeal tendered by the plaintiff lists two grounds of appeal; first, a "miscarriage of justice"; and second, a "violation of judiciary". The orders sought by the defendant are unfortunately obscured on the tendered document tendered by the plaintiff. In his "summary of argument" the defendant outlined the history of the proceedings before the Tribunal and Malpass AsJ and repeated allegations of misleading and deceptive conduct by the Department under the [Fair Trading Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) and the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth), along with "absence of jurisdiction", "constitutional abuse" and "miscarriage of justice". The latter allegations arise in part from the defendant's misunderstanding of the operation of [s 78B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth). It appears, both from the summary of argument and the transcript before the Court of Appeal that the defendant was of the view that because Malpass AsJ found that [s 14(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/s14.html) of the [Residential Tenancies Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/) under consideration had not been the subject of a decided case then the requirements of <case> were required to be satisfied. 
The matter came before Ipp and Tobias JJA on 10 December 2007, the defendant appearing in person and the Department represented by Mr Jungwirth. The appeal was dismissed with costs. In dismissing the appeal, Ipp JA found that the defendant appeared to misunderstand the meaning of clause 30 and he "is extremely aggrieved at what he perceives to be the consequences of it." His Honour noted that he had sought to explain the meaning and effect of the clause to the defendant without success and that, in any event, there was no reason for concluding that that Malpass AsJ had "made any error". His Honour further noted that the defendant left the court whilst his Honour was giving judgment. 
The plaintiff submits that the proceedings were vexatious as they were commenced without reasonable grounds. The plaintiff points to the manner in which the defendant conducted himself before the Court of Appeal as further supporting this submission. The transcript of the proceeding indicates that the defendant was highly emotional during the proceeding, Ipp JA requesting the defendant to "[j]ust calm down". Despite this, and noting the limitations which apply as a result of only having a transcript available, it does not appear that the defendant acted in a manner which would warrant a finding that it was outside the normal bounds of behaviour expected from a self-represented litigant in the defendant's circumstances. 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 07/20220
On 16 April 2007 the defendant lodged an application seeking orders that the Department cease using the title "Department of Housing" when addressing or corresponding with the defendant and that in all correspondence from the Department to the defendant bear the signature of the author. The Defendant alleged that the use of the title "Department of Housing" was "misleading and likely to deceive" contrary to the [Fair Trading Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) and the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth).
Member Smith of the Tribunal heard the matter on 7 May 2007. The notice of order made on that date states that the application was dismissed because of "[n]o jurisdiction". On 7 May 2007 the defendant made an application for written reasons, which were provided on that date (Rouvinetis versus NSW Corporation of Land and Housing <case> The reasons state - "The applicant seeks that the Tribunal make an order that the respondent landlord use the name NSW Corporation of Land and Housing, and not the name of the Department of Housing in correspondence to him.

This application for specific performance order is based upon a breach of the residential tenancy agreement (Residential Tenancies Act 1987, s16) and the
Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to make such a specific performance or declaratory order."
The Tribunal noted in its written reasons that [s 6(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ha2001107/s6.html) of the [Housing Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ha2001107/) authorised the NSW Corporation of Land and Housing to act in the name of the Department. In my view, this proceeding was utterly without merit and amounted to being vexatious.

Supreme Court proceeding - 30048 of 2007
On 14 May 2007 the defendant filed a summons in this Court seeking review of the decision of the Tribunal on 7 May 2007 on the grounds of "error in law", "denial of natural justice" and "abuse of authority by impotentia excusat legem". The defendant relied upon two sets of written submissions both of which are of some length and, in addition to rehearsing once more his grievances against the Department and Tribunal, addresses in confused and often abusive language, matters of Constitutional law and associated principles. They are, for the most part incoherent, and fail to address the matters raised in the summons in any meaningful manner. The Department filed submissions on 22 August 2007.
Harrison AsJ heard the matter on 28 August 2007, the defendant appeared in person and Mr Jungwirth represented the Department. Judgment was given on 5 September 2007 dismissing the summons with costs. Her Honour made the following observations concerning the nature of the defendant's claim: "[22] There are a number of written submissions made by the plaintiff. I have read them carefully and paid close attention to them. This Court is unable to ascertain, from those submissions, why the plaintiff says that he was not given a reasonable opportunity to present his case. He bears the onus to show there was a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness. He has not done so. The claim fails.
 [23] From my reading of the plaintiff's wide-ranging submissions, he seems to be referring to a number of constitutional issues. I am unsure how these issues relate to the correct name of the second defendant...So far as the ground of appeal "abuse of authority by 'impotentia excusat legem" is concerned, if the plaintiff is asserting that the [Department] as a corporation is not subject to the laws of the State, this assertion is not correct."
In my view, the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds.

Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 08/42892
On 25 August 2008 the Department lodged an application with the Tribunal seeking a number of orders including the termination of the Defendant's Tenancy Agreement. The Department applied to withdraw its application on the same date and the notice that the application had been withdrawn pursuant to the CTTT Act was issued on 3 September 2008. 
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 08/44392
On 3 September 2008 the Department lodged an application (CTTT 08/44392) seeking orders that the defendant cease "breaking or to carry out the terms of the agreement", that he pay the Department $1,885.65 "as compensation (e.g. Rent Arrears)", terminating the Tenancy Agreement and granting vacant possession (due to rent arrears) and an order that the defendant pay the Department "all rental arrears outstanding plus an occupation fee for the period of any order of possession and re-lists if applicable." 
After a number of adjournments, Tribunal Member O'Keeffe heard the matter on 16 January 2009. He dismissed the application so far as it sought an order terminating the Tenancy Agreement on the ground that there was evidence rebutting the statutory presumption of service of the notice of termination issued by the Department to the defendant and the Tribunal was without jurisdiction "to hear and determine the application for termination." However, he did find that the defendant was in rental arrears and ordered the defendant to make payment of the arrears and to pay rent in accordance with the terms of the Tenancy Agreement. 
The plaintiff submits that the defendant's conduct towards the Tribunal and its staff was "vexatious and justifies characterising the proceedings as vexatious on that basis alone." In support of this submission it points to a number of letters sent by the defendant to the Tribunal and a note prepared by a registry staff member of the Tribunal after an incident involving the defendant. It is convenient to briefly summarise the content of those letters. On 20 October 2008 the defendant wrote to the Tribunal requesting that the Department produce a copy of the Tenancy Agreement at the "third ... hearing" of the matter. The letter also contains an allegation that the proceeding was "unsustainable, frivolous, silly ... most likely [sic] part of a conspiracy between member/s of the Tribunal and agent/s of the [Department]" designed to "harass and pressure" the defendant. It concludes by stating that the proceeding may have "unforeseen consequences and will be resolved, if at all, by actions far beyond and above this tribunal." In response the Tribunal wrote to the defendant on 24 October 2008 advising of the fees applicable for the production of a transcript of proceedings and his right to request a copy of a sound recording. On 25 November 2008 the defendant wrote two letters to the Tribunal. In the first he admonished the Tribunal for the response contained in its letter of 24 October 2008, stating that it was required to wave the fees for the production of transcript because the defendant "is an aged pensioner and if your goddamned tribunal has, wrongly, given power to issue orders has to learn what HUMAN RIGHT ARE AND TO RESPECT THEM." The defendant also alleged that the Tribunal had engaged in an "abuse of office and conspiracies" as a result of it accepting "crazy and unsubstantiated applications and squandering time and resources", the latter being a reference to the number of adjournments granted during the course of the proceeding. In the second he sought the Tribunal to provide him with a transcript from four hearings and outlined his fortnightly expenses. On 25 November 2008 the Tribunal wrote to the defendant informing him that it was inquiring into the matters raised in his letter received by it on 24 November 2008 and on 26 November 2008 it wrote to him in response to his request for the production of transcripts in his letter of 25 November informing him that the Tribunal would not waive the fee of producing the transcript but it would waive the fee for the production of sound recordings. 
On 1 December 2008 the defendant wrote to the Tribunal outlining the grounds upon which he disputed the Department's claim, in particular complaining about the method employed by the Department in calculating his rent - "The rent which was paid at the time was "$62.05" and the rent claimed is $66.00" the difference in the rents paid and the rents claimed is "$3.95" per week and multiplied by "19" weeks gives arrears "$75.05" where the fucks I coming the arrears of $"162.05"????" 
The letter also contained allegations of conspiracy on the part of the members of the Tribunal stating, amongst other insults - "The need of asking such documentation from the respondent by the agent of the applicant was solely for to cover malpractice and obfuscate dereliction of duty by overdue requests of needless statements and applications and in the process involving the mindless members of this tribunal to conspiracy for which they may face court and compensation claim."
On 15 December 2008, the defendant wrote again to the Tribunal referring again to the issue of the transcripts of proceedings. He added - "The author doubts that there are sound recordings, because those hearings were the crimes and conspiracies of your thugs and would not have recorded and that letter is sent to your service to enable the author to brief the JUDGE
COMPREHENSIVELY comprende???"
As earlier noted the plaintiff tendered a file note dated 12 January 2009 which purports to be a record of an exchange between an employee of the Tribunal Registry and the defendant. The existence of the file note or its contents was not brought to the attention of the defendant during the hearing before me and no evidence was adduced concerning its contents. I do not rely upon it. 
In my opinion, these letters demonstrate a deliberate process of abuse which, combined with the threat of future proceedings, was designed, albeit irrationally, to obtain a free transcript if he could. It is appropriate to take this conduct into account in considering this application. 
District Court proceeding - 5853 of 2008
On 8 December 2008 the defendant commenced proceedings (5853 of 2008) in the District Court seeking orders withdrawing the application lodged by the Department in Tribunal proceeding number 08/44392, requiring the Department to pay any rental arrears owed by the defendant, as it was the result of professional negligence, and requiring both the Department and the Tribunal to pay the Defendant $300,000 in compensation for "losses and hardship endured for fifteen years by coordinated and unsuccessful actions of...[the Defendant and Tribunal]". It appears that the summons was subsequently amended on 17 April 2009 without material affect. The Department appeared whilst the Tribunal filed a submitting appearance and the Attorney General sought and was granted leave to ensure there was a contradictor to any of the claims raised against the Tribunal. 
The matter was heard by Balla DCJ who dismissed the defendant's summons on 2 July 2009 pursuant to [Part 13.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/index.html#p13.4) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/). At the hearing before his Honour the defendant appeared in person, Mr Jungwirth appeared for the Department and Ms Baker appeared for the Attorney General. His Honour declined to make the first order sought by the defendant on the basis that the defendant had "not shown any legal basis on which such an order could be made" and that the proceedings in the Tribunal had been completed. He declined to make the second order sought on the grounds that the defendant did not adduce any evidence as to "factual basis on which the submission is made" and the defendant had not "otherwise particularised the 'professional negligence' on which he relies." Finally, his Honour declined to make the third order sought on the ground that the "legal basis on which the [defendant] claims compensation of $300,000 is not explained in the pleading or any document in evidence." His Honour concluded - "[t]he matters which are asserted in the Amended Summons are, for the reasons
I have given, so obviously untenable that they cannot possibly succeed and are manifestly groundless. No reasonable cause of action is disclosed and they are an abuse of process."
In addition to the allegations contained in the amended summons his Honour noted that the defendant levelled serious allegations that the Department, Tribunal, the Independent Commission Against Corruption and Centrelink were conspiring against him. His Honour concluded that there was no evidence of any such conspiracy before him and "[n]or is there any evidence of the first and second defendants acting other than in accordance with their statutory duties." 
The plaintiff submits that the proceeding was commenced without reasonable grounds and commenced and conducted to harass or annoy the Department and the Tribunal. I agree.

Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 09/34751
On 27 July 2009 the defendant lodged a social housing division application (CTTT 09/34751) with the Tribunal seeking orders that the Department and its agents cease breaching the tenancy agreement, reimburse "with interest money illegally by fraud obtained" and "stop committing bullying..." The reasons for the orders were stated as - "(A) The agents of the [Department] charge for water rates payment, the last "5" years upon a statutory agreement which have had not in its previous 10 years running to pay such a charge, which is demanded illegally and in breach.

The untaxable income of the tenant is for rent payment of 18% of earnings the agent of the [Department], after tenancy of six months started, illegally, charging 25%.

Those illegal payments and fraud are imposes by intimidation and bullying which must st[op]."
On 12 August 2009 orders were made by the Tribunal directing the parties to serve the material upon which they intended to rely at the hearing. The defendant and Department filed submissions with the Tribunal on 16 August and 14 September 2009 respectively. The defendant's submissions are a largely confused account of his views on the history of public housing in Australia and matters of constitutional law while making offensive and unsubstantiated allegations of impropriety and criminality, cast in offensive and insulting language, on the part of the Department and the Tribunal. 
It appears that the basis of the defendant's complaint, at least in so far as it concerns the rental increase (or the rental rebate), arise from a discussion he had with a representative of the Department at the time of entering into the Tenancy Agreement in which he gathered that the rental payable by him was calculated at 18% of his income. He submitted that this remained the method of calculating rent for "about five months" where after the calculation was increased to 25% of his income, an increase which he described as "unilateral" and goes on to submit for various reasons, and at some length, that it should not apply to him. 
It was submitted on behalf of the Department that it was empowered to charge water usage under the [Residential Tenancies Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rta1987207/), as affirmed by the Tribunal in its decisions against the defendant in RT 06/45367, that the Tribunal was without power to consider matters concerning the rental rebate amounts applied by the Department, and that the order seeking the Department to "stop bullying and illegalities" was not a proper cause of action, that it was an abuse of process and was similar to that raised by the defendant in NSW Court of Appeal proceedings 40361 of 1997 and District Court proceedings 5853 of 2008. The Department submitted that the application should be dismissed "[o]n the principles of res judicata, lack of jurisdiction and no reasonable cause of action...".
The matter was heard before Senior Member Bordon of the Tribunal on 2 October 2009. The defendant appeared in person while Mr Marques appeared for the Department. In dismissing the application Senior Member Bordon noted that the Tribunal was without jurisdiction to determine questions relating to rental rebates applied by the Department, that on 7 September 2006 the Tribunal had dismissed an application by the defendant in respect of rental rebates (CTTT 06/41710) and that following the introduction of the [Residential Tenancies Amendment (Social Housing) Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/rtaha2005426/) public housing tenants were required to pay for water usage. He stated that, notwithstanding the problems with the defendant's application, he faced a "more immediate insurmountable obstacle" arising from the fact that the matters raised in his application had been the subject of "at least two previous decisions (Application RT 06/45367 (7 November 2006) and an earlier application, determined on 7 September 2006)". He extracted the orders sought by the defendant in his first application and noted that the defendant responded to the questions as to whether the principle of res judicata applied by referring the Tribunal to a number of documents which post dated the previous decisions of the Tribunal and therefore, he submitted, rendered the principle inapplicable. After considering the authorities relating to res judicata and issue estoppel, the Member concluded - "The documents referred to by the applicant which are said to post date the previous decisions do not alter the fact that the issues in relation to water usage and rental rebate have been determined. As indeed has the issue of the claimed harassment by the respondent seeking to recover and otherwise enforce water usage and rent arrears. In any event I am satisfied that there is no basis for the claim that the respondent is seeking to recover amounts owed to it under the residential tenancy agreement amounts to any breach of the agreement. The application will be dismissed."
In its written submissions before this Court, the plaintiff contended that the defendant sought to challenge the validity of the rental subsidy in Tribunal proceeding CTTT 06/58430, Supreme Court proceeding 30175 of 2006 and Court of Appeal proceeding 40486 of 2007. The plaintiff submitted that this was a vexatious proceeding commenced without reasonable grounds and constituted an abuse of process and that, moreover, the conduct of the proceeding by the defendant, in his communication with the Tribunal, "could be characterised as vexatious." In support of this latter submission the plaintiff, as I understand it, points to a letter sent by the defendant to the Tribunal and dated 22 July 2009 in which he requests the production of an "out print" of "all cases heard against and for since 1995 (Graham Cochrain) to the 2009 (O Keefe)" along with the names of the "presiding director or manages of the Tribunal and the member (if any) of the Council of the Directorate who can [be] indicted as co defendants." The letter, went on, following a reference to fraud, to conclude - "If monetary obligations are extracted for the present request, let it be known the author is a senior pensioner constituent and shall have all fees waived."
In my view the commencement and maintenance of this proceeding was an abuse of process and the documents of the defendant to which I have referred were part of that abusive behaviour.

Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal proceeding - CTTT 09/38572
On 19 August 2009 the defendant lodged a social housing division application (CTTT 09/38572) with the Tribunal seeking an order against the Department that it cease breaching the Tenancy Agreement, particularly clauses 6.1, 6.2, 17.1 and 17.2. The reason stated for the order is that the "peace, safety and security" of the defendant's residence had been compromised as a result of a defective garage door which remained opened and allowed non-residents to access the property who sprayed graffiti and left syringes on the property. On 9 September 2009 the defendant sought leave to amend his application. On 23 September 2009 the Tribunal granted leave and directed the parties to file and serve all documents upon which they intended to rely upon at the hearing. On 28 September 2009 the defendant lodged an amended application with the Tribunal which included written submissions. The orders sought by the defendant were for compensation arising from the defective garage door in the form of $10 per day during the period in which the door remained inoperative and an additional $10 per day for the period during which repairs to the door occurred. The defendant also sought an order that the Department only communicate with him through registered mail. The grounds for the orders were, shortly put, that the Department continually breached its obligations under the Tenancy Agreement and "policies" and committed criminal acts against the defendant. The particularised breaches of policy were - "(a) tenants rights to peaceful enjoyment of residence quality of life of tenant the agent/s failure to improve [the Department's] services failure of agent/s to protect the resident/s from nuisance against peace comfort and privacy."
The defendant's submissions are largely incomprehensible and irrelevant, again raising matters of public housing generally and constitutional law and making allegations of unspecified crimes by "the agents of the defendant". Notwithstanding, they do outline the defendant's complaints regarding the defective garage door and the noise and inconvenience caused by construction work carried out on the property which the defendant alleged was undertaken without prior consultation with residents of the property. On 27 October 2009 the Department filed its evidence which (inter alia) indicated that the Department gave residents of the property a reduction in rent of $5.00 per week as compensation for the disruption arising from upgrading work carried out on a retaining wall and access stairs on the property and inconvenience caused by the defective garage door. 
The matter was heard by Member Titterton on 10 December 2009. The defendant appeared in person and Mr Marques appeared for the Department. Member Titteron dismissed the application on insufficient evidence, noting that whilst the defendant had sought to file a syringe and signs indicating that building work had taken place on the property (the Member refusing leave to do so because of the size of the signs and the dangerous nature of the syringe) "[n]o evidence was filed by the landlord [a typographical error for the tenant] to support his claim, other than his own oral evidence." The member extracted the notation in the defendant's written submissions that "[t]his case has and needs no documents in submission, testimony of application will cover and suffice." He concluded that, based on the evidence before him, he was not satisfied that the defendant was entitled to any compensation in addition to that which he had received from the Department. 
Member Titterton noted that the defendant's written submissions which were "made in generalised language" and often referred to irrelevant matters along with his oral submissions, which were "made in an aggressive manner", confounding the difficulties faced by the defendant. He went on to state - "It simply does not assist the [defendant] when he shouts at the [Department's] representative and makes scandalous allegations. This is even more so when what only can be described as abuse is directed to the Tribunal member presiding over the proceedings...

I note that the [defendant] apologised for his conduct at the conclusion of the hearing and I accept this apology as I am not sure that the [defendant] is completely aware of his conduct or the impact of his conduct during the
Tribunal hearings. He is clearly deeply disturbed by what he perceives to be the conduct of the [Department], blaming it on everything from the breakdown of his marriage to mental health issues."
The plaintiff submits that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds and conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy the Department and the Tribunal. 
I should note that, whilst the plaintiff did not specifically submit that the defendant's conduct during the proceeding was such as to render the proceeding vexatious, it did point to a file note prepared by a staff member of the Tribunal registry which alleges a discussion between the staff member and the defendant. That document refers only to the caller as the "applicant" and complains in general terms of the conduct of the caller in swearing at and using inappropriate language towards the staff member and making personal insults towards her. Moreover, the contents of the document was not drawn to the defendant's attention during the course of the hearing before me and no evidence was called by the plaintiff in respect of the document. I have disregarded it.

Proceedings involving Sydney Girls'/Boys' High School 
Administrative Decisions Tribunal proceeding - ADT 083198 
On 20 May 2008 the defendant wrote to the NSW Department of Education and Training (Department of Education) requesting access to "the agreement/s for the use of the premises of...the Sydney Girls High School for the kosher dinner of 09/04/2008..." under the [Freedom of Information Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/). The Department of Education responded to the request under letter dated 22 May 2008 acknowledging receipt of the application and informing the defendant that whilst it was its normal practice to respond to such requests within 21 days of their receipt there may be a delay and that the defendant would be informed of any such delay and an explanation provided. The defendant responded by letter dated 3 June 2008 in which he stated (inter alia) that his purpose for access to the documents was to determine upon what basis the "jew was given use of the ...Sydney Girls high school...for a dinner of conspiracy, crime and thuggery" and "...as to how the jew came in use of his criminal illegalities the premises of a such (sic) prestigious public institution, to soil with his conspiracies." He further stated that "...if the jew does not come clean in this case, the author has a very strong case and the jew may have to answer much more than the disrepute of the Sydney high schools." 
On 25 June 2008 the defendant lodged an application for review in the Administrative Decision Tribunal seeking review of the decision made by the Department of Education as outlined its letter to the defendant dated 22 May 2008. The reasons for the application state that the principle of the Sydney Girls High School was "in violation of N.S.W police implementation procedures of 1994 Department of Education premises of the school for a dinner the 09-04-2008 which incurred criminal violations. Which may incur criminal proceedings in the N.S.W Supreme Court..." On his application the defendant wrote that he had not received notice of the decision and marked that the decision had been the subject of internal review. 
Under letter dated 21 July 2008 the Department of Education provided the defendant with 20 documents which it determined were relevant to the requests contained in his letters of 20 May and 3 June 2008. The Department redacted (inter alia) the name and details of the organisation which hired the premises in response to the views expressed by the defendant in his correspondence with the Department of Education. On 26 August 2008 the defendant and Mr Bevan of the Department of Education attended a "planning meeting" in respect of the proceeding during which the defendant indicated that he wished to withdraw his application.
The plaintiff submits that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds. The allegations of criminality were evidently based entirely upon the defendant's manifest anti-Semitism and, aside from his crude prejudice, were completely without any evidence whatever. The plaintiff's submission should be accepted.

Supreme Court proceeding - SC 20354 of 2008 
On 20 August 2008 the defendant filed a summons in this Court seeking compensation in the amount of $1,000,000 against Dr Margaret Varaday, Principal of Sydney Girls High School. The defendant pleaded that Dr Varaday, in her capacity as principal, was negligent in approving a private function to be held in the school grounds and "allowing armed private personal body guard in the school" who detained the defendant and caused him to suffer injuries and that in doing so she failed in her duty to ensure "safety and security in the school grounds for every one (sic), during the 09/04/2008 function by allowing armed private personal body guards". The defendant also pleaded a breach of the "Community use of School Facilities: (Policy Statement and Community use and Implementation Procedures N.S.W Department of Education 1994)". The defendant filed an affidavit on the same occasion in which he makes a number of incoherent allegations regarding Dr Varaday's management of the school and deposes to the events that took on the evening of 9 April 2008 while he was present at the school. 
On 26 August 2008 the defendant filed a general case management document in which he set out in detail the events of 9 April 2008. On 17 October 2008 the defendant filed a statement of claim by which the Department of Education as a defendant and in which he repeated the grounds pleaded in the summons. 
The defendants filed a notice of motion on 23 October 2008 seeking summary dismissal of the statement of claim or that it be struck out pursuant to [parts 13](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/index.html#p13) and [14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/index.html#p14) of the UCPR respectively. On 13 February 2009 they filed written submissions in support of the application. The matter was heard by Schmidt J on 24 February 2009, the defendant appearing in person and Mr Fordham of counsel appearing for the defendants. Her Honour delivered judgment on 5 March 2009 dismissing the proceedings with no order as to costs (Rouvinetis versus Varady <case> In dismissing the summons her Honour concluded that there was no basis upon which a duty of care could be said to be owed by either the Department of Education or Dr Varady to the defendant and that no amendment to the pleadings could remedy the deficiencies in the defendant case. 
In my view, the proceeding was vexatious, having been commenced without reasonable grounds.

Administrative Decisions Tribunal proceeding - ADT 093059
By way of letter dated 30 September 2008 the defendant made an application under the FOI Act to the Department of Education seeking access to documents relating to the practice of permitting parking of vehicles on the grounds of the Sydney Girls' and Sydney Boys' high schools by persons attending sporting matches at the "Sydney stadium" in return for a fee. A number of letters were exchanged between the defendant and the Department of Education regarding his application and on 3 December 2008 the Department of Education wrote to the defendant advising him of the inquires undertaken by it in respect of his application and providing him with document entitled "Parking Procedures & Notes" produced to it by the Sydney Boys' High School. The defendant was invited to make inquiries of the Parents and Citizens Association as the department did not hold any additional documents. 
In response to the letter of 3 December 2008 the defendant wrote to the Department of Education on 11 December 2008 expressing his dissatisfaction with the response to his application stating, "[d]eal with the application properly, take your time, the author knows how hard it is and shall appreciate any good information you will be able to come with" and repeating his request for access to documents in abrupt and abusive language. On 15 December 2008 the Department of Education wrote to the defendant advising him of his rights to apply for internal review and on 18 December 2008 the defendant applied for internal review. An internal review was conducted by Trevor Fletcher, Deputy Director-General of Schools, and the original determination of 3 December 2008. 
On 3 March 2009 the defendant lodged an application for review of the decision with the ADT seeking review of the decision of Mr Fletcher. The reasons stated for the application were "[f]or obtaining the information initially applied". The defendant filed written submission on 2 March 2009 in which he provided a detailed, although rambling and sometimes incoherent, chronology of correspondence with the Department of Education regarding his FOI application in which he made an allegation of criminal activity on the part of Dr Varady. The defendant subsequently filed further submissions on 22 June and 31 July 2009 which, for the most part, either rearticulated matters contained in the defendant's original submissions or dealt with irrelevant matters. Submissions were filed on behalf of the Department of Education. The application was heard by Judicial Member Montgomery on 15 June 2009. The defendant appeared in person and Mr Bilbe-Taylor appeared for the Department of Education. On 11 August 2009 Member Montgomery dismissed the application. In his decision he noted that the defendant sought an order requiring the Department of Education to locate additional documents to that provided which the defendant asserted the former "must hold". After considering the relevant statutory provisions of the FOI Act, Member Montgomery concluded that the ADT was without jurisdiction to order the Department of Education to conduct a search for additional documents and the application must therefore be dismissed. 
It would be naive to suppose that this application was not being pursued, regardless of the merits, in the course of the defendant's attempt to vindicate the anti-Semitic prejudice to which I have already referred. The proceeding was vexatious, having been commenced without reasonable grounds.

Supreme Court proceeding - SC 15679 of 2008
On 28 October 2008 the defendant filed a statement of claim in this Court against David Knoll of the Jewish Board of Deputies ('Board') alleging "negligence", "failing duty of care" and "failing reasonable precautions" arising from the events on 9 April 2008 while the defendant was at the Sydney Girls' High School. Shortly put he pleaded that the duty of care arose from the alleged hiring by the Board of private security guards who assaulted the defendant. He also pleaded that Mr Knoll breached the "Policy Statement and Implementation Procedures N.S.W. Department of Education 1994". He claimed compensation in the amount of $1,000,000. The defendant also filed a document entitled "general case management" in which he made allegations regarding the Jewish community and expressed his opinion on matters relating to that community in Australia and internationally. 
On 22 November 2008 an amended statement of claim was filed in which the Board was named as the defendant in place of Mr Knoll. On 22 December 2008 the defendant filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the compensation claimed by him be paid. On 24 December 2008 the Board filed a notice of motion seeking to have the notice of motion and amended statement of claim dismissed. On 5 January 2009 the defendant filed a notice of motion seeking a pro bono referral. On 8 May 2009 Buddin J made an order that the defendant be referred to the Pro Bono Panel for legal assistance, resulting in Mr Gormly SC being briefed to appear. 
On 14 July an amended statement of claim was filed pursuant to a grant of leave on 9 July 2009, which named Mr Knoll and Paliguard Pty Limited as the defendants. On 22 July 2009 a further amended statement of claim was filed naming all of the members of the Board as defendants. The statement of claim alleged negligence, wrongful imprisonment, assault and battery arising from the events of 9 April 2008 and seeks damages, general damages, exemplary damages, aggravated damages, interest and costs. 
On 2 October 2009 the defendant filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the proceedings be heard by a jury on the basis that Rotham J was listed as a defendant, the impartiality of this Court was therefore affected. On 20 October a notice of motion was filed by the defendants seeking (inter alia) that the further amended statement of claim be dismissed or struck out. R A Hulme J heard the motions on 29 October 2009 and his Honour gave judgment on 19 November 2009 (Rouvinetis versus Knoll <case> dismissing both motions. All parties were represented by counsel at the hearing. Hulme J dismissed the motion seeking summary dismissal of the further amended summons, finding that the material before him was inadequate to permit a conclusion that no reasonable action was disclosed. In dismissing the motion seeking the matter to be determined by a jury his Honour concluded that the interests of justice did not require a trial by jury. His Honour reserved the question of costs and after receiving submissions from both parties ordered the defendant to pay costs. The defendant was granted leave to amend his statement of claim. 
On 10 November 2011 the Court gave verdicts for the defendants plus costs. However, the plaintiff does not submit that the proceeding was vexatious. 
Proceedings against a tenant 
Supreme Court proceeding - SC 12504 of 2000
On 22 September 2000 the defendant filed a summons in this court commencing proceedings against Ms Beverly Grant seeking "orders for compensation" and orders that Ms Grant answer "global charges" for offences against ss 78 and 83 of the Criminal Proceeding Act 1986 and "malicious prosecution with injury to reputation". The defendant filed an affidavit in which he deposed that Ms Grant had been misappropriating electricity by using power points in the car park of the unit block in which both her and the defendant resided and that false allegations had been made against him by Ms Grant who had (inter alia) applied for an apprehended violence order, as it was then termed, against the defendant. Reference was also made to Tribunal proceeding CTTT 25379/98 the history of which is set out above. Ms Grant filed a notice of appearance in October 2000. A transcript of a hearing before Levine J on 24 November 2000, at which Ms Grant was not present, the defendant clarified his position by informing his Honour that he was seeking compensation in the amount of $1,000 to be paid to the Children's Hospital at Randwick by Ms Grant as a result of what he said were unsuccessful steps taken against him over a period of four years. 
The Court record indicates that the matter came before Master Harrison on 3 April 2001 and, while the plaintiff did not tender a written judgment of her Honour, it pointed to the judgments of Kirby J in Grant versus Rouvinetis <case> at <case> and O'Keefe J in Grant versus Rouvinetis <case> at <case> in which both judges refer to the summons, although referred to as a statement of claim, being struck out by Master Harrison. It appears from the judgment of O'Keefe J at [5] and [6] that the defendant filed a further statement of claim in similar, but not identical form, on 5 April 2001 and that it was struck out by Master Malpass on 24 April 2001. 
The plaintiff submits that even in the absence of the relevant originating process (which were not tendered by it) I should be satisfied, having regard to the procedural history of the proceeding which is briefly referred to in the judgments of Kirby and O'Keefe JJ above, that the proceeding was vexatious, having been commenced without reasonable grounds and to harass or annoy Ms Grant. I am so satisfied.

Supreme Court proceeding: Grant versus Rouvinetis <case>
On 21 June 2001 O'Keefe J delivered judgment. At the commencement of the judgment his Honour stated that the defendant had filed a "Notice of Motion (Notice of Appeal)" on 5 June 2001 commencing the matter. Further on in the judgment at [8] his Honour makes reference to the affidavit filed in support of the motion by the defendant. Whilst a copy of the motion was not tendered by the plaintiff, a copy of the affidavit in support filed on 5 June 2001 was. The affidavit (inter alia) listed the grounds upon which the defendant sought review of the decision of Master Malpass striking out his application on 24 April 2001. It complains of an error of law 'by not following the court rules and violating "68" and "81" for not directing the statement of claim to D.C.M', a denial of procedural justice arising from that failure, an abuse of process by dismissing the statement of claim on the basis that no cause of action was disclosed and not affording the defendant an opportunity to "complete any omission (sic), as its fair and as required". The defendant also alleged that Master Malpass "acted with insolence and malice" towards him and that he suffered inequality arising from being self represented. Included in the affidavit was an outline of the proceedings before Master Malpass and of his correspondence with the Kingsford Community Legal Centre, the New South Wales Bar Association and the Chief Justice of New South Wales regarding pro bono legal assistance. All of which is stated in hyperbolic terms. The affidavit concludes with the defendant stating "[I] demand my statement of claim restored as it aims to unravel conspiracy against my person by a sinister [Ms Grant]... and persons and bodies who could put me easily behind bars..." 
Annexed to the affidavit was a letter addressed to the United Nations in Geneva accusing the High Court of "national treason, dictatorship, and gross and massive abuse of human rights."
At the hearing before O'Keefe J on 16 June 2001 the defendant appeared in person and Mr Lee appeared for Ms Grant. In his judgment of 21 June 2001 dismissing the application and ordering the defendant to pay costs, O'Keefe J stated that the affidavit "graphically indicates the emotional and immoderate approach adopted by the [defendant]" and found that allegations that Master Malpass was "stern" and made a statement "in an outrage" could not be maintained by the defendant when cross-examined on the matter and, in fact, it was the defendant who exhibited outrage to the Master. His Honour noted that in the hearing before him the defendant conceded that the material relating to pro bono assistance and the letter to the United Nations was irrelevant. His Honour stated: "[13] It would appear from the foregoing that the plaintiff regards his proposed action as part of a crusade to expose what he sees as the shortcomings of the judicial system in Australia."
His Honour went on to consider and dismiss each of the grounds raised by the defendant in his application concluding: "[20] An examination of the statement of claim filed by the [defendant] in my opinion reveals that it infringes the provisions of [Part 15 rule 26 of the
Supreme Court Rules]. At the very least its form is such as to have the tendency to cause prejudice embarrassment and delay (sic). Accordingly it is a pleading which was appropriately struck out.
 [21] When regard is had to the defective form of the pleading, the delay on the part of the plaintiff in commencing the present application and the failure of each of the grounds of appeal I am of the opinion that the application must be dismissed."
The plaintiff rightly submits that the proceeding was vexatious as it was commenced without reasonable grounds.

Supreme Court proceeding: Grant versus Rouvinetis <case>
On 14 June 2001 Ms Grant filed a summons seeking an order that the defendant be prohibited from commencing proceedings against her without leave of the Court. A number of affidavits were filed in the proceedings. It appears that no documents were filed by the defendant in the proceeding. The matter was heard by Kirby J on 8 August 2001, orders having previously been made for the service of originating process and notice of the hearing on the defendant and adjournments granted for allowing those things to be done. Notwithstanding, the defendant did not appear at the hearing on 8 August 2001 and his Honour, having received affidavits of service evidencing that the defendant was aware of the hearing, determined that the matter should proceed in his absence (Grant versus Rouvinetis <case> In granting the application his Honour concluded - "Here the [defendant] is a litigant in person. Whilst he cannot be expected to know the intricacies of pleading and may be forgiven difficulties in formulating a claim, the documents which have been issued by him and ultimately struck out by each of the Masters betray not simply ignorance of the rules, but rather an ulterior motive towards Ms Grant. I believe that the appropriate inference from the nature of the allegations and the nature of the pleadings, and from the general history is that the proceedings were commenced to annoy and embarrass Miss Grant and were manifestly groundless."
It is evident that such a proceeding must be vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court. 
Discussion
The defendant has filed four sets of written submissions and, in addition, made oral submissions in the course of the hearing. I do not intend to set out his submissions in detail. In short, he contended that in all the cases relied on he had acted appropriately to vindicate his rights and that this was difficult because he did not have legal assistance and had only a lay person's understanding of the law. He submitted, in substance, that the adverse decisions that resulted from his actions were mistaken. He repeated his allegations of the crimes and conspiracies to which he claimed to have been subjected. He sought to litigate the matter (at the time still on foot in this Court) concerning the injuries he suffered at the hands of security guards at the dinner at Sydney Girls' High School. The hearing before me commenced with the following submission - "DEFENDANT: Before we go further, what is your full name? 
HIS HONOUR: All these matters are available on the List, why do you need my full name? 
DEFENDANT: Because I have a matter trust and confidence in the Court. There are serious allegations against the Jewish community of Sydney.

One of the judges ... runs paramilitary organisation. Several barristers of his own community are defendants. I am facing the heavy guns of the law, practicing in New South Wales, and I have grave expectation the present proceedings are outcome of conspiracy, further action, so I want to address to you that I am, if a problem of confidence, if you tell me you can be fully trusted I accept it. Are you to be fully trusted? 
HIS HONOUR: Mr Rouvenitis, I am a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales. I hold that office by virtue of appointment by the Governor. I will do my duty. You may sit down.

DEFENDANT: That pacifies me. I have here some documents of submissions." 
The defendant's submissions were rambling and replete with gross exaggerations and wild accusations of one kind or another against members of the judiciary and the Tribunal, police and employees of the Department, as well as simple insult and vulgar abuse. He sought to demonstrate that many, if not all, of the matters relied on by the plaintiff were commenced by him for good reasons and wrongly decided against him.
In substance, the defendant contended that he is the victim of a massive criminal conspiracy at the instance of the various servants of the State and was provoked by their actions into taking the proceedings which are the subject of evidence. Those proceedings were fully justified and failed because of the conspiracy and/or the fact that he was legally unrepresented.

Conclusion
I take into account that the defendant has come to this country, as I understand it, when he was an adult and might therefore have some difficulty in understanding the legal system. Although it is obvious that English is not his first language, he is quite fluent, has a substantial vocabulary and well capable of expressing himself clearly. There is no doubt in my mind that he understands fully what he says and what is said to him. I have given careful consideration to whether his possible ignorance of the legal system and difficulty with language provides any explanation or possible excuse for his frequent unsubstantiated allegations, insults and abuse. Making every possible allowance, however, I have concluded that neither of these factors have played any significant role in his conduct or the substance of his contentions. 
In my view it is plain, when the course and character of the defendant's litigation is looked at as a whole, that he has persistently acted without a proper basis in law and fact. His submissions present the picture of a man for whom any slight or grievance is the result of criminal conduct or overweening State power, which must be combated and denounced. They are often couched in or use insulting and abusive language. It is clear from that picture, case after case, decision after decision, the correctness of which he rejects even to the present time, that he has harboured for many years a deep resentment against the Department, which has not simply accepted the truth of his allegations about its staff and his characterisation of the mode in which it carries out its functions, a matter which he finds offensive and, I think, humiliating. 
The frequent rejection of his claims by the Tribunal have led him to allege that the Department and the Tribunal have been engaged in a conspiracy against him, as indeed, have all the parties with whom he has been in litigation. For all I can tell, perhaps he believes these allegations. However, I am certainly satisfied that he makes use of almost any grievance or slight as an opportunity to have his day in court, when he can in a public arena declare both his own propriety and the dishonest and criminal enmity of those who decline to accept it. The actual substance of the dispute is of little importance except to the extent that it provides grist to the mill of his indignation. 
It is not, however, necessary to explain the defendant's motives. The objective picture is clear. The unnecessary burden to which the Department has been put time after time for over a decade has resulted in a significant waste of resources, not to speak of the time taken up in the Tribunal and this Court on appeal.
I take into account, of course, that granting the orders sought will present a significant obstacle for the defendant in obtaining access to the courts and tribunals of this State. However, this follows from the appropriate application of the Act in the defendant's case. All these cases present issues of degree. There is no bright line that marks the boundary indicating that a litigant has acted vexatiously. In this case I have reached the conclusion, which I think is inevitable, that the defendant has frequently instituted and conducted proceedings that are an abuse of the process of the Tribunal and this Court, for which there was no reasonable ground and have been conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy. Furthermore, it is evident from his submissions in this case that he has no intention of changing his approach to the institution of proceedings. His calling of Ms Fraser to make unfounded allegations of conspiracy against both her and the plaintiff is evidence of this attitude. 
Accordingly, I make the following orders under <case> of the Act - .The defendant is prohibited from instituting proceedings in any tribunal or court in New South Wales without leave of this Court.
 .All of the proceedings in New South Wales already instituted by the defendant, with the exception of an appeal, if any, from the decision in
Rouvinetis versus Knoll [[2011] NSWSC 1352] are stayed.
