Judgment for plaintiffs 
JUDGMENT: - 5 - 
THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
HIDDEN J 
Wednesday 24th February 1999 
No: 13330 of 1997 The Zinc Corporation Ltd & Anor versus WorkCover Authority 
Reasons for judgment On 9 December 1998 I gave a judgment in which I determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to an order that the Uninsured Liability and
Indemnity Scheme, administered by the defendant, should meet the whole of their liability to make weekly payments to a worker, following their successful appeal against an award of compensation to that worker under the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/).
Provision for such an order is made by [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) of the [Compensation Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/). On 19
February 1999, I heard argument about the orders which should be made to give effect to my decision.
 For the plaintiffs, it was argued that I should order the Scheme to bear not only the weekly payments specified in paragraph 1 of the award, but also the interest provided for in paragraph 2. That interest was ordered pursuant to s19 (since repealed) of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/). The total amount of weekly payments paid under paragraph 1 of the award is $135,649.66. The amount of interest paid pursuant to paragraph 2 is $43,776.64.
 Counsel for the defendant opposed any order in respect of the interest. It is true that the interest formed part of the compensation awarded under the [Workers Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/): Westpac
Banking Corporation versus Tomassian [(1992) 32 NSWLR 207], per
Mahoney JA at 217 and Meagher JA at 220. However, the critical question is whether it is embraced by the expression "weekly payments of compensation" in [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/). I am persuaded by the submission of counsel for the defendant that it is not.
 The terms "weekly payment" and "compensation" are not defined in the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/). In the [Workers Compensation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/), "compensation" is defined to include "any monetary benefit under this Act" and "weekly payment", in relation to compensation, is defined as "a weekly payment of compensation under Division 2 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p3) in respect of a period of total or partial incapacity for work". Division 2 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p3) is headed "Weekly compensation by way of income support". This could suggest that the expression in the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) is directed only at the weekly payments and not to any interest which might be ordered, but it is by no means conclusive of the issue.
 As counsel for the defendant submitted, the answer lies in the scheme of [s38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/) itself.
As observed in my earlier judgment, [s38(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) provides that weekly payments of compensation cannot be stayed pending an appeal. I referred in that judgment to Lovett Building Co Pty Ltd versus Burns [(1991) 7 NSWCCR 265], in which Kirby P examined the background and rationale of the section. His Honour observed (at 274): 
At least this much is clear from [section :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) that Parliament intended the worker to gain the benefit of the weekly payments ordered under an award (both those due to the past and those payable at present) until the obligation fixed by the award is lawfully terminated on appeal.
 Viewed in this way, it is clear that the prohibition in [s38(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) was not intended to embrace an award of interest under s19 of the Act.
Accordingly, it would have been open to the plaintiffs to seek a stay of that part of the award pending the appeal. [Section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) was enacted to remedy injustice which an employer might suffer as a result of the inability of the court to stay weekly payments. In the event of a successful appeal, the employer might be relieved of the obligation to make those payments but be unable to recover them from the worker.
 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the power under [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) to order the Uninsured Liability and Indemnity Scheme to bear an employer's liability to make weekly payments does not extend to interest. The plaintiffs are entitled to an order only in respect of the weekly payments, totaling $135,649.66.
 The plaintiffs also contend that they are entitled to interest pursuant to s94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) on any amount which I order to be paid under [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/).
Section 94(1) provides that I may order interest for the period "between the date when the cause of action arose and the date when the judgment takes effect". Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the cause of action arose here when the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment against the worker, at which time the right to seek an order under [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) arose. Not so, said counsel for the defendant. He submitted that [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) established an exceptional statutory procedure for the benefit of employers, which creates no entitlement unless and until an order under the subsection were made. Until such an order, he argued, the Scheme administered by the defendant was not entitled, let alone obliged, to make any payment.
 Again, I am persuaded by the defendant's submissions. I think there is considerable force in the argument that the Scheme can make no payment to an employer voluntarily, but must abide an order of the court under the subsection. However that may be, the power to award interest under s94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) is discretionary and I do not consider that such an order is appropriate in this case.
 The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs of the proceedings in this court. The only argument to the contrary put by counsel for the defendant was that they could, and should, have made this application in the Court of
Appeal. That is so but, as their counsel pointed out, that would have involved the same exercise as was undertaken before me.
 Accordingly, pursuant to [s38(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/s38.html) of the [Compensation Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cca1984225/), I order that the Uninsured Liability and Indemnity Scheme bear the whole of the plaintiffs' liability to make weekly payments to the worker, in an amount of $135,649.66. There will be judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant in that amount. The defendant is to pay the plaintiffs' costs of this application.
