REGINA v. WEN HUI LI /91/0063 
WEDNESDAY 6 NOVEMBER 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES CRIMINAL DIVISION 
SMART J 
JUDGMENT (On admissibility of evidence see page 4 of transcript.) 
HIS HONOUR: The Crown has tendered the statement of Steven John Wilson dated 28 July 1995 and the statement of Shirley Anne Collins dated 17 September 1996. Both statements are directed, amongst other things, to events and statements made prior to the killing on the evening of 13 June 1995.

The Crown has asked for an order under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s4.html) (2) and of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). The Crown has submitted that proof of the nature of the relationship existing between the deceased and the prisoner will be significant in determing the sentence to be imposed. The Crown wishes to put to the court that it should find that there had been a relationship between the deceased and the prisoner, that it had been terminated about a couple of months prior to 13 June 1995 and that since the termination the prisoner had not left the deceased alone and was pursuing and harassing her.

The Crown wishes to put that the prisoner was simply not able to accept that the relationship was over and leave the deceased in peace. There is the further aspect of an association by her with another young gentleman.

I think I should make an order pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s4.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) as the material does relate to matters likely to be significant.

The Crown sought to rely on the allegation of rape which had been made by the deceased and which is recorded in paragraph 4 of Constable Wilson's statement.
The Crown made it clear that it was not relying on that material as proof of the fact of rape but proof of what Miss Wong believed and, as I understood it, the Crown contended that the prisoner was aware of Miss Wong going to the police station and would have been fearful about what she might say as to what occurred on the night of 8 June 1995.

If the prisoner asserted that he had not raped Miss Wong and had not done so there would, of course, be no ground for him to feel apprehensive about what she might say to the police in relation to that matter.

The allegation of rape is extremely serious, and in my view, I do not think that I should admit paragraph 4 of Constable Wilson's statement. I do not think that the Crown can make use of that absent establishing knowledge on the part of the prisoner that Miss Wong was going to make a complaint to that effect or absent establishing the truth of that allegation. Accordingly, I do not admit paragraph 4 of Constable Wilson's statement.

The relevant paragraph to which objection is taken in Miss Collins' statement is paragraph 6, there being no objection to the remainder of her statement. It is perhaps a pity that statement was not taken until 17 September 1996.
However, Miss Collins states that she interviewed Miss Wong shortly before the events with which we are concerned. It must have been within 24 hours before they occurred.

Miss Collins has a recollection of what Miss Wong told her. If Miss Wong had been present, evidence of what the prisoner had said and done would undoubtedly be admissible.

I bear in mind that the purpose of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s65.html) is to allow certain hearsay material to be admitted. Miss Wong had personal knowledge of the matters of which she spoke and Miss Collins was acting, among other things, as a recorder as she listened to her history. Miss Wong is speaking to Miss Collins of events of importance to her and which had occurred since the termination of the relationship and extremely recently, there being material of Miss Wong being followed to the police station.

In paragraph 6 of the statement Miss Collins has not recalled specific dates when Miss Wong said various events occurred, but the overwhelming inference is that Miss Wong was speaking of events of very recent happening.

I think that the material is admissible under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s65.html) (2) and (c) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and I do not think that any of the discretionary grounds for exclusion exist.

The matter may be put very simply, namely that there is evidence of Miss Wong being harassed by the prisoner when she went to the police station to have immediate action taken in respect of current problems.

I therefore admit paragraph 6 of Miss Collins' statement.
