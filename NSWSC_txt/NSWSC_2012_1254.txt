JUDGMENT
On 15 August 2012 an application was filed for the adoption of a child I will refer to as G by applicants I will refer to as P and P under the Family Law (Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption) Regulations (Cth), reg 15. 
The material on the file relates to an application under the [Adoption Act 2000](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) for the adoption of G. 
There is no evidence that the arrangements for the adoption were made in accordance with the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (Convention). The Placement Authority document and the Discharge Slip do not go far enough.
In particular, evidence should be filed to establish that the Department of Family and Community Services as the New South Wales Central Authority prepared and transmitted to the Inter-Country Adoption Board of the Philippines as the Central Authority of the State of origin the report required by art 15 of the Convention.
The evidence should also establish that in accordance with art 16 of the Convention, the Inter-Country Adoption Board as Central Authority of the Philippines prepared and transmitted a report to the Department of Family and Community Services as the New South Wales Central Authority
I direct the Registrar to notify the applicants and the Director-General of the Department of this order and provide them with a copy of this judgment.
The application is adjourned to a date to be fixed. * * *
