Reid versus George [1996] NSWSC 159 (27 May 1996) 
REID V GEORGE /92 
Tuesday 30 April 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG, J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: These proceedings were commenced by summons on 18 August 1992. In that summons the plaintiff Francis Reid sought:- 
An order extending the time for commencing these proceedings; and "An order under Part III Division 2 of the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 to adjust interest in respect to property." 
The defendant, Patricia George, filed an appearance on 23 September 1992. The summons did not have a return day and nothing happened in the court until on November 1995 the plaintiff's solicitor filed a document requesting an appointment for hearing. The matter came into the Registrar's list on 28
November 1995 and, by consent, directions were made for filing affidavits.

On 8 December 1995, the plaintiff died.

On 6 February 1996, the defendant moved for a declaration that the plaintiff or any other person in the plaintiff's name was prohibited from continuing these proceedings. The plaintiff's solicitor shortly afterwards moved for an order that Donna Irene Reid be substituted for the deceased plaintiff and that pursuant to <case> of the De Facto Relationships Act, leave be granted to the substituted plaintiff to continue the proceedings.

The defendant's notice of motion came on before me on 12 March 1996. There was no appearance for any party other than the solicitor for the defendant who argued the matter personally. Unfortunately, he was not equipped with any authority and it was necessary to reserve the decision so that my staff could do the work that should have been done by the solicitor preparing the case. I can understand why people involved in cases in the Supreme Court involving a relatively small amount of money are not represented by counsel, but it still behoves solicitors to prepare the case in the same way as counsel would have prepared it by presentation to the Court of relevant authority. The consequence of not doing this is that the time and expense that should have been put into the case is merely passed on to the Court. The courts are now working at very close to maximum use of court time and resources. It is questionable how much longer the court will be able to do parties' work for them.

The present case does in fact raise quite considerable problems.

The background facts are that it would seem that the plaintiff and the defendant commenced living in a de facto relationship in 1973. In 1984, the parties jointly purchased a house in Eden which is the property that is now the key property in the subject dispute. The parties lived in the house together but the relationship ended somewhere in 1989 or perhaps as late as
March 1990 when the plaintiff moved out of the house.

Under <case> of the De Facto Relationships Act, an application under the Act "shall be made before the expiration of the period of two years after the day on which [the parties] ... last ceased ... to so live together." Accordingly, under that subsection, an application had to be made by March 1992 at the latest.

Section 18(2) of the Act entitles the Court to - "grant leave to a de facto partner to apply to the court for an order under this Part ... where the court is satisfied ... that greater hardship would be caused to the applicant if that leave were not granted than would be caused to the respondent if that leave were granted." 
Subsection (3) then goes on to say: "Where, under sub-section (2), a court grants a de facto partner leave to apply to the court for an order under this Part, the de facto partner may apply accordingly." 
The substantive application that the plaintiff wishes to make is an application under <case> of the Act which entitles the Court to make an order adjusting the interests of de facto partners with respect to the property of either of the de facto partners as seems just and equitable.

Section 24(1) of the Act is as follows:- "Where, before an application under <case> is determined, either party to the application dies, the application may be continued by or against, as the case may require, the legal personal representative of the deceased party." 
The argument for the defendant is that there was no application under <case> pending as at the date of death of the plaintiff. Section 24 of the Act is the exclusive source of authority to continue proceedings after death. Thus the proceedings must have come to an end when the plaintiff died and it is incompetent for anyone else to continue them.

At common law, causes of action which were purely personal did not survive the death of their possessor; see Fleming on Tort 7th Ed pp 638-639 (8th edition pp 675-676). By the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1944404/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1944404/s2.html), the common law rule was altered so that "all causes of action subsisting against or vested in" a deceased person "shall survive against, or, as the case may be, for the benefit of, his estate." The current form of the section contains certain provisos including defamation, seduction, damages for adultery and "claims under Division 2 of Part 3 of the De Facto Relationships Act 1984."
That Division includes <case>. It should be noted that the amendment to include s 20 in the provisos was made by the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (De
Facto Relationships) Amendment Act No 150 of 1984. It is clear, accordingly, that the amendment was part of the same package of legislation which provided for the first time for a statutory right to a de facto partner.

The problem was considered by Kaye, J in Skene versus Dale <case>; [[1990] VR 605.] His Honour there considered whether an application under s (1) of the Victorian [Property Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/pla1958179/) (which is the equivalent to <case> of the NSW Act) could be made against a deceased person by virtue of ss 289 and 290 (which are the equivalents of <case> of the NSW
Act). His Honour held that no action under that Act could be commenced after the death of one of the partners to a de facto relationship.

In obiter dicta his Honour remarked at p 608 "the absence of any provision enabling the commencement of an application against the estate of a deceased de facto partner after his or her death might justify the application of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius." The NSW Act also lacks an express provision for commencing an action for or against a deceased person's estate. It would seem then that it is impossible to commence a <case> application at this stage of proceedings. Indeed the Second Reading Speech made for the De Facto Relationships Bill (Hansard Forty Eighth Parliament
Second Session Tuesday 30 October 1984 p 2691) states that ss 24 and 25 "provide for a code". As I noted earlier, the Parliament, at the same time it passed the De Facto Relationships Act, also passed an amendment to the [Law
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1944404/) to exclude applications after the death of a party. Therefore I think it is clear that the only way for a <case> order to be made after the death of a party is by means of <case>, that is, when an application under <case> was made before the death.

The real question in this case, then, is whether the plaintiff had made an "application under <case>". The Act itself does not contain a definition of "application" so I must resort to general principles of statutory interpretation and cases which have dealt with the term.

I have already set out the substantive prayers in the summons.

At first glance the first claim seems to be one under <case>, not one under <case> at all. However, it is obvious on reading the whole summons that the extension of time is sought with a view to obtaining an order under <case>. There is some authority that the term "application" includes the interlocutory stages of an application. In International Financial Society versus City of Moscow Gas
Company [(1871) 7 Ch D 241], it was held that the ordinary grammatical construction of the word "application" included an interlocutory step in an application, namely, a motion for decree at the hearing.

As to the second claim, any claim under that Part and Division of the Act for property adjustment necessarily involves an order under <case>. That is, it is clear that this part of the summons is a purported claim under <case>.

It is arguable that it could not be a true application under <case> because such a claim is out of time and contingent on leave to extend time being granted, which was an unresolved question at the time the summons was filed. The question then is, can such a claim be an application even though on its own it is unable to be granted? In Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd versus Kammins
Ballrooms Co Ltd (No 2) [[1971] 1 WLR 1751], the tenants of business premises made an application under the English [Landlord and Tenant Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/lata1954177/) for the grant of a new tenancy. That application did not comply with the time requirements set out in that Act. In that case it was held that a bona fide application is still an application under the Act, notwithstanding that it is possible for an opponent to raise a successful defence against the application, that defence being that the application was not filed within the time regime laid down in the Act (per Sachs, LJ at p 1757).

It should be noted, however, that Zenith (No 2) followed upon the decision of the House of Lords in Kammins Ballrooms Co Ltd versus Zenith Investments
Ltd [[1971] AC 850], where the House of Lords held that when the English
Act said that no application shall be entertained unless made within a certain time, what the legislature meant was that the landlord had a defence if the application was made out of time, but the application was to be considered by the Court. It is clear from the argument in Zenith (No 1) that there is a strong distinction between words which exclude the jurisdiction of the Court unless an application is made in time and words which merely give the defendant a defence (see the argument at pp 853-854).

In Packo versus Packo [(1989) 17 NSWLR 316], I had to consider an application to restrain an executor of a deceased person dealing with the assets of an estate pending hearing of a [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) application which was made out of time. The basis of that decision was the power and duty of a superior court to preserve the subject matter of proceedings; see Tait v The Queen <case>; [(1962) 108 CLR 620.] Accordingly, although the case gives some support to the idea that a combined application for leave to commence proceedings and to commence proceedings is valid, it really does not take the matter much further.

However, it has been very common in this Court over the last 30 years or so, to permit applications for leave to commence proceedings and the substantive application in the one summons. Not only is this true of [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) applications and applications under the previous law, the Testator's Family Maintenance etc
Act of 1916, but it is also a common practice when applications are made under the Corporations Law against a company in liquidation. Indeed, it is common under the [Family Provision
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) to extend the time for commencing proceedings up to the date when the summons was in fact filed. This seems to confirm the view that the filing of the summons was a mere irregularity and that it should be considered to be validly filed. I do not consider that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/s81.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) which tells against matters being classed as nullities when they can be classed as irregularities has much to do with the situation. The same rules seem to have applied before the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) came into force.

Argument by analogy is legitimate, but its limitations must be noted. It is no substitute for looking at the actual words of the legislature or examining the scheme of the legislation.

Were it not for <case> of the De Facto Relationships Act 1984, I would have considered that the summons seeking an extension of time to make the application and asking for an order under <case> as well in anticipation that such leave would be granted, was an application under <case> so that <case> would apply to it.

However, <case> seems to suggest that the de facto partner may only apply after the Court grants leave.

As far as I am aware, there is no reported decision as to the effect of s (3) of the De Facto Relationships Act. There are, however, a series of cases on <case> and (2) which seem to suggest that <case> does not extinguish claims which are otherwise able to be made under <case>, but merely regulates the claims. The most telling statement in the authorities is by Bryson, J in
Beavan versus Fallshaw [(1992) 15 Fam LR 686], 687, where his Honour says of <case>, "The language of the section is not such as to extinguish claims unless the court makes an exception; but <case> regulates the presentation of claims in different ways according to the time when they are presented, imposing a requirement to obtain leave to apply in cases such as the present." 
There are reported cases, such as Meyer versus Melocco [(1991) 14 Fam LR ], where Waddell, CJ in Eq had no difficulty at all in dealing with a combined application for declaration of trust under the general law, leave to make an application under <case> of the De Facto Relationships Act and also a claim under that Act. Indeed, this appears to be very common in this
Division.

The only passage that I have been able to find in a reported authority which flows perhaps the other way is from the decision of Hill, J in Re Smith; Ex parte Chesson <case>; [(1992) 106 ALR 359] at 364. In that case, a woman had brought an application for leave to bring proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act out of time.
That application was dismissed with costs. The man then sought to bankrupt the woman because she did not pay pursuant to the order for costs. The woman wished to put on a cross claim against the bankruptcy notice for moneys owing to her by the man. Hill, J held she could do so because as her proceedings in this Court never got to the stage of commencing an action under the De Facto
Relationships Act, she could not have set up her claim for debt against the man in the application for leave. However, the case is distinguishable because it seems quite clear from p 360 of the report that the woman had only sought leave to commence proceedings out of time, she had not actually joined an application for substantive relief in the same summons.

In my view, it is competent for a person to commence proceedings in this Court by way of the one summons seeking (a) leave to make an application out of time (s 18); and (b) for substantive relief under the De Facto Relationships Act (s ). If an application is made in that form, then the Court may deal with both aspects of the matter. The effect of <case> is not to defeat the Court's jurisdiction to entertain the claim, but rather, as the dicta of Bryson, J quoted earlier suggests, it merely regulates the way in which the Court is to deal with the claim. Thus, the claim is similar to that made in the Zenith (No 2) case discussed earlier.

It must be remembered that the present Act is beneficial legislation and it is legislation designed to apply to people in relatively humble circumstances without too much in the way of property. It would be most surprising if the legislature intended that such people should have to pay two sets of filing fees and two brief fees merely because the application was out of time by a few months. Indeed, as Waddell, CJ in Eq said in the Melocco case at p , it is often sensible to wait before making an application.

Accordingly, in my view, the plaintiff has made an application. The plaintiff died before the application was determined (s 24(1)) and it would be appropriate under <case> to permit that application to be proceeded with by the plaintiff's legal personal representative.

The material tends to suggest that no legal personal representative has taken office at this stage. If the plaintiff's solicitor wishes to pursue the matter, then he will need to pursue his notice of motion after such representative has been appointed. I think it would then be sensible to try the case as to whether leave should be given as a separate issue. This is because, in the instant case, the matter of the respective hardship to the parties after the death of one of them is probably a matter which raises discrete questions to those that might arise on the final hearing. Of course, the parties may decide that the amount of property involved and the possible legal costs of the action mean that it would be far more sensible to mediate or otherwise settle their dispute at this stage.

The formal order I make is that the defendant's motion, which was virtually a motion to dismiss the proceedings though phrased in terms of declaratory relief, should be dismissed. As the plaintiff did not appear, there should be no order for costs. The matter should not be let to lie in limbo and I will stand it over for mention before the Registrar on 27 May 1996 at 9.30 am.
